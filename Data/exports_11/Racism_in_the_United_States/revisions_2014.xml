'''Racism and ethnic [[discrimination in the United States]]''' has been a major issue since the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial era]] and the [[Slavery in the United States|slave era]]. Legally sanctioned racism sanctioned privileges and rights for [[White Americans]] not granted to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[African American]]s, [[Asian American]]s, and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latin Americans]]. [[European American]]s (particularly [[Anglo-America|Anglo Americans]]) were privileged by law in matters of education, [[immigration]], [[voting rights]], [[citizenship]], land acquisition, and criminal procedure over periods of time extending from the 17th century to the 1960s. At the time, many non-[[Protestant]] groups immigrating from Europe - particularly [[Jews]], [[Irish people]], [[Poles]] and [[Italians]] - suffered xenophobic exclusion and other forms of ethnicity-based discrimination in the American society.

Major racially and ethnically structured institutions included [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]], [[Indian reservation|Native American reservations]], [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[Native American boarding schools|residential schools]] for Native Americans, and [[List of internment camps#United States|internment camps]].&lt;ref&gt;Internment camps are particularly associated with World War II, but also occurred during World War I. Most significant was the [[Japanese American internment]] of 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. There was also internment of almost 11,000 German Americans in [[German American internment]] during World War II, and some [[Italian American internment]].&lt;/ref&gt; Formal racial discrimination was largely banned in the mid-20th century, and came to be perceived as socially unacceptable and/or morally repugnant as well.

Racial politics remains a major phenomenon. Racism continues to be [[Racial_inequality_in_the_United_States|reflected in socioeconomic inequality]],&lt;ref&gt;In his 2009 visit to the US, the [UN] Special Rapporteur on Racism noted that "Socio-economic indicators show that poverty and race and ethnicity continue to overlap in the United States. This reality is a direct legacy of the past, in particular slavery, segregation, the forcible resettlement of Native Americans, which was confronted by the United States during the civil rights movement. However, whereas the country managed to establish equal treatment and non-discrimination in its laws, it has yet to redress the socioeconomic consequences of the historical legacy of racism."{{Cite book | last = CERD Task Force of the US Human Rights Network | title = Universal Periodic Review Joint Reports: United States of America | chapter = From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Implementing US Obligations Under the International Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) | date = August 2010 | page = 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has taken on more modern, indirect forms of expression, most prevalently [[symbolic racism]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry, P.

In the view of the [[U.S. Human Rights Network]], a network of scores of US civil rights and human rights organizations, "[[Discrimination]] permeates all aspects of life in the United States, and extends to all [[people of color|communities of color]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = US Human Rights Network | title = Universal Periodic Review Joint Reports: United States of America | chapter = The United States of America: Summary Submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review | date = August 2010 | page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-Civil War====

'''Atlantic Slave Trade'''

While the existence of slavery is arguably the root of subsequent conceptualizations of African-Americans, the origins of African enslavement have a large economic foundation. Among the European elite who structured national policy throughout the age of the Atlantic system of trade, there existed a popular ideology called mercantilism, or the belief that policy pursuits were centralized around military power and economic wealth. They attributed the value of colonial possessions, as a source of mineral wealth and raw materials and as a means of exporting products to the home country.&lt;ref name="Darity Jr."&gt;{{cite book|last=Darity Jr.|first=William|title=African Americans in the U.S. Economy (Africa, Europe, and the Origins of Uneven Development: The Role of Slavery)|year=2005|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|location=Lanham, Md.|pages=15–16|url=http://cas.umkc.edu/econ/economics/faculty/Forstater/688/Reading/Black%20Political%20Economy/AfricaEuropeOriginsUnevenDevelopment.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The population of Native Americans as labor proved too exceedingly reduced, after decimation through disease and violence. The use of voluntary European peoples as labor also proved unsustainably expensive and detrimental to domestic labor and competitiveness. Unlike the previous populations, Africans were "available in large numbers at prices that made plantation agriculture in the Americas profitable"&lt;ref&gt;"Darity Jr., 2005"&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It is also argued that, along with the economic motives underlying slavery in the Americas, European world schemas played a large role in the enslavement of Africans. According to this view, the European in-group for humane behavior included the sub-continent, while African and American Indian cultures had a more localized definition of "an insider". While neither schema has inherent superiority, the technological advantage of Europeans became a resource to disseminate the conviction that underscored their schemas, that non-Europeans could be enslaved. With the capability to spread their schematic representation of the world, Europeans could impose a social contract, morally permitting three centuries of African slavery. While the disintegration of this social contract by the eighteenth century led to the abolition of slavery, it is argued that the removal of barriers to "insider status" is a very slow, and presently continued, process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eltis|first=David|title=Europeans and the Rise and Fall of African Slavery in the Americas: An Interpretation|journal=The American Historical Review|date=December 1993|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1402–1422|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2167060|accessdate=2013-10-19|doi=10.2307/2167060}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
As a result of these debated elements, the Atlantic slave trade arose. According to the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, between 1626 and 1850, an estimated total of 305,326 slaves were forcibly transported via U.S. vessels to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eltis|first=David|title=Extending the Frontiers: Essays on the New Transatlantic Slave Trade Database|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-300-13436-0|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eltis|first=David|title=Estimates|url=http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/assessment/estimates.faces|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, approximately one Southern family in four held slaves prior to war. According to the 1860 U.S. census, there were about 385,000 slaveowners out of approximately 1.5 million white families.&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo L. Hamby, George Clack, and Mildred Sola Neely.

'''Efforts toward Abolition'''

In the early part of the 19th century, a variety of organizations were established advocating the movement of black people from the United States to locations where they would enjoy greater freedom; some endorsed [[colony|colonization]], while others advocated [[emigration]]. During the 1820s and 1830s the [[American Colonization Society]] (A.C.S.) was the primary vehicle for proposals to return black Americans to greater freedom and equality in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&amp;issue_id=75|title=Background on conflict in Liberia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1821 the A.C.S. established the colony of [[Liberia]], assisting thousands of former African-American slaves and free black people (with legislated limits) to move there from the United States. The colonization effort resulted from a mixture of motives with its founder [[Henry Clay]] stating; "unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off".&lt;ref name=ATH&gt;Maggie Montesinos Sale (1997). ''The slumbering volcano: American slave ship revolts and the production of rebellious masculinity''. p.264. Duke University Press, 1997. ISBN 0-8223-1992-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Constitution had banned the importation of new African slaves in 1808, and in 1820 slave trade was equated with piracy, punishable by death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/SlaverBackground.htm |title=The legal and diplomatic background to the seizure of foreign vessels |publisher=Pdavis.nl |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice of chattel slavery still existed for the next half century. All slaves in only the areas of the [[Confederate States of America]] that were not under direct control of the United States government were declared free by the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which was issued on January 1, 1863, by President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=34 |title=Emancipation Proclamation (1863) |publisher=Ourdocuments.gov |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] did not apply to areas loyal to, or controlled by, the Union, thus the document only freed slaves where the Union still had not regained the legitimacy to claim freedom. Slavery was not actually abolished in the United States until the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] which was declared ratified on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/amend1.htm#13 XIII - Slavery Abolished] The Avalon Project&lt;/ref&gt;

About 4 million [[African American|black]] [[slavery|slaves]] were freed in 1865. Ninety-five percent of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North.&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, Drawn with the Sword, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all [[white American|white]] males aged 13 to 43 died in the civil war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/050155.html |title=The Deadliest War |publisher=Harvardmagazine.com |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reconstruction Era'''

After the Civil War, the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]] in 1865, formally abolishing slavery, was ratified. Furthermore, Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], which broadened a range of civil rights to all persons born in the United States. Despite this, the emergence of "[[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]]", sanctioned acts of subjugation against blacks, continued to bar [[African-Americans]] from due [[civil rights]]. The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] was ratified in 1868 to underscore this effort, and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] followed. The latter was eliminated, in a decision that undermined federal power to thwart private racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Estreicher|first=Samuel|title=Federal Power to Regulate Private Discrimination: The Revival of the Enforcement Clauses of the Reconstruction Era Amendments|journal=Columbia Law Review|year=1974|volume=74|issue=3|pages=452–454|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/112176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the last of the [[Reconstruction Era]] amendments, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]] promised [[voting rights]] to African-American men, and these cumulative federal efforts, African-Americans began taking advantage of enfranchisement. African-Americans began voting, seeking office positions, utilizing [[public education]]. Yet by the end of Reconstruction in the mid 1870s, violent [[white supremacist]]s came to power via [[paramilitary group]]s such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and the [[White League]] and imposed [[Jim Crow]] laws that deprived African-American of voting rights and instituted systemic discriminatory policies through policies of unequal [[racial segregation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klarman|first=Michael|title=The Plessy Era|journal=The Supreme Court Review|year=1998|pages=307–308|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3109701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-Reconstruction'''

The new century saw a hardening of [[institutionalized racism]] and legal [[discrimination]] against citizens of African descent in the United States. Throughout this post Civil War period, [[racial stratification]] was informally and systemically enforced, to solidify pre-existing social order. Although technically able to vote, [[poll taxes]], pervasive acts of terror such as [[lynching in the United States]] (often perpetrated by groups such as the reborn [[Ku Klux Klan]], founded in the Reconstruction South), and discriminatory laws such as [[grandfather clauses]] kept black Americans disenfranchised particularly in the South.  Furthermore, discrimination extended to state legislation that "allocated vastly unequal financial support" for black and white schools. In addition to this, county officials sometimes redistributed resources earmarked for blacks to white schools, further undermining educational opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=E.M.|author2=Tolnay, Stewart |title=Black Flight: Lethal Violence and the Great Migration, 1900–1930|journal=Social Science History|year=1990|volume=14|issue=3|page=354|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1171355|doi=10.2307/1171355}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to de jure racism, [[protest]] and lobbyist groups emerged, most notably, the [[NAACP]] (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) in 1909.

This time period is sometimes referred to as the [[nadir of American race relations]] because [[racism]], [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[racial discrimination]], and expressions of [[white supremacy]] all increased. So did anti-black violence, including [[Mass racial violence in the United States|race riots]] such as the [[Atlanta Race Riot]] of 1906 and the [[Tulsa race riot]] of 1921.

'''The Great Migration'''

In addition, racism which had been viewed primarily as a problem in the Southern states, burst onto the national consciousness following the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], the relocation of millions of African Americans from their roots in the Southern states to the industrial centers of the North after World War I, particularly in cities such as [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], and [[New York City|New York]] ([[Harlem]]). Within Chicago, for example, between 1910 and 1970, the percentage of African-Americans leapt from 2.0 percent to 32.7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolnay|first=Stewart|title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2003|volume=29|page=221|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demographic patterns of black migrants and external economic conditions are largely studied stimulants regarding the Great Migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolnay|first=Stewart|title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2003|volume=29|page=213|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, migrating blacks (between 1910 and 1920) were more likely to be literate than blacks that remained in the South. Known economic push factors played a role in migration, such as the emergence of a split labor market and agricultural distress from the boll weevil destruction of cotton economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=E.M.|author2=Tolnay, Stewart |title=Black Flight: Lethal Violence and the Great Migration, 1900-1930|journal=Social Science History|year=1990|volume=14|issue=3|pages=351–352|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1171355|doi=10.2307/1171355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern migrants were often treated in alliance with pre-existing racial stratification. The rapid influx of blacks disturbed the racial balance within cities, exacerbating hostility from both black and white Northerners. Stereotypic schemas of Southern blacks were used to attribute issues in urban areas, such as crime and disease, to the presence of African-Americans. Overall, African-Americans in Northern cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility . Within the housing market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of "targeted violence, restrictive covenants, redlining and racial steering"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolnay|first=Stewart|title=The African American 'Great Migration' and Beyond|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2003|volume=29|pages=218–221|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100009|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30036966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this period, racial tensions exploded, most violently in Chicago, and [[lynching in the United States|lynchings]]—mob-directed hangings, usually racially motivated—increased dramatically in the 1920s.

====WWII to Civil Rights Era====
The [[Jim Crow Laws]] were state and local laws enacted in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] of the [[United States]] and enforced between 1876 and 1965. They mandated "[[separate but equal]]" status for black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were almost always inferior to those provided to [[white American]]s. The most important laws required that public schools, public places and public transportation, like trains and buses, have separate facilities for whites and blacks. State-sponsored school segregation was declared unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1954 in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. One of the first federal court cases to challenge segregation in schools was [[Mendez v. Westminster]] in 1946.

In response to heightening discrimination and violence, non-violent acts of protest began to occur. For example, in February 1960, in Greensboro, North Carolina, four young African-American college students entered a Woolworth store and sat down at the counter but were refused service. The men had learned about non-violent protest in college, and continued to sit peacefully as whites tormented them at the counter, pouring ketchup on their heads and burning them with cigarettes. After this, many sit-ins took place to non-violently protest against racism and inequality. Sit-ins continued throughout the South and spread to other areas. Eventually, after many sit-ins and other non-violent protests, including marches and boycotts, places began to agree to desegregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dream of Equality, 1954-1974|work=American History}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Broken citation|date=August 2012}}

The [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] marked a turning point during the Civil Rights Era, by attracting national attention. On Sunday, September 15, 1963 with a stack of dynamite hidden on an outside staircase, Ku Klux Klansmen destroyed one side of the Birmingham church. The bomb exploded in proximity to twenty-six children preparing in basement assembly room. The explosion killed four black girls, Carole Robertson (14), Cynthia Wesley (14), Denise McNair (11) and Addie Mae Collins (14).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ravitz|first=Jessica|title=Siblings of the bombing: Remembering Birmingham church blast 50 years on|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/14/us/birmingham-church-bombing-anniversary-victims-siblings/|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birmingham Church Bombed|url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/la-rebellion/timeline/birmingham-church-bombed-0|publisher=L.A. Rebellion: Film &amp; Television Archive|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the bombing only a couple weeks after Martin Luther King's March on Washington, it became an integral aspect of transformed perceptions of conditions for blacks in America. It influenced the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act, which overruled remaining Jim Crow laws. Nonetheless, neither had been implemented by the end of the 1960s.

Segregation continued even after the demise of the Jim Crow laws. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration from suggest that in the mid-20th century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="vigdor"&gt;''The Rise and Decline of the American Ghetto'' David M. Cutler, Edward L. Glaeser, Jacob L. Vigdor ''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 107, No. 3 (Jun., 1999), pp. 455-506&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation also took the form of [[redlining]], the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as [[banking]], [[insurance]], access to jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf |title=Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; access to health care,&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Race and health]]&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[supermarkets]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ptc5hvexthe7wrye/ In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition], Elizabeth Eisenhauer, [[GeoJournal]] Volume 53, Number 2, February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; to residents in certain, often racially determined,&lt;ref name="eastny"&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto] by Walter Thabit. ISBN 0-8147-8267-1. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; areas. Although in the [[United States]] informal discrimination and segregation have always existed, redlining began with the [[National Housing Act of 1934]], which established the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA). The practice was fought first through passage of the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]] (which prevents redlining when the criteria for redlining are based on race, religion, gender, familial status, disability, or ethnic origin), and later through the [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977, which requires banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813339529 ''Comeback Cities: A Blueprint for Urban Neighborhood Revival''] By Paul S. Grogan, Tony Proscio. ISBN 0-8133-3952-9. 2002. p. 114. "The goal was not to relax lending restrictions but rather to get banks to apply the same criteria in the inner-city as in the [[suburbs]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Although redlining is illegal some argue that it continues to exist in other forms.

====Present====
While substantial gains were made in the succeeding decades through middle class advancement and public employment, [[black poverty]] and lack of education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jbhe.com/latest/122905_statistical_shocker2005.html |title=JBHE Statistical Shocker of the Year |publisher=Jbhe.com |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; deepened in the context of de-industrialization.&lt;ref name=Takaki-CivRights&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 400-414.&lt;/ref&gt; Prejudice, discrimination, and institutional racism (see below) continue to affect African Americans.

From 1981 to 1997, the United States Department of Agriculture discriminated against tens of thousands of Black American farmers, denying loans provided to white farmers in similar circumstances. The discrimination was the subject of the ''[[Pigford v. Glickman]]'' lawsuit brought by members of the [[National Black Farmers Association]], which resulted in two settlement agreements of $1.25 billion in 1999 and of $1.15 billion in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | issn = 0362-4331 | last = Southall | first = Ashley | title = Bias Payments Come Too Late for Some Farmers | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2010-05-26 | date = 2010-05-25 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/us/26farmers.html?scp=1&amp;sq=black%20farmers&amp;st=cse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that there exists a color blindness or an "understanding that cultural differences rooted in racial identities are irrelevant for peoples' prospects and their overall well-being".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blau|first=Judith|title=White Supremacy and Racism in the Post-Civil Rights Era by Eduardo Bonilla-Silva|journal=Contemporary Sociology|year=2002|volume=31|issue=5|page=527|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3090024|doi=10.2307/3090024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, one counter-example to this claim is that employer interviews reveal reluctance from both black and white employers to employ "urban young males who exhibit lower-class behavioral styles", highlighting the existence of embedded socio-economic preconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loury|first=Glenn|title=Discrimination in the Post-Civil Rights Era: Beyond Market Intercations|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|year=1998|volume=12|issue=2|page=123|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2646965|doi=10.1257/jep.12.2.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, many cite the [[2008 United States presidential election]] as a step forward in race relations: White Americans played a role in electing [[Barack Obama]], the country's first black president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-assess5-2008nov05,0,6354926.story White Americans play major role in electing the first black president], ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Obama received a greater percentage of the white vote (43%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1023/exit-poll-analysis-2008|title=Inside Obama's Sweeping Victory|date=November 5, 2008|publisher=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; than did the previous Democratic candidate, [[John Kerry]] (41%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html|title=U.S. President: National: Exit Poll|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Racial divisions persisted throughout the election; wide margins of Black voters gave Obama an edge during the presidential primary, where 8 out of 10 African-Americans voted for him in the primaries, and an MSNBC poll found that race was a key factor in whether a candidate was perceived as being ready for office. In South Carolina, for instance,"Whites were far likelier to name Clinton than Obama as being most qualified to be commander in chief, likeliest to unite the country and most apt to capture the White House in November. Blacks named Obama over Clinton by even stronger margins — two- and three-to one — in all three areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22859978/ |title=Strong black vote gives Obama big boost|publisher=MSNBC |date=2008-01-26 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asian Americans===
Asian Americans have suffered from much racism ever since they started immigrating to the United States. The Asian American identity has developed to include a numerous amount of different types of social identities today. To categorize and organize them, Shinsuke Eguchi separates Asian Americans into three identities. One type of identity experienced by Asians exists due to “Asian diaspora.” This is when Asian immigrants come to America from foreign countries. These Asians are also known as first generation. The second type of identity exists to Asians born in the United States. Those who relate to this identity may be second, third, or more generation. Their identity is neither fully Asian nor fully American. The third type identifies with Asian Americans adopted by non-Asian families. No matter which identity Asian Americans may identify with, all of them experience some sort of racial impact in one way or another. &lt;ref&gt;Eguchi, Shinsuke. "Revisiting Asiacentricity: Toward Thinking Dialectically about Asian 			American Identities and Negotiation." Howard Journal of Communications 24.1 (2013): 		95-115. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

	American history shows a great deal of what Asian Americans have been through and how Asian Americans have been treated over the years. Many historic events have come to shape the discrimination that Asian Americans unfortunately face today. &lt;ref&gt;Eguchi, Shinsuke. "Revisiting Asiacentricity: Toward Thinking Dialectically about Asian 			American Identities and Negotiation." Howard Journal of Communications 24.1 (2013): 		95-115. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
	When America was still growing industrially, there was a shortage in labor in the mining and railroad industries. This was when Asians began immigrating and there became a huge flow of Asians into America at this time. &lt;ref&gt;Eguchi, Shinsuke. "Revisiting Asiacentricity: Toward Thinking Dialectically about Asian 			American Identities and Negotiation." Howard Journal of Communications 24.1 (2013): 		95-115. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese immigrants started becoming hated on because they took the jobs of whites for cheaper pay. White Americans wanted them deported. &lt;ref&gt;Chin, Philip. "The Chinese Exclusion Act: Ten Year Exclusion Act Debates and Passage -- Part 		3." Chinese American Forum 29.1 (2013): 24-31. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; There were so many Asians working in the American industries that in 1882, a Chinese Exclusion Act was enacted. This was the first time that a law was passed to exclude a major group from the nation that was based on ethnicity and class. &lt;ref&gt;Eguchi, Shinsuke. "Revisiting Asiacentricity: Toward Thinking Dialectically about Asian 			American Identities and Negotiation." Howard Journal of Communications 24.1 (2013): 		95-115. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
	In 1907, Japanese workers started migrating to the U.S. to replace Chinese workers in the industries. Theodore Roosevelt restricted the Japanese from continuing to migrate. Later on, the Gentlemen’s Agreement was made and Japan agreed to stop issuing passports to its workers so that they couldn't migrate to the U.S. &lt;ref&gt;Eguchi, Shinsuke. "Revisiting Asiacentricity: Toward Thinking Dialectically about Asian 			American Identities and Negotiation." Howard Journal of Communications 24.1 (2013): 		95-115. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
	In 1924, the National Origins Act was passed. This act only allowed those who were coming from the Western Hemisphere to be let into the United States.
	Then, in the early 1940’s, Japanese Americans started becoming targeted as “yellow perils.” This means they were seen as dangerous and were a threat to the American way of life.
	To add onto the American’s discrimination towards Japanese, Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, which led to Japanese Americans being held in concentration camps in 1941. Finally, in 1949, the Japanese surrendered to end World War II. However, when this happened, Communists also being taking over China. Now, the Chinese were seen as the new “yellow peril.”
	In 1965, Immigration Acts allowed for a huge wave of immigration into the United States. This act allowed for everyone to come into the States.
	In 1990, nonimmigrant temporary working visas were given to help with the shortage of skilled labor within the United States.

	All the history that has happened to Asians in America have led to create a successful “model minority” where Asians are generally seen to be educated, and overall seen as a very successful race. Asian Americans are often considered to be the “model minority,” meaning they are stereotyped as intelligent and hard-working, but socially they are quiet and shy, placing them in a position that is less valued. &lt;ref&gt;Lai, Lei, and Linda C. Babcock. "Asian Americans and Workplace Discrimination: The Interplay 	between Sex of Evaluators and the Perception of Social Skills Asian Americans and 		Workplace Discrimination: The Interplay between Sex of Evaluators and the Perception 		of Social Skills." Journal of Organizational Behavior 34.3 (2013): 310-26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; There are model minority realities that Asian Americans have to face everyday that create more complicated lives for them. In fact, there are actually many cultural disadvantages faced by Asian Americans living in the United States today. Because Asians in America are generally seen with positive light from the “model minority” idea, people would not expect them to have any difficulty dealing with any type of racial issues, but in reality, they have to face with issues that come from all groups of people. Asian Americans pretty much live the “middle person” role in the social hierarchy. This means Asians stand somewhere between Whites and Blacks. This means Asians have the potential for being discriminated against from not only just Whites, but other ethnic minorities as well. &lt;ref&gt;Kim, Isok. "The Role of Critical Ethnic Awareness and Social Support in the discrimination–		depression Relationship among Asian Americans: Path Analysis." Cultural Diversity and 		Ethnic Minority Psychology 20.1 (2014): 52-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
	The type of treatment that Asian Americans have to face include a wide range. Asian Americans were victimized by racist attitudes coming from all levels of the American society and the American government. &lt;ref&gt;Sakamoto, Taylor. "The Triumph and Tragedies of Japanese Women in America: A View Across 		Four Generations." History Teacher 41.1 (2007): 97-122. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Japanese women who entered America went through a lot. When first generation Japanese women came to America, many went into prostitution as a way to earn a living. Their initial motive for coming to America was to find a husband and get married and have children, but many went into prostitution instead. Because of this, the growth of Japanese immigrants gradually added to prejudice towards the Japanese. First and second generation Japanese women who came to America struggled against anti-Japanese sentiments. To prove their contributions, they tried really hard to show that they had a strong work ethic and that they were willing to work for cheap labor. This actually made the discrimination worse and caused Americans to hate them even more. Because the Asians worked for such cheap labor they became more preferred to be hired. This is why Americans saw the Japanese as degrading themselves instead.
	In 1913, California enacted an Alien Land Law. This law restricted land leases to 3-year periods. In 1920, California came up with another Alien Land Law. This one made it legall for first generation immigrants to lease agricultural land even though they were deemed eligible for citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Sakamoto, Taylor. "The Triumph and Tragedies of Japanese Women in America: A View Across 		Four Generations." History Teacher 41.1 (2007): 97-122. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

	Today, the workplace is a place where many Asian Americans experience much discrimination. This is also the place where Asian Americans may face the most negative consequences from the “model minority” idea. Surveys show just how many Asian Americans suffer from discrimination in the workplace. In 2000, out of 1,218 adult Asian Americans, 92 percent of those who experienced personal discrimination indicated that the unfair treatment was due to their ethnicity. Forty percent of them indicated that they were discriminated against in the workplace in the form of getting jobs or promotions. In 2007, it was reported by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that Asians make up 10 percent of professional jobs, and that only 3.7 percent of them held executive, senior level, or manager positions. This shows how out of all the asians who hold professional jobs, very few are given the opportunity to advance any further than the position that they currently hold. This is due to the stigma that people believe that Asians lack in social skills to be able to hold any higher executive positions. It is true that people must possess a certain set of skills in order to advance in what they do, but for Asian Americans, it has come to the point where they are being judged even before they get the opportunity to express the skills they have. Many people see what they expect to see because of stereotypes creating biases in people’s minds. &lt;ref&gt;Lai, Lei, and Linda C. Babcock. "Asian Americans and Workplace Discrimination: The Interplay 	between Sex of Evaluators and the Perception of Social Skills Asian Americans and 		Workplace Discrimination: The Interplay between Sex of Evaluators and the Perception 		of Social Skills." Journal of Organizational Behavior 34.3 (2013): 310-26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
	Stereotypes that Asian Americans are put into today in relation to the work force include being successful in engineering, computing, and math. Basically, Asians are seen as more likely to excel in technical positions as compared to non-technical positions that include more social skills. This perception that Asians lack social skills can be a big barrier to Asians who want to excel in the more social, executive positions. &lt;ref&gt;Lai, Lei, and Linda C. Babcock. "Asian Americans and Workplace Discrimination: The Interplay 	between Sex of Evaluators and the Perception of Social Skills Asian Americans and 		Workplace Discrimination: The Interplay between Sex of Evaluators and the Perception 		of Social Skills." Journal of Organizational Behavior 34.3 (2013): 310-26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

	As studies show, discrimination of Asian Americans take a big part in negatively shaping the Asian American lifestyle. Many American ethnic groups suffer from discrimination that ultimately leads to unhealthy lifestyles for them. Some other forms of discrimination besides those found in the model minority idea and the workplace include racial profiling and hate crimes. Research demonstrates that there is not that big of a difference between racial discrimination and mental disorders among Asian Americans. This is how bad it has become. &lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Michael S., et al. "Discrimination and Mental Health-Related Service use in a National 		Study of Asian Americans." American Journal of Public Health 100.12 (2010): 2410-7. 		Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
	As for the overall health of Asian Americans, it has been found that the experience of unfair treatment due to racial or ethnic discrimination leads to an incline to smoking. The social treatment of Asian Americans caused by their race/ethnicity helps to explain the increase and severity in Asian American smoking patterns. &lt;ref&gt;Chae, David H., et al. "Unfair Treatment, Racial/Ethnic Discrimination, Ethnic Identification, 		and Smoking among Asian Americans in the National Latino and Asian American Study." 	American Journal of Public Health 98.3 (2008): 485-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
	Because Asians are known to not be as proficient in English, they have been seen to be more prone to illness and of having a more diminished quality of life. &lt;ref&gt;Gee, Gilbert C., and Ninez Ponce. "Associations between Racial Discrimination, Limited 			English Proficiency, and Health-Related Quality of Life among 6 Asian Ethnic Groups in 		California." American Journal of Public Health 100.5 (2010): 888-95. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

	Overall, the Asian Americans who gain awareness of the racial injustice they experience are encouraged to take on the responsibility to educate their fellow community members about the racism of Asian Americans. &lt;ref&gt;Kim, Isok. "The Role of Critical Ethnic Awareness and Social Support in the discrimination–		depression Relationship among Asian Americans: Path Analysis." Cultural Diversity and 		Ethnic Minority Psychology 20.1 (2014): 52-60. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European immigrants===
Various [[European-American]] immigrant groups have been subject to discrimination either on the basis of their immigrant status (known as "[[Nativism (politics)|Nativism]]") or on the basis of their ethnicities (country of origin).
[[File:Philadelphia1844riot.jpg|thumb|[[Philadelphia Nativist Riots]].]]
[[File:NINA-nyt.JPG|thumb|''[[New York Times]]'', 1854 ad, reading "No Irish need apply."]]
In the 19th century, this was particularly true of [[Anti-Irish sentiment|anti-Irish prejudice]], which was partly [[anti-Catholic]] sentiment, partly anti-Irish as an ethnicity. This was especially true for Irish Catholics who immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-19th century; the large number of Irish (both Catholic and Protestant) who settled in America in the 18th century had largely (but not entirely) escaped such discimination and eventually blended into the American white population.

The 20th century saw discrimination against immigrants from southern and eastern Europe (notably [[Italian-American]]s and [[Polish American]]s), partly from anti-Catholic sentiment (as against Irish-Americans), and partly from [[Nordicism]], which considered all non-[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], non-Scandinavian, or non-British immigrants as racially inferior – see [[Nordic race#Nordicism in the USA|Nordicism in the USA]].

{{rquote|right|Biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend. The Nordics propagate themselves successfully. With other races, the outcome shows deterioration on both sides.|Future US president [[Calvin Coolidge]], 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Coolidge| first =Calvin | title = Whose Country is This?| journal = Good Housekeeping| volume =| page = 14| year = 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nordicism led to the reduction in [[Southern Europe]]an, along with [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Eastern Europe]]an and [[Russia]]n immigrants in the [[National Origins Formula]] of the [[Emergency Quota Act]] of 1921 and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], whose goal was to maintain the status quo distribution of ethnicity by limiting immigration in proportion to existing populations. This reduced the inflow from the average prior to 1921 of 176,983 from northern, central and western Europe, and 685,531 for other countries, principally Southern and Russia, to a 1924 level of 140,999 for northern, central and western Europe, and 21,847 for other countries, principally Southern and Russia (from a 1:3.9 ratio to a 6.4:1 ratio).

There was also discrimination against German-Americans and Italian-Americans due to these being enemy countries in [[World War I]] (Germany) and [[World War II]] (Germany and Italy). This resulted in a sharp decrease in German-American ethnic identity and a sharp decrease in the use of [[German in the United States]] following WWI, which had hitherto been significant, and to [[German American internment]] and [[Italian American internment]] during WWII; see also [[German American#World War I anti-German sentiment|World War I anti-German sentiment]].

Specific European-American ethnicities significantly diminished as a political issue in the 1930s, being replaced by a bi-racialism of Black/White, as described and predicted by [[Lothrop Stoddard]], due to numerous causes. The National Origins Formula significantly reduced inflows of non-Nordic ethnicities; the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] (of African-Americans out of the South) displaced anti-White immigrant racism with anti-Black racism; and the [[Great Depression]] brought economic concerns to the fore.

Anti-Catholic sentiment remained evident in the presidential campaign of [[John F. Kennedy]], who nevertheless went on to become the US's first Catholic (and indeed non-Protestant) president.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s, many immigrants came to the United States from Russia. A new type of stereotyping, sometimes described as racism, which is based on the former Cold War stereotypes began to target people from the former Soviet states. There are many jokes refer to a communist past, corruption, high alcohol consumption, high crime rate, prostitution, and unemployment. Some people began to use words like ''Eurotrash, mafia, commie, [[Borat]]'', and ''Russki'' when refer to Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, or Balkan peoples (mainly [[Serbs]] and [[Albanians]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} During the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver NBC's commenter Mike Milbury used the term ''Eurotrash'' to describe the Russian hockey team.  Jokes about Russian [[mail-order bride]]s, European prostitutes and fashion models, the revival of Eastern-European and Latin-European (especially [[Anti-Polish sentiment|Polish]] and [[Anti-Italianism|Italian]]) ethnic stereotypes in movies and television shows (''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'', ''[[The Real Housewives of New Jersey]]'' and ''[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]'') and offensive images became popular among young people in the United States.

===Latin Americans===
Americans of Latin American ancestry (often categorized as "[[Hispanic]]") come from a wide variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. Latinos are not all distinguishable as a racial minority.

After the [[Mexican-American War]] (1846–1848), the U.S. annexed much of the current Southwestern region from Mexico. Mexicans residing in that territory found themselves subject to discrimination. It is estimated that at least 597 Mexicans were lynched between 1848 and 1928 (this is a conservative estimate due to lack of records in many reported lynchings). Mexicans were lynched at a rate of 27.4 per 100,000 of population between 1880 and 1930. This statistic is second only to that of the African American community during that period, which suffered an average of 37.1 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=m_mXXvWYO-sC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=lynching+mexicans+in+the+us+in+1800s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=touFHmR6qx&amp;sig=t7URp8FcWdSFl1tTZGG32yQzU-8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V15IVLasEsbKmAWFxoHYAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=lynching%20mexicans%20in%20the%20us%20in%201800s&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1848 to 1879, Mexicans were lynched at an unprecedented rate of 473 per 100,000 of population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_2_37/ai_111897839/pg_9 |title=The lynching of persons of Mexican origin or descent in the United States, 1848 to 1928 &amp;#124; Journal of Social History &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[The Great Depression]], the U.S. government sponsored a [[Mexican Repatriation]] program which was intended to encourage Mexican immigrants to voluntarily return to Mexico, however, many were forcibly removed against their will. In total, up to one million persons of Mexican ancestry were deported, approximately 60 percent of those individuals were actually U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1038&amp;context=lawrev&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zoot Suit Riots]] were vivid incidents of racial violence against Latinos (e.g. [[Mexican-Americans]]) in [[Los Angeles]] in 1943. Naval servicemen stationed in a Latino neighborhood conflicted with youth in the dense neighborhood. Frequent confrontations between small groups and individuals had intensified into several days of non-stop rioting. Large mobs of servicemen would enter civilian quarters looking to attack Mexican American youths, some of whom were wearing [[zoot suit]]s, a distinctive exaggerated fashion popular among that group.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Griswold del Castillo, "The Los Angeles "Zoot Suit Riots" Revisited: Mexican and Latin American Perspectives," ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 16, No. 2. (Summer, 2000), pp. 367-391.&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbances continued unchecked, and even assisted, by the local police for several days before base commanders declared downtown Los Angeles and Mexican American neighborhoods off-limits to servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Verge, "The Impact of the Second World War on Los Angeles," The Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 63, No. 3, Fortress California at War: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Diego, 1941-1945. (Aug., 1994), pp. 306-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public institutions, businesses, and homeowners associations had official policies to exclude Mexican Americans. School children of Mexican American descent were subject to racial segregation in the public school system. In many counties, Mexican Americans were excluded from serving as jurors in court cases, especially in those that involved a Mexican American defendant. In many areas across the Southwest, they lived in separate residential areas, due to laws and real estate company policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/osi04.soc.ush.civil.mendez/ |title=Teachers' Domain: Mendez v.

People of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent historically occupied an ambiguous racial status in the United States. Middle Eastern and South Asian immigrants were among those who sued in the late 19th and early 20th century to determine whether they were "white" immigrants as required by naturalization law. By 1923, courts had vindicated a "common-knowledge" standard, concluding that "scientific evidence", including the notion of a "[[Caucasian race]]" including Middle Easterners and many South Asians, was incoherent. Legal scholar John Tehranian argues that in reality this was a "performance-based" standard, relating to religious practices, education, intermarriage and a community's role in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;John Tehranian, "Performing Whiteness: Naturalization Litigation and the Construction of Racial Identity in America," ''[[The Yale Law Journal]]'', Vol. 109, No. 4. (Jan., 2000), pp. 817–848.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious racialization conflates Arabs and Islam, and consequently positions all Arabs as Muslim; represents Islam as a monolithic religion erasing diversity among Arabs and Muslims; and marks Islam as a backwards, fanatical, uncivilized, and a terroristic belief system" (p. 127). "Whereas before September 11, Arab- and Muslim-Americans were not included in discourses on race and racism in the United States, a public discourse emerged after September 11 on whether Arabs and Muslims were being treated fairly or being subjected to racism with the rise in hate crimes and government measures targeting Arabs and Muslims" (p. 141). {{Cite book | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | isbn = 978-0-415-37542-9 | editors = Zahia Smail Salhi, Ian Richard Netton (eds.) | last = Alsultany | first = Evelyn | title = The Arab diaspora: Voices of an anguished scream | chapter = From ambiguity to abjection: Iraqi-Americans negotiating race in the United States | year = 2006 | page = 127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Muslim' identity has certainly congealed as a marker of exclusion and marginalization, in relation to white or mainstream America, which is subjected to similar processes of racialization, and racism, that operate for racial minority groups."{{Cite book | publisher = [[Duke University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-8223-4409-4 | last = Maira | first = Sunaina | title = Missing: youth, citizenship, and empire after 9/11 | date = January 2009 | page = 229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Arab and non-Muslim Middle Eastern people, as well as [[South Asians]] of different ethnic/religious backgrounds (Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs) have been stereotyped as "Arabs". The case of [[Balbir Singh Sodhi]], a Sikh who was murdered at a Phoenix gas station by a [[white supremacist]] for "looking like an Arab terrorist" (because of the turban that is a requirement of [[Sikhism]]), as well as that of Hindus being attacked for "being Muslims" have achieved prominence and criticism following the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=February 11, 2009, 8:55 PM |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/11/25/national/main530749.shtml |title=Hindu Beaten Because He's Muslim, Mistaken Anti-Islam Thugs Pummel, Hogtie And Stab Deliveryman |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.adl.org/presrele/hatcr_51/4277_51.asp |title = ADL Condemns Hate Crime Against Hindu  |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) |accessdate = 2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The November 1979 [[Iranian hostage crisis]] of the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]] precipitated a wave of anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States, directed both against the [[Iranian Revolution|new Islamic regime]] and Iranian nationals and immigrants. Even though such sentiments gradually declined after the release of the hostages at the start of 1981, they sometimes flare up. In response, some Iranian immigrants to the U.S. have distanced themselves from their nationality and instead identify primarily on the basis of their ethnic or religious affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mehdi|last=Bozorgmehr|title=No solidarity: Iranians in the U.S|url=http://www.Iranian.com/Opinion/2001/May/Iranians/index.html#3a|work=The Iranian|date=2001-05-02|accessdate=2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Antisemitism====
{{Main|Antisemitism in the United States}}
[[Antisemitism]] has also played a role in the United States. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, hundreds of thousands of [[Jews]] were escaping the [[pogroms]] in [[Europe]]. They boarded boats from ports on the Baltic Sea and in Northern [[Germany]], and largely arrived at [[Ellis Island]], [[New York]].&lt;ref name=Takaki-JewishMigr&gt;Ronald Takaki, ''A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America'' (New York: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 1993), 277-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought by [[Leo Rosten]], in his book, '[[The Joys of Yiddish]]', that as soon as they left the boat, they were subject to racism from the port immigration authorities. The derogatory term '[[kike]]' was adopted when referring to Jews (because they often could not write so they may have signed their immigration papers with circles - or kikel in [[Yiddish]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rosten, Leo (1968) "The Joys of Yiddish"&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1910s, the Southern Jewish communities were attacked by the Ku Klux Klan, who objected to Jewish immigration, and often used 'The Jewish Banker' in their propaganda. In 1915, [[Texas]]-born, [[New York]] Jew [[Leo Frank]] was lynched by the newly re-formed Klan, after being convicted of rape and sentenced to death (his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment).&lt;ref name="lynching openly organized"&gt;Phagan, 1987, p. 27, states that "everyone knew the identity of the lynchers" (putting the words in her father's mouth). Oney, 2003, p. 526, quotes Carl Abernathy as saying, "They'd go to a man's office and talk to him or ... see a man on the job and talk to him," and an unidentified lyncher as saying "The organization of the body was more open than mysterious."&lt;/ref&gt;

The events in [[Nazi Germany]] also attracted attention from the United States. Jewish lobbying for intervention in Europe drew opposition from the [[isolationists]], amongst whom was Father [[Charles Coughlin]], a well known radio priest, who was known to be critical of Jews, believing that they were leading the United States into the war.&lt;ref name="Coughlin"&gt;[http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/coughlin.html Father Charles Edward Coughlin (1891-1971)] By Richard Sanders, Editor, ''Press for Conversion!''&lt;/ref&gt; He preached in weekly, overtly [[anti-Semitic]] sermons and, from 1936, began publication of a newspaper, ''[[Social Justice (periodical)|Social Justice]]'', in which he printed anti-Semitic accusations such as [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].&lt;ref name="Coughlin"&gt;Mary Christine Athans, "A New Perspective on Father Charles E. Coughlin," ''Church History'', Vol. 56, No. 2. (Jun., 1987), pp. 224-235, [[American Society of Church History]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Jewish organizations, Christian organizations, Muslim organizations, and academics consider the [[Nation of Islam]] to be [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]]. Specifically, they claim that the [[Nation of Islam]] has engaged in revisionist and antisemitic interpretations of the Holocaust and exaggerates the [[Jews and the slave trade|role of Jews in the African slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~antis/papers/occasional.papers.html |title=H-ANTISEMITISM OCCASIONAL PAPERS, NO. 1M |publisher=H-net.msu.edu |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) alleges that NOI Health Minister, Abdul Alim Muhammad, has accused Jewish doctors of injecting blacks with the [[AIDS]] virus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/focus_sheets/focus_islam.asp |title=Nation of Islam |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; an allegation that Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad has denied.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Although Jews are often perceived as white in the American mainstream, the relationship of Jews to whiteness remains complex, with many preferring not to identify as white.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Seth Korelitz, "The Menorah Idea: From Religion to Culture, From Race to Ethnicity," ''American Jewish History'' 1997 85(1): 75–100. 0164–0178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Novick, ''The Holocaust in American Life'' (1999); Hilene Flanzbaum, ed.

Lerner, Village Voice, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent activist and rabbi [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]] argues, in a 1993 Village Voice article, that "in America, to be 'white' means to be the beneficiary of the past 500 years of European exploration and exploitation of the rest of the world" and that "Jews can only be deemed white if there is massive amnesia on the part of non-Jews about the monumental history of anti-Semitism".&lt;ref&gt;M. Lerner, Village Voice May 18, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[African-American]] activist [[Cornel West]], in an interview with the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], has explained:

{{cquote|Even if some Jews do believe that they're white, I think that they've been duped. I think that antisemitism has proven itself to be a powerful force in nearly every post of Western civilization where Christianity has a presence. And so even as a Christian, I say continually to my Jewish brothers and sisters: don't believe the hype about your full scale assimilation and integration into the mainstream. It only takes an event or two for a certain kind of anti-Jewish, antisemitic sensibility to surface in places that you would be surprised. But I'm just thoroughly convinced that America is not the promised land for Jewish brothers and sisters. A lot of Jewish brothers say, "No, that’s not true. We finally—yeah—they said that in [[History of the Jews in Egypt#Ptolemaic and Roman|Alexandria]]. You said that in [[Weimar Germany]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voices on Antisemitism Podcast|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20070719|work=[[USHMM]]|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

=====New antisemitism=====
{{Main|New antisemitism}}

In recent years some scholars have advanced the concept of ''New antisemitism'', coming simultaneously from the [[Far Left]], the [[far right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]], and argue that the language of [[Anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] are used to attack Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that criticisms of Israel and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and attribute this to antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Yehuda Bauer]], Professor of Holocaust Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, considers the concept "new antisemitism" to be false, since it is in fact old antisemitism that remains latent and recurs whenever it is triggered. In his view, the current trigger is the Israeli situation, and if a compromise were achieved there antisemitism would decline but not disappear.

Noted critics of Israel, such as [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Norman Finkelstein]] question the extent of new antisemitism in the United States. Chomsky has stated that the Anti-Defamation League casts any question of pro-Israeli policy as antisemitism;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.nvg.org/~skars/ni/ni-c10-s20.html Noam Chomsky, ''Necessary Illusions'', Appendix V, Segment 20]&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein stated supposed "new antisemitism" is a preposterous concept advanced by the ADL to combat critics of Israeli policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/30/1418200 |title=Congressmember Weiner Gets It Wrong On Palestinian Group He Tried To Bar From U.S. |date=2006-08-30 |publisher=[[Democracy Now!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Americans===
[[File:Creeks in Oklahoma.png|thumb|left|Members of the [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation]] in Oklahoma around 1877. Notice the members with European and African ancestry. The Creek were originally from the Alabama region.]]

[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who have lived on the North American continent for at least 10,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Charles C., ''1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus'', Vintage Books, 2006, c.2005, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; had an enormously complex impact on American history and racial relations. During the colonial and independent periods, a long series of conflicts were waged, often with the objective of obtaining resources of Native Americans. Through [[List of wars|wars]], [[population transfer|forced displacement]] (such as in the [[Trail of Tears]]), and the imposition of treaties, land was taken. The loss of land often resulted in hardships for Native Americans. In the early 18th century, the English had enslaved nearly 800 Choctaws.&lt;ref name=brescia_era&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After the creation of the United States, the idea of [[Indian removal]] gained momentum. However, some Native Americans chose or were allowed to remain and avoided removal whereafter they were subjected to official racism. The Choctaws in [[Mississippi]] described their situation in 1849, "we have had our habitations torn down and burned, our fences destroyed, cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged, manacled, fettered and otherwise personally abused, until by such treatment some of our best men have died."&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph B. Cobb, who moved to Mississippi from Georgia, described Choctaws as having "no nobility or virtue at all," and in some respect he found blacks, especially native Africans, more interesting and admirable, the red man's superior in every way.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Ideological expansionist justification ([[Manifest Destiny]]) included stereotyped perceptions of all Native Americans as "merciless Indian savages" (as described in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]) despite successful American efforts at civilization as proven with the [[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Creek (people)|Creek]], and [[Choctaw]]. An egregious attempt occurred with the [[California gold rush]], the first two years of which saw the deaths of thousands of Native Americans. Under [[Alta California|Mexican rule in California]], Indians were subjected to ''de facto'' enslavement under a system of [[peon]]age by the white elite. While in 1850, California formally entered the [[United States|Union]] as a [[Free state (United States)|free state]], with respect to the issue of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], the practice of Indian [[Indentured servant|indentured servitude]] was not outlawed by the [[California State Legislature|California Legislature]] until 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward D. Castillo|Castillo, Edward D.]] (1998). [http://www.ceres.ca.gov/nahc/califindian.html "Short Overview of California Indian History"], California Native American Heritage Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military and civil resistance by Native Americans has been a constant feature of American history. So too have a variety of debates around issues of sovereignty, the upholding of treaty provisions, and the civil rights of Native Americans under U.S. law.

====Reservation marginalization====
Once their territories were incorporated into the United States, surviving Native Americans were denied equality before the law and often treated as wards of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Native American reservations}}
Many Native Americans were moved to reservations&amp;mdash;constituting 4% of U.S. territory. In a number of cases treaties signed with Native Americans were violated. Tens of thousands of American Indians and Alaska Natives were forced to attend a [[Indian boarding school|residential school system]] which sought to reeducate them in white settler American values, culture and economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ward Churchill, ''Kill the Indian, Save the Man'', 2006. The basis for this theory was that inside every native person, there was a repressed white person screaming to come to the surface. Abuse both physical and psychological was common in these schools, and often their objective of 'compulsory whiteness' was not even ultimately achieved, with many of the Indians who later returned to the reservations afterwards not at all 'becoming white', but instead simply becoming heavy [[alcoholic]]s and displaying signs of permanent psychological distress, and even [[mental illness]]. Further, these individuals were often either totally unemployable or only marginally employed, as it was sensed by those around them that on the one hand, they had not successfully assimilated into 'white society', nor were they any longer acceptable to the Indian societies from which they had originated.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/world_news_america/9097996.stm | work=BBC News | first1=Franz | last1=Strasser | first2=Sharon | last2=Carpenter | title=Native Americans battle teenage suicide | date=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further dispossession of various kinds continues into the present, although these current dispossessions, especially in terms of land, rarely make major news headlines in the country (e.g., the [[Lenape]] people's recent fiscal troubles and subsequent land grab by the [[State of New Jersey]]), and sometimes even fail to make it to headlines in the localities in which they occur. Through concessions for industries such as oil, mining and timber and through division of land from the [[Allotment Act]] forward, these concessions have raised problems of consent, exploitation of low royalty rates, environmental injustice, and gross mismanagement of funds held in trust, resulting in the loss of $10–40 billion.&lt;ref&gt;United States Senate, [http://www.indiantrust.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=OtherMedia.ViewDetail&amp;Other_id=12&amp;Month=3&amp;Year=2007 Oversight Hearing on Trust Fund Litigation, Cobell v. Kempthorne]. See also, [[Cobell v. Norton]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Worldwatch Institute]] notes that 317 reservations are threatened by environmental hazards, while [[Western Shoshone]] land has been subjected to more than 1,000 nuclear explosions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Winona LaDuke]], ''All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life'', 1999, p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded date of Native Americans becoming U.S. citizens was in 1831 when the Mississippi [[Choctaw]] became citizens after the United States Legislature ratified the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]]. Under article XIV of that treaty, any Choctaw who elected not to move to Native American Territory could become an American citizen when he registered and if he stayed on designated lands for five years after treaty ratification. Citizenship could also be obtained by:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. Treaty Provision (as with the Mississippi Choctaw) &lt;br /&gt;
2. Allotment under the [[Dawes Act|Act of February 8, 1887]]&lt;br /&gt;
3. Issuance of Patent in Fee Simple &lt;br /&gt;
4. Adopting Habits of Civilized Life &lt;br /&gt;
5. Minor Children &lt;br /&gt;
6. Citizenship by Birth &lt;br /&gt;
7. Becoming Soldiers and Sailors in the U.S. Armed Forces &lt;br /&gt;
8. Marriage &lt;br /&gt;
9. Special Act of Congress. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{cquote|Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That all noncitizen Native Americans born within the territorial limits of the United States be, and they are hereby, declared to be citizens of the United States: Provided, That the granting of such citizenship shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of any Native American to tribal or other property.''|20px|20px|-''Indian Citizenship Act of 1924}}

While formal equality has been legally estated, [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Alaska Natives]], [[Native Hawaiians]], and [[Pacific Islanders]] remain among the most economically disadvantaged groups in the country, and according to National mental health studies, American Indians as a group tend to suffer from high levels of alcoholism, depression and suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/cre/fact4.asp |title=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Publications&amp;#124; SAMHSA Store |publisher=Mentalhealth.samhsa.gov |date=2011-11-19 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

===Developmental===
Using [[Psychometrics of racism|The Schedule of Racist Events]] (SRE), an 18-item self-report inventory that assesses the frequency of racist discrimination. Hope Landrine and Elizabeth A. Klonoff found that racist discrimination is rampant in the lives of African Americans and is strongly related to psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;''The Schedule of Racist Events: A Measure of Racial Discrimination and a Study of Its Negative Physical and Mental Health Consequences'' Journal of Black Psychology, Vol. 22, No. 2, 144-168 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; A study on racist events in the lives of African American women found that lifetime experiences of racism were positively related to lifetime history of both physical disease and frequency of recent common colds. These relationships were largely unaccounted for by other variables. Demographic variables such as income and education were not related to experiences of racism. The results suggest that racism can be detrimental to African American's well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kwate NO, Valdimarsdottir HB, Guevarra JS, Bovbjerg DH |title=Experiences of racist events are associated with negative health consequences for African American women |journal=J Natl Med Assoc |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=450–60 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12856911 |doi= |url= |pmc=2594553}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological stress caused by racism has been documented in studies by [[Claude Steele]], Joshua Aronson, and Steven Spencer on what they term "[[stereotype threat]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blascovich J, Spencer SJ, Quinn D, Steele C |title=African Americans and high blood pressure: the role of stereotype threat |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=225–9 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11437305 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00340 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quite similarly, another example of the psychosocial consequences of discrimination have been observed in a study sampling Mexican-origin participants in Fresno, California. It was found that perceived discrimination is correlated with depressive symptoms, especially for those less acculturated in the United States, like Mexican immigrants and migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finch|first=Brian|title=Perceived Discrimination and Depression among Mexican-Origin Adults in California|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|year=2000|volume=41|issue=3|page=309|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2676322|accessdate=5 November 2013|doi=10.2307/2676322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the vein of somatic responses to discrimination, Kennedy et al. found that both measures of collective disrespect were strongly correlated with black mortality (r = 0.53 to 0.56), as well as with white mortality (r = 0.48 to 0.54). These data suggest that racism, measured as an ecologic characteristic, is associated with higher mortality in both blacks and whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kennedy BP, Kawachi I, Lochner K, Jones C, Prothrow-Stith D |title=(Dis)respect and black mortality |journal=Ethn Dis |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=207–14 |year=1997 |pmid=9467703 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers also suggest that racial segregation may lead to disparities in health and mortality. Thomas LaVeist (1989; 1993) tested the hypothesis that [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] would aid in explaining race differences in infant mortality rates across cities. Analyzing 176 large and midsized cities, LaVeist found support for the hypothesis. Since LaVeist's studies, segregation has received increased attention as a determinant of race disparities in mortality.&lt;ref name="lavest"&gt;..&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that mortality rates for male and female African Americans are lower in areas with lower levels of residential segregation. Mortality for male and female Whites was not associated in either direction with residential segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hart KD, Kunitz SJ, Sell RR, Mukamel DB |title=Metropolitan governance, residential segregation, and mortality among African Americans |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=434–8 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9518976 |pmc=1508338 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.88.3.434|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9518976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Sharon A. Jackson, Roger T. Anderson, Norman J. Johnson and Paul D. Sorlie found that, after adjustment for family income, [[Mortality rate|mortality]] risk increased with increasing minority residential segregation among Blacks aged 25 to 44 years and non-Blacks aged 45 to 64 years. In most age/race/gender groups, the highest and lowest mortality risks occurred in the highest and lowest categories of residential segregation, respectively. These results suggest that minority residential segregation may influence mortality risk and underscore the traditional emphasis on the social underpinnings of disease and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jackson SA, Anderson RT, Johnson NJ, Sorlie PD |title=The relation of residential segregation to all-cause mortality: a study in black and white |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=615–7 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10754978 |pmc=1446199 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.90.4.615|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10754978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of heart disease among African Americans are associated with the segregation patterns in the neighborhoods where they live (Fang ''et al.'' 1998). Stephanie A. Bond Huie writes that neighborhoods affect health and mortality outcomes primarily in an indirect fashion through environmental factors such as smoking, diet, exercise, stress, and access to health insurance and medical providers.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/(4mofmj45dowzx445b21cbw55)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,8,15;journal,30,40;linkingpublicationresults,1:102491,1 THE CONCEPT OF NEIGHBORHOOD IN HEALTH AND MORTALITY RESEARCH]''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, segregation strongly influences premature mortality in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper RS, Kennelly JF, Durazo-Arvizu R, Oh HJ, Kaplan G, Lynch J |title=Relationship between premature mortality and socioeconomic factors in black and white populations of US metropolitan areas |journal=Public Health Rep |volume=116 |issue=5 |pages=464–73 |year=2001 |pmid=12042610 |pmc=1497360 |doi= 10.1016/S0033-3549(04)50074-2|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1866, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|Civil Rights Act]] provided a remedy for intentional race discrimination in employment by private employers and state and local public employers. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]] applies to public employment or employment involving state action prohibiting deprivation of rights secured by the federal constitution or federal laws through action under color of law. Title VII is the principal federal statute with regard to employment discrimination prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, labor organizations, training programs and employment agencies based on race or color, religion, gender, and national origin. Title VII also prohibits retaliation against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] expanded the damages available in Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to a jury trial. Title VII also provides that race and color discrimination against every race and color is prohibited.

===Societal===

====Schemas and stereotypes====
[[File:1900sc Mammy Card Interracial.jpg|thumb|This racist [[postcard]] from the 1900s shows the casual denigration of black women. It states "I know you're not particular to a fault / Though I'm not sure you'll never be sued for assault / You're so fond of women that even a wench / Attracts your gross fancy despite her strong stench"]]

'''Media'''
{{See also|Stereotypes of African Americans|Stereotypes of East Asians in the Western world|Stereotypes of Native Americans|Stereotypes of West and Central Asians in the United States}}
Popular culture (songs, theater) for European American audiences in the 19th century created and perpetuated negative stereotypes of African Americans. One key symbol of racism against African Americans was the use of [[blackface]]. Directly related to this was the institution of [[Blackface|minstrelsy]]. Other stereotypes of African Americans included the fat, dark-skinned "[[mammy archetype|mammy]]" and the irrational, hypersexual male "buck".

In recent years increasing numbers of African-American activists have asserted that [[rap music]] videos utilize African-American performers commonly enacting [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of scantily clothed women and men as thugs or pimps. Church organized groups have protested outside the residence of Phillipe Dauman (Upper East Side (New York, NY)) (president and chief executive officer of [[Viacom]]) and the residence of Debra L. Lee (Northwest Washington DC) (chairman and chief executive of [[Black Entertainment Television]], a unit of Viacom). Rev. Donald Coates, leader of a protest organization formed around the issue of the videos, "Enough is Enough!" said, "In the wake of the [[Don Imus|Imus]] affair, I began to think that the African-American community must be consistent in its outrage." The Clifton, Maryland minister has also said, "Why are these corporations making these images normative and mainstream?" ... "I can talk about this in the church until I am blue in the face, but we need to take it outside." The [[NAACP]] and the National Congress of Black Women also have called for the reform of images on videos and on television. [[Julian Bond]] said that in a segregated society, people get their impressions of other groups from what they see in videos and what they hear in music.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Felicia R. Lee, "[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/arts/05enou.html Protesting Demeaning Images in Media]" ''[[New York Times]]'' November 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marissa Newhall, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/15/AR2007091501441.html Channeling Their Discontent, 500 Gather at Executive's D.C. Home to Protest Stereotypes]," ''[[Washington Post]]'', September 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enoughisenoughcampaign.com/ |title=Enough is Enough! Campaign |publisher=Enough is Enough! Campaign |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whataboutourdaughters.com/ |title=What About Our Daughters? |publisher=Whataboutourdaughters.com |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, activists protested against the BET show, ''Hot Ghetto Mess,'' which satirizes the culture of [[working-class]] [[African-Americans]]. The protests resulted in the change of the television show name to ''[[We Got to Do Better]].''&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

It is understood that representations of minorities in the media have the ability to reinforce or change stereotypes. For example, in one study, a collection of white subjects were primed by a comedy skit either showing a stereotypical or neutral portrayal of African-American characters. Participants were then required to read a vignette describing an incident of sexual violence, with the alleged offender either white or black, and assign a rating for perceived guilt. For those shown the  stereotypical African-American character, there was a significantly higher guilt rating for black alleged offender in the subsequent vignette, in comparison to the other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ford|first=Thomas|title=Effects of Stereotypical Television Portrayals of African-Americans on Person Perception|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|year=1997|volume=60|issue=3|page=266|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2787086|accessdate=5 November 2013|doi=10.2307/2787086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While schemas have an overt societal consequence, the strong development of them have lasting effect on recipients. Overall, it is found that strong in-group attitudes are correlated with academic and economic success. In a study analyzing the interaction of assimilation and racial-ethnic schemas for Hispanic youth found that strong schematic identities for Hispanic youth undermined academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Altschul|first=Inna|coauthors=Daphna Oyserman and Deborah Bybee|title=Racial-Ethnic Self-Schemas and Segmented Assimilation: Identity and the Academic Achievement of Hispanic Youth|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=September 2008|volume=71|issue=3|page=303|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20141842|accessdate=5 November 2013|doi=10.1177/019027250807100309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional stereotypes attributed to minorities continue to influence societal interactions. For example, a 1993 Harvard Law Review article states that Asian-Americans are commonly viewed as submissive, as a combination of relative physical stature and Western comparisons of cultural attitudes. Furthermore, Asian-Americans are depicted as the model minority, unfair competitors, foreigners, and indistinguishable. These stereotypes can serve to dehumanize Asian-Americans and catalyze hostility and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Racial Violence against Asian Americans|journal=Harvard Law Review|year=1993|volume=106|issue=8|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1341790|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formal discrimination====
Formal discrimination against minorities has been present throughout American history. Within education, a survey of black students in sixteen majority white universities found that four of five African-Americans reported some form of racial discrimination. For example, in February 1988, the University of Michigan enforced a new anti discrimination code following the distribution of fliers saying blacks “don’t belong in classrooms, they belong hanging from trees”. Other forms of reported discrimination were refusal to sit next to black in lecture, ignored input in class settings, and informal segregation. While the penalties are imposed, the psychological consequences of formal discrimination can still manifest. Black students, for example, reported feelings of heightened isolation and suspicion. Furthermore, studies have shown that academic performance is stunted for black students with these feelings as a result of their campus race interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilkerson|first=Isabel|title=Campus Blacks Feel Racism's Nuances|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/17/us/campus-blacks-feel-racism-s-nuances.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=5 November 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 April 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minority-minority racism'''

Minority racism is sometimes considered controversial because of theories of [[power (sociology)|power]] in society. Some theories of racism insist that racism can only exist in the context of social power to impose it upon others.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Catherine A. Hansman, Leon Spencer, Dale Grant, Mary Jackson, "Beyond Diversity: Dismantling Barriers in Education," ''Journal of Instructional Psychology'', March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Yet discrimination and racism between racially marginalized groups has been noted. For example, there has been ongoing violence between [[African American]] and [[Mexican American]] gangs, particularly in [[Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Blankstein And Joel Rubin.

This amounts to a standing authorization for Latino gang members to prove their mettle by terrorizing or even murdering any blacks sighted in a neighborhood claimed by a gang loyal to the Mexican Mafia.{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/bawnews/stateof/hutchinson105]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several significant riots in [[California]] prisons where Mexican American inmates and African Americans have targeted each other particularly, based on racial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2006/12/race-riot-put-down-at-california-state.php JURIST - Paper Chase: Race riot put down at California state prison]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsmine.org/archive/security/incarceration/racial-segregation-continues-in-california-prisons.txt Racial segregation continues in California prisons]{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been noted conflict between recent immigrant groups and their established ethnic counterparts within the United States. Rapid growth in [[Africans in the United States|African]] and [[Caribbean]] immigrants has come into conflict with American blacks. Interaction and cooperation between black immigrants and American blacks are, ironically, debatable. One can argue that racial discrimination and cooperation is not ordinarily based on color of skin but more on shared common, cultural experiences, and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06044/654613.stm |title=African immigrants face bias from blacks |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=1969-12-31 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Story?id=5237459&amp;page=1 |title=Racism not always black and white |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, conflict between [[Chinese people|Chinese immigrants]] and [[Japanese Americans]] are known to have occurred in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] of the [[Los Angeles]] area in the 1980s. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

====Interpersonal discrimination====
In a manner that defines interpersonal discrimination in the United States, Darryl Brown of the Virginia Law Review states that while “our society has established a consensus against blatant, intentional racism and in decades since Brown v Board of Education has developed a sizeable set of legal remedies to address it”, our legal system “ignores the possibility that ‘race’ is structural or interstitial, that it can be the root of injury even when not traceable to a specific intention or action”&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Darryl|title=Racism and Race Relations in the University|journal=Virginia Law Review|date=March 1990|volume=76|issue=2|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1073204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal discrimination is defined by its subtlety. Unlike formal discrimination, interpersonal discrimination is often not an overt or deliberate act of racism. For example, in an incident regarding a racial remark from a professor at Virginia Law, a rift was created by conflicting definitions of racism. For the students that defended the professor’s innocence, “racism was defined as an act of intentional maliciousness.” Yet for African-American’s, racism was broadened to a detrimental influence on “the substantive dynamics of the classroom”. As an effect, it is argued that the “daily repetition of subtle racism and subordination in the classroom and on campus can ultimately be, for African Americans, more productive of stress, anxiety and alienation than even blatant racists acts.” Moreover, the attention to these acts of discrimination diverts energy from academics, becoming a distraction that white students do not generally face.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

===Institutional===
[[Institutional racism]] is the theory that aspects of the structure, pervasive attitudes, and established institutions of society disadvantage some racial groups, although not by an overtly discriminatory mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eraseracismny.org/html/whatis/whatis.php What is Institutional and Structural Racism?] ERASE RACISM&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors that play into institutional racism, including but not limited to: accumulated wealth/benefits from racial groups that have benefited from past discrimination, educational and occupational disadvantages faced by non-native English speakers in the United States, ingrained stereotypical images that still remain in the society (e.g. black men are likely to be criminals).&lt;ref&gt;Bullock III, C. S. &amp; Rodgers Jr., H. R. (1976) "Institutional Racism: Prerequisites, Freezing, and Mapping". ''Phylon'' 37 (3), 212-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigration====
{{See also|Immigration to the United States}}
Access to United States [[citizenship]] was restricted by race, beginning with the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] which refused naturalization to "non-whites". Many in the modern United States forget the institutionalized prejudice against white followers of [[Roman Catholicism]] who immigrated from countries such as [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us/tserve/nineteen/nkeyinfo/nromcath.htm Roman Catholics and Immigration in Nineteenth-Century America] by Julie Byrne, Dept. of Religion, Duke University, National Humanities Center&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts include the 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and the 1924 [[National Origins Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=47 |title=Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) |publisher=Ourdocuments.gov |date=1968-07-01 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicaldocuments.com/ImmigrationActof1924.htm Immigration Act of 1924] HistoricalDocuments.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at further restricting the [[Southern Europe]]ans and [[Russians]] who had begun to enter the country in large numbers beginning in the 1890s.

In conjunction with immigration reform in the late 1980s (seen with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986), there have been noted IRCA-related discriminatory behavior toward Hispanics within employment. As the measure made it unlawful to hire without authorization to work in the United States, avoidant treatment toward “foreign-appearing workers” increased to bypass the required record-keeping or risk of sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowell|first=Lindsay|title=Unintended Consequences of Immigration Reform: Discrimination and HIspanic Employment|journal=Demography|date=November 1995|volume=32|issue=4|page=617|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2061678|accessdate=5 November 2013|doi=10.2307/2061678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wealth====
{{See also|Wealth inequality in the United States}}
Massive racial differentials in account of wealth remain in the United States: between whites and African Americans, the gap is a factor of twenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/0726/Wealth-gap-widens-Whites-net-worth-is-20-times-that-of-blacks |title=Wealth gap widens: Whites' net worth is 20 times that of blacks |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2011-07-26 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analyst of the phenomenon, Thomas Shapiro, professor of law and social policy at Brandeis University argues, "The wealth gap is not just a story of merit and achievement, it's also a story of the historical legacy of race in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15704759/ Census report: Broad racial disparities persist]", November 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Differentials applied to the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Act]] (which excluded agricultural workers, a sector that then included most black workers), rewards to military officers, and the educational benefits offered returning soldiers after [[World War II]]. Pre-existing disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income, subsidize mortgages, and subsidize private sector developers.&lt;ref&gt;George Lipsitz, "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0003-0678%28199509%2947%3A3%3C369%3ATPIIWR%3E2.0.CO%3B2-9 The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: Racialized Social Democracy and the "White" Problem in American Studies]," ''American Quarterly'', Vol. 47, No. 3.

====Health care====
{{See also|Race and health in the United States}}
There are major racial differences in access to [[Health care in the United States|health care]] and in the quality of health care provided. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that: "over 886,000 deaths could have been prevented from 1991 to 2000 if African Americans had received the same care as whites."

Inequalities in health care may also reflect a [[systemic bias]] in the way medical procedures and treatments are prescribed for different ethnic groups. Raj Bhopal writes that the history of [[Scientific racism|racism in science]] and medicine shows that people and institutions behave according to the ethos of their times and warns of dangers to avoid in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bhopal R |title=Spectre of racism in health and health care: lessons from history and the United States |journal=BMJ |volume=316 |issue=7149 |pages=1970–3 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9641943 |pmc=1113412 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.316.7149.1970|url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9641943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Krieger contended that much modern research supported the assumptions needed to justify racism.

====Politics====
It is argued that racial “coding” of concepts like crime and welfare has been used to strategically influence public political views. Racial coding is implicit; it incorporates racially primed language or imagery to allude to racial attitudes and thinking. For example, in the context of domestic policy, it is argued that Ronald Reagan implied linkages between concepts like “special interests” and “big government” with ill-perceived minority groups in the 1980s, using the conditioned negativity toward the minority groups to discredit certain policies and programs during campaigns. In a study analyzing how political ads prime attitudes, Valentino compares the voting responses of participants after being exposed to narration of a George W. Bush advertisement paired with three different types of visuals with different embedded racial cues to create three conditions: neutral, race comparison, and undeserving blacks. For example, as the narrator states “Democrats want to spend your tax dollars on wasteful government programs”, the video shows an image of a black woman and child in an office setting. Valentino found that the undeserving blacks condition produced the largest primed effect in racialized policies, like opposition to affirmative action and welfare spending.&lt;ref name=Valentino&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valentino|first=Nicholas|title=Cues that Matter: How Political Ads Prime Racial Attitudes during Campaigns|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=March 2002|volume=96|issue=1|page=83|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3117811|accessdate=5 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s0003055402004240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Justice system====
{{main|Race and crime in the United States}}
Racial disparities have been noted in all levels of the U.S. justice system. According to 2009 congressional testimony from Marc Mauer; while African Americans comprise 13% of the US population and 14% of monthly drug users they are 37% of the people arrested for drug offenses; as well as 56% of the people in state prisons for drug offenses. The U.S. Sentencing Commission reported in March 2010 that in the federal system black offenders receive sentences that are 10% longer than white offenders for the same crimes. A July 2009 report by the Sentencing Project found that two-thirds of the people in the US with life sentences are non-white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Fourteen Examples of Racism in Criminal Justice System|author=Bill Quigley|date=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary issues in American racism==

===Hate crimes===
{{Main|Hate crime}}
Most [[hate crimes]] in the United States target victims on the basis of race or ethnicity (for Federal purposes, crimes targeting Hispanics based on that identity are considered based on ethnicity). Leading forms of bias cited in the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, based on law enforcement agency filings are: anti-black, anti-Jewish, anti-white, anti-homosexual, and anti-Hispanic bias in that order in both 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2004/openpage.htm Hate Crime Statistics, 2004]. [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2005/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics had similar rates of violent hate crime victimization between 2007-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hate Crime Victimization, 2003-2011|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcv0311.pdf|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Criminal Victimization Survey found that per capita rates of hate crime victimization varied little by race or ethnicity, and the differences are not statistically significant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcrvp.pdf Hate Crime Reported by Victims and Police], Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report, November 2005, NCJ 209911.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Century Foundation]], a [[white nationalist]] organization founded by [[Jared Taylor]], argues that blacks are more likely than whites to commit hate crimes, and that FBI figures inflate the number of hate crimes committed by whites by counting Hispanics as "white".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nc-f.org/colorcrime1999.htm The Color of Crime], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysts are sharply critical of the NCF's findings, referring to the criminological mainstream view that "Racial and ethnic data must be treated with caution. Existing research on crime has generally shown that racial or ethnic identity is not predictive of criminal behavior with data which has been controlled for social and economic factors."&lt;ref&gt;Preface to Minnesota's official crime data reports, quoted in Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime].&lt;/ref&gt; NCF's methodology and statistics are further sharply criticized as flawed and deceptive by anti-racist activists Tim Wise and the Southern Poverty Law Center.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Wise, "[http://www.lipmagazine.org/~timwise/colorofdeception.html The Color of Deception: Race, Crime and Sloppy Social Science]," 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Southern Poverty Law Center, [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=255 Coloring Crime].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first post-Jim Crow era hate crime to make sensational media attention was the [[murder of Vincent Chin]], an Asian American of Chinese descent in 1982. He was attacked by a two white assailants who were recently laid off from a Detroit area auto factory job and blamed the Japanese for their individual unemployment. Chin was not of Japanese descent, but the assailants testified at the criminal court case that he "looked like a Jap", an ethnic slur used to describe Japanese and other Asians, and that they were angry enough to beat him to death.

===Hateful views from Americans===
Continuing [[antisemitism in the United States]] has remained an issue as the 2011 ''Survey of American Attitudes Toward Jews in America'', released by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), has found that the recent [[Late-2000s recession|world economic recession]] increased some antisemitic viewpoints among Americans. Most people express [[Philo-Semitism|pro-Jewish sentiments]], with 64% of those surveyed agreeing that Jews have contributed much to U.S. social culture. Yet the polling found that 19% of Americans answered "probably true" to the [[antisemitic canard]] that "Jews have too much control/influence on Wall Street" while 15% concurred with the related statement that Jews seem "more willing to use shady practices" in business. Reflecting on the lingering antisemitism of about in five Americans, [[Abraham H. Foxman]], ADL national director, has argued, "It is disturbing that with all of the strides we have made in becoming a more tolerant society, anti-Semitic beliefs continue to hold a vice-grip on a small but not insubstantial segment of the American public."&lt;ref name=adl-poll&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/ADL-poll-Anti-Semitic-attitudes-on-rise-in-USA|title=ADL poll: Anti-Semitic attitudes on rise in USA|publisher=''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''|date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[ABC News]] report in 2007 recounted that past ABC polls across several years have tended to find that "six percent have self-reported prejudice against Jews, 27 percent against Muslims, 25 percent against Arabs," and "one in 10 concedes harboring at least some such feelings" against [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]]. The report also remarked that a full 34% of Americans reported "some racist feelings" in general as a self-description.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/US/1048a1Hispanics.pdf|title=Aquí Se Habla Español – and Two-Thirds Don’t Mind|publisher=''[[ABC News]]''|date=Oct 8, 2007|accessdate=Dec 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Associated Press]] and [[Yahoo News]] survey of 2,227 adult Americans in 2008 found that 10% of white respondents stated that "a lot" of discrimination against African-Americans exists while 45% answered "some" compared to 57% of black respondents answering that "a lot" exists. In the same poll, more whites applied positive attributes to black Americans than negative ones, with blacks describing whites even more highly, but a significant minority of whites still called their fellow Americans "irresponsible", "lazy", or other such things.&lt;ref name=babington&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Sep22/0,4670,APYahooPollRaceinAmerica,00.html |title=Poll: Views still differ sharply by race |first=Charles |last=Babington |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |date=September 22, 2008 |accessdate=January 16, 2010 |quote=[A] new Associated Press-Yahoo News poll, conducted with Stanford University, shows ... that a substantial portion of white Americans still harbor negative feelings toward blacks.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanford University political scientist Paul Sniderman has remarked that, in the modern U.S., racial prejudice "is a deep challenge, and it's one that Americans in general, and for that matter, political scientists, just haven't been ready to acknowledge fully."&lt;ref name=babington/&gt;

==Alleviation==
There is a wide plethora of societal and political suggestions to alleviate the effects of continued discrimination in the United States. For example,  within universities, it has been suggested that a type of committee could respond to non-sanctionable behavior.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

It is also argued that there is a need for “white students and faculty to reformulate white-awareness toward a more secure identity that is not threatened by black cultural institutions and that can recognize the racial non-neutrality of the institutions whites dominate” (Brown, 334). Paired with this effort, Brown encourages the increase in minority faculty members, so the embedded white normative experience begins to fragment.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

Within media, it is found that racial cues prime racial stereotypic thought. Thus, it is argued that “stereotype inconsistent cues might lead to more intentioned thought, thereby suppressing racial priming effects” &lt;ref name=Valentino /&gt;
