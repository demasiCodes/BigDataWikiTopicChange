'''Gender studies''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[discipline (academia)|academic field]] devoted to analysing [[gender identity]] and gendered [[representation (politics)|representation]]. Gender studies originated in the field of [[women's studies]], concerning [[women]], [[feminism]], [[gender]], and [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wiesner-Hanks |first=Merry |author-link=Merry Wiesner-Hanks |title=Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe |year=2019 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=9781108683524 |pages=1–22 |edition=4 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/women-and-gender-in-early-modern-europe/86B27B08AF675395E5ADE5544AAD4CB0#overview |access-date=7 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies |title=Gender Studies |publisher=[[Whitman College]] |access-date=1 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121212181127/http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies |archive-date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field now overlaps with [[queer studies]] and [[men's studies]]. Its rise to prominence, especially in Western universities after 1990, coincided with the rise of [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref name="gottshall02"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1466463 |title=The Ethical Implications of the Deconstruction of Gender |last=Gottschall|first=Marilyn |year=2002 |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]] |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=279–99 |doi=10.1093/jaar/70.2.279 |jstor=1466463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disciplines that frequently contribute to gender studies include the fields of [[literature]], [[linguistics]], [[human geography]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[archaeology]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[film theory|cinema]], [[musicology]], [[media studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gender and Media: Representing, Producing, Consuming |last1=Krijnen|first1=Tonny |last2=van Bauwel|first2=Sofie |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-415-69540-4 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human development (economics)|human development]], law, [[public health]], and medicine.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gendersexuality.uchicago.edu/about/ |title=About – Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS) |publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |access-date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender studies also analyzes how [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[location]], [[social class]], [[nationality]], and [[disability]] [[intersectionality|intersect]] with the categories of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Race, Ethnicity, Gender &amp; Class"&gt;Healey, J.

(1992). "Gender", p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; however, this view is not held by all gender scholars.

Gender is pertinent to many disciplines, such as [[literary theory]], drama studies, [[film theory]], [[performativity|performance theory]], contemporary [[art history]], anthropology, sociology, [[sociolinguistics]] and [[psychology]]. These disciplines sometimes differ in their approaches to how and why gender is studied. In politics, gender can be viewed as a foundational discourse that political actors employ in order to position themselves on a variety of issues.&lt;ref&gt;Salime, Zakia. ''Between Feminism and Islam: Human Rights and Sharia Law in Morocco''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender studies is also a discipline in itself, incorporating methods and approaches from a wide range of disciplines.&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Essed |first1=Philomena |author-link1=Philomena Essed |last2=Goldberg |first2=David Theo |author-link2=David Theo Goldberg |last3=Kobayashi |first3=Audrey |author-link3=Audrey Kobayashi |title=A Companion to Gender Studies |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPgYDTa9P84C |access-date=7 November 2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-8808-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==

===Psychoanalytic theory===

A number of theorists have influenced the field of gender studies significantly, specifically in terms of psychoanalytic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Pollock | editor-first=Griselda | title=Psychoanalysis and the Image | location=Oxford | publisher=Blackwell | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these are [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Julia Kristeva]], and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]]. Gender studied under the lens of each of these theorists looks somewhat different. In a Freudian system, women are "mutilated and must learn to accept their lack of a penis" (in Freud's terms a "deformity").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Horney | first = Karen | contribution = On the Genesis of the Castration Complex in Women (1922) | editor-last = Miller | editor-first = J. B. | title = Psychoanalysis and Women | location = New York | publisher = Bruner/Mazel | year = 1973 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan, however, organizes femininity and masculinity according to different unconscious structures. Both male and female subjects participate in the "phallic" organization, and the feminine side of sexuation is "supplementary" and not opposite or complementary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lacan | first = Jacques | author-link = Jacques Lacan | title = Encore | publisher = Seuil | location = Paris | year = 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan uses the concept of sexuation (sexual situation), which posits the development of gender-roles and role-play in childhood, to counter the idea that gender identity is innate or biologically determined. According to Lacan, the sexuation of an individual has as much, if not more, to do with their development of a gender identity as being genetically sexed male or female.&lt;ref name="Lacan &amp; Post-feminism"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = E. | title = Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristeva contends that patriarchal cultures, like individuals, have to exclude the maternal and the feminine so that they can come into being.&lt;ref name="Kristeva Abject"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kristeva | first = Julia | author-link = Julia Kristeva | title = Powers of Horror | url = https://archive.org/details/powersofhorrores00kris | url-access = registration | year = 1982 | publisher = Columbia University Press | isbn = 9780231053464 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bracha L.

====Feminist psychoanalytic theory====
Feminist theorists such as [[Juliet Mitchell]], [[Nancy Chodorow]], [[Jessica Benjamin]], [[Jane Gallop]], [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Griselda Pollock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pollock | first = Griselda | author-link = Griselda Pollock | title = Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive | publisher = Routledge | date = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luce Irigaray]] and [[Jane Flax]] have developed a Feminist psychoanalysis and argued that psychoanalytic theory is vital to the feminist project and must, like other theoretical traditions, be criticized by women as well as transformed to free it from vestiges of sexism (i.e. being [[censored]]). [[Shulamith Firestone]], in ''The Dialectic of Sex'', calls [[Freudianism]] the misguided feminism and discusses how Freudianism is ''almost'' completely accurate, with the exception of one crucial detail: everywhere that Freud writes "penis", the word should be replaced with "power".

Critics such as [[Elizabeth Grosz]] accuse [[Jacques Lacan]] of maintaining a sexist tradition in psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name ="Grosz"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grosz | first = Elizabeth | author-link = Elizabeth Grosz| title = Jacques Lacan: A Feminist Introduction | url = https://archive.org/details/jacqueslacanfemi0000gros | url-access = registration | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Judith Butler]], Bracha L. Ettinger and [[Jane Gallop]] have used Lacanian work, though in a critical way, to develop gender studies.&lt;ref name="Gender Trouble"&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ettinger"&gt;{{citation | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha L. | author-link = Bracha L.

B. Marchand, "The gender studies and queer theory are rather reluctant, hostile to see the psychoanalytic approach."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Chaudoye | first1 = Guillemine | last2 = Cupa | first2 = Dominique | last3 = Parat | first3 = Hélène | contribution = Judith Butler | editor-last1 = Chaudoye | editor-first1 = Guillemine | editor-last2 = Cupa | editor-first2 = Dominique | editor-last3 = Parat | editor-first3 = Hélène | title = Le Sexuel, ses différences et ses genres | publisher = EDK Editions | location = Paris | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Jean-Claude Guillebaud]], gender studies (and activists of sexual minorities) "besieged" and consider psychoanalysis and psychoanalysts as "the new priests, the last defenders of the genital normality, morality, moralism or even obscurantism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1-first=Jean-Claude | author1-last=Guillebaud | author1-link=Jean-Claude Guillebaud | author2-first=Armand | author2-last=Abécassis | author3-first=Alain | author3-last=Houziaux | title=La psychanalyse peut-elle guérir? | location=Paris | publisher=Éditions de l'Atelier | year=2005 | page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judith Butler]]'s worries about the psychoanalytic outlook under which sexual difference is "undeniable" and pathologizing any effort to suggest that it is not so paramount and unambiguous ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = Judith | last2 = Fassin | first2 = Éric | last3 = Wallach Scott | first3 = Joan | author-link1 = Judith Butler | author-link2 = Éric Fassin | author-link3 = Joan Wallach Scott | title = Pour ne pas en finir avec le 'genre'... table ronde | trans-title = For more on 'gender'... round table | journal = Sociétés &amp; Représentations | volume = 2 | issue = 24 | pages = 285–306 | doi = 10.3917/sr.024.0285 | date = May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Daniel Beaune and Caterina Rea, the gender-studies "often criticized psychoanalysis to perpetuate a family and social model of patriarchal, based on a rigid and timeless version of the parental order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Beaune | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Rea | first2 = Caterina | title = Psychanalyse sans Œdipe: Antigone, genre et subversion | page = 78 | publisher = L'Harmattan | location = Paris | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary theory===
Psychoanalytically oriented [[French feminism]] focused on visual and literary theory all along. [[Virginia Woolf]]'s legacy as well as "[[Adrienne Rich]]'s call for women's revisions of literary texts, and history as well, has galvanized a generation of feminist authors to reply with texts of their own".&lt;ref&gt;Mica Howe &amp; Sarah A. Aguier (eds). ''He said, She Says''. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]] and other feminists have articulated Myth and poetry&lt;ref name="Vanda Zajko 2006"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first=Vanda | editor1-last=Zajko | editor2-first=Miriam | editor2-last=Leonard | editor2-link=Miriam Leonard | title=Laughing with Medusa | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and literature,&lt;ref name="Vanda Zajko 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author-first=Maggie | author-last=Humm | author-link=Maggie Humm | title=Modernist Women and Visual Cultures | publisher=Rutgers University Press | year=2003 | isbn=0-8135-3266-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Nina | last=Cornyetz | title=Dangerous Women, Deadly Words | publisher=Stanford University Press | year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the point of view of gender.

===Post-modern influence===
The emergence of [[post-modernism]] theories affected gender studies,&lt;ref name="Lacan &amp; Post-feminism"/&gt; causing a movement in [[Gender identity|identity theories]] away from the concept of fixed or [[essentialism|essentialist]] gender identity, to [[Postmodernity#Distinctions in philosophy and critical theory|post-modern]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Margret | last=Grebowicz | author-link=Margret Grebowicz | year=2007 | title=Gender After Lyotard | location=NY | publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; fluid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Zohar | editor-first=Ayelet | title=PostGender | publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing | year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or multiple identities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seyla Benhabib|Benhabib, S.]] (1995). "Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange", and Butler, J. (1995), "Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange".&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of [[post-structuralism]], and its literary theory aspect post-modernism, on gender studies was most prominent in its challenge of grand narratives. Post-structuralism paved the way for the emergence of [[queer theory]] in gender studies, which necessitated the field expanding its purview to sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderandsexuality.as.nyu.edu/page/home|title=Gender and Sexuality Studies – New York University|work=nyu.edu|access-date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the expansion to include sexuality studies, under the influence of post-modernism gender studies has also turned its lens toward [[hegemonic masculinity|masculinity studies]], due to the work of sociologists and theorists such as [[R. W. Connell]], [[Michael Kimmel]], and E. Anthony Rotundo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Manhood: Transformations in Masculinity From The Revolution to the Modern Era|author= E. Anthony Rotundo|isbn= 9780465001699|date= 1994-05-13|publisher= Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeser, ''Masculinities in Theory'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes and expansions have led to some contentions within the field, such as the one between second wave feminists and queer theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amygoodloe.com/papers/lesbian-feminism-and-queer-theory-another-battle-of-the-sexes/|first=Amy | last=Goodloe | author-link=Amy Goodloe | title=Lesbian-Feminism and Queer Theory: Another "Battle of the Sexes"?|work=amygoodloe.com|access-date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line drawn between these two camps lies in the problem as feminists see it of queer theorists arguing that everything is fragmented and there are not only no grand narratives but also no trends or categories. Feminists argue that this erases the categories of gender altogether but does nothing to antagonize the power dynamics reified by gender. In other words, the fact that gender is [[social construction|socially constructed]] does not undo the fact that there are strata of oppression between genders.

==Development of theory==

===History===

The history of gender studies looks at the different perspectives of gender. This discipline examines the ways in which historical, cultural, and social events shape the role of gender in different societies. The field of gender studies, while focusing on the differences between men and women, also looks at sexual differences and less binary definitions of gender categorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Joan Wallach | last=Scott | author-link=Joan Wallach Scott | title=Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis | journal=American Historical Review | volume=91 | issue=5 | date=December 1986 | pages=1053–1075 | doi=10.2307/1864376 | jstor=1864376 | url=https://seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/educacaoerealidade/article/download/71721/40667 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the universal suffrage revolution of the twentieth century, the [[women's liberation movement]] of the 1960s and 1970s promoted a revision from the feminists to "actively interrogate" the usual and accepted versions of history as it was known at the time. It was the goal of many feminist scholars to question original assumptions regarding women's and men's attributes, to actually measure them, and to report observed differences between women and men.&lt;ref name="Chafetz, Janet Saltzman 1999"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Chafetz | editor-first=Janet Saltzman | title=Handbook of the Sociology of Gender | location=New York | publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum | year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, these programs were essentially feminist, designed to recognize contributions made by women as well as by men. Soon, men began to look at masculinity the same way that women were looking at femininity, and developed an area of study called "men's studies".&lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"&gt;Douglas, Fedwa. ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender''. Detroit: Macmillan Reference, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1980s and 1990s that scholars recognized a need for study in the field of sexuality. This was due to the increasing interest in lesbian and gay rights, and scholars found that most individuals will associate sexuality and gender together, rather than as separate entities.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liddington|first=Jill|title=HISTORY, FEMINISM AND GENDER STUDIES|url=http://www.jliddington.org.uk/cig1.html|publisher=University of Leeds Centre for Interdisciplinary Gender Studies: Working Paper 1 Feminist Scholarship: within/across/between/beyond the disciplines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although doctoral programs for women's studies have existed since 1990, the first doctoral program for a potential PhD in gender studies in the United States was approved in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/11/10/gender |title=Indiana Creates First Gender Studies PhD |date=10 November 2005 |first=Scott |last=Jaschik |quote=The last decade has seen the number of women's studies PhD programs grow to at least 10 – most of them relatively new.

===Women's studies===
{{Main|Women's studies}}
Women's studies is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[women]], [[feminism]], [[gender identity|gender]], and [[politics]]. It often includes [[feminist theory]], [[women's history]] (e.g. a history of [[women's suffrage]]) and [[social history]], [[women's fiction]], [[women's health]], feminist psychoanalysis and the [[feminist]] and gender studies-influenced practice of most of the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]].

===Men's studies===
{{Main|Men's studies}}
Men's studies is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[men]], [[gender identity|gender]], and [[politics]]. It often includes feminist theory, men's history and [[social history]], men's fiction, [[men's health]], feminist psychoanalysis and the feminist and gender studies-influenced practice of most of the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Timothy Laurie and [[Anna Hickey-Moody]] suggest that there 'have always been dangers present in the institutionalisation of "masculinity studies" as a semi-gated community', and note that 'a certain triumphalism vis-à-vis feminist philosophy haunts much masculinities research'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurie |first1=Timothy |last2=Hickey-Moody |first2=Anna |year=2015 |title=Geophilosophies of Masculinity: Remapping Gender, Aesthetics and Knowledge |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912564|journal=[[Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359|hdl=10453/44702 |s2cid=145472959 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within studies on men, it is important to distinguish the specific approach often defined as Critical Studies on Men. This approach was largely developed in the anglophone countries from the early 1980s – especially in the United Kingdom –  centred then around the work of [[Jeff Hearn]], [[David Morgan (sociologist)|David Morgan]] and colleagues.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hearn |first1=Jeff |last2=Morgan |first2=David|title=Men, masculinities &amp; social theory|publisher=Unwin Hyman|year=1990|isbn=978-0-04-445657-5|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the approach has spread globally since then. It is inspired primarily by a range of feminist perspectives (including socialist and radical) and places emphasis on the need for research and practice to explicitly challenge men's and boys' sexism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Although it explores a very broad range of men's practices, it tends to focus especially on issues related to sexuality and/or men's violences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hearn|first=Jeff|title=The Violences of Men: : How Men Talk About and How Agencies Respond to Men's Violence to Women|publisher=Sage|year=1998|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally largely rooted in sociology, it has since engaged with a broad range of other disciplines including social policy, social work, cultural studies, gender studies, education and law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| editor-last = Flood | editor-first = M | editor-last2 = Gardiner | editor-first2 = J.

===Gender in Asia and Polynesia===
{{See also|Women in Asia}}

Certain issues associated with gender in [[Eastern Asia]] and the [[Pacific Region]] are more complex and depend on location and context. For example, in [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], a heavy importance of what defines a woman comes from the workforce. In these countries, "gender related challenges tend to be related to economic empowerment, employment, and workplace issues, for example related to informal sector workers, feminization of migration flows, work place conditions, and long term social security".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The World Bank. [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20327365~menuPK:502969~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502940,00.html "Gender in East Asia and Pacific"], Social Development. The World Bank, 2013. Web. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in countries who are less economically stable, such as [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Timor Leste]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and some provinces in more remote locations, "women tend to bear the cost of social and domestic conflicts and natural disasters".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Places such as India and Polynesia have widely identified third-gender categories. For example, the [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]/kinnar/kinner people of India are often regarded as being a third-gender. Hijra is often considered an offensive term, so the terms kinnar &amp; kinner are often used for these individuals. In places such as India and Pakistan, these individuals face higher rates of HIV infection, depression, and homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Talwar |first=Rajesh |author-link= |date= 1999 |title= The Third Sex and Human Rights |url= |location= |publisher= Library of Congress - New Delhi Field Office |page= |isbn= 8121206421}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polynesian languages are also consistent with the idea of a third-gender or non-binary gender. The Samoan term ''[[fa'afafine]]'', meaning "in the manner of a woman", is used to refer to a third-gender/non-binary role in society. These sexualities are expressed across a spectrum, although some literature has suggested that ''fa'afafine'' individuals do not form sexual relations with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16909317/ | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | title = A retrospective study of childhood gender-atypical behavior in Samoan fa'afafine| year = 2006 | pmid = 16909317 | last1 = Bartlett | first1 = N.

One issue that remains consistent throughout all provinces in different stages of development is women having a weak voice when it comes to decision-making. One of the reasons for this is the "growing trend to decentralization [which] has moved decision-making down to levels at which women's voice is often weakest and where even the women's civil society movement, which has been a powerful advocate at national level, struggles to organize and be heard".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

East Asia Pacific's approach to help mainstream these issues of gender relies on a three-pillar method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20327365~menuPK:502969~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502940,00.html#EAP_approach | website = The World Bank | title = Gender in East Asia and Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pillar one is partnering with middle-income countries and emerging middle-income countries to sustain and share gains in growth and prosperity. Pillar two supports the developmental underpinnings for peace, renewed growth and poverty reduction in the poorest and most fragile areas. The final pillar provides a stage for knowledge management, exchange and dissemination on gender responsive development within the region to begin. These programs have already been established, and successful in, [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[China]], as well as the [[Philippines]], and efforts are starting to be made in [[Laos]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[Timor Leste]] as well. These pillars speak to the importance of showcasing gender studies.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Judith Butler===
{{Main|Judith Butler}}
{{primary|section|date=March 2023}}
Philosopher and gender studies Judith Butler's work ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' discussed gender performativity. In Butler's terms the performance of gender, sex, and sexuality is about power in society.&lt;ref name="performativity of gender"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 | page = [https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/9 9]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They locate the [[Social constructivism|construction]] of the "gendered, sexed, desiring subject" in "regulative discourses". A part of Butler's argument concerns the role of sex in the construction of "natural" or coherent gender and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UczySqq19AIC|title=Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex|last=Butler|first=Judith|author-link=Judith Butler|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136807183|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their account, gender and heterosexuality are constructed as natural because the opposition of the male and female sexes is perceived as natural in the social imaginary.&lt;ref name="performativity of gender"&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity | title-link = Gender Trouble | year = 1999 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl_628/page/n197 163]–71, 177–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Men's and Women's Beliefs About Gender and Sexuality" is an article written by authors Emily Kane and Mimi Schippers, which explicitly focuses on the social construct of social opposition between men and women. Parallel to Butler's argument, this article also argues that gender is constructed as "natural" within our society when in reality it contains arbitrary aspects. By pointing out distinct differences between gender aspects of both men and women, this article reveals the source of opposition that Butler mentions, arguing that "men and women share a variety of interests based on personal circumstances and on social locations other than gender, but men's and women's gender interests do tend to differ." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kane |first=Emily W. |last2=Schippers |first2=Mimi |date=1996 |title=Men's and Women's Beliefs about Gender and Sexuality |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/189887 |journal=Gender and Society |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=650–665 |issn=0891-2432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Historian and theorist Bryan Palmer argues that gender studies' current reliance on [[post-structuralism]] – with its reification of discourse and avoidance of the structures of oppression and struggles of resistance – obscures the origins, meanings, and consequences of historical events and processes, and he seeks to counter current trends in gender studies with an argument for the necessity to analyze lived experiences and the structures of subordination and power.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Palmer, ''Descent into Discourse: The Reification of Language and the Writing of Social History'', Trent University (Peterborough, Canada) 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Debra W. Soh]] postulates that gender studies is composed of dubious scholarship, that it is an unscientific ideology, and that it causes needless disruption in the lives of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Feminist philosopher [[Rosi Braidotti]] has criticized gender studies as "the take-over of the feminist agenda by studies on masculinity, which results in transferring funding from feminist faculty positions to other kinds of positions. There have been cases... of positions advertised as 'gender studies' being given away to the 'bright boys'. Some of the competitive take-over has to do with gay studies. Of special significance in this discussion is the role of the mainstream publisher Routledge who, in our opinion, is responsible for promoting gender as a way of deradicalizing the feminist agenda, re-marketing masculinity and gay male identity instead."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Feminism by any other name (Judith Butler interviews Rosi Braidotti) | journal = [[Differences (journal)|differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 44–45 | date = Summer 1994 | url = https://bagelabyss.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/butler-and-braidotti-interview-feminism-by-any-other-name1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin Thomas countered that, "as Joseph Allen Boone points out, 'many of the men in the academy who are feminism's most supportive 'allies' ''are'' gay,'" and that it is "disingenuous" to ignore the ways in which mainstream publishers such as Routledge have promoted feminist theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Calvin, ed., "Introduction: Identification, Appropriation, Proliferation", ''Straight with a Twist: Queer Theory and the Subject of Heterosexuality''.

==== Russia ====
In Russia, gender studies is currently tolerated; however, state-supported practices follow the traditional gender perspectives of those in power. The law related to prosecuting and sentencing domestic violence, for instance, was greatly limited in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/09/putins-war-on-women/|title=Putin's War on Women|last=Ferris-Rotman|first=Amie|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, the Russian government has also been leading a campaign at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] to recognise Russian "[[traditional values]]" as a legitimate consideration in human rights protection and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2018/01/15/traditional-values-for-the-99-the-new-gender-ideology-in-russia/|title='Traditional values' for the 99%?

==== Hungary ====
Gender studies programs were banned in Hungary in October 2018. In a statement released by Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]]'s office, a spokesperson stated that "The government's standpoint is that people are born either male or female, and we do not consider it acceptable for us to talk about socially constructed genders rather than biological sexes." The ban has attracted criticism from several European universities which offer the program, among them the Budapest-based [[Central European University]], whose charter was revoked by the government, and is widely seen as part of the [[Fidesz|Hungarian ruling party]]'s move away from democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/hungary-bans-gender-studies-programmes-viktor-orban-central-european-university-budapest-a8599796.html|title=Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban bans gender studies programmes|last=Oppenheim|first=Maya|date=2018-10-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China ====
The [[Central People's Government]] supports studies of gender and social development of gender in history and practices that lead to gender equality. Citing [[Mao Zedong]]'s philosophy, "Women hold up half the sky", this may be seen as continuation of equality of men and women introduced as part of [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/china-voices-lu-ying|title=China voices: the professor of gender studies|last=Branigan|first=Tania|date=2009-05-20|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
