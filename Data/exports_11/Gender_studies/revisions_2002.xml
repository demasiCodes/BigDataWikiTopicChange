Work in gender studies is often associated with work in [[feminist theory]], [[queer theory]], and other theoretical aspects of [[cultural studies]]. While work in gender studies is principally found in humanities departments and publications (in areas such as [[English literature]] and other literary studies), it is also found in social-scientific areas such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]].
