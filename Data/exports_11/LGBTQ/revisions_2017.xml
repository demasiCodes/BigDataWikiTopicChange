{{About|the term LGBT|the history of the movement|LGBT history}}

{{LGBT sidebar}}

'''LGBT''' and '''GLBT''' are [[initialisms]] that stand for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]]. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism '''LGB''', which was used to replace the term ''gay'' in reference to the [[LGBT community]] beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;''Acronyms, Initialisms &amp; Abbreviations Dictionary,'' Volume 1, Part 1.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDtUAAAAMAAJ Factsheet five, Issues 32–36, Mike Gunderloy, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; Activists believed that the term ''[[gay community]]'' did not accurately represent all those to whom it referred.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt;

The initialism has become mainstream as a self-designation; it has been adopted by the majority of [[sexuality and gender identity-based cultures|sexuality and gender identity-based]] community centers and media in the United States, as well as some other [[English-speaking world|English-speaking countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Centerlink|title=2008 Community Center Survey Report|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/file/2008-lgbt-community-center-survey-report.pdf|website=LGBT Movement Advancement Project|accessdate=August 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgja.org/resources/stylebook.html|title=NLGJA Stylebook on LGBT Terminology|author=|date=2008|work=nlgja.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used in dozens of other countries.&lt;ref name=Zak-2013&gt;{{cite web |title=LGBPTTQQIIAA+ — How We Got Here from Gay |last1=Zak |first1=Emily |url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/10/01/lgbpttqqiiaa-how-we-got-here-from-gay/ |date=1 October 2013 |website=Ms. Blog |publisher=[[Liberty Media for Women|Liberty Media]] |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=16 July 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2017}}

The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures. It may be used to refer to anyone who is [[non-heterosexual]] or non-[[cisgender]], instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"/&gt; To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as [[queer]] or are [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] their sexual identity; '''LGBTQ''' has been recorded since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkUEAQAAIAAJ |title=The Santa Cruz County in-queery, Volume 9, Santa Cruz Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgendered Community Center, 1996 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-11-01 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who add [[intersex]] people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism '''LGBTI'''.&lt;ref&gt;William L.

[[File:Palco BolognaPride08.jpg|thumb|LGBT publications, [[pride parade]]s, and related events, such as this stage at [[Bologna]] Pride 2008 in Italy, increasingly drop the ''LGBT'' initialism instead of regularly adding new letters, and dealing with issues of placement of those letters within the new title.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, Sean, and Bryan Kim-Butler.

Before the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary for [[Non-heterosexuals|non-heterosexuality]];{{Dubious |Challenging the history of the term |reason=the term "invert" was used earlier |date=July 2017}} the closest such term, ''[[third gender]]'', traces back to the 1860s but never gained wide acceptance in the United States.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hubert C. (1980) "The "third sex" theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs", ''Journal of Homosexuality''. 1980–1981 Fall–Winter; 6(1–2): pp. 103–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1904.

''Sexual Inversion''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Carpenter|Carpenter, Edward]], 1908.

Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ("Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt;

The first widely used term, ''[[homosexual]]'', originally carried negative connotations. It was replaced by  ''[[homophile]]'' in the 1950s and 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Minton |first=Henry |title=Departing from Deviance |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-226-53043-4 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=cCoADHpbzHsC&amp;pg=PA238 |accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |Challenging the history of the term |reason=The term "homophile" was little used and never replaced "homosexual". |date=July 2017}} and subsequently ''[[gay]]'' in the 1970s; the latter term was adopted first by the homosexual community.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=E.

As [[lesbian]]s forged more public identities, the phrase "gay and lesbian" became more common.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt; The [[Daughters of Bilitis]] folded in 1970 due to disputes over their direction: whether to focus on [[feminism]] or [[gay rights]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Esterberg | first1 = Kristen | year = 1994 | title = From Accommodation to Liberation: A Social Movement Analysis of Lesbians in the Homophile Movement | url = | journal = Gender and Society | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 424–443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As equality was a priority for [[lesbian feminism|lesbian feminists]], disparity of roles between men and women or [[butch and femme]] were viewed as [[patriarchy|patriarchal]]. Lesbian feminists eschewed [[gender role]] play that had been pervasive in bars, as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men; many lesbian feminists refused to work with gay men, or take up their causes.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman, Lillian (1991). ''Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth Century America'', Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-017122-3}}, p. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbians who held a more [[essentialist]] view, that they had been born homosexual and used the descriptor "lesbian" to define sexual attraction, often considered the separatist, angry opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman (1991), p. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Bisexual and transgender people also sought recognition as legitimate categories within the larger minority community.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"&gt;{{cite web | last=Swain | first=Keith W. | title=Gay Pride Needs New Direction | publisher=[[Denver Post]] | date=21 June 2007 |url = http://www.denverpost.com/ci_6198394?source=rss |accessdate= 2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the elation of change following group action in the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]] in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] people.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leli |first=Ubaldo |first2=Jack | last2=Drescher |title=Transgender Subjectivities: A Clinician's Guide |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2005|isbn= 0-7890-2576-0|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=QiJryCzrZmYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first= Jonathan |first2=Karen |last2=Yescavage |title= Bisexuality and Transgenderism: InterSEXions of The Others |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2004|isbn= 1-56023-287-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SOe4igsrbgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics said that transgender people were acting out [[stereotypes]] and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid to [[coming out|come out]] and be honest about their identity.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"/&gt; Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other [[gender]] and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.&lt;ref name="Exhibition Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalgraphics.org/out-of-the-closet |website=[[Center for the Study of Political Graphics]]|accessdate=1 October 2016|title=Out of the Closet and Into the Streets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1988, activists began to use the initialism LGBT in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=PW9JTfOeOtPd4AbR54SjDA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=PiglAQAAIAAJ Research, policy and practice: Annual meeting], American Educational Research Association Verlag AERA, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the 1990s within the movement did gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people gain equal respect .&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; Although the LGBT community has seen much controversy regarding universal acceptance of different member groups (bisexual and transgender individuals, in particular, have sometimes been marginalized by the larger LGBT community), the term ''LGBT'' has been a positive symbol of inclusion.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shankle |first=Michael D. |title=The Handbook of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Public Health: A Practitioner's Guide To Service |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2006|isbn= 1-56023-496-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pUUyLSKD5voC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt;

Despite the fact that ''LGBT'' does not nominally encompass all individuals in smaller communities (see Variants below), the term is generally accepted to include those not specifically identified in the four-letter initialism.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt; Overall, the use of the term ''LGBT'' has, over time, largely aided in bringing otherwise marginalized individuals into the general community.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt; Transgender actress [[Candis Cayne]] in 2009 described the LGBT community "the last great minority", noting that "We can still be harassed openly" and be "called out on television".&lt;ref name="Advocate 2009-03"&gt;{{cite news|title=I Advocate...|date=March 2009|work=[[The Advocate]]|publisher=Issue #1024|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to years of lobbying from users and LGBT groups to eliminate discrimination, the online social networking service [[Facebook]], in February 2014, widened its choice of gender variants for users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/13/transgender-facebook-expands-gender-options |title=Facebook expands gender options: transgender activists hail 'big advance' | date=14 February 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/02/14/confused-by-facebooks-new-gender-options-heres-what-they-mean/ |title=Confused by Facebook's new gender options?

In 2016, [[GLAAD]]'s Media Reference Guide states that ''LGBTQ'' is the preferred initialism, being more inclusive of younger members of the communities who embrace ''[[queer]]'' as a self-descriptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|title=Expanding the Acronym: GLAAD Adds the Q to LGBT|url=http://www.advocate.com/media/2016/10/26/expanding-acronym-glaad-adds-q-lgbt|publisher=Advocate|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many variants exist including variations that change the order of the letters; ''LGBT'' or ''GLBT'' are the most common terms and the ones most frequently seen.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt; Although identical in meaning, ''LGBT'' may have a more [[feminist]] connotation than ''GLBT'' as it places the "L" (for "lesbian") first.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt; ''LGBT'' may also include additional Q's for "[[queer]]" or "[[questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]]" (sometimes abbreviated with a question mark and sometimes used to mean anybody not literally L, G, B or T)  producing the variants "LGBTQ" and "LGBTQQ"".&lt;ref name="In-Between Bodies"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bloodsworth-Lugo | first=Mary K. | title=In-Between Bodies: Sexual Difference, Race, and Sexuality | publisher=SUNY Press | year=2007|isbn= 0-7914-7221-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ph74JKY_5dwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Girls' Violence"&gt;{{cite book | last=Alder | first=Christine | first2=Anne |last2=Worrall | title=Girls' Violence: Myths and Realities | publisher=SUNY Press | year=2004|isbn=0-7914-6110-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O0ye93mW0eUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advocacy Research in "&gt;{{cite book | last=Cherland | first=Meredith Rogers | first2= Helen J. |last2=Harper | title=Advocacy Research in Literacy Education: Seeking Higher Ground | publisher=Routledge | year=2007|isbn= 0-8058-5056-2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ct_5Cf1aH0kC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, it is sometimes stylized as '''LGB&amp;T''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender couples urged to research honeymoon destinations|url=http://ilga.org/lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-couples-urged-research-honeymoon-destinations/ |accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|date=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National LGB&amp;T Partnership|url=http://lgbt.foundation/policy-research/The-National-LGB-T-Partnership/|publisher=The National LGB&amp;T Partnership|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] uses the term '''LGBTIQ''' in its manifesto and official publications.&lt;ref name=LGBTIQGreens&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lgbtiq-greens.greenparty.org.uk/ |title=Green Party LGBT Group Website |publisher=Lgbtiq-greens.greenparty.org.uk |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EqualityForAll&gt;{{cite web|title=EQUALITY FOR ALL|url=https://www.greenparty.org.uk/resources/LGBTIQ_Manifesto_v4%20FINAL.pdf |publisher=Green Party of England and Wales|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PinkNewsLGBTIQGreen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duffy|first1=Nick|title=Green Party wants every teacher to be trained to teach LGBTIQ issues |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/05/01/green-party-wants-every-teacher-to-be-trained-to-teach-lgbtiq-issues/ |accessdate=3 May 2015 |work=[[PinkNews]] |date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order of the letters has not been standardized; in addition to the variations between the positions of the initial "L" or "G", the mentioned, less common letters, if used, may appear in almost any order.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; Initialisms related to LGBTQ people are sometimes referred to as "alphabet soup".&lt;ref name="pugetsoundoff.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pugetsoundoff.org/blog/lgbtqqiaap-alphabet-soup-101|title=LGBTQQIAAP - 'Alphabet Soup 101' |publisher=PugetSoundOff.org |accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeMarco2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/linda-demarco/no-more-alphabet-soup_b_1527958.html |title=No More Alphabet Soup |work=The Huffington Post |date=18 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203014445/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/linda-demarco/no-more-alphabet-soup_b_1527958.html |archive-date= 3 February 2015 |dead-url=no |first1=Linda |last1=DeMarco |first2=Sylvain |last2=Bruni |orig-year=1st pub. 18 May 2012 |id=1527958 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Variant terms do not typically represent political differences within the community, but arise simply from the preferences of individuals and groups.&lt;ref name="Narrative Therapy"&gt;{{cite book | last=Brown | first=Catrina | first2=Tod |last2=Augusta-Scott | title=Narrative Therapy: Making Meaning, Making Lives | publisher=Sage Publications Inc | year= 2006|isbn= 1-4129-0988-0 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=STMieEKGGikC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[pansexual]]'', ''omnisexual'', ''fluid'' and ''queer-identified'' are regarded as falling under the umbrella term ''bisexual'' (and therefore are considered a part of the [[bisexual community]]).

=== Transgender inclusion ===
The gender identity "transgender" has been recategorized to trans* by some groups, where trans (without the asterisk) has been used to describe [[trans men]] and [[trans women]], while trans* covers all non-cisgender ([[genderqueer]]) identities, including transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, [[genderfuck]], genderless, [[agender]], non-gendered, third gender, two-spirit, [[bigender]], and trans man and trans woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/01/10/trans_what_does_it_mean_and_where_did_it_come_from.html |title=What Does Trans* Mean, and Where Did It Come From?' | first=Hugh|last= Ryan| date=10 January 2014 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vadenprd.stanford.edu/special-topics/lgbtq-health/glossary |title=Glossary of Transgender Terms | date=14 February 2014 |work=Vaden Health Center Stanford University|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the term ''transsexual'' commonly falls under the umbrella term ''transgender'', but some transsexual people object to this.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt;

When not inclusive of transgender people, ''LGBT'' is sometimes shortened to ''LGB''.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Psychology and Sexu"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bohan | first=Janis S. | title= Psychology and Sexual Orientation: Coming to Terms | publisher= Routledge | year=1996|isbn=0-415-91514-7| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v5IzSjeq1S8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersex inclusion ===

Some people advocate the term "minority sexual and gender identities" (MSGI, coined in 2000), or ''gender and sexual/sexuality minorities'' (GSM) so as to explicitly include all people who are not [[cisgender]] and [[heterosexual]], or ''gender, sexual, and romantic minorities'' (GSRM) which is more explicitly inclusive of [[Romantic orientation|minority romantic orientations]] and [[polyamory]], but those have not been widely adopted either.&lt;ref name="Bradford Uni"&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome to the Bradford University Minority Sexual and Gender Identity Site! | publisher=Bradford Uni MSGI Society | year=2008 | url =http://lgbt.wikidot.com/ | accessdate=2008-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/Gender,-Sexual,-and-Romantic-Minorities-%28GSRM%29.html|title=GSRM - Gender, Sexual, and Romantic Minorities|publisher=acronymfinder.com|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-suresha/diversities-may-enrich-lgbtqiap-alphabet-soup_b_3929870.html|title='Diversities' May Enrich 'LGBTQIAP' Alphabet Soup|date=19 September 2013|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LGBT?

The [[National Institutes of Health]] have framed LGBT, others "whose sexual orientation and/or gender identity varies, those who may not self-identify as LGBT" and also intersex populations (as persons with [[disorders of sex development]]) as "''sexual and gender minority''" (SGM) populations. This has led to the development of an NIH SGM Health Research Strategic Plan.&lt;ref name="nih2015"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1089/lgbt.2015.0107| issn = 2325-8292| last1 = Alexander| first1 = Rashada| last2 = Parker| first2 = Karen| last3 = Schwetz| first3 = Tara| title = Sexual and Gender Minority Health Research at the National Institutes of Health| journal = LGBT Health| date = October 2015 | url = http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/lgbt.2015.0107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Williams Institute]] has used the same term in a report on an international sustainable development goals, but excluding intersex populations.&lt;ref name="park2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The Williams Institute| last = Park| first = Andrew| title = A Development Agenda for Sexual and Gender Minorities| date = June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In public health settings, ''MSM'' ("[[men who have sex with men]]") is clinically used to describe men who have sex with other men without referring to their sexual orientation, with ''WSW'' ("[[women who have sex with women]]") also used as a corollary.&lt;ref&gt;Young, R M &amp; Meyer, I H (2005) The Trouble with "MSM" and "WSW": Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse American Journal of Public Health July 2005 Vol. 95 No. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glick, M Muzyka, B C Salkin, L M Lurie, D (1994) Necrotizing [[Periodontitis|ulcerative periodontitis]]: a marker for immune deterioration and a predictor for the diagnosis of [[AIDS]] Journal of Periodontology 1994 65 p. 393–397.&lt;/ref&gt;
