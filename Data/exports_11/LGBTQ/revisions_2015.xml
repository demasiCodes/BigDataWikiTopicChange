'''LGBT''' or '''GLBT''' is an [[initialism]] that stands for [[lesbian|'''l'''esbian]], [[gay|'''g'''ay]], [[bisexuality|'''b'''isexual]], and [[transgender|'''t'''ransgender]]. In use since the 1990s, the term is an adaptation of the initialism '''LGB''', which was used to replace the term ''gay'' in reference to the [[LGBT community]] beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;''Acronyms, Initialisms &amp; Abbreviations Dictionary,'' Volume 1, Part 1.

The initialism LGBT is intended to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures. It may be used to refer to anyone who is [[non-heterosexual]] or non-[[cisgender]], instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"/&gt; To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as [[queer]] or are [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] their sexual identity; '''LGBTQ''' has been recorded since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkUEAQAAIAAJ |title=The Santa Cruz County in-queery, Volume 9, Santa Cruz Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgendered Community Center, 1996 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-11-01 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[intersex]] people who want to be included in LGBT groups suggest an extended initialism '''LGBTI.'''&lt;ref&gt;William L.

Whether or not LGBT people openly identify themselves may depend on local political concerns and whether they live in a discriminatory environment, as well as on the status of [[LGBT rights]] where they live.&lt;ref name=betterhealth1&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay and lesbian issues - discrimination|url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Gay_and_lesbian_issues_discrimination|website=betterhealth.vic.gov.au|publisher=Better Health Channel|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research, conducted anonymously and online and including the 'Q' category, found that more adolescents and young adults identified as 'Q' (questioning) compared with other LGBTI categories.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, K. M. (2013). Sexuality and suicidality: Matched-pairs analyses reveal unique characteristics in non-heterosexual suicidal behaviors.

{{further|Terminology of homosexuality}}
Before the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, there was no common non-derogatory vocabulary for [[Non-heterosexuals|non-heterosexuality]]; the closest such term, ''[[third gender]]'', traces back to the 1860s but never gained wide acceptance in the United States.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hubert C. (1980) "The "third sex" theory of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs", ''Journal of Homosexuality''. 1980–1981 Fall–Winter; 6(1–2): pp. 103–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1904. ''Berlins Drittes Geschlecht'' ("Berlin's Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Havelock Ellis|Ellis, Havelock]] and [[John Addington Symonds|Symonds, J. A.]], 1897. ''Sexual Inversion''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Carpenter|Carpenter, Edward]], 1908. ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/carpenter-is.html The Intermediate Sex: A Study of Some Transitional Types of Men and Women]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duc, Aimée, 1901. ''Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ("Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex")&lt;/ref&gt;

The first widely used term, ''[[homosexual]]'', originally carried negative connotations. It was replaced by  ''[[homophile]]'' in the 1950s and 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Minton |first=Henry |title=Departing from Deviance |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-226-53043-4 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=cCoADHpbzHsC&amp;pg=PA238 |accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently ''[[gay]]'' in the 1970s; the latter term was adopted first by the homosexual community.&lt;ref name="The Social Studies C"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=E. Wayne |title=The Social Studies Curriculum: Purposes, Problems, and Possibilities |publisher=SUNY Press |year=2006|isbn= 0-7914-6909-3 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4qFMqjxte9IC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lars Ullerstam promoted use of the term [[sexual minority]] in the 1960s,&lt;small&gt;([[:sv:Lars Ullerstam|sv]])&lt;/small&gt; as an analogy to the term [[ethnic minority]] for non-whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ullerstam|first1=Lars|title=The Erotic Minorities: A Swedish View|date=1967|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=whGGAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[lesbian]]s forged more public identities, the phrase "gay and lesbian" became more common.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt; The [[Daughters of Bilitis]] folded in 1970 due to disputes over their direction: whether to focus on [[feminism]] or [[gay rights]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;Esterberg, Kristen (September, 1994). "From Accommodation to Liberation: A Social Movement Analysis of Lesbians in the Homophile Movement." ''Gender and Society'', '''8''', (3) p. 424–443.&lt;/ref&gt; As equality was a priority for [[lesbian feminism|lesbian feminists]], disparity of roles between men and women or [[butch and femme]] were viewed as patriarchal. Lesbian feminists eschewed [[gender role]] play that had been pervasive in bars, as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men; many lesbian feminists refused to work with gay men, or take up their causes.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman, Lillian (1991). ''Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth Century America'', Penguin Books. ISBN 0-14-017122-3, p. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbians who held a more [[essentialist]] view, that they had been born homosexual and used the descriptor "lesbian" to define sexual attraction, often considered the separatist, angry opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman (1991), p. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Bisexual and transgender people also sought recognition as legitimate categories within the larger minority community.&lt;ref name="Gay Pride Nee"/&gt;

After the elation of change following group action in the [[Stonewall riots]] in New York, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some gays and lesbians became less accepting of [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] people.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leli |first=Ubaldo |first2=Jack | last2=Drescher |title=Transgender Subjectivities: A Clinician's Guide |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2005|isbn= 0-7890-2576-0|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=QiJryCzrZmYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first= Jonathan |first2=Karen |last2=Yescavage |title= Bisexuality and Transgenderism: InterSEXions of The Others |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2004|isbn= 1-56023-287-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SOe4igsrbgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics said that transgender people were acting out [[stereotypes]] and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid to [[coming out|come out]] and be honest about their identity.&lt;ref name="Transgender Subjectivities"/&gt; Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other [[gender]] and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day.&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt;

From about 1988, activists began to use the initialism LGBT in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=PW9JTfOeOtPd4AbR54SjDA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=PiglAQAAIAAJ Research, policy and practice: Annual meeting], American Educational Research Association Verlag AERA, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the 1990s within the movement did gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people gain equal respect .&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; Although the LGBT community has seen much controversy regarding universal acceptance of different member groups (bisexual and transgender individuals, in particular, have sometimes been marginalized by the larger LGBT community), the term ''LGBT'' has been a positive symbol of inclusion.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shankle |first=Michael D. |title=The Handbook of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Public Health: A Practitioner's Guide To Service |publisher=Haworth Press |year=2006|isbn= 1-56023-496-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pUUyLSKD5voC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; Despite the fact that ''LGBT'' does not nominally encompass all individuals in smaller communities (see Variants below), the term is generally accepted to include those not specifically identified in the four-letter initialism.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; Overall, the use of the term ''LGBT'' has, over time, largely aided in bringing otherwise marginalized individuals into the general community.&lt;ref name="The Handbook of Lesb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bisexuality and Transgend"/&gt; Transgender actress [[Candis Cayne]] in 2009 described the LGBT community "the last great minority", noting that "We can still be harassed openly" and be "called out on television."&lt;ref name="Advocate 2009-03"&gt;{{cite news|title=I Advocate...|date=March 2009|work=[[The Advocate]]|publisher=Issue #1024|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to years of lobbying from users and LGBT groups to eliminate discrimination, the online social networking service [[Facebook]], in February 2014, widened its choice of gender variants for users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/13/transgender-facebook-expands-gender-options |title=Facebook expands gender options: transgender activists hail 'big advance' | date=14 February 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/02/14/confused-by-facebooks-new-gender-options-heres-what-they-mean/ |title=Confused by Facebook's new gender options?

The terms ''[[pansexual]]'', ''omnisexual'', ''fluid'' and ''queer-identified'' are regarded as falling under the umbrella term ''bisexual'' (and therefore are considered a part of the [[bisexual community]]).
