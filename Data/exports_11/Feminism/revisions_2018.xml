'''Feminism''' is a range of [[political movement]]s, [[ideologies]], and [[social movement]]s that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social [[Gender equality|equality of sexes]].&lt;ref name="Hawkesworth"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hawkesworth | first=Mary E.|title=Globalization and Feminist Activism |year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |pages=25–27 |isbn=9780742537835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beasley"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Beasley |first=Chris |title=What is Feminism? |year=1999|publisher=Sage |location=New York |pages=3–11 |isbn=9780761963356}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men.

[[Feminist movement]]s have campaigned and continue to campaign for [[women's rights]], including the right to [[Women's suffrage|vote]], to hold public office, [[Right to work|to work]], to earn fair [[wages]] or [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]], to [[Right to property|own property]], [[Right to education|to receive education]], to enter contracts, to have equal rights within [[marriage]], and to have [[maternity leave]]. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and [[social integration]], and to protect women and girls from [[rape]], [[sexual harassment]], and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="Echols"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Echols |first=Alice |authorlink=Alice Echols |title=Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975 |year=1989 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-1787-6 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical [[Social change|societal changes]] for [[women's rights]], particularly in [[Western world|the West]], where they are near-universally credited with achieving [[women's suffrage]], [[gender neutrality in English]], [[reproductive rights]] for women (including access to [[contraceptive]]s and [[support for the legalization of abortion|abortion]]), and the right to enter into contracts and [[property|own property]].&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Messer-Davidow |first=Ellen |title=Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse |year=2002 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, [[North Carolina|NC]] |isbn=978-0-8223-2843-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including [[bell hooks]], argue for the inclusion of [[men's liberation]] within its aims because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name="hooks"/&gt;
[[Feminist theory]], which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.&lt;ref name="Chodorow1989"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Chodorow, Nancy |title=Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory |year=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=978-0-300-05116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gilligan1977"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |year=1977 |title=In a Different Voice: Women's Conceptions of Self and of Morality|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=47|issue=4 |pages=481–517|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-47,-issue-4/herarticle/women-s-conceptions-of-self-and-of-morality_917 |accessdate=8 June 2008 |doi=10.17763/haer.47.4.g6167429416hg5l0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of feminism have been [[feminism#Civil rights movement and anti-racism|criticized]] for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives. This criticism led to the creation of ethnically specific or [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] forms of feminism, including [[black feminism]] and [[Intersectionality|intersectional feminism]].&lt;ref name=Weedon/&gt;

[[Charles Fourier]], a [[Utopian socialism|Utopian Socialist]] and French philosopher, is credited with having coined the word "féminisme" in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Leslie F.|year=1982|title=Early Feminist Themes in French Utopian Socialism: The St.-Simonians and Fourier|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=43|issue=1|pages=91–108|doi=10.2307/2709162|jstor=2709162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words "féminisme" ("feminism") and "féministe" ("feminist") first appeared in [[Feminism in France|France]] and the [[Feminism in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] in 1872,&lt;ref&gt;Dutch feminist pioneer [[Mina Kruseman]] in a letter to Alexandre Dumas – in: Maria Grever, Strijd tegen de stilte.

The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] comprised women's suffrage movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, promoting women's right to vote. The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] was associated with the ideas and actions of the [[women's liberation movement]] beginning in the 1960s. The second wave campaigned for legal and social equality for women. The [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] is a continuation of, and a reaction to, the perceived failures of second-wave feminism, which began in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Suffragettes to Grrls"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krolokke |first1=Charlotte |first2=Anne Scott |last2=Sorensen |title=Gender Communication Theories and Analyses: From Silence to Performance |year=2005 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-2918-5 |page=24 |chapter=Three Waves of Feminism: From Suffragettes to Grrls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] which introduced the [[Tender years doctrine]] for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wroath|first=John|title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights|year=1998|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=1 872 870 57 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=L.

For example, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] passed legislation in 1884, [[New South Wales]] in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's [[suffrage]], though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's [[Sexual and reproductive health and rights|sexual]], [[reproductive rights|reproductive]], and [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]] as well.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464&gt;{{cite book |author=Freedman, Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back : The History of Feminism and the Future of Women |year=2003 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-45053-1 |page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's suffrage]] (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) began in Britain's [[Australasia]]n colonies at the close of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of [[Feminism in New Zealand|New Zealand]] granting women the [[right to vote]] in 1893 and South Australia granting female suffrage in 1895. This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/votes-women |title=Votes for Women Electoral Commission|publisher=Elections New Zealand |date=13 April 2005 |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm|title=Women and the right to vote in Australia|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] the Suffragettes and the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies|Suffragists]] campaigned for the women's vote, and in 1918 the [[Representation of the People Act 1918|Representation of the People Act]] was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property. In 1928 this was extended to all women over 21.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book |author=Phillips, Melanie |title=The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement and the Ideas Behind it |year=2004 |publisher=Abacus |location=London |isbn=978-0-349-11660-0 |pages=1–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] was the most notable activist in England, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' naming her one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 Most Important People of the 20th Century]] stating: "she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Emmeline Pankhurst&amp;nbsp;– Time 100 People of the Century |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991250,00.html |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |accessdate= |first=Marina |last=Warner |date=14 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., notable leaders of this movement included [[Lucretia Mott]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Susan B. Anthony]], who each campaigned for the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] prior to championing women's right to vote. These women were influenced by the [[Quaker]] theology of spiritual equality, which asserts that men and women are equal under God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruether|first=Rosemary Radford|title=Women and Redemption: A Theological History|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8006-9816-4|pages=112–18, 136–39|edition=2nd|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, first-wave feminism is considered to have ended with the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1919), granting women the right to vote in all states. The term ''first wave'' was coined retroactively to categorize these western movements after the term ''second-wave feminism'' began to be used to describe a newer feminist movement that focused on fighting social and cultural inequalities, as well political inequalities.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;&lt;ref name= DuBois&gt;{{cite book |author=DuBois, Ellen Carol |title=Harriot Stanton Blatch and the Winning of Woman Suffrage |year=1997 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=978-0-300-06562-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flexner&gt;{{cite book |last=Flexner |first=Eleanor |title=Century of Struggle: The Woman's Rights Movement in the United States |publisher=The Belknap Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-674-10653-6 |pages=xxviii–xxx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Wheeler&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheeler |first=Marjorie W. |title=One Woman, One Vote: Rediscovering the Woman Suffrage Movement |year=1995 |publisher=NewSage Press |location=Troutdale, OR |isbn=978-0-939165-26-1 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stevens |first1=Doris |last2=O'Hare |first2=Carol |title=Jailed for Freedom: American Women Win the Vote |year=1995 |publisher=NewSage Press |location=Troutdale, OR |isbn=978-0-939165-25-4 |pages=1–388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nawar al-Hassan Golley, Arab feminism was closely connected with [[Arab nationalism]]. In 1899, [[Qasim Amin]], considered the "father" of Arab feminism, wrote ''The Liberation of Women'', which argued for legal and social reforms for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stange |first1=Mary Zeiss |first2=Carol K. |last2=Oyster |first3=Jane E. |last3=Sloan |title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World |publisher=SAGE |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4129-7685-5 |pages=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew links between women's position in Egyptian society and nationalism, leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement.&lt;ref name=Golley&gt;{{cite book |last=Golley |first=Nawar Al-Hassan |title=Reading Arab women's autobiographies: Shahrazad tells her story |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2003 |pages=30–50 |isbn=978-0-292-70545-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 [[Hoda Shaarawi]] founded the [[Egyptian Feminist Union]], became its president and a symbol of the Arab women's rights movement.&lt;ref name=Golley/&gt;

The [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] in 1905 triggered the [[Iranian women's movement]], which aimed to achieve women's equality in [[Iranian gender restrictions in education|education]], marriage, careers, and [[Women's rights in Iran|legal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ettehadieh |first=Mansoureh |authorlink=Mansoureh Ettehadieh |year=2004 |chapter=The Origins and Development of the Women's Movement in Iran, 1906–41 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tLRgXf_e_CEC&amp;pg=PA85 |pages=85–106 |title=Women in Iran from 1800 to the Islamic Republic |editor1-first=Lois |editor1-last=Beck |editor2-first=Guity |editor2-last=Nashat |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-07189-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the [[Iranian revolution]] of 1979, many of the rights that [[Women in Iran|women]] had gained from the women's movement were systematically abolished, such as the [[Iran's Family Protection Law|Family Protection Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chronology of Events Regarding Women in Iran since the Revolution of 1979 |title=Iran since the Revolution |first=Elham |last=Gheytanchi |series=Social Research, Volume 67, No. 2 |year=2000 |editor1-first=Arien |editor1-last=Mack |url=http://www.iranchamber.com/society/articles/chronology_events_women_iran.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Women in France|France]], women obtained the [[Women's suffrage#France|right to vote]] only with the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] of 21 April 1944. The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by [[Fernand Grenier]], they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote. Grenier's proposition was adopted 51 to 16. In May 1947, following the [[French legislative election, November 1946|November 1946 elections]], the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the "[[gender differences|gender gap]]", stating in ''[[Le Populaire]]'' that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes. During the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] period, feminism waned in importance. Wars (both World War I and World War II) had seen the provisional emancipation of some women, but post-war periods signalled the return to conservative roles.&lt;ref name=Bard&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christine |last=Bard |url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/index.php?numero=01&amp;rub=dossier&amp;item=7 |title=Les premières femmes au Gouvernement (France, 1936–1981) |trans-title=First Women in Government (France, 1936–1981) |journal=[[Histoire@Politique]] |issue=1 |date=May–June 2007 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mid-twentieth century ===
By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, women still lacked some significant rights. Feminists in these countries continued to fight for voting rights. In [[Women in Switzerland|Switzerland]], women gained the [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland|right to vote]] in federal [[Elections in Switzerland|elections]] in 1971;&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=United Nations press release of a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), issued on 14 January 2003 |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Liechtenstein]], women were given the right to vote by the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]].

Feminists continued to campaign for the reform of [[family law]]s which gave husbands control over their wives. Although by the 20th century [[coverture]] had been abolished in the UK and the US, in many [[continental European]] countries married women still had very few rights. For instance, in France married women did not receive the right to work without their husband's permission until 1965.&lt;ref name=Guillaumin&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillaumin|first=Colette|year=1994 |title=Racism, Sexism, Power, and Ideology |pages=193–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meltzer&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Françoise |year=1995 |title=Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have also worked to abolish the [[marital rape|"marital exemption" in rape laws]] which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{cite book |last=Allison |first=Julie A. |year=1995 |title=Rape: The Misunderstood Crime |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier efforts by first-wave feminists such as [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], [[Victoria Woodhull]] and [[Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy]] to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed;&lt;ref name=Bland&gt;{{cite book |last=Bland |first=Lucy |year=2002 |title=Banishing the Beast: Feminism, Sex and Morality |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cl8nLdfgz1IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |accessdate=August 25, 2013 |pages=135–49|isbn=9781860646812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1040-0656 | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 54–68 [60] | last = Palczewski | first = Catherine Helen | title = Voltairine de Cleyre: Sexual Slavery and Sexual Pleasure in the Nineteenth Century | journal = NWSA Journal | date = 1995-10-01 | jstor = 4316402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was only achieved a century later in most Western countries, but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowell |first1=Nancy A. |last2=Burgess |first2=Ann W. |year=1997 |title=Understanding Violence Against Women |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] provided a [[Marxist]] solution and an [[existentialist]] view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' (''[[The Second Sex]]'') in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bergoffen |first=Debra |title=Simone de Beauvoir |date=16 August 2010 |origyear=17 August 2004 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/ |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice.

Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;

Second-wave feminists see women's cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures. The feminist activist and author [[Carol Hanisch]] coined the slogan "The Personal is Political", which became synonymous with the second wave.&lt;ref name=Echols/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanisch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |title=Hanisch, New Intro to 'The Personal is Political' – Second Wave and Beyond |accessdate=8 June 2008 |last=Hanisch |first=Carol |date=1 January 2006 |website=The Personal Is Political |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515014413/http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |archivedate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second- and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of women's roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women's equality has actually been fully achieved.&lt;ref name="Dooling" /&gt;

In 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Feminism in Egypt|Egypt]] initiated "[[state feminism]]", which outlawed [[Human rights in Egypt#Status of women|discrimination based on gender]] and granted women's suffrage, but also blocked political [[activism]] by feminist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badran |first=Margot |title=Feminists, Islam, and nation: gender and the making of modern Egypt |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-691-02605-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]]'s presidency, his wife, [[Jehan Sadat]], publicly advocated further women's rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equality with the new [[Islamist]] movement and growing conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Bonnie G. |title=Global feminisms since 1945 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-18491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, [[Islamic feminism]], which argues for women's equality within an Islamic framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2004/16-31Jan04-Print-Edition/1631200425.htm |title=Islamic feminism means justice to women |website= The Mili Gazette |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Feminism in Latin America|Latin America]], revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as [[Role of women in Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]], where [[feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution]] aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.&lt;ref name="parpart"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parpart |first=Jane L. |last2=Connelly |first2=M.

In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]]'s book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' was published and helped voice the discontent that American women felt. The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/us/betty-friedan-who-ignited-cause-in-feminine-mystique-dies-at-85.html|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85|date=5 February 2006|author=Margalit Fox|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's success also meant that Friedan could lecture her views while she was on tour in 1970.

==== Third-wave feminism ====
{{main|Third-wave feminism}}
[[File:Lozu mont oct8 bellhooooooooks.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Feminist, author and social activist [[bell hooks]] (b. 1952).]]
[[Third-wave feminism]] is traced to the emergence of the [[Riot grrrl]] feminist [[punk subculture]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Feliciano (New York Public Library, 2013): "The emergence of the Riot Grrrl movement began in the early 1990s, when a group of women in Olympia, Washington, held a meeting to discuss how to address sexism in the punk scene. The women decided they wanted to start a 'girl riot' against a society they felt offered no validation of women's experiences. And thus the Riot Grrrl movement was born."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feliciano|first1=Steve|title=The Riot Grrrl Movement|url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/06/19/riot-grrrl-movement|publisher=New York Public Library|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Anita Hill]]'s televised testimony in 1991—to an all-male, all-white [[Senate Judiciary Committee]]—that [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]], nominated for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], had [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] her. The term ''third wave'' is credited to [[Rebecca Walker]], who responded to Thomas's appointment to the Supreme Court with an article in ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine, "Becoming the Third Wave" (1992).&lt;ref name="MsMagazineThirdWave"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Walker| first1 = Rebecca | authorlink1 = Rebecca Walker| editor-last=| editor-first =| editor-link=| title = Becoming the Third Wave| journal = [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]| issue = | pages = 39–41| issn = 0047-8318| oclc = 194419734|date= January 1992|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2002/BecomingThirdWaveRebeccaWalker.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumgardner_Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manifesta: Young Women, Feminism, and the Future |last1=Baumgardner |first1=Jennifer |author1-link=Jennifer Baumgardner |last2=Richards |first2=Amy |author2-link=Amy Richards |year=2000 |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-52622-1 |p=77|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote:

{{quote|So I write this as a plea to all women, especially women of my generation: Let Thomas’ confirmation serve to remind you, as it did me, that the fight is far from over.

I am the Third Wave.&lt;ref name="MsMagazineThirdWave"/&gt;}}

Third-wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave's [[Essentialism|essentialist]] definitions of [[femininity]], which, third-wave feminists argued, over-emphasized the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focused on "[[wikt:micropolitics|micro-politics]]" and challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what was, or was not, good for women, and tended to use a [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Astrid |title=Not my mother's sister: generational conflict and third-wave feminism |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-21713-4 |pages=1–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillis |first1=Stacy |last2=Howie |first2=Gillian |last3=Munford |first3=Rebecca |title=Third wave feminism: a critical exploration |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-0-230-52174-2 |pages=xxviii, 275–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faludi&gt;{{cite book |last=Faludi |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Faludi |title=Backlash: the undeclared war against women |year=1992 |publisher=Vintage |location=London |isbn=978-0-09-922271-2}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks]], [[Chela Sandoval]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities.&lt;ref name=Gillis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leslie |first1=Heywood |last2=Drake |first2=Jennifer |title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism |year=1997 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-3005-9}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-wave feminism also contained internal debates between [[difference feminism|difference feminists]], who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to [[social conditioning]].&lt;ref name=Gilligan&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |authorlink=Carol Gilligan |title=In a different voice: psychological theory and women's development |year=1993 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-44544-4 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Standpoint theory ====
Standpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view that believes a persons' social position influences their knowledge.  This perspective argues that research and theory treats women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = standpoint theory {{!}} feminism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/standpoint-theory|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, [[Standpoint feminism|standpoint feminists]] have argued that the feminist movement should address [[global issue]]s (such as rape, [[incest]], and prostitution) and culturally specific issues (such as [[female genital mutilation]] in some parts of [[Women in Africa|Africa]] and [[Women in Arab societies|Arab societies]], as well as [[glass ceiling]] practices that impede women's advancement in developed economies) in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, [[homophobia]], [[classism]] and [[colonization]] in a "[[matrix of domination]]".&lt;ref name="BFT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harding2003&gt;{{cite book |last=Harding |first=Sandra |authorlink=Sandra Harding |title=The Feminist Standpoint Theory Reader: Intellectual and Political Controversies |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-94501-1 |pages=1–16, 67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fourth-wave feminism ====
{{main|Fourth-wave feminism}}
[[Fourth-wave feminism]] refers to a resurgence of interest in feminism that began around 2012 and is associated with the use of [[social media]].&lt;ref name=4thWave-Guardian20131210/&gt; According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to [[sexual harassment]] and [[violence against women]]. Its essence, she writes, is "incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Chamberlain|first=Prudence|title=The Feminist Fourth Wave: Affective Temporality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AIkDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=2017|publisher=Springer|location=Cham|isbn=978-3-319-53682-8|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology", according to [[Kira Cochrane]], and is characterized particularly by the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]], and blogs such as [[Feministing]] to challenge [[misogyny]] and further [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|website=NOW Toronto|publisher=|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"/&gt;

Issues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include [[street harassment|street]] and [[workplace harassment]], [[campus sexual assault]] and [[rape culture]]. Scandals involving the harassment, abuse, and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement. These have included the 2012 [[2012 Delhi gang rape|Delhi gang rape]], 2012 [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|Jimmy Savile allegations]], the [[Bill Cosby sexual assault case|Bill Cosby allegations]], 2014 [[2014 Isla Vista killings|Isla Vista killings]], 2016 [[trial of Jian Ghomeshi]], 2017 [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein allegations]] and subsequent [[Weinstein effect]], and the 2017 [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals|Westminster sexual scandals]].&lt;ref&gt;For Cosby, Ghomeshi, #MeToo, and fourth wave, see Matheson, Kelsey (17 October 2017).

==== Post-feminism ====
The term [[post-feminism]] is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s. While not being "anti-feminist", post-feminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third and fourth wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Elizabeth |title=Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) |year=2000 |publisher=Totem Books |isbn=978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other post-feminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modleski |first=Tania |title=Feminism without women: culture and criticism in a 'postfeminist' age |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-90416-2 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Amelia |chapter=Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art |title=New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action |editor1-first=Joana |editor1-last=Frueh |editor2-first=Cassandra L. |editor2-last=Langer |editor3-first=Arlene |editor3-last=Raven |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1994 |pages=16–41, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Chunn notes a "blaming narrative" under the post-feminist moniker, where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for [[gender equality]] in a "post-feminist" society, where "gender equality has (already) been achieved." According to Chunn, "many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them."&lt;ref&gt;Chunn, D. (2007).

While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, [[stereotyping]], [[objectification]] (especially [[sexual objectification]]), [[oppression]], and [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name=Chodorow1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=gilligan1977/&gt;
In the field of [[literary criticism]], [[Elaine Showalter]] describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls "feminist critique", in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls "[[gynocriticism]]", in which the "woman is producer of textual meaning". The last phase she calls "gender theory", in which the "ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored".&lt;ref name=showalter1979&gt;{{cite book |last1=Showalter |first1=Elaine |authorlink1=Elaine Showalter |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Jacobus |title=Women Writing about Women |year=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-85664-745-1 |pages=25–36 |chapter=Towards a Feminist Poetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was paralleled in the 1970s by [[French structuralist feminism|French feminists]], who developed the concept of ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (which translates as 'female or feminine writing').&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; [[Helene Cixous]] argues that writing and philosophy are ''[[Wikt:phallocentric|phallocentric]]'' and along with other French feminists such as [[Luce Irigaray]] emphasize "writing from the body" as a subversive exercise.&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; The work of [[Julia Kristeva]], a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, and [[Bracha Ettinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, 'The Matrixial Borderspace'.

Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years.

=== Political movements ===
Some branches of feminism closely track the political leanings of the larger society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. [[Liberal feminism]] seeks individualistic equality of men and women through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality.&lt;ref name="rotten"/&gt; Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;Catherine Rottenberg, "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09502386.2013.857361 The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism]", Cultural Studies. (2014) Vol. 28 (3), pgs. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radical feminism]] considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary.&lt;ref name="Echols" /&gt; [[List of conservative feminisms|Conservative feminism]] is conservative relative to the society in which it resides. [[Individualist feminism|Libertarian feminism]] conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-liberal/#ClasCri |title=Liberal Feminism |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Separatist feminism]] does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist.&lt;ref name="hooks"&gt;{{cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |authorlink=Bell hooks |year=2000 |title=Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics |publisher=[[South End Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-629-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eco-feminist|Ecofeminists]] see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the [[ecology|natural environment]]; ecofeminism has been criticized for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.&lt;ref name="Biehl"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Biehl |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Biehl |title=Rethinking eco-feminist politics |year=1991 |publisher=[[South End Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-392-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materialist ideologies ===
[[Rosemary Hennessy]] and Chrys Ingraham say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of different (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Hennessy |first= Rosemary |first2=Chrys |last2=Ingraham |title=Materialist feminism: a reader in class, difference, and women's lives |location= London |publisher=Routledge | pages=1–13 |isbn=978-0-415-91634-9 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist feminism]] argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies.&lt;ref name="Bottomore"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bottomore, T.B. |title=A Dictionary of Marxist thought |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | page=215 |isbn=978-0-631-18082-1 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist feminism]] distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Socialist-Feminism.html |title=What is Socialist Feminism? |author=Barbara Ehrenreich |publisher=feministezine.com |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcha-feminism|Anarcha-feminists]] believe that [[class struggle]] and [[anarchism|anarchy]] against the [[State (polity)|state]]&lt;ref name="farrow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dunbar-Ortiz |first=Roxanne |title=Quiet Rumours |publisher=AK Press |isbn=978-1-902593-40-1 |year=2002 |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.

=== Black and postcolonial ideologies ===
[[Sara Ahmed]] argues that [[Black feminism|Black]] and [[Postcolonial feminism|Postcolonial]] feminisms pose a challenge "to some of the organizing premises of Western feminist thought."&lt;ref name="Ahmed"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ahmed, Sarta |title= Transformations: thinking through feminism |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-22066-8 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; During much of its [[history of feminism|history]], feminist movements and [[Feminism#Theoretical schools|theoretical developments]] were led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walker, Alice |title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose |year=1983 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |isbn=978-0-15-144525-7 |page=397|title-link=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFT"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill Collins |first=P. |title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |pages=1–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Narayan"/&gt; However women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms.&lt;ref name="BFT" /&gt; This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the collapse of European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in [[Third World|developing nations]] and [[postcolonialism|former colonies]] and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms.&lt;ref name="Narayan" /&gt; [[Womanism]]&lt;ref name="Ogunyemi"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/494200 |title=Womanism: The Dynamics of the Contemporary Black Female Novel in English |year=1985 |last1=Ogunyemi |first1=Chikwenye Okonjo |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=63–80 |jstor=3174287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolawole"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Kolawole, Mary Ebun Modupe |title=Womanism and African Consciousness |year=1997 |publisher=Africa World Press |location=Trenton, N.J. |isbn=978-0-86543-540-7 |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle-class.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless.&lt;ref name=Weedon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weedon |first=Chris |title=Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective |year=2002 |url=http://www.genderforum.org/issues/genderealisations/key-issues-in-postcolonial-feminism-a-western-perspective/ |journal=Gender Forum |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002056/http://www.genderforum.org/issues/genderealisations/key-issues-in-postcolonial-feminism-a-western-perspective/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Third-world feminism]] and [[Indigenous feminism]] are closely related to postcolonial feminism.&lt;ref name="Narayan"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Narayan |first=Uma |title=Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third-World Feminism |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91418-5 |pages=20–28, 113, 161–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism, motherism,&lt;ref name="Acholonu"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Obianuju Acholonu |first=Catherine |title=Motherism: The Afrocentric Alternative to Feminism |year=1995 |publisher=Afa Publ. |isbn=978-978-31997-1-2 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiwanism,&lt;ref name="Ogundipe-Leslie"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ogundipe-Leslie |first=Molara |title=Re-creating Ourselves: African Women &amp; Critical Transformations |year=1994 |publisher=Africa World Press |isbn=978-0-86543-412-7 |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; negofeminism,&lt;ref name="Nnaemeka"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nnaemeka |first=Obioma |title=Feminism, Rebellious Women, and Cultural Boundaries: Rereading Flora Nwapa and Her Compatriots |journal=Research in African Literatures |year=1995 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=80–113 |jstor=3820273}}&lt;/ref&gt; femalism, [[transnational feminism]], and [[Africana womanism]].&lt;ref name="Hudson-Weems"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hudson-Weems |first=Clenora |title=Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves |year=1994 |publisher=Bedford Publishers |location=Troy, Mich. |isbn=978-0-911557-11-4 |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transgender people ===
{{Main|Feminist views on transgender topics}}
Feminist views on transgender people differ. Some feminists do not view [[trans women]] as women,&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterjreilly/2013/06/15/cathy-brennan-on-radfem-2013/ | title=Cathy Brennan On Radfem 2013 | website=[[Forbes]] | date=June 15, 2013 | accessdate=April 18, 2014 | author=Reilly, Peter J}}&lt;/ref&gt; believing that they have [[male privilege]] due to their [[sex assignment]] at birth.&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberg|first1=Michelle|title=What Is a Woman?|journal=The New Yorker|date=August 4, 2014|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some feminists reject "transgenderism" due to views that all behavioral differences between genders are a result of [[socialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/06/21/55123/ | title=The Emperor's New Penis | publisher=[[CounterPunch]] | date=21–23 June 2013 | accessdate=27 August 2014 | author=Keith, Lierre | quote=Female socialization is a process of psychologically constraining and breaking girls—otherwise known as "grooming"—to create a class of compliant victims.

==Demographics==
According to 2015 poll, 18 percent of Americans consider themselves feminists, while 85 percent reported they believe in "equality for women". Despite the popular belief in equal rights, 52 percent did not identify as feminist, 26 percent were unsure, and four percent provided no response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Allum |first=Cynthia  |date=9 April 2015 |title=82 percent of Americans don't consider themselves feminists, poll shows |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/04/09/82-percent-of-americans-dont-consider-themselves-feminists-poll-shows/ |accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2014 [[Ipsos]] poll covering 15 developed countries, 53 percent of respondents identified as feminists, and 87% agreed that "women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency, not their gender". However, only 55% of women agreed that they have "full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations".&lt;ref name=ipsos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=6511 |last=Clark |first=Julia |title= Can Men Be Feminists Too? Half (48%) of Men in 15 Country Survey Seem to Think So |year=2014 |accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among women, some of the strongest support for feminism was found in Sweden, where one in three (36%) agreed very much that they defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by women in Italy (31%) and Argentina (29%). Those in the middle of the ranking were from Great Britain (22%), Spain (22%), United States (20%), Australia (18%), Belgium (18%), France (18%), Canada (17%), Poland (17%), and Hungary (15%). Women least likely to agree very much were from Japan (8%), Germany (7%) and South Korea (7%).&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

One quarter of men in Italy (25%) and Argentina (25%), and two in ten of those in Poland (21%) and France (19%), defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by those from Sweden (17%), Spain (16%), the United States (16%), Canada (15%), Great Britain (14%), Hungary (12%), Belgium (11%) and Australia (10%). Men least likely to identify this way were from South Korea (7%), Germany (3%) and Japan (3%).&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

Women were more likely to self-identify as being feminists than men in every country in the study except for Poland, where 21% of men were and only 17% of women were likely to agree very much with the statement, and South Korea, where there was no difference between men and women (7%) on this measure.&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

== Sexuality ==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexuality}}
[[Feminist views on sexuality]] vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the [[sex industry]], sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the [[feminist sex wars]], which pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.&lt;ref name=Duggan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Karen Tranberg |last2=Philipson |first2=Ilene J. |title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-87722-630-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-11204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leidholdt |first1=Dorchen |authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt |last2=Raymond |first2=Janice G. |title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-08-037457-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=978-0-04-440593-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the [[sexual revolution]] from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and [[bisexuality|bisexual women]] as part of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=Lesbian History|url=http://www.outhistory.org/exhibits/show/lesbians-20th-century/sex-wars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex industry ===
{{main|Sex industry|Feminist views on pornography|Feminist views on prostitution|Feminist sex wars| Male prostitution#Feminist studies}}
Opinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality. For the views of feminism on male prostitutes see the article on [[Male prostitution#Feminist studies|male prostitution]].

Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of [[violence against women]], to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression.&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{cite book |author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91036-1 |pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance/&gt; Similarly, feminists' views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affirming female sexual autonomy ===
For feminists, a woman's right to control her own [[Right to sexuality|sexuality]] is a key issue. Feminists such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement, and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rohana Ariffin|author2=Women's Crisis Centre (Pinang, Malaysia)|title=Shame, secrecy, and silence: study on rape in Penang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfsDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=1997|publisher=Women's Crisis Centre|isbn=978-983-99348-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett L, Manderson L, Astbury J. [http://academic.udayton.edu/health/01status/rape01.htm Mapping a global pandemic: review of current literature on rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment of women]. University of Melbourne, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In many{{clarify|date=June 2018}} cultures, men do not believe that a woman has the right to reject a man's sexual advances or to make an autonomous decision about participating in sex. Feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that largely deny women the right to decide how to express their sexuality, because men under patriarchy feel entitled to define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In many{{clarify|date=June 2018}} parts of the world, especially in [[conservative]] and religious cultures, marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jewkes R, Abrahams N |title= The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview|pmid=12365533|year=2002|volume=55|issue=7|pages=1231–44|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00242-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen P. Ending the presumption of consent: nonconsensual sex in marriage. London, Centre for Health and Gender Equity, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In more liberal cultures, this entitlement takes the form of a general [[sexualization]] of the whole culture. This is played out in the [[sexual objectification]] of women, with pornography and other forms of sexual entertainment creating the fantasy that all women exist solely for men's sexual pleasure, and that women are readily available and desiring to engage in sex at any time, with any man, on a man's terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon |date=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sandra Harding]] says that the "moral and political insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender, sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds."&lt;ref name=Harding_method&gt;{{cite book|author=Harding, Sandra|editor=Nancy Tuana|year=1989|title=Feminism &amp; Science|chapter=Is There a Feminist Method|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQQkAvU4S1oC&amp;pg=PA17|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20525-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminists, such as [[Ruth Hubbard]] and [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], criticize traditional [[rhetoric of science|scientific discourse]] as being historically biased towards a male perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hubbard, Ruth|year=1990|title=The Politics of Women's Biology|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-1490-1|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name="QCommRsrch"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lindlof | first1 = Thomas R. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Bryan C. | title = Qualitative Communication Research Methods | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, Calif | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7619-2493-7 |page = 357}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Lisa Randall]], appointed to a task force at Harvard by then-president [[Lawrence Summers]] after his controversial discussion of why women may be underrepresented in science and engineering, said, "I just want to see a whole bunch more women enter the field so these issues don't have to come up anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Holloway, Marguerite|title=The Beauty of Branes|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-beauty-of-branes|date=26 September 2005|work=Scientific American|publisher=Nature America|accessdate=12 December 2011|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn Hankinson Nelson notes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women, and to "uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them" to account for a range of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1990|title=Who Knows: from Quine To a Feminist Empiricism|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-0-87722-647-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name="QCommRsrch"/&gt; Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cortina |first1=L.

One criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1997|title=Feminism, Science, and the Philosophy of Science |publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4611-1|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Haack]] also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women's thinking (as intuitive and emotional, etc.); [[Meera Nanda]] further cautions that this may in fact trap women within "traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/ |title=Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science |author=Anderson, Elizabeth |accessdate=6 December 2011|year=2011 |journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |issue=Spring 2011 |editor=Edward N.

=== Feminist psychology ===
{{main|Feminist psychology}}
Feminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates in psychology, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Worell|first1=Judith|title=Feminism in Psychology: Revolution or Evolution?|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=September 2000|volume=571|pages=183–96|url=http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~pchsiung/summer/SCMEDIA/Worell.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2014|doi=10.1177/0002716200571001013|jstor=1049142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as [[Psychology's Feminist Voices]] have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology's Feminist Voices|url=http://www.feministvoices.com|website=Psychology's Feminist Voices|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
Gender-based inquiries into and conceptualization of architecture have also come about, leading to [[Feminism and modern architecture|feminism in modern architecture]]. Piyush Mathur coined the term "archigenderic". Claiming that "architectural planning has an inextricable link with the defining and regulation of gender roles, responsibilities, rights, and limitations", Mathur came up with that term "to explore&amp;nbsp;... the meaning of 'architecture' in terms of gender" and "to explore the meaning of 'gender' in terms of architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09699089800200034 |title=The archigenderic territories: Mansfield park and a handful of dust |year=1998 |last1=Mathur |first1=Piyush |journal=Women's Writing |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Businesses ===
Feminist activists have established a range of [[feminist businesses]], including women's bookstores, feminist credit unions, feminist presses, feminist mail-order catalogs, and feminist restaurants. These businesses flourished as part of the [[Second-wave feminism|second]] and [[Third-wave feminism|third-waves]] of feminism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.{{sfnp|Echols|1989|pp=269–278}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminist Bookstore Movement: Lesbian Antiracism and Feminist Accountability|last=Hogan|first=Kristen|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corresponding with general developments within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Gopnik/&gt; Jeremy Strick, director of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles]], described the feminist art movement as "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period", and [[Peggy Phelan]] says that it "brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing over the past four decades".&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/20/AR2007042000400.html |title=What Is Feminist Art? |author=Blake Gopnik |date=22 April 2007 |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist artist [[Judy Chicago]], who created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', a set of [[Vagina and vulva in art|vulva-themed ceramic plates]] in the 1970s, said in 2009 to ''[[ARTnews]]'', "There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] narrative.

The feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]]. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel  |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a close link between feminist literature and [[activism]], with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era.

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like [[Dale Spender]]'s ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing.

Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandra M. |last=Gilbert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260 |title=Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 May 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Broadview Press]] continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the [[University of Kentucky]] has a series of republications of early women's novels.

Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) by [[Virginia Woolf]], is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

The widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the [[literary canon]]. Interest in [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Literary genre|genres and subgenres]] have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies has entered new territories such as the "[[Gothic fiction#The female Gothic and the supernatural explained|female gothic]]"&lt;ref&gt;Term coined by Ellen Moers in ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' (New York: Doubleday, 1976). See also Juliann E. Fleenor, ed., ''The Female Gothic'' (Montreal: Eden Press, 1983) and Gary Kelly, ed., ''Varieties of Female Gothic'' 6 Vols. (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Women in science fiction|women's science fiction]].

According to Elyce Rae Helford, "Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Helford, Elyce Rae |editor-first=Gary |editor-last=Westfahl |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy |chapter=Feminist Science Fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=289–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15328023top1703_17 |title=Using Science Fiction to Teach the Psychology of Sex and Gender |year=1990 |last1=Lips |first1=Hilary M. |journal=Teaching of Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=197–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable texts of this kind are [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969), [[Joanna Russ]]' ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1970), [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) and [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985).

Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, [[Maya Angelou]]'s ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings]]'' was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2018/08/10/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-review-maya-angelou/|title=I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings: Angelou's Quest to Truth and Power|last=Shah|first=Mahvish|date=2018|website=Feminism in India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many feminist movements have embraced [[poetry]] as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/144696/a-change-of-world|title=A Change of World|last=Poetry Foundation|first=|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminism became a principal concern of [[Musicology|musicologists]] in the 1980s&lt;ref name=mus&gt;Beard, David; Gload, Kenneth. 2005. Musicology : The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[New Musicology]]. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of [[Western canon|canon]], genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt; Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like [[Susan McClary]], [[Marcia Citron]] and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and [[Female education|education of women]]; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt;

While the [[music industry]] has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end|first=Jessica |last=Duchen |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[Record producer|music producers]], the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rosina |last=Ncube |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women in Audio? |website=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013 |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/people/sounding-why-so-few-women-audio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
{{main|Feminist film theory}}
{{see also|Women's cinema}}

Feminist cinema, advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives, arose largely with the development of [[feminist film theory]] in the late '60s and early '70s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward S., ''Cinema Studies – The Key Concepts'', 3rd edn, Routledge, 2006;134–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Differences were particularly marked between [[Feminist film theory#History|feminists on either side of the Atlantic]]. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, [[List of film periodicals|''Women and Film'']]. Trailblazers from this period included [[Claire Johnston]] and [[Laura Mulvey]], who also organized the Women's Event at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival|Edinburgh Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Erens, P., ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism'', Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991; 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include [[Teresa de Lauretis]], Anneke Smelik and [[Kaja Silverman]]. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.

It has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent, theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking. 'Deconstruction' concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema, aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema. The second approach, a feminist counterculture, embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kuhn |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Radstone |editor2-first=S. |title=Women's Companion to International Film |publisher=Virago |year=1990 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/what-really-makes-a-film-feminist/281402/ |title=What really makes a feminist film? |work=[[The Atlantic]] |first=Holly L. |last=Derr |date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of "feminist film" approaches has centred around a Swedish rating system called the [[Bechdel test]].

Feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the twentieth century.

=== Socialism ===
{{main|Left-wing politics#Social progressivism and counterculture|l1=Social Progressivism and Counterculture}}
Since the late nineteenth century some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women's rights. [[August Bebel]], an early activist of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), published his work ''Die Frau und der Sozialismus'', juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In 1907 there was an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Stuttgart 1907|International Conference of Socialist Women]] in [[Stuttgart]] where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. [[Clara Zetkin]] of the SPD called for women's suffrage to build a "''socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Badia, Gilbert |title=Zetkin.

In Britain, the women's movement was allied with the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]]. In the U.S., [[Betty Friedan]] emerged from a radical background to take leadership. [[Radical Women]] is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Radical Women Manifesto: Socialist Feminist Theory, Program and Organizational Structure |year=2001 |publisher=Red Letter Press |location=Seattle, WA |isbn=978-0-932323-11-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Dolores Ibárruri]] (''La Pasionaria'') led the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]].

[[File:Feministas en lucha anti Pinochet (de Kena Lorenzini).jpg|thumb|Chilean feminists protest against the regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]]]]
Fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the [[Fascist manifesto]] in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary groups such as the ''fasci femminilli'' and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s more conservative coalition partners.&lt;ref name="hagg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hägg |first=Göran |year=2008 |title=Mussolini: En studie i makt |trans-title=A study in power |language=sv |publisher=Norstedt |location=Stockholm |isbn=978-91-1-301949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="passmore"&gt;{{cite book |last=Passmore |first=Kevin |authorlink=Definitions_of_fascism#Kevin_Passmore |year=2003 |title=Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–45 |publisher=Rutgers Univ.

Cyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], feminism has a complicated relationship with the [[Nazi]] movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment.&lt;ref name=Blamires&gt;{{cite book |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |last=Blamires |first=Cyprian |volume=1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-940-9 |pages=232–33|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism,&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt; and after the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period and to some extent during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=hww5/&gt; Georges Duby et al. note that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position.&lt;ref name=hww5&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duby |first1=Georges |last2=Perrot |first2=Michelle |last3=Schmitt Pantel |first3=Pauline |title=A history of women in the West |year=1994 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-40369-7 |page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blamires also notes that Neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept "their traditional roles".&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt;

=== Civil rights movement and anti-racism ===
The [[civil rights movement]] has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Peter |year=1998 |title=The Civil Rights Movement |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-29854-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Code |first=Lorraine |title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories |chapter=Civil rights |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-13274-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns.&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt; These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, [[classism]], and [[sexism]], and new feminisms, such as [[black feminism]] and [[Chicana feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roth |first=Benita |title=Separate Roads to Feminism: Black, Chicana, and White feminist movements in America's second wave |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-52972-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winddance Twine |first1=France |first2=Kathleen M. |last2=Blee |title=Feminism and Antiracism: International struggles for justice |publisher=NYU Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8147-9855-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoliberalism===
[[Neoliberalism]] has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe, especially in the global south.  Masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=V. Spike |year=2014 |chapter=International/Global Political Economy |editor-last=Shepherd | editor-first=Laura J. |title=Gender Matters in Global Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291 |edition=2 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134752591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|177}} Women's experiences in non-industrialized countries reveal often deleterious effects of modernization policies and undercut orthodox claims that development benefits everyone.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|175}}

Proponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing women's participation in the workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have noted that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations.&lt;ref name="elias"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elias |first1=Juanita |last2=Ferguson |first2=Lucy |year=2014 |chapter=Production, Employment, and Consumption |editor-last=Shepherd | editor-first=Laura J. |title=Gender Matters in Global Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134752591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|186–98}} Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women's subordination in the family and the workplace.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|176}} The "feminization of employment" refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe and secure.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|179}}  Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|180}}  Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part in this, for instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as 'secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.&lt;ref name="elias"/&gt;{{rp|189}}

== Societal impact ==
{{Main|Feminist effects on society}}
The feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; greater access to education; more nearly equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the right to own property.&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"/&gt;

From the 1960s on, the campaign for women's rights&lt;ref name="quarterly"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Lockwood, Bert B. |title=Women's Rights: A Human Rights Quarterly Reader |year=2006 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; was met with mixed results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=FROM SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN'S LIBERATION: FEMINISM IN TWENTIETH CENTURY AMERICA by Jo Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. and the U.K. Other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.

Some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to [[child sexual abuse]]. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men's responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rush |first=Florence |authorlink=Florence Rush |year=1988 |title=The Best Kept Secret: Sexual Abuse of Children |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs |isbn=978-0070542235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[National Organization for Women]] ([[National Organization for Women|NOW]]) began in 1966 to seek women's equality, including through the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ([[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://now.org/about/history/statement-of-purpose/|title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not pass, although [[Equal Rights Amendment#State constitutions|some states enacted their own]]. [[Reproductive rights]] in the U.S. centred on the court decision in [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe'' v. ''Wade'']] enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable [[birth control]], allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under [[Margaret Sanger]] and elsewhere under [[Marie Stopes]]. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through [[birth control]], which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1676.html|title=Margaret Sanger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[division of labor|division of labour]] within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework,&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |author2=Machung, Anne |title=The Second Shift |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-14-200292-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild2"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |title=The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work |year=2001 |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-8050-6643-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Cathy Young]] responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/|title=The Mama Lion at the Gate |accessdate=17 December 2015 |publisher=Salon.com |author=Young, Cathy |authorlink=Cathy Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith K. Brown writes, "Women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics: the participant is not obliged to be far from home; the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration; and the work is not dangerous, can be performed in spite of interruptions, and is easily resumed once interrupted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Judith K. | last = Brown | title = A Note on the Division of Labor by Sex | date = October 1970 | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 1073–78 | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | doi=10.1525/aa.1970.72.5.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international law, the ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]'' (CEDAW) is an international convention adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women. It came into force in those nations ratifying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CEDAW.aspx|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women New York, 18 December 1979 |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisprudence ===
{{Main|Feminist legal theory}}

Feminist jurisprudence is a branch of [[jurisprudence]] that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights.&lt;ref name="blacks"&gt;{{cite book |year=2014 |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Bryan |editor-link=Bryan A. Garner |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition=10th |location=St. Paul, Minn. |publisher=Thomson Reuters |page=985 |isbn=978-0-314-61300-4 |quote=Feminist jurisprudence examines ... the history of legal and social biases against women, the elimination of those biases in modern law, and the enhancement of women's legal rights and recognition [status] in society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the [[Philosophy of law|philosophical approach]] of modern [[Law#Legal theory|legal scholars]], who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.&lt;ref name="minda"&gt;{{cite book |last=Minda |first=Gary |year=1995 |title=Postmodern Legal Movements: Law and Jurisprudence at Century's End |publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]] |location=N.Y.C. |isbn=978-0814755105 |pages=129–30 |quote=Feminist legal scholars, despite their differences, appear united in claiming that 'masculine' jurisprudence ... fails to acknowledge, let alone respond to, the interests, values, fears, and harms experienced by women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===
{{details|Gender-neutral language in English}}
Proponents of gender-neutral language argue that the use of gender-specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Casey |authorlink1=Casey Miller |last2=Swift |first2=Kate |authorlink2=Kate Swift |year=1988 |title=The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=N.Y.C. |isbn=978-0061816024 |pages=45, 64, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Handbook of English Linguistics'', generic masculine pronouns and gender-specific job titles are instances "where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species."&lt;ref name="handbook linguistics"&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |editor1-last=Aarts |editor1-first=Bas |editor2-last=McMahon |editor2-first=April |title=The Handbook of English Linguistics |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-1405113823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.&lt;ref name=Bundesen&gt;{{cite book |author=Bundesen, Lynne |title=The Feminine Spirit: Recapturing the Heart of Scripture |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-8495-3|date=2007-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian feminism]] is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the [[Christian egalitarianism|equality]] of [[Women in Christianity|women]] and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the [[ordination of women]], male dominance and the balance of parenting in [[Christian views on marriage|Christian marriage]], claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church.&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haddad, Mimi |title=Egalitarian Pioneers: Betty Friedan or Catherine Booth? |journal=Priscilla Papers |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=2006 |url=http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713193304/http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=andeson&gt;{{cite book |author=Anderson, Pamela Sue |author2=Clack, Beverley |title=Feminist philosophy of religion: critical readings |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-25749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian [[Women in the Bible|Bible refers to women]] in positions of authority in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 4:4 and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 22:14.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|4:4|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|22:14|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=April 2016}}

[[Islamic feminism|Islamic feminists]] advocate women's rights, [[gender equality]], and [[social justice]] grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the [[Women in the Quran|Quran]] and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings of [[Muhammad]]), and ''[[Sharia#Women|sharia]]'' (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/international/Islamic-Feminism-01.html|title=Islamic Feminism: What's in a Name?|author=Badran, Margot |accessdate=17 December 2015 |date=17–23 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized [[Islam and secularism|secular]] and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm|publisher=feminismeislamic.org |author=Catalonian Islamic Board |title=II International Congress on Islamic Feminism|accessdate=9 July 2008 |date=24–27 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114144940/http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm|archivedate=14 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhist feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and [[social status]] of [[Women in Buddhism|women within Buddhism]]. It is an aspect of [[feminist theology]] which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective. The Buddhist feminist [[Rita Gross]] describes Buddhist feminism as "the radical practice of the co-humanity of women and men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism|last= Gross|first= Rita M.|year= 1992|publisher= [[State University of New York Press]]|location= Albany, New York|isbn= 978-0-7914-1403-3|page= 127|accessdate=October 7, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3eurUjHo1IC&amp;pg=PA127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of [[Women in Judaism|women]] within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women.

Patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege, and is dependent on female subordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of sex and gender |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |location=Detroit, Mich.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women. [[Carole Pateman]] argues that the patriarchal distinction "between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection."&lt;ref&gt;Pateman, Carole (1988). ''The Sexual Contract'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[feminist theory]] the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tickner, Ann J.|chapter=Patriarchy|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries PZ|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-24352-0|pages=1197–98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society, [[Separatist feminism|separatism]] is the only viable solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hoagland, Lesbian Ethics: toward new value&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminists have criticized these views as being anti-men.&lt;ref&gt;Friedan, Betty.

Feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality.

== Reactions ==
Different groups of people have responded to feminism, and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics. Among American university students, for both men and women, support for feminist ideas is more common than self-identification as a feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00159.x |title=Disavowing Social Identities: What It Means when Women Say, 'I'm Not a Feminist, but&amp;nbsp;...' |year=2004 |last1=Zucker |first1=Alyssa N. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=423–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1007044802798 |year=2000 |last1=Burn |first1=Shawn Meghan |last2=Aboud |first2=Roger |last3=Moyles |first3=Carey |title=The Relationship Between Gender Social Identity and Support for Feminism |journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] |volume=42 |issue=11/12 |pages=1081–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00289954 |title=New wave or second stage?

=== Pro-feminism ===
{{main|Pro-feminism}}
Pro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, [[men's studies]], and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.&lt;ref name=Lingard&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Lingard |first1=Bob |last2=Douglas |first2=Peter |title=Men Engaging Feminisms: Pro-Feminism, Backlashes and Schooling |year=1999 |publisher=Open University Press |location=Buckingham, England |isbn=978-0-335-19818-4 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimmel-Tide"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Kimmel |first1=Michael S. |authorlink1=Michael Kimmel |last2=Mosmiller |first2=Thomas E. |title=Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776–1990: A Documentary History |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-6767-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-feminism and criticism of feminism===
{{Anchor|Critique of Feminism and Anti-feminism|Criticism of feminism and anti-feminism}} &lt;!--Former name--&gt;
{{main|Antifeminism}}
Anti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Simpson | first1 = John A. | last2 = Weiner | first2 = Edmund S.C. | author-link1 = John Simpson (lexicographer) | author-link2 = Edmund Weiner | contribution = Anti-feminist | editor-last1 = Simpson | editor-first1 = John A. | editor-last2 = Weiner | editor-first2 = Edmund S.

In the nineteenth century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWj5OBvTh1IC&amp;pg=PA35 |chapter=Antifeminism |first=Michael |last=Kimmel |authorlink=Michael Kimmel | editor-last1 = Kimmel | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Aronson | editor-first2 = Amy | editor-link1 = Michael Kimmel | editor-link2 = Amy Aronson | title = Men and masculinities a social, cultural, and historical encyclopedia | pages = 35–37 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781576077740 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. These anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lukas | first = Carrie | author-link = Carrie Lukas | contribution = Marriage: happier ever after | editor-last = Lukas | editor-first = Carrie | editor-link = Carrie Lukas | title = The politically incorrect guide to women, sex, and feminism | page = 75 | publisher = Regency Publishing | location = Washington, DC Lanham, Maryland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781596980037 | quote = Feminists' assault on marriage also has played a role in devaluing marriage. Radical feminists view marriage as a cruel trap for women, perpetuating patriarchy, and keeping women subservient to men. They lament the roles that women and men tend to assume in traditional marriages, believing that women get the worse deal from the marriage contract. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Kassian | first = Mary | contribution = Introduction: the tsunami of feminism | editor-last = Kassian | editor-first = Mary | title = The feminist &lt;del&gt;mystique&lt;/del&gt; mistake: the radical impact of feminism on church and culture | page = 10 | publisher = [[Good News Publishers|Crossway Books]] | location = Wheaton, Illinois | year = 2005 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781581345704 | quote = The feminist assault on traditional gender roles and families began in earnest in the 1960s and increasingly turned radical in the 1970s. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schlafly | first = Phyllis | author-link = Phyllis Schlafly | contribution = Understanding the difference | editor-last = Schlafly | editor-first = Phyllis | editor-link = Phyllis Schlafly | title = The power of the positive woman | page = 12 | publisher = Arlington House | location = New Rochelle, New York | year = 1977 | isbn = 9780870003738 | quote = The second dogma of the women's liberationists is that, of all the injustices perpetuated upon women through the centuries, the most oppressive is the cruel fact that women have babies and men do not. Within the confines of the women's liberationist ideology, therefore, the abolition of this overriding inequality of women becomes the primary goal. This goal must be achieved at any at all costs – to the woman herself, to the baby, to the family, and to society. Women must be made equal to men in their ability ''not'' to become pregnant and ''not'' to be expected to care for babies they may bring into the world. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gottfried |first=Paul | author-link = Paul Gottfried |title=The trouble with feminism  |url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/04/paul-gottfried/the-trouble-with-feminism/ | work = [[LewRockwell.com]] (web magazine) |publisher= [[Lew Rockwell]] |date= 21 April 2001 |accessdate=30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = al-Qaradawi | first = Yusuf | author-link = Yusuf al-Qaradawi | contribution = Women and family in Islamist discourses: 'When Islam prohibits something, it closes all the avenues of approach to it'| editor-last = Calvert | editor-first = John | editor-link = John Calvert (scholar) | title = Islamism: a documentary and reference guide | page = 62 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780313338564 | quote = Islamists are aggrieved at the support of ostensibly Muslim governments for the 'alleged' legal emancipation of women, including granting women the right to vote and hold public office, in addition to limited rights to initiate divorce. Although many Muslim women take pride in the fact that they now perform jobs and enter professions once reserved for men, for most Islamists female employment and legal emancipation are dangerous trends that lead to the dissolution of traditional gender roles associated with the extended family. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers such as [[Camille Paglia]], [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], [[Jean Bethke Elshtain]], [[Elizabeth Fox-Genovese]], Lisa Lucile Owens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Department of Sociology: Lisa Lucile Owens | url = http://sociology.columbia.edu/node/347 | publisher = [[Columbia University|Columbia University in the City of New York]] | access-date = 13 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Daphne Patai]] oppose some forms of feminism, though they identify as feminists. They argue, for example, that feminism often promotes [[misandry]] and the elevation of women's interests above men's, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women.&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sommers |first=Christina Hoff |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers |title=Who Stole Feminism?
