Originating in late 18th-century Europe, [[feminist movement]]s have campaigned and continue to campaign for [[women's rights]], including the right to [[Women's suffrage|vote]], [[Nomination rules|run for public office]], [[Right to work|work]], earn [[gender pay gap|equal pay]], [[Right to property|own property]], [[Right to education|receive education]], enter into [[contract]]s, have equal rights within [[marriage]], and [[maternity leave]].

Many scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical [[Social change|societal changes]] for women's rights, particularly in [[Western world|the West]], where they are near-universally credited with achieving [[women's suffrage]], [[gender-neutral language]], [[reproductive rights]] for women (including access to contraceptives and [[support for the legalization of abortion|abortion]]), and the right to enter into contracts and [[property|own property]].&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Messer-Davidow |first=Ellen |title=Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse |year=2002 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, [[North Carolina|NC]] |isbn=978-0-8223-2843-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists argue for the inclusion of [[men's liberation]] within its aims, because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name="hooks"/&gt; [[Feminist theory]], which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experiences.

Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years, representing different viewpoints and political aims. Traditionally, since the 19th century, [[First-wave feminism|first-wave]] [[liberal feminism]], which sought political and legal equality through [[political reform|reforms]] within a [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] framework, was contrasted with [[Labour movement|labour]]-based [[proletarian]] women's movements that over time developed into [[socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism]] based on [[class struggle]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Artwińska|first1=Anna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUDpDwAAQBAJ|title=Gender, Generations, and Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and Beyond|last2=Mrozik|first2=Agnieszka|date=3 June 2020|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-000-09514-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, both of these traditions are also contrasted with the [[radical feminism]] that arose from the [[radical politics|radical]] wing of [[second-wave feminism]] and that calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate [[patriarchy]]. Liberal, socialist, and radical feminism are sometimes referred to as the "Big Three" schools of feminist thought.&lt;ref name="Maynard" /&gt;

Since the late 20th century, many newer forms of feminism have emerged. Some forms, such as [[white feminism]] and [[gender-critical feminism]], have been criticized as taking into account only white, middle class, college-educated, [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]], or [[cisgender]] perspectives. These criticisms have led to the creation of ethnically specific or [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] forms of feminism, such as [[black feminism]] and [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] feminism.&lt;ref name=Weedon/&gt; Some feminists have argued that feminism often promotes [[misandry]] and the elevation of women's interests above men's, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women.&lt;ref name="Hoff_Sommers" /&gt;

[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] is seen by many as a founder of feminism due to her 1792 book titled ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' in which she argues that class and private property are the basis of discrimination against women, and that women as much as men needed equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;M Wollstoncraft, ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Vindication_of_the_Rights_of_Woman/Chapter_IX ch VII], "From the respect paid to property flow, as from a poisoned fountain, most of the evils and vices which render this world such a dreary scene to the contemplative mind." {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ue0dAAAAQBAJ|isbn = 9781136753039|title = Mary Wollstonecraft, Pedagogy, and the Practice of Feminism|date = 18 July 2013|publisher = Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGSV8ihuJfcC|isbn = 9780061866005|title = Vindication: A Life of Mary Wollstonecraft|date = 17 March 2009|publisher = Harper Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/oct/05/original-suffragette-mary-wollstonecraft|title=The original suffragette: The extraordinary Mary Wollstonecraft|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://institute-genderequality.org/news-publications/feminism/feminism-18th-century-and-beyond/|title = Feminism in the 18th century and beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Fourier]], a [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] and French philosopher, is credited with having coined the word "féminisme" in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Leslie F.|year=1982|title=Early Feminist Themes in French Utopian Socialism: The St.-Simonians and Fourier|journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]|volume=43|issue=1|pages=91–108|doi=10.2307/2709162|jstor=2709162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words "féminisme" ("feminism") and "féministe" ("feminist") first appeared in [[Feminism in France|France]] and the [[Feminism in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] in 1872,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grever|first=Maria|title=Strijd tegen de stilte.

The [[First-wave feminism|first]] comprised women's suffrage movements of the 19th and early-20th centuries, promoting women's right to vote. The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]], the [[women's liberation movement]], began in the 1960s and campaigned for legal and social equality for women.

=== 19th and early 20th centuries ===
{{Main|First-wave feminism}}
First-wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th and early-20th centuries. In the UK and US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. New legislation included the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] in the UK, which introduced the [[tender years doctrine]] for child custody and gave women the right of custody of their children for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wroath|first=John|title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights|year=1998|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=1-872870-57-0|url=https://archive.org/details/untiltheyareseve00wroa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=L.

[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] passed legislation in 1884 and [[New South Wales]] in 1889; the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. With the turn of the 19th century, activism focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's [[suffrage]], though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's [[Sexual and reproductive health and rights|sexual]], [[reproductive rights|reproductive]], and [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]] too.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464&gt;{{cite book|author=Freedman, Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of Women |year=2003 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-45053-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/464 464] |url=https://archive.org/details/noturningbackhis00free/page/464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's suffrage]] (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) began in Britain's [[Australasia]]n colonies at the end of the 19th century, with the self-governing colony of [[Feminism in New Zealand|New Zealand]] granting women the right to vote in 1893; [[South Australia]] followed suit with the [[Constitutional Amendment (Adult Suffrage) Act 1894]] in 1894.

In Britain, the suffragettes and [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies|suffragists]] campaigned for the women's vote, and in 1918 the [[Representation of the People Act 1918|Representation of the People Act]] was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property.

According to Nawar al-Hassan Golley, Arab feminism was closely connected with [[Arab nationalism]]. In 1899, [[Qasim Amin]], considered the "father" of Arab feminism, wrote ''The Liberation of Women'', which argued for legal and social reforms for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stange |first1=Mary Zeiss |first2=Carol K. |last2=Oyster |first3=Jane E. |last3=Sloan |title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World |publisher=SAGE |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4129-7685-5 |pages=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew links between women's position in Egyptian society and nationalism, leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement.&lt;ref name=Golley&gt;{{cite book |last=Golley |first=Nawar Al-Hassan |title=Reading Arab Women's Autobiographies: Shahrazad Tells Her Story |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2003 |pages=30–50 |isbn=978-0-292-70545-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 [[Hoda Shaarawi]] founded the [[Egyptian Feminist Union]], became its president and a symbol of the Arab women's rights movement.&lt;ref name=Golley/&gt;

=== Mid-20th century ===

By the mid-20th century, women still lacked significant rights.

In [[Women in France|France]], women obtained the [[Women's suffrage#France|right to vote]] only with the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] of 21 April 1944. [[Provisional Consultative Assembly|The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944]] proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by [[Fernand Grenier (French Politician)|Fernard Grenier]], they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote. Grenier's proposition was adopted 51 to 16. In May 1947, following the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 elections]], the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the "[[gender differences|gender gap]]", stating in ''[[Le Populaire (French newspaper)|Le Populaire]]'' that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes. During the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] period, feminism waned in importance. Wars (both World War I and World War II) had seen the provisional emancipation of some women, but post-war periods signalled the return to conservative roles.&lt;ref name=Bard&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christine |last=Bard |url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/index.php?numero=01&amp;rub=dossier&amp;item=7 |title=Les premières femmes au Gouvernement (France, 1936–1981) |trans-title=First Women in Government (France, 1936–1981) |journal=[[Histoire@Politique]] |issue=1 |date=May–June 2007 |volume=1 |page=2 |doi=10.3917/hp.001.0002 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists continued to campaign for the reform of [[family law]]s which gave husbands control over their wives. Although by the 20th century [[coverture]] had been abolished in the UK and US, in many [[continental European]] countries married women still had very few rights. For instance, in France, married women did not receive the right to work without their husband's permission until 1965.&lt;ref name=Guillaumin&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillaumin|first=Colette|year=1994 |title=Racism, Sexism, Power, and Ideology |pages=193–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meltzer&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Françoise |year=1995 |title=Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have also worked to abolish the [[marital rape|"marital exemption" in rape laws]] which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{cite book |last=Allison |first=Julie A. |year=1995 |title=Rape: The Misunderstood Crime |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier efforts by first-wave feminists such as [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], [[Victoria Woodhull]] and [[Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy]] to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed;&lt;ref name=Bland&gt;{{cite book |last=Bland |first=Lucy |year=2002 |title=Banishing the Beast: Feminism, Sex and Morality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cl8nLdfgz1IC |access-date=25 August 2013 |pages=135–49|publisher=I.

Second-wave feminists see women's cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures. The feminist activist and author [[Carol Hanisch]] coined the slogan "The Personal is Political", which became synonymous with the second wave.&lt;ref name=Echols/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanisch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |title=Hanisch, New Intro to 'The Personal is Political' – Second Wave and Beyond |access-date=8 June 2008 |last=Hanisch |first=Carol |date=1 January 2006 |website=The Personal Is Political |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515014413/http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |archive-date=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second- and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of women's roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women's equality has actually been fully achieved.&lt;ref name="Dooling" /&gt;

In 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Feminism in Egypt|Egypt]] initiated "[[state feminism]]", which outlawed [[Human rights in Egypt#Status of women|discrimination based on gender]] and granted women's suffrage, but also blocked political activism by feminist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badran |first=Margot |title=Feminists, Islam, and Nation: Gender and the Making of Modern Egypt |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-691-02605-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]]'s presidency, his wife, [[Jehan Sadat]], publicly advocated further women's rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equality with the new [[Islamist]] movement and growing conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Bonnie G. |title=Global Feminisms Since 1945 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-18491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, [[Islamic feminism]], which argues for women's equality within an Islamic framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic feminism means justice to women|url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2004/16-31Jan04-Print-Edition/1631200425.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821055118/https://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2004/16-31Jan04-Print-Edition/1631200425.htm|archive-date=21 August 2013|access-date=31 March 2013|website=The Mili Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Feminism in Latin America|Latin America]], revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as [[Role of women in Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]], where [[feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution]] aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.&lt;ref name="parpart"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Parpart |first1=Jane L. |last2=Connelly |first2=M.

Third-wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave's [[Essentialism|essentialist]] definitions of [[femininity]], which, third-wave feminists argued, overemphasized the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focused on "[[wikt:micropolitics|micro-politics]]" and challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what was, or was not, good for women, and tended to use a [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Astrid |url=https://archive.org/details/notmymotherssist0000henr/page/1/mode/2up |title=Not My Mother's Sister: Generational Conflict and Third-Wave Feminism |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-253-21713-4 |location=Bloomington |pages=1–288 |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillis |first1=Stacy |last2=Howie |first2=Gillian |last3=Munford |first3=Rebecca |title=Third Wave Feminism: A Critical Exploration |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-0-230-52174-2 |pages=xxviii, 275–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faludi&gt;{{cite book |last=Faludi |first=Susan |author-link=Susan Faludi |title=Backlash: The Undeclared War Against Women |year=1992 |publisher=Vintage |location=London |isbn=978-0-09-922271-2}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks]], [[Chela Sandoval]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities.&lt;ref name=Gillis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leslie |first1=Heywood |last2=Drake |first2=Jennifer |title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism |year=1997 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-3005-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thirdwaveagendab0000unse }}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-wave feminism also contained internal debates between [[difference feminism|difference feminists]], who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to [[social conditioning]].&lt;ref name=Gilligan&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |author-link=Carol Gilligan |title=In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development |url=https://archive.org/details/indifferentvoic000gill |url-access=registration |year=1993 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-44544-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/indifferentvoic000gill/page/184 184]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view stating that a person's social position influences their knowledge. This perspective argues that research and theory treat women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = standpoint theory {{!}} feminism|url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/standpoint-theory|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, [[Standpoint feminism|standpoint feminists]] have argued that the feminist movement should address global issues (such as rape, [[incest]], and prostitution) and culturally specific issues (such as [[female genital mutilation]] in some parts of [[Women in Africa|Africa]] and [[Women in Arab societies|Arab societies]], as well as [[glass ceiling]] practices that impede women's advancement in developed economies) in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, [[homophobia]], [[classism]] and [[colonization]] in a "[[matrix of domination]]".&lt;ref name="BFT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harding2003&gt;{{cite book |last=Harding |first=Sandra |author-link=Sandra Harding |title=The Feminist Standpoint Theory Reader: Intellectual and Political Controversies |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-94501-1 |pages=1–16, 67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-wave feminism is a proposed extension of third-wave feminism which corresponds to a resurgence in interest in feminism beginning around 2012 and associated with the use of social media.&lt;ref name=4thWave-Guardian20131210/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Feminism: A fourth wave? {{!}} The Political Studies Association (PSA)|url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa/news/feminism-fourth-wave|access-date=29 November 2021|website=Feminism: A fourth wave? {{!}} The Political Studies Association (PSA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to sexual harassment and violence against women. Its essence, she writes, is "incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist".{{sfn|Chamberlain|2017|p=115}}

Fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology", according to [[Kira Cochrane]], and is characterized particularly by the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]], and blogs such as [[Feministing]] to challenge [[misogyny]] and further [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|author-link=Kira Cochrane|date=10 December 2013|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210221939/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|archive-date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|url-status=live|access-date=16 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501082226/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html?_r=3|archive-date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200817170127/https://nowtoronto.com/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist|archive-date=17 August 2020|access-date=21 April 2016|website=NOW Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include [[street harassment|street]] and [[workplace harassment]], [[campus sexual assault]] and rape culture. Scandals involving the harassment, abuse, and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement. These have included the [[2012 Delhi gang rape]], 2012 [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|Jimmy Savile allegations]], the [[Bill Cosby sexual assault case|Bill Cosby allegations]], [[2014 Isla Vista killings]], 2016 [[trial of Jian Ghomeshi]], 2017 [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein allegations]] and subsequent [[Weinstein effect]], and the [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals]].&lt;ref&gt;For Cosby, Ghomeshi, #MeToo, and fourth wave, see Matheson, Kelsey (17 October 2017).

=== Decolonial feminism ===
Decolonial feminism reformulates the [[coloniality of gender]] by critiquing the very formation of gender and its subsequent formations of [[patriarchy]] and the [[gender binary]], not as universal constants across cultures, but as structures that have been instituted by and for the benefit of [[European colonialism]]. [[Maria Lugones|Marìa Lugones]] proposes that decolonial feminism speaks to how "the colonial imposition of gender cuts across questions of ecology, economics, government, relations with the spirit world, and knowledge, as well as across everyday practices that either habituate us to take care of the world or to destroy it." Decolonial feminists like [[Karla Jessen Williamson]] and Rauna Kuokkanen have examined colonialism as a force that has imposed [[Gender hierarchy|gender hierarchies]] on Indigenous women that have disempowered and fractured Indigenous communities and ways of life.

==== Postfeminism ====
{{main|Postfeminism}}
The term [[postfeminism]] is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s. While not being "anti-feminist", postfeminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third- and fourth-wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Elizabeth |title=Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) |year=2000 |publisher=Totem Books |isbn=978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abbott |first1=Pamela |last2=Tyler |first2=Melissa |last3=Wallace |first3=Claire |title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-38245-3 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PPp7dfrNTroC&amp;q=no+longer+relevant xi] |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mateo–Gomez"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mateo–Gomez |first1=Tatiana |editor1-last=Richter |editor1-first=William L. |title=Approaches to Political Thought |date=2009 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4616-3656-4 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mQn-AAAAQBAJ&amp;q=feminism+no+longer+relevant 279] |chapter=Feminist Criticism}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Amelia |chapter=Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art |title=New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action |editor1-first=Joana |editor1-last=Frueh |editor2-first=Cassandra L. |editor2-last=Langer |editor3-first=Arlene |editor3-last=Raven |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1994 |pages=16–41, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Chunn describes a "blaming narrative" under the postfeminist moniker, where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for gender equality in a "post-feminist" society, where "gender equality has (already) been achieved". According to Chunn, "many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Chunn|first=Dorothy E.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASc568aunFoC&amp;q=Take+It+Easy+Girls%22:+Feminism,+Equality,+and+Social+Change+in+the+Media&amp;pg=PA31|title=Reaction and Resistance: Feminism, Law, and Social Change|date=1 November 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-4036-1|editor-last=Chunn|editor-first=Dorothy E.|location=|pages=31|chapter="Take It Easy Girls": Feminism, Equality, and Social Change in the Media (2007)|editor-last2=Boyd|editor-first2=Susan|editor-last3=Lessard|editor-first3=Hester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
{{main|Feminist theory}}
{{see also|Gynocriticism|écriture féminine}}
Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields.

While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, [[stereotyping]], [[objectification]] (especially [[sexual objectification]]), [[oppression]], and [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name=Chodorow1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=gilligan1977/&gt;
In the field of [[literary criticism]], [[Elaine Showalter]] describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls "feminist critique", in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls "[[gynocriticism]]", in which the "woman is producer of textual meaning". The last phase she calls "gender theory", in which the "ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored".&lt;ref name=showalter1979&gt;{{cite book |last1=Showalter |first1=Elaine |author-link1=Elaine Showalter |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Jacobus |title=Women Writing about Women |year=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-85664-745-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/womenwritingwrit0000unse/page/25 25–36] |chapter=Towards a Feminist Poetics |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/womenwritingwrit0000unse/page/25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was paralleled in the 1970s by [[French structuralist feminism|French feminists]], who developed the concept of ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (which translates as "female or feminine writing").&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; [[Hélène Cixous]] argues that writing and philosophy are ''[[Wikt:phallocentric|phallocentric]]'' and along with other French feminists such as [[Luce Irigaray]] emphasize "writing from the body" as a subversive exercise.&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; The work of [[Julia Kristeva]], a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, and [[Bracha Ettinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, 'The Matrixial Borderspace'.

However, as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out, "none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] world".&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moi1986&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kristeva |first1=Julia |last2=Moi |first2=Toril |author-link2=Toril Moi |title=The Kristeva Reader |year=1986 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-06325-8 |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent feminist theory, such as that of Lisa Lucile Owens,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite journal |title=Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' |first=Lisa Lucile |last=Owens |journal=[[Alabama Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Law Review]] |volume=5 |page=1 |year=2003 |ssrn=2439294}}&lt;/ref&gt; has concentrated on characterizing feminism as a universal emancipatory movement.

== Movements and ideologies ==
{{Main|Feminist movements and ideologies}}
Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years. Feminism is often divided into three main traditions called liberal, radical and socialist/Marxist feminism, sometimes known as the "Big Three" schools of feminist thought. Since the late 20th century, newer forms of feminisms have also emerged.&lt;ref name="Maynard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maynard |first1=Mary |title=Beyond the 'big three': the development of feminist theory into the 1990s |journal=[[Women's History Review]] |date=1995|volume=4|issue=3|pages=259–281|doi=10.1080/09612029500200089|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some branches of feminism track the political leanings of the larger society to a greater or lesser degree, or focus on specific topics, such as the environment.

=== Liberal feminism ===
{{Main|Liberal feminism}}
[[File:Elizabeth Stanton.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], a major figure in 19th-century liberal feminism]]
[[Liberal feminism]], also known under other names such as reformist, mainstream, or historically as bourgeois feminism,&lt;ref name="Voet"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voet |first1=Rian |title=Feminism and Citizenship |date=1998 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=1-4462-2804-5 |page=25|chapter=Categorizations of feminism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindsey |first=Linda L. |date=2015 |title=Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective |publisher= Routledge |page=17 |isbn=978-1-317-34808-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; arose from 19th-century first-wave feminism, and was historically linked to 19th-century [[liberalism]] and [[progressivism]], while 19th-century conservatives tended to oppose feminism as such. Liberal feminism seeks equality of men and women through political and [[legal reform]] within a [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] framework, without radically altering the structure of society; liberal feminism "works within the structure of mainstream society to integrate women into that structure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=West |first1=Rebecca |title=Kinds of Feminism |url=https://www.uah.edu/woolf/feminism_kinds.htm |publisher=University of Alabama in Huntsville}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th and early 20th centuries liberal feminism focused especially on women's suffrage and [[Female education|access to education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marilley |first1=Suzanne M. |title=Woman Suffrage and the Origins of Liberal Feminism in the United States, 1820–1920 |date=1996 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-95465-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Norwegian supreme court justice and former president of the liberal [[Norwegian Association for Women's Rights]], [[Karin Maria Bruzelius]], has described liberal feminism as "a realistic, sober, practical feminism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hvem vi er |url=http://kvinnesak.no/om/ |publisher=Norwegian Association for Women's Rights|access-date=28 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Wendell argues that "liberal feminism is an historical tradition that grew out of liberalism, as can be seen very clearly in the work of such feminists as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill, but feminists who took principles from that tradition have developed analyses and goals that go far beyond those of 18th and 19th century liberal feminists, and many feminists who have goals and strategies identified as liberal feminist&amp;nbsp;... reject major components of liberalism" in a modern or party-political sense; she highlights "equality of opportunity" as a defining feature of liberal feminism.&lt;ref name="Wendell-1987"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wendell|first=Susan|date=June 1987|title=A (Qualified) Defense of Liberal Feminism |journal=[[Hypatia (journal)|Hypatia]] |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=65–93 |doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1987.tb01066.x|s2cid=143213609 |issn=0887-5367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal feminism is a very broad term that encompasses many, often diverging modern branches and a variety of feminist and general political perspectives; some historically liberal branches are [[equality feminism]], [[social feminism]], [[equity feminism]], [[difference feminism]], [[individualist feminism|individualist/libertarian feminism]] and some forms of [[state feminism]], particularly the state feminism of the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Griffiths |first=Morwenna |date=April 1995 |title=Making a Difference: feminism, post‐modernism and the methodology of educational research |url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1080/0141192950210207 |journal=British Educational Research Journal |language=en |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=219–235 |doi=10.1080/0141192950210207 |issn=0141-1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broad field of liberal feminism is sometimes confused with the more recent and smaller branch known as libertarian feminism, which tends to diverge significantly from mainstream liberal feminism. For example, "libertarian feminism does not require social measures to reduce material inequality; in fact, it opposes such measures&amp;nbsp;... in contrast, liberal feminism may support such requirements and egalitarian versions of feminism insist on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mahowald |first1=Mary Briody |title=Genes, Women, Equality |date=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=145|chapter=Different Versions of Feminism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine Rottenberg notes that the [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of classic liberal feminism was "to pose an immanent critique of liberalism, revealing the gendered exclusions within liberal democracy's proclamation of universal equality, particularly with respect to the law, institutional access, and the full incorporation of women into the public sphere." Rottenberg contrasts classic liberal feminism with modern [[neoliberal]] feminism which "seems perfectly in sync with the evolving neoliberal order."&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/09502386.2013.857361|title = The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism|journal = [[Cultural Studies (journal)|Cultural Studies]]|volume = 28|issue = 3|pages = 418–437|year = 2014|last1 = Rottenberg|first1 = Catherine|s2cid = 144882102|url = http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/INFE/article/view/54954}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zhang and Rios, "liberal feminism tends to be adopted by 'mainstream' (i.e., middle-class) women who do not disagree with the current social structure." They found that liberal feminism with its focus on equality is viewed as the dominant and "default" form of feminism.&lt;ref name=ZhangRios&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Y. |last2=Rios |first2=K. |title=Understanding Perceptions of Radical and Liberal Feminists: The Nuanced Roles of Warmth and Competence |journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]]|date=2021 |volume=86 |issue=3–4 |pages=143–158 |doi=10.1007/s11199-021-01257-y|s2cid=243479502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern forms of feminism that historically grew out of the broader liberal tradition have more recently also been described as [[List of conservative feminisms|conservative]] in relative terms. This is particularly the case for libertarian feminism which conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-liberal/#ClasCri |title=Liberal Feminism |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radical feminism ===
[[File:Feminism symbol.svg|upright|thumb|right|The merged [[Venus symbol]] with [[raised fist]] is a common symbol of [[radical feminism]], one of the movements within feminism]]

[[Radical feminism]] arose from the [[radical politics|radical]] wing of second-wave feminism and calls for a radical reordering of society to eliminate [[male supremacy]]. It considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary.&lt;ref name="Echols" /&gt; [[Separatist feminism]] does not support heterosexual relationships. [[Lesbian feminism]] is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist.&lt;ref name="hooks"&gt;{{cite book|last=hooks |first=bell |author-link=Bell hooks |year=2000 |title=Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=South End Press |isbn=978-0-89608-629-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/feminismisforeve00hook }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materialist ideologies ===
[[File:Emma Goldman seated.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Emma Goldman]] a union activist, labour organizer and [[anarcha-feminist|feminist anarchist]]]]

[[Rosemary Hennessy]] and [[Chrys Ingraham]] say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of different (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Hennessy |first1= Rosemary |first2=Chrys |last2=Ingraham |title=Materialist Feminism: A Reader in Class, Difference, and Women's Lives |location= London |publisher=Routledge | pages=1–13 |isbn=978-0-415-91634-9 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist feminism]] argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies.&lt;ref name="Bottomore"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bottomore, T.B. |title=A Dictionary of Marxist Thought |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | page=215 |isbn=978-0-631-18082-1 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist feminism]] distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Socialist-Feminism.html |title=What is Socialist Feminism? |author=Barbara Ehrenreich |publisher=feministezine.com |access-date=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcha-feminism|Anarcha-feminists]] believe that [[class struggle]] and [[anarchism|anarchy]] against the [[State (polity)|state]]&lt;ref name="farrow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dunbar-Ortiz |first=Roxanne |title=Quiet Rumours |publisher=AK Press |isbn=978-1-902593-40-1 |year=2002 |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.

=== Other modern feminisms ===

According to 2014 [[Ipsos]] poll covering 15 developed countries, 53 percent of respondents identified as feminists, and 87 percent agreed that "women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency, not their gender". However, only 55 percent of women agreed that they have "full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations".&lt;ref name="ipsos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=6511|title=Can Men Be Feminists Too?

According to a 2015 poll, 18 percent of Americans use the label of "feminist" to describe themselves, while 85 percent are feminists in practice as they reported they believe in "equality for women".

== Sexuality ==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexuality}}
[[Feminist views on sexuality]] vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the [[sex industry]], sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the [[feminist sex wars]], which pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.&lt;ref name=Duggan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Karen Tranberg |last2=Philipson |first2=Ilene J. |title=Women, Class, and the Feminist Imagination: A Socialist-Feminist Reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-87722-630-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/womenclassfemini0000unse }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring Revolution: Second-Wave Feminism and the Rewriting of American Sexual Thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-11204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leidholdt |first1=Dorchen |author-link=Dorchen Leidholdt |last2=Raymond |first2=Janice G. |title=The Sexual Liberals and the Attack On Feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-08-037457-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |year=1989 |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=978-0-04-440593-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the [[sexual revolution]] from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and [[bisexuality|bisexual women]] as part of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=The Sex Wars, 1970s to 1980s |date=2008 |website=OutHistory|url=http://www.outhistory.org/exhibits/show/lesbians-20th-century/sex-wars}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex industry ===
{{main|Sex industry|Feminist views on pornography|Feminist views on prostitution|Feminist sex wars| Male prostitution#Feminist studies}}
Opinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists who are critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and reflect a woman's right to control and define her own sexuality. For the views of feminism on male prostitutes see the article on [[Male prostitution#Feminist studies|male prostitution]].

[[Individualist feminism|Individualist feminists]] support the existence of a sex industry on the grounds that adult women have the right to consent to sexual acts as they choose and should have access to [[labor rights]], to earn money how they choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.libertarianism.org/topics/sex-work |access-date=2023-08-31 |website=Libertarianism.org |title=Sex Work }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, banning the sex industry effectively strips women of their right to work and earn money on their own terms, treating them as children who cannot make decisions for themselves. In this view, women who consider the sex industry degrading do not have to partake in it. Women who do choose to work in the sex industry however should not be banned from doing so, given that they are doing so willingly. Libertarian Feminist Zine, [https://feministsforliberty.com/reclaim-volume-1-issue-1/ Reclaim], has argued that sex work has helped more women (including students, freelancers, and women in poverty) achieve financial independence than all [[Grant (money)|government grants]] combined. 

Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression and a legitimate career.&lt;ref name="Duggan"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex Wars: Sexual Dissent and Political Culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91036-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sexwarssexualdis0000dugg/page/1 1–14] |url=https://archive.org/details/sexwarssexualdis0000dugg/page/1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerhard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leidholdt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance" /&gt; Similarly, feminists' views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Affirming female sexual autonomy ===
{{See also|My body, my choice}}
For feminists, a woman's right to control her own [[Right to sexuality|sexuality]] is a key issue and one that is heavily contested between different branches of feminism. [[Radical feminism|Radical feminists]] such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Radical feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rohana Ariffin|author2=Women's Crisis Centre (Pinang, Malaysia)|title=Shame, Secrecy, and Silence: Study On Rape in Penang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfsDAQAAIAAJ|access-date=1 October 2011|year=1997|publisher=Women's Crisis Centre|isbn=978-983-99348-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett L, Manderson L, Astbury J. [http://academic.udayton.edu/health/01status/rape01.htm Mapping a global pandemic: review of current literature on rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment of women] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102214813/http://academic.udayton.edu/health/01status/rape01.htm |date=2 November 2012 }}. University of Melbourne, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Some radical feminists have argued that women should not engage in heterosexual sex, and choose [[Political lesbianism|lesbianism]] as a lifestyle and political choice, a view that has fallen out of favor, as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] is seen as largely biologically influenced rather than a choice one can make for political reasons.  

Some radical feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that deny women's right to sexual expression, because men under a patriarchy define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In some [[conservative]] and religious cultures marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jewkes R, Abrahams N |title= The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview|pmid=12365533|year=2002|volume=55|issue=7|pages=1231–44|journal=[[Social Science &amp; Medicine]]|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00242-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen P. Ending the presumption of consent: nonconsensual sex in marriage. London, Centre for Health and Gender Equity, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, radical feminist [[Anne Koedt]] argued in her essay ''[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]'' that women's biology and the [[Clitoris|clitoral]] orgasm had not been properly analyzed and popularized, because men "have orgasms essentially by friction with the vagina" and not the clitoral area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wahlquist|first=Calla|date=31 October 2020|title=The sole function of the clitoris is female orgasm.

Other branches of feminism such as individualist feminism consider themselves [[Sex-positive movement|sex-positive]], and see women's expression of their own sexuality as a right. In this view, what is or is not "degrading" is subjective, and each person has a right to decide for themselves what sexual acts they find degrading and if they want to participate in them or not. Individualist feminist, [[Wendy McElroy]] wrote in her book, [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/621306.XXX XXX: A Woman's Right to Pornography], "let's examine [...] the idea that pornography is degrading to women. Degrading is a subjective term. Personally, I find detergent commercials in which women become orgasmic over soapsuds to be tremendously degrading to women. I find movies in which prostitutes are treated like ignorant drug addicts to be slander against women. Every woman has the right—the need!—to define degradation for herself." 

According to this view, part of sexual autonomy is the right to define one's boundaries, desires and limits around their sexuality rather than accept a narrative in which all women are victims of men during a sex act.

Lynn Hankinson Nelson writes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women and to "uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them" to account for a range of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn|year=1990|title=Who Knows: from Quine To a Feminist Empiricism|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-0-87722-647-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/whoknowsfromquin0000nels/page/30 30]|url=https://archive.org/details/whoknowsfromquin0000nels/page/30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name="QCommRsrch"/&gt; Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cortina |first1=L.

One criticism of feminist epistemology is that it allows social and political values to influence its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1997|title=Feminism, Science, and the Philosophy of Science |publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4611-1|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Haack]] also points out that feminist epistemology reinforces traditional stereotypes about women's thinking (as intuitive and emotional, etc.); [[Meera Nanda]] further cautions that this may in fact trap women within "traditional gender roles and help justify patriarchy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/ |title=Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science |author=Anderson, Elizabeth |access-date=6 December 2011|year=2011 |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Spring 2011 |editor=Edward N.

Feminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects. As women earned doctorates in psychology, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study.

=== Businesses ===
{{See also|Feminist businesses}}
Feminist activists have established a range of [[feminist businesses]], including [[feminist bookstore]]s, credit unions, presses, mail-order catalogs and restaurants. These businesses flourished as part of the second and third waves of feminism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.{{sfnp|Echols|1989|pp=269–278}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminist Bookstore Movement: Lesbian Antiracism and Feminist Accountability|last=Hogan|first=Kristen|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2016|location=Durham, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Feminist art movement}}
Corresponding with general developments within feminism, and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Gopnik/&gt; Jeremy Strick, director of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles]], described the feminist art movement as "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period", and [[Peggy Phelan]] says that it "brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing over the past four decades".&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/20/AR2007042000400.html |title=What Is Feminist Art? |author=Blake Gopnik |date=22 April 2007 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist artist [[Judy Chicago]], who created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', a set of [[Vagina and vulva in art|vulva-themed ceramic plates]] in the 1970s, said in 2009 to ''[[ARTnews]]'', "There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] narrative.

The feminist movement produced [[feminist fiction]], feminist non-fiction, and [[feminist poetry]], which created new interest in [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]]. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel |title=The Feminist Companion to Literature in English: Women Writers from the Middle Ages to the Present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/feministcompanio00blai/page/ vii–x] |url=https://archive.org/details/feministcompanio00blai/page/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a close link between feminist literature and [[activism]], with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era.

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like [[Dale Spender]]'s ''[[Mothers of the Novel: 100 Good Women Writers Before Jane Austen|Mothers of the Novel]]'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing.

Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th- and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-link=Sandra Gilbert |first=Sandra M. |last=Gilbert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260 |title=Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel |work=The New York Times |date=4 May 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Broadview Press]] continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the [[University of Kentucky]] has a series of republications of early women's novels.

Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) by [[Virginia Woolf]], is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

The widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the [[literary canon]]. Interest in [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Literary genre|genres and subgenres]] have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies have entered new territories such as the "[[Gothic fiction#The female Gothic and The Supernatural Explained|female gothic]]"&lt;ref&gt;Term coined by Ellen Moers in ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' (New York: Doubleday, 1976). See also Juliann E. Fleenor, ed., ''The Female Gothic'' (Montreal: Eden Press, 1983) and Gary Kelly, ed., ''Varieties of Female Gothic'' 6 Vols. (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Women in science fiction|women's science fiction]].

According to Elyce Rae Helford, "Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Helford, Elyce Rae |editor-first=Gary |editor-last=Westfahl |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy |chapter=Feminist Science Fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/feministcompanio00blai/page/289 289–291] |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/feministcompanio00blai/page/289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15328023top1703_17 |title=Using Science Fiction to Teach the Psychology of Sex and Gender |year=1990 |last1=Lips |first1=Hilary M. |journal=[[Teaching of Psychology]] |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=197–98|s2cid=145519594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable texts of this kind are [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969), [[Joanna Russ]]' ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1970), [[Octavia Butler]]'s ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) and [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985).

Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, [[Maya Angelou]]'s ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2018/08/10/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-review-maya-angelou/|title=I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings: Angelou's Quest to Truth and Power|last=Shah|first=Mahvish|date=2018|website=Feminism in India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many feminist movements have embraced [[poetry]] as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/144696/a-change-of-world|title=A Change of World|last=Poetry Foundation|date=29 November 2018|website=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, historical pieces of writing by women have been used by feminists to speak about what women's lives were like in the past while demonstrating the power that they held and the impact they had in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Case|first=Sue-Ellen|date=December 1983|title=Re-Viewing Hrotsvit|journal=[[Theatre Journal]]|volume=35|issue=4|pages=533–542|doi=10.2307/3207334|jstor=3207334}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important figure in the history of women's literature is [[Hrotsvitha]] ({{Circa|935}}–973), a [[canoness]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scihi.org/hrotsvitha-gandersheim/|title=Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim – The Most Remarkable Women of her Time|last=Sack|first=Harald|date=6 February 2019|website=SciHi Blog|access-date=6 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was an early female poet in the German lands.

Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of [[Western canon|canon]], genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt; Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like [[Susan McClary]], [[Marcia Citron]] and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and education of women; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt;

While the [[music industry]] has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end|first=Jessica |last=Duchen |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[Record producer#Women in producing|music producers]], the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rosina |last=Ncube |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women in Audio? |website=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013 |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/people/sounding-why-so-few-women-audio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cinema ===
{{main|Feminist film theory}}
{{see also|Women's cinema}}

Feminist cinema, advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives, arose largely with the development of [[feminist film theory]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hayward|first=Susan|title=Cinema Studies – The Key Concepts|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2006|edition=3rd|pages=134–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences were particularly marked between [[Feminist film theory#History|feminists on either side of the Atlantic]]. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, ''[[Women &amp; Film]]''. Trailblazers from this period included [[Claire Johnston (film theorist)|Claire Johnston]] and [[Laura Mulvey]], who also organized the Women's Event at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival|Edinburgh Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Erens|first=Patricia Brett|title=Issues in Feminist Film Criticism|publisher=[[Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1991|isbn=9780253206107|pages=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include [[Teresa de Lauretis]], Anneke Smelik and [[Kaja Silverman]]. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.

It has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent, theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking. 'Deconstruction' concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema, aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema. The second approach, a feminist counterculture, embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kuhn |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Radstone |editor2-first=S. |title=Women's Companion to International Film |url=https://archive.org/details/womenscompaniont00kuhn |url-access=registration |publisher=Virago |year=1990 |page=[https://archive.org/details/womenscompaniont00kuhn/page/153 153]|isbn=9781853810817 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bracha L.

Feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the 20th century.

=== Socialism ===
{{main|Left-wing politics#Social progressivism and counterculture|Socialist feminism}}
Since the late 19th century, some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women's rights. [[August Bebel]], an early activist of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), published his work ''Die Frau und der Sozialismus'', juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In 1907 there was an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Stuttgart 1907|International Conference of Socialist Women]] in [[Stuttgart]] where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. [[Clara Zetkin]] of the SPD called for women's suffrage to build a "socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Badia, Gilbert |title=Zetkin.

In Britain, the women's movement was allied with the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]]. In the U.S., [[Betty Friedan]] emerged from a radical background to take leadership. [[Radical Women]] is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Radical Women Manifesto: Socialist Feminist Theory, Program and Organizational Structure |year=2001 |publisher=Red Letter Press |location=Seattle, WA |isbn=978-0-932323-11-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Dolores Ibárruri]] (''La Pasionaria'') led the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]].

Fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the [[Fascist manifesto]] in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary groups such as the ''fasci femminilli'' and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s more conservative coalition partners.&lt;ref name="hagg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hägg |first=Göran |year=2008 |title=Mussolini: En studie i makt |trans-title=A study in power |language=sv |publisher=Norstedt |location=Stockholm |isbn=978-91-1-301949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="passmore"&gt;{{cite book |last=Passmore |first=Kevin |author-link=Definitions of fascism#Kevin Passmore |year=2003 |title=Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–45 |publisher=Rutgers Univ.

Cyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], feminism has a complicated relationship with the [[Nazi]] movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment.&lt;ref name=Blamires&gt;{{cite book |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |last=Blamires |first=Cyprian |volume=1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-940-9 |pages=232–33|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism,&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt; and after the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period and to some extent during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=hww5/&gt; Georges Duby et al. write that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position.&lt;ref name=hww5&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duby |first1=Georges |last2=Perrot |first2=Michelle |last3=Schmitt Pantel |first3=Pauline |title=A History of Women in the West |year=1994 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-40369-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofwomenin00gold/page/600 600] |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofwomenin00gold/page/600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blamires also writes that [[Neo-fascism|neofascism]] has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept "their traditional roles".&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt;

=== Civil rights movement and anti-racism ===

The [[civil rights movement]] has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many American feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy |first=Peter |year=1998 |title=The Civil Rights Movement |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-29854-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/civilrightsmovem00levy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tensions arose during the late 1960s and the 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white, straight, and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with issues of race and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Code |first=Lorraine |title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories |chapter=Civil rights |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-13274-9 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0000unse |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0000unse }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist and homophobic elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns.&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=hooks|first=bell|date=3 October 2014|title=Feminist Theory|doi=10.4324/9781315743172|isbn=978-1-315-74317-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manditch-Prottas|first=Zachary|date=2019|title=Meeting at the Watchtower: Eldridge Cleaver, James Baldwin's No Name in the Street, and Racializing Homophobic Vernacular|journal=[[African American Review]]|volume=52|issue=2|pages=179–195|doi=10.1353/afa.2019.0027|s2cid=197851021|issn=1945-6182}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms created new feminist social theories about identity politics and the intersections of [[racism]], classism, and sexism; they also generated new feminisms such as black feminism and [[Chicana feminism]] in addition to making large contributions to lesbian feminism and other integrations of [[Queer of color critique|queer of colour]] identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roth |first=Benita |title=Separate Roads to Feminism: Black, Chicana, and White Feminist Movements in America's Second Wave |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-52972-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/separateroadstof00roth }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winddance Twine |first1=France |first2=Kathleen M. |last2=Blee |title=Feminism and Antiracism: International Struggles for Justice |publisher=NYU Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8147-9855-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/feminismantiraci0000unse }}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title="The Combahee River Collective Statement" (1977)|work=Available Means|pages=292–300|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-7975-3|doi=10.2307/j.ctt5hjqnj.50|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neoliberalism ===

[[Neoliberalism]] has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe, especially in the global south. Masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=V.

Proponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing women's participation in the workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have stated that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations.&lt;ref name="elias"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elias |first1=Juanita |last2=Ferguson |first2=Lucy |year=2014 |chapter=Production, Employment, and Consumption |editor-last=Shepherd | editor-first=Laura J. |title=Gender Matters in Global Politics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-75259-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|186–98}} Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women's subordination in the family and the workplace.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|176}} The "feminization of employment" refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe and secure.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|179}} Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|180}} Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part in this, for instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as 'secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.&lt;ref name="elias"/&gt;{{rp|189}}

== Societal impact ==
{{Main|Feminist effects on society}}
The feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; greater access to education; more equal payment to men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the right to own property.&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"/&gt;

From the 1960s on, the campaign for women's rights&lt;ref name="quarterly"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Lockwood, Bert B. |title=Women's Rights: A Human Rights Quarterly Reader |year=2006 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8374-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/womensrightshuma0000unse }}&lt;/ref&gt; was met with mixed results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Jo Freeman |last=Freeman |first=Jo |url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=From Suffrage to Women's Liberation: Feminism in Twentieth Century America}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. and the U.K. Other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.

Some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to [[child sexual abuse]]. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men's responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rush |first=Florence |author-link=Florence Rush |year=1988 |title=The Best Kept Secret: Sexual Abuse of Children |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs |isbn=978-0-07-054223-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) began in 1966 to seek women's equality, including through the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://now.org/about/history/statement-of-purpose/|title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose|newspaper=National Organization for Women – |date=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not pass, although [[Equal Rights Amendment#State constitutions|some states enacted their own]]. Reproductive rights in the U.S. centred on the court decision in [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe'' v. ''Wade'']] enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable [[birth control]], allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under [[Margaret Sanger]] and elsewhere under [[Marie Stopes]]. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through birth control, which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1676.html|title=Margaret Sanger}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|reason=Self-published source.|date=November 2021}}

The [[division of labor|division of labour]] within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework,&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |author2=Machung, Anne |title=The Second Shift |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-14-200292-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild2"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |title=The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work |year=2001 |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8050-6643-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/timebind00arli_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Cathy Young]] responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/|title=The Mama Lion at the Gate |access-date=17 December 2015 |work=Salon.com |author=Young, Cathy |author-link=Cathy Young|date=12 June 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith K. Brown writes, "Women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics: the participant is not obliged to be far from home; the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration and the work is not dangerous, can be performed in spite of interruptions, and is easily resumed once interrupted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Judith K. | last = Brown | title = A Note on the Division of Labor by Sex | date = October 1970 | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 1073–78 | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | doi=10.1525/aa.1970.72.5.02a00070| doi-access =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international law, the ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]'' (CEDAW) is an international convention adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women. It came into force in those nations ratifying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CEDAW.aspx|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women New York, 18 December 1979 |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|access-date=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisprudence ===
{{Main|Feminist legal theory}}

Feminist jurisprudence is a branch of [[jurisprudence]] that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights.&lt;ref name="blacks"&gt;{{cite book |year=2014 |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Bryan |editor-link=Bryan A. Garner |title=[[Black's Law Dictionary]] |edition=10th |location=St. Paul, Minn. |publisher=Thomson Reuters |page=985 |isbn=978-0-314-61300-4 |quote=Feminist jurisprudence examines&amp;nbsp;... the history of legal and social biases against women, the elimination of those biases in modern law, and the enhancement of women's legal rights and recognition [status] in society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the [[Philosophy of law|philosophical approach]] of modern [[Law#Legal theory|legal scholars]], who typically see the law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.&lt;ref name="minda"&gt;{{cite book |last=Minda |first=Gary |year=1995 |title=Postmodern Legal Movements: Law and Jurisprudence at Century's End |publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]] |location=N.Y.C. |isbn=978-0-8147-5510-5 |pages=129–30 |quote=Feminist legal scholars, despite their differences, appear united in claiming that 'masculine' jurisprudence&amp;nbsp;... fails to acknowledge, let alone respond to, the interests, values, fears, and harms experienced by women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language ===

Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.&lt;ref name=Bundesen&gt;{{cite book |author=Bundesen, Lynne |title=The Feminine Spirit: Recapturing the Heart of Scripture |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-8495-3|date=30 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian feminism]] is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the [[Christian egalitarianism|equality]] of [[Women in Christianity|women]] and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the [[ordination of women]], male dominance and the balance of parenting in [[Christian views on marriage|Christian marriage]], claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church.&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haddad, Mimi |title=Egalitarian Pioneers: Betty Friedan or Catherine Booth? |journal=[[Priscilla Papers]] |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=2006 |url=http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713193304/http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |archive-date=13 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=andeson&gt;{{cite book |author=Anderson, Pamela Sue |author2=Clack, Beverley |title=Feminist Philosophy of Religion: Critical Readings |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-25749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic feminism|Islamic feminists]] advocate women's rights, gender equality, and [[social justice]] grounded within an Islamic framework.

[[Buddhist feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and [[social status]] of [[Women in Buddhism|women within Buddhism]]. It is an aspect of [[feminist theology]] which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective. The Buddhist feminist [[Rita Gross]] describes Buddhist feminism as "the radical practice of the co-humanity of women and men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism|last= Gross|first= Rita M.|year= 1992|publisher= [[State University of New York Press]]|location= Albany, New York|isbn= 978-0-7914-1403-3|page= [https://archive.org/details/buddhismafterpat00gros/page/127 127]|access-date=7 October 2012 |url=https://archive.org/details/buddhismafterpat00gros |url-access= registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of [[Women in Judaism|women]] within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women.

Patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system, fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege and is dependent on female subordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Encyclopedia of sex and gender |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |location=Detroit, Mich.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women.

Feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality. The social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition, and reinforces patriarchal and unequal gender relations.&lt;ref name="Faludi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tong |first=Rosemarie Putnam |title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction |location=Boulder, Colo. |publisher=Westview Press |edition=2nd |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8133-3295-6 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchal cultures are criticized for "limiting forms of masculinity" available to men and thus narrowing their life choices.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardiner |first1=Judith Kegan |title=Masculinity Studies and Feminist Theory |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-12278-8 |pages =96, 153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminists are engaged with men's issues activism, such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uviller | first1 = Rena K. | year = 1978 | title = Fathers' Rights and Feminism: The Maternal Presumption Revisited | journal = [[Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender|Harvard Women's Law Journal]] | page = 107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shanley |first=Mary |date=January 1995 |title=Unwed fathers' rights, adoption, and sex equality: Gender-neutrality and the perpetuation of patriarchy |jstor=1123127 |journal=[[Columbia Law Review]] |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=60–103 |doi=10.2307/1123127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levit |first=Nancy |title=Feminism for Men: Legal Ideology and the Construction of Maleness |journal=[[UCLA Law Review]] |volume=43 |number=4 |year=1996 |ssrn=1297365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male participation in feminism is generally encouraged by feminists and is seen as an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality.&lt;ref name="hooks" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Digby, Tom (1998).

== Reactions ==

Different groups of people have responded to feminism, and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics. Among American university students, for both men and women, support for feminist ideas is more common than self-identification as a feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00159.x |title=Disavowing Social Identities: What It Means when Women Say, 'I'm Not a Feminist, but&amp;nbsp;...' |year=2004 |last1=Zucker |first1=Alyssa N. |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=423–35|s2cid=144528255 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1007044802798 |year=2000 |last1=Burn |first1=Shawn Meghan |last2=Aboud |first2=Roger |last3=Moyles |first3=Carey |title=The Relationship Between Gender Social Identity and Support for Feminism |journal=Sex Roles |volume=42 |issue=11/12 |pages=1081–89|s2cid=17743495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00289954 |title=New wave or second stage?

=== Pro-feminism ===
{{main|Pro-feminism}}
Pro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, [[men's studies]], and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.&lt;ref name=Lingard&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Lingard |first1=Bob |last2=Douglas |first2=Peter |title=Men Engaging Feminisms: Pro-Feminism, Backlashes and Schooling |year=1999 |publisher=Open University Press |location=Buckingham, England |isbn=978-0-335-19818-4 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimmel-Tide"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Kimmel |first1=Michael S. |author-link1=Michael Kimmel |last2=Mosmiller |first2=Thomas E. |title=Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776–1990: A Documentary History |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-6767-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/againsttide00rces }}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-feminism and criticism of feminism ===
{{Anchor|Critique of Feminism and Anti-feminism|Criticism of feminism and anti-feminism}} &lt;!-- Former name --&gt;
{{main|Antifeminism}}
Anti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Simpson | first1 = John A. | last2 = Weiner | first2 = Edmund S.C. | author-link1 = John Simpson (lexicographer) | author-link2 = Edmund Weiner | contribution = Anti-feminist | editor-last1 = Simpson | editor-first1 = John A. | editor-last2 = Weiner | editor-first2 = Edmund S.

In the 19th century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWj5OBvTh1IC&amp;pg=PA35 |chapter=Antifeminism |first=Michael |last=Kimmel |author-link=Michael Kimmel | editor-last1 = Kimmel | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Aronson | editor-first2 = Amy | editor-link1 = Michael Kimmel | editor-link2 = Amy Aronson | title = Men and Masculinities a Social, Cultural, and Historical Encyclopedia | pages = 35–37 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-57607-774-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. Some anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lukas | first = Carrie | author-link = Carrie Lukas | contribution = Marriage: happier ever after | editor-last = Lukas | editor-first = Carrie | editor-link = Carrie Lukas | title = The politically incorrect guide to women, sex, and feminism | page = [https://archive.org/details/politicallyincor0000luka/page/75 75] | publisher = Regency Publishing | location = Washington, DC Lanham, Maryland | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-59698-003-7 | quote = Feminists' assault on marriage also has played a role in devaluing marriage.

This goal must be achieved at any at all costs – to the woman herself, to the baby, to the family, and to society. Women must be made equal to men in their ability ''not'' to become pregnant and ''not'' to be expected to care for babies they may bring into the world. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification |date=June 2023|reason=Can't find any occurance of "anti-feminist", all I see is about radical feminists.}} Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gottfried |first=Paul | author-link = Paul Gottfried |title=The trouble with feminism |url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/04/paul-gottfried/the-trouble-with-feminism/ | work = [[LewRockwell.com]] |publisher= [[Lew Rockwell]] |date= 21 April 2001 |access-date=30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = al-Qaradawi | first = Yusuf | author-link = Yusuf al-Qaradawi | contribution = Women and family in Islamist discourses: 'When Islam prohibits something, it closes all the avenues of approach to it'| editor-last = Calvert | editor-first = John | editor-link = John Calvert (scholar) | title = Islamism: a documentary and reference guide | page = 62 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-313-33856-4 | quote = Islamists are aggrieved at the support of ostensibly Muslim governments for the 'alleged' legal emancipation of women, including granting women the right to vote and hold public office, in addition to limited rights to initiate divorce.

=== Secular humanism ===

[[Secular humanism]] is an ethical framework that attempts to dispense with any unreasoned dogma, pseudoscience, and superstition. Critics of feminism sometimes ask "Why feminism and not humanism?". Some humanists argue, however, that the goals of feminists and humanists largely overlap, and the distinction is only in motivation. For example, a humanist may consider abortion in terms of a utilitarian ethical framework, rather than considering the motivation of any particular woman in getting an abortion. In this respect, it is possible to be a humanist without being a feminist, but this does not preclude the existence of feminist humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Doran |first1=Tatiana |last2=West |first2=Robin |title=Feminism or Humanism? |journal=[[Yale Law Journal]] |date=June 1998 |volume=107 |issue=8 |pages=2661 |doi=10.2307/797353 |jstor=797353 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Cordelia Tucker|last= O'Sullivan |title=Why Humanism and feminism go hand in hand |url=http://humanistlife.org.uk/2015/03/07/why-humanism-and-feminism-go-hand-in-hand/ |website=HumanistLife |access-date=9 January 2019 |date=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanism played a significant role in protofeminism during the Renaissance period in such that humanists made educated women popular figures despite the challenge of the patriarchal organization of society.&lt;ref name="Ross-2009"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth of Feminism: Woman As Intellect in Renaissance Italy and England|last=Ross, Sarah Gwyneth, 1975–|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03454-9|oclc=517501929}}&lt;/ref&gt;
