'''Cancel culture''' or '''call-out culture''' is a phrase contemporary to the late [[2010s]] and early [[2020s]] used to refer to a form of [[Ostracism#Modern usage|ostracism]] in which someone is thrust out of social or professional circles – whether it be online, on [[social media]], or in person. Those subject to this ostracism are said to have been "cancelled".&lt;ref name="McDermott"&gt;{{Cite news |last=McDermott |first=John |date=November 2, 2019 |title=Those People We Tried to Cancel?

In March 2014, activist [[Suey Park]] called out "a blatantly racist tweet about Asians" from the official Twitter account of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' using the hashtag #cancelColbert, which generated widespread outrage against [[Stephen Colbert]] and an even greater amount of backlash against Park, even though the ''Colbert Report'' tweet was a satirical tweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Park |first1=Suey &amp; Eunsong Kim |title=We Want To #CancelColbert |url=https://time.com/42174/we-want-to-cancelcolbert/ |access-date=July 29, 2021 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Here's What Happened to the Woman Who Started #CancelColbert |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/02/cancelcolbert-what-happened/ |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |access-date=July 29, 2021 |date=February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By around 2015, the concept of canceling had become widespread on [[Black Twitter]] to refer to a personal decision, sometimes seriously and sometimes in jest, to stop supporting a person or work.&lt;ref name=mcgrady&gt;{{cite news |last1=McGrady |first1=Clyde |title=The strange journey of 'cancel,' from a Black-culture punchline to a White-grievance watchword |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/cancel-culture-background-black-culture-white-grievance/2021/04/01/2e42e4fe-8b24-11eb-aff6-4f720ca2d479_story.html |access-date=April 10, 2021 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 2, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mishan&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mishan |first1=Ligaya |title=The Long and Tortured History of Cancel Culture |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/t-magazine/cancel-culture-history.html |access-date=April 10, 2021 |work=T |date=December 3, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Romano |first1=Aja |title=Why we can't stop fighting about cancel culture |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/12/30/20879720/what-is-cancel-culture-explained-history-debate |access-date=April 10, 2021 |work=Vox |date=August 25, 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jonah Engel Bromwich of ''[[The New York Times]]'', this usage of the word "cancellation" indicates the "total disinvestment in something (anything)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bromwich |first1=Jonah Engel |title=Everyone Is Canceled |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/style/is-it-canceled.html |access-date=April 10, 2021 |work=The New York Times |date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drag them"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=D.

===Etymology===
The 1981 [[Chic (band)|Chic]] album ''[[Take It Off (album)|Take It Off]]'' includes the song "Your Love Is Cancelled" which compares a breakup to the [[cancellation (broadcasting)|cancellation]] of TV shows. The song was written by [[Nile Rodgers]] following a bad date Rodgers had with a woman who expected him to misuse his celebrity status on her behalf. "Your Love Is Cancelled" inspired screenwriter [[Barry Michael Cooper]] to include a reference to a woman being "cancelled" in the 1991 film ''[[New Jack City]]''.&lt;ref name=mcgrady/&gt; This usage introduced the term to [[African-American Vernacular English]], where it eventually became more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Webster |first=Dr Elizabeth N. |date=2021-12-24 |title=Cancel Culture Will Not Be Canceled. |url=https://medium.com/afrosapiophile/cancel-culture-will-not-be-canceled-22d46f0829c6 |access-date=2022-03-03 |website=AfroSapiophile |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic analysis ==
An article written by [[Pippa Norris]], a professor at Harvard University, states that the controversies surrounding cancel culture are between the ones who argue it gives a voice to those in marginalized communities, while the opposing side argues cancel culture is dangerous because it prevents free speech and/or the opportunity for open debate.&lt;ref name="Norris 003232172110370"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Norris |first=Pippa |date=2021-08-11 |title=Cancel Culture: Myth or Reality? |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00323217211037023 |journal=Political Studies |pages=003232172110370 |doi=10.1177/00323217211037023 |s2cid=238647612 |issn=0032-3217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris emphasizes the role of social media in contributing to the rise of cancel culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ng |first=Eve |date=2020-07-26 |title=No Grand Pronouncements Here...: Reflections on Cancel Culture and Digital Media Participation |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1527476420918828 |journal=Television &amp; New Media |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=621–627 |doi=10.1177/1527476420918828 |s2cid=220853829 |issn=1527-4764}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris 003232172110370"/&gt; Additionally, online communications studies have demonstrated the intensification of cultural wars through activists that are connected through digital and social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bouvier |first1=Gwen |last2=Machin |first2=David |date=2021-04-15 |title=What gets lost in Twitter 'cancel culture' hashtags?

In the book ''[[The Coddling of the American Mind]]'' (2018), social psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]] and free-speech activist [[Greg Lukianoff]] argue that call-out culture arises on college campuses from what they term "safetyism:" a moral culture in which people are unwilling to make tradeoffs demanded by the practical or moral concerns of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Safetyism Isn't the Problem |url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/safetyism-isnt-the-problem.html |access-date=2022-03-03 |website=Association for Psychological Science - APS |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haidt"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |author-link1=Jonathan Haidt |last2=Lukianoff |first2=Greg |author-link2=Greg Lukianoff |title=[[The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure]]  |publisher=Penguin Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-7352-2489-6 |location=New York City |oclc=1007552624 }}; For ''safetyism'', see {{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9-o6DwAAQBAJ&amp;q=safetyism+call-out+culture  | title = The Coddling of the American Mind | pages = 30, 158, 235, 268, 329| isbn = 978-0-7352-2490-2 | last1 = Lukianoff | first1 = Greg | last2 = Haidt | first2 = Jonathan | date = September 4, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Hampton]], professor of media studies at [[Michigan State University]], contends that the practice contributes to the [[Political polarization in the United States|polarization of American society]], but does not lead to changes in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=[[Agence France Presse]] |date=July 22, 2020 |title=La "cancel culture", nouvelle arme des anonymes et facteur de polarisation |url=https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2020/07/22/la-cancel-culture-nouvelle-arme-des-anonymes-et-facteur-de-polarisation |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727073137/https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2020/07/22/la-cancel-culture-nouvelle-arme-des-anonymes-et-facteur-de-polarisation |archive-date=July 27, 2020 |access-date=July 24, 2020 |website=[[Le Journal de Montréal]] |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancel culture has been described by media studies scholar Eve Ng as "a collective of typically marginalized voices 'calling out' and emphatically expressing their censure of a powerful figure."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ng |first=Eve |date=July 26, 2020 |title=No Grand Pronouncements Here&amp;nbsp;...: Reflections on Cancel Culture and Digital Media Participation |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1527476420918828 |volume=21 |issue=16 |pages=621–627 |doi=10.1177/1527476420918828 |access-date=February 12, 2021 |journal=Television and New Media |s2cid=220853829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies scholar [[Frances E.

Professor [[Joshua Knobe]], of the Philosophy Department at [[Yale University|Yale]], contends that public denunciation is not effective, and that society is too quick to pass judgement against those they view as public offenders or ''[[persona non grata]]''. Knobe asserts that these actions have the opposite effect on individuals, and that it is best to bring attention to the positive actions in which most of society participates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Stein |first=J. |date=August 13, 2015 |title=I'm making the case for public shaming-unless you publicly shame me for doing so |magazine=Time |url=https://time.com/3995794/im-making-the-case-for-public-shaming-unless-you-publicly-shame-me-for-doing-so/ |access-date=March 8, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|A Letter on Justice and Open Debate}}

A response letter organized by lecturer Arionne Nettles, "A More Specific Letter on Justice and Open Debate", was signed by over 160 people in academia and media. It criticized the ''Harper's'' letter as a plea to end cancel culture by successful professionals with large platforms who wanted to exclude others who have been "cancelled for generations.” The writers ultimately stated that the ''Harper's'' letter was intended to further silence already marginalized people. They wrote: "It reads as a caustic reaction to a diversifying industry — one that's starting to challenge diversifying norms that have protected bigotry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Schuessler |first=Jennifer |date=July 10, 2020 |title=An Open Letter on Free Expression Draws a Counterblast |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/arts/open-letter-debate.html |access-date=July 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Roberts |first=Mikenzie |date=July 13, 2020 |title=Harper's letter and response signed by Northwestern academics |url=https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/07/12/campus/northwestern-academics-clash-with-opposing-letters-on-free-speech-cancel-culture/ |access-date= July 18, 2020 |website=The Daily Northwestern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American public opinion ===
A survey conducted on 10,000 Americans by [[Pew Research Center]] asked a series of different questions in regard to cancel culture, specifically on who has heard of the term cancel culture and how Americans define cancel culture.&lt;ref name="Vogels"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Vogels |first1=Emily A. |last2=Monica |last3=erson |last4=Porteus |first4=Margaret |last5=Baronavski |first5=Chris |last6=Atske |first6=Sara |last7=McClain |first7=Colleen |last8=Auxier |first8=Brooke |last9=Perrin |first9=rew |date=2021-05-19 |title=Americans and 'Cancel Culture': Where Some See Calls for Accountability, Others See Censorship, Punishment |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/05/19/americans-and-cancel-culture-where-some-see-calls-for-accountability-others-see-censorship-punishment/ |access-date=2022-03-03 |website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2020, 44% of Americans said that they have at least heard a fair amount about the new phrase, while 22% have heard a great deal and 32% said they have heard nothing at all.&lt;ref name="Vogels"/&gt; 43% Americans aged 18–29 have heard a great deal about cancel culture, compared to only 12% of Americans over the age of 65 who say they have heard a great deal.&lt;ref name="Vogels"/&gt; Additionally, within that same study, the 44% of Americans who had heard a great deal about cancel culture, were then asked how they defined cancel culture. 49% of those Americans state that it describes actions people take to hold others accountable, 14% describe cancel culture as censorship of speech or history, and 12% define it as mean-spirited actions taken to cause others harm.&lt;ref name="Vogels"/&gt; It was found that men were more likely to have heard or know of cancel culture, and that those who identify with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] (46%) are more likely to know the term than those in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (44%).&lt;ref name="Vogels" /&gt;

A poll of American registered voters conducted by [[Morning Consult]] in July 2020 showed that cancel culture, defined as "the practice of withdrawing support for (or canceling) public figures and companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive", was common: 40% of respondents said they had withdrawn support from public figures and companies, including on social media, because they had done or said something considered objectionable or offensive, with 8% having engaged in this often. Behavior differed according to age, with a majority (55%) of voters 18 to 34 years old saying they have taken part in cancel culture, while only about a third (32%) of voters over 65 said they had joined a social media pile-on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lizza |first=Ryan |date=July 22, 2020 |title=Americans tune in to 'cancel culture' — and don't like what they see |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/americans-cancel-culture-377412 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723040244/https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/americans-cancel-culture-377412 |archive-date=July 23, 2020 |access-date=July 22, 2020 |website=[[Politico]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude towards the practice was mixed, with 44% of respondents saying they disapproved of cancel culture, 32% who approved, and 24% who did not know or had no opinion. Furthermore, 46% believed cancel culture had gone too far, with only 10% thinking it had not gone far enough. Additionally, 53% believed that people should expect social consequences for expressing unpopular opinions in public, such as those that may be construed as deeply offensive to other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Morning Consult |author-link=Morning Consult |last2=Politico |author-link2=Politico |date=July 2020 |title=National tracking poll, July 17-19, 2020 |url=https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000173-7326-d36e-abff-7ffe72dc0000 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200722192513/https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000173-7326-d36e-abff-7ffe72dc0000 |archive-date=July 22, 2020 |website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2021 poll by the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] Center for American Political Studies and [[the Harris Poll]] found that 64% of respondents viewed "a growing cancel culture" as a threat to their freedom, while the other 36% did not. 36% of respondents said that cancel culture is a big problem, 32% called it a moderate problem, 20% called it a small problem, and 13% said it is not a problem. 54% said they were concerned that if they expressed their opinions online, they would be banned or fired, while the other 46% said they were not concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Manchester |first1=Julia |title=64 percent view 'cancel culture' as threat to freedom: poll |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/545387-64-percent-say-they-view-cancel-culture-as-a-threat-to-their-freedom-poll |access-date=April 27, 2021 |work=The Hill |date=March 29, 2021 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[C. J. Coventry]] argues that the term has been incorrectly applied, and that it more accurately reflects the propensity of people to hide historical instances of injustice.&lt;ref name="Coventry 2020"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:33351/|title=A New Birth of Freedom: South Australia, slavery and exceptionalism|first=C.

If you look through Australian history, as well as European and American history, you will find countless examples of people speaking out against injustice and being persecuted in return. I can think of a number of people in our own time who are being persecuted by supposedly democratic governments for revealing uncomfortable information."&lt;ref name="Coventry 2020"/&gt;}} Another historian, [[David Olusoga]], made a similar argument, and said it is not limited to the left.&lt;ref name="Olusoga2021"&gt;{{Cite news |date=January 3, 2021 |title='Cancel culture' is not the preserve of the left.

According to Scalia, cancel culture can interfere with the [[right to counsel]], as some lawyers would not be willing to risk their personal and professional reputation on controversial topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Scalia |first=Eugene |date=2021 |title=John Adams, Legal Representation, and the 'Cancel Culture' |journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=333–338 |via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Manavis wrote for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine that while free speech advocates are more likely to make accusations of ''cancel culture'', criticism is part of free speech and rarely results in consequences for those in power who are criticized. She argues that social media is an extension and reincarnation of a longer tradition of expression in a liberal society, "a new space for historical power structures to be solidified" and that online criticism by people who do not hold actual power in society tends to not affect existing power structures. She adds that most prominent people who criticized public opinion as canceling still have highly profitable businesses and concludes by saying, "So even if you fear the monster under the bed, it will never do you harm. It can't, because it was never there in the first place. Repercussions rarely come for those in power. Why punch down, when you've already won?"&lt;ref name="NewStatesman2020"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2020/07/cancel-culture-does-not-exist|magazine=[[New Statesman]]|date=July 16, 2020|title='Cancel culture' does not exist|first=Sarah|last=Manavis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consequence culture ===
