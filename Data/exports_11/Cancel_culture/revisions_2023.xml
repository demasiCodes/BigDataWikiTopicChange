'''Cancel culture''' is a phrase contemporary to the late 2010s and early 2020s used to refer to a culture  in which those who are deemed to have acted or spoken in an unacceptable manner are [[Ostracism|ostracized]], [[boycott]]ed, or [[Shunning|shunned]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Munro |first=Ealasaid |date=August 23, 2013 |title=Feminism: A Fourth Wave? |url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa/news/feminism-fourth-wave |url-status=live |journal=Political Insight |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=22–25 |doi=10.1111/2041-9066.12021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210124315/https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa/news/feminism-fourth-wave |archive-date=December 10, 2019 |access-date=April 29, 2020 |s2cid=142990260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sills |first1=Sophie |last2=Pickens |first2=Chelsea |last3=Beach |first3=Karishma |last4=Jones |first4=Lloyd |last5=Calder-Dawe |first5=Octavia |last6=Benton-Greig |first6=Paulette |last7=Gavey |first7=Nicola |date=March 23, 2016 |title=Rape culture and social media: young critics and a feminist counterpublic |journal=Feminist Media Studies |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=935–951 |doi=10.1080/14680777.2015.1137962 |s2cid=147023782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bromwich 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Yar |first1=Sanam |last2=Bromwich |first2=Jonah Engel |date=October 31, 2019 |title=Tales From the Teenage Cancel Culture |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/style/cancel-culture.html |url-status=live |access-date=July 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200601235105/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/style/cancel-culture.html |archive-date=June 1, 2020 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cancel culture" is predominantly used when these responses are to [[American conservative|right-wing]] actions or speech, but is rare when the responses are to [[American progressive|left-wing]] actions or speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/07/09/1014744289/cancel-culture-debate-has-early-90s-roots-political-correctness |access-date=June 20, 2023 |title=How Cancel Culture Became Politicized — Just Like Political Correctness |last1=Shapiro |first1=Ari |author-link=Ari Shapiro |last2=Marquez Janse |first2=Alejandra |last3=Venkat |first3=Mia |last4=Caldwell |first4=Noah |last5=Jarenwattananon |first5=Patrick |date=July 26, 2021 |website=www.npr.org |publisher=National Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|group=examples|''For example, ostracizing someone for being communist ([[McCarthyism]]), gay ([[Don't Say Gay]]), or foreign ([[Trump wall]]) is not usually called "cancellation".}} This shunning may extend to social or professional circles—whether on [[social media]] or in person—with most high-profile incidents involving [[Celebrity|celebrities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McDermott |first=John |date=November 2, 2019 |title=Those People We Tried to Cancel?

The 1981 [[Chic (band)|Chic]] album ''[[Take It Off (album)|Take It Off]]'' includes the song "Your Love Is Cancelled", which compares a breakup to the [[cancellation (broadcasting)|cancellation]] of TV shows. The song was written by [[Nile Rodgers]] following a bad date Rodgers had with a woman who expected him to misuse his celebrity status on her behalf. "Your Love Is Cancelled" inspired screenwriter [[Barry Michael Cooper]] to include a reference to a woman being canceled in the 1991 film ''[[New Jack City]]''.&lt;ref name=mcgrady/&gt; This usage introduced the term to [[African-American Vernacular English]], where it eventually became more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Webster |first= Elizabeth N. |date=2021-12-24 |title=Cancel Culture Will Not Be Canceled |url=https://medium.com/afrosapiophile/cancel-culture-will-not-be-canceled-22d46f0829c6 |access-date=2022-03-03 |website=AfroSapiophile }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic analysis ==
An article written by [[Pippa Norris]], a professor at Harvard University, states that the controversies surrounding cancel culture are between the ones who argue it gives a voice to those in marginalized communities, while the opposing side argues cancel culture is dangerous because it prevents free speech and/or the opportunity for open debate. Norris emphasizes the role of social media in contributing to the rise of cancel culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ng |first=Eve |date=2020-07-26 |title=No Grand Pronouncements Here...: Reflections on Cancel Culture and Digital Media Participation |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1527476420918828 |journal=Television &amp; New Media |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=621–627 |doi=10.1177/1527476420918828 |s2cid=220853829 |issn=1527-4764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, online communications studies have demonstrated the intensification of cultural wars through activists that are connected through digital and social networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bouvier |first1=Gwen |last2=Machin |first2=David |date=2021-04-15 |title=What gets lost in Twitter 'cancel culture' hashtags?

In the book ''[[The Coddling of the American Mind]]'' (2018), social psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]] and free-speech activist [[Greg Lukianoff]] argue that call-out culture arises on college campuses from what they term "safetyism"—a moral culture in which people are unwilling to make tradeoffs demanded by the practical or moral concerns of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |author-link1=Jonathan Haidt |last2=Lukianoff |first2=Greg |author-link2=Greg Lukianoff |title=[[The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure]]  |publisher=Penguin Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-7352-2489-6 |location=New York City |oclc=1007552624 }} For ''safetyism'', see {{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9-o6DwAAQBAJ&amp;q=safetyism+call-out+culture  | title = The Coddling of the American Mind | pages = 30, 158, 235, 268, 329| isbn = 978-0-7352-2490-2 | last1 = Lukianoff | first1 = Greg | last2 = Haidt | first2 = Jonathan | date = September 4, 2018 | publisher = Penguin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Bradley|last2= Paresky |first2=Pamela |date=June 1, 2020 |title=Safetyism Isn't the Problem |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/opinion/safetyism-coronavirus-reopening.html |access-date=December 20, 2022 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 15, 2020|title=Safetyism Isn't the Problem |url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/safetyism-isnt-the-problem.html |publisher=Association for Psychological Science|access-date=December 20, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Hampton]], professor of media studies at [[Michigan State University]], contends that the practice contributes to [[political polarization in the United States]] but does not lead to changes in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=[[Agence France Presse]] |date=July 22, 2020 |title=La "cancel culture", nouvelle arme des anonymes et facteur de polarisation |url=https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2020/07/22/la-cancel-culture-nouvelle-arme-des-anonymes-et-facteur-de-polarisation |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727073137/https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2020/07/22/la-cancel-culture-nouvelle-arme-des-anonymes-et-facteur-de-polarisation |archive-date=July 27, 2020 |access-date=July 24, 2020 |work=[[Le Journal de Montréal]] |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancel culture has been described by media studies scholar Eve Ng as "a collective of typically marginalized voices 'calling out' and emphatically expressing their censure of a powerful figure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ng |first=Eve |date=July 26, 2020 |title=No Grand Pronouncements Here&amp;nbsp;...: Reflections on Cancel Culture and Digital Media Participation |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1527476420918828 |volume=21 |issue=16 |pages=621–627 |doi=10.1177/1527476420918828 |access-date=February 12, 2021 |journal=Television and New Media |s2cid=220853829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural studies scholar [[Frances E.

=== Open letter ===
{{main|A Letter on Justice and Open Debate}}
Dalvin Brown, writing in ''[[USA Today]]'', has described an open letter signed by 153 public figures and published in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' as marking a "high point" in the debate on the topic.&lt;ref name="Brown 2020" /&gt; The letter set out arguments against "an intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism, and the tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a blinding moral certainty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=July 7, 2020 |title=A Letter on Justice and Open Debate |url=https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723175921/https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/ |archive-date=July 23, 2020 |website=[[Harper's Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=JK Rowling joins 150 public figures warning over free speech|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53330105 | date= July 8, 2020 |work=BBC |access-date=July 23, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Chiu |first=Allyson |date=July 8, 2020 |title=Letter signed by J.K.

A response letter organized by lecturer Arionne Nettles, "A More Specific Letter on Justice and Open Debate", was signed by over 160 people in academia and media. It criticized the ''Harper's'' letter as a plea to end cancel culture by successful professionals with large platforms who wanted to exclude others who have been "canceled for generations.” The writers ultimately stated that the ''Harper's'' letter was intended to further silence already marginalized people. They wrote: "It reads as a caustic reaction to a diversifying industry — one that's starting to challenge diversifying norms that have protected bigotry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Schuessler |first=Jennifer |date=July 10, 2020 |title=An Open Letter on Free Expression Draws a Counterblast |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/arts/open-letter-debate.html |access-date=July 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Roberts |first=Mikenzie |date=July 13, 2020 |title=Harper's letter and response signed by Northwestern academics |url=https://dailynorthwestern.com/2020/07/12/campus/northwestern-academics-clash-with-opposing-letters-on-free-speech-cancel-culture/ |access-date= July 18, 2020 |website=The Daily Northwestern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American public opinion ===
A survey conducted in September 2020 on 10,000 Americans by [[Pew Research Center]] asked a series of different questions in regard to cancel culture, specifically on who has heard of the term cancel culture and how Americans define cancel culture.&lt;ref name="Vogels et al. 2021"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Vogels |first1=Emily A. |last2=Monica |last3=Erson |last4=Porteus |first4=Margaret |last5=Baronavski |first5=Chris |last6=Atske |first6=Sara |last7=McClain |first7=Colleen |last8=Auxier |first8=Brooke |last9=Perrin |first9=Andrew |date=May 19, 2021 |title=Americans and 'Cancel Culture': Where Some See Calls for Accountability, Others See Censorship, Punishment |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/05/19/americans-and-cancel-culture-where-some-see-calls-for-accountability-others-see-censorship-punishment/ |access-date=December 20, 2022 |publisher=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, 44% of Americans said that they have at least heard a fair amount about the new phrase, while 22% have heard a great deal and 32% said they have heard nothing at all.&lt;ref name="Vogels et al. 2021"/&gt; 43% Americans aged 18–29 have heard a great deal about cancel culture, compared to only 12% of Americans over the age of 65 who say they have heard a great deal.&lt;ref name="Vogels et al. 2021"/&gt; Additionally, within that same study, the 44% of Americans who had heard a great deal about cancel culture, were then asked how they defined cancel culture. 49% of those Americans state that it describes actions people take to hold others accountable, 14% describe cancel culture as censorship of speech or history, and 12% define it as mean-spirited actions taken to cause others harm.&lt;ref name="Vogels et al. 2021"/&gt; It was found that men were more likely to have heard or know of cancel culture, and that those who identify with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] (46%) are more likely to know the term than those in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (44%).&lt;ref name="Vogels et al. 2021" /&gt;

A poll of American registered voters conducted by [[Morning Consult]] in July 2020 showed that cancel culture, defined as "the practice of withdrawing support for (or canceling) public figures and companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive", was common: 40% of respondents said they had withdrawn support from public figures and companies, including on social media, because they had done or said something considered objectionable or offensive, with 8% having engaged in this often. Behavior differed according to age, with a majority (55%) of voters 18 to 34 years old saying they have taken part in cancel culture, while only about a third (32%) of voters over 65 said they had joined a social media pile-on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lizza |first=Ryan |date=July 22, 2020 |title=Americans tune in to 'cancel culture' — and don't like what they see |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/americans-cancel-culture-377412 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723040244/https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/americans-cancel-culture-377412 |archive-date=July 23, 2020 |access-date=July 22, 2020 |website=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude towards the practice was mixed, with 44% of respondents saying they disapproved of cancel culture, 32% who approved, and 24% who did not know or had no opinion. Furthermore, 46% believed cancel culture had gone too far, with only 10% thinking it had not gone far enough. Additionally, 53% believed that people should expect social consequences for expressing unpopular opinions in public, such as those that may be construed as deeply offensive to other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morning Consult |author-link=Morning Consult |last2=Politico |author-link2=Politico |date=July 2020 |title=National tracking poll, July 17-19, 2020 |url=https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000173-7326-d36e-abff-7ffe72dc0000 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200722192513/https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000173-7326-d36e-abff-7ffe72dc0000 |archive-date=July 22, 2020 |website=Politico|access-date=December 20, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2021 poll by the [[Harvard]] Center for American Political Studies and [[the Harris Poll]] found that 64% of respondents viewed "a growing cancel culture" as a threat to their freedom, while the other 36% did not. 36% of respondents said that cancel culture is a big problem, 32% called it a moderate problem, 20% called it a small problem, and 13% said it is not a problem. 54% said they were concerned that if they expressed their opinions online, they would be banned or fired, while the other 46% said they were not concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Manchester |first1=Julia |title=64 percent view 'cancel culture' as threat to freedom: poll |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/545387-64-percent-say-they-view-cancel-culture-as-a-threat-to-their-freedom-poll |access-date=April 27, 2021 |work=The Hill |date=March 29, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A November 2021 Hill/HarrisX poll found that 71% of registered voters strongly or somewhat felt that cancel culture went too far, with similar numbers of Republicans (76%), Democrats (70%), and independents (68%) saying so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schulte|first=Gabriela|date=November 8, 2021|title=Poll: Overwhelming majority say cancel culture has gone too far|url=https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/580569-poll-overwhelming-majority-say-cancel-culture-has-gone-too-far|access-date=November 10, 2021|website=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same poll found that 69% of registered voters felt that cancel culture unfairly punishes people for their past actions or statements, compared to 31% who said it did not.

Per Kurtzleben and others, the term has undergone [[semantic bleaching]] to lose its original meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kurtzleben| first=Danielle |date=February 10, 2021|title=When Republicans Attack 'Cancel Culture,' What Does It Mean? |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/965815679/is-cancel-culture-the-future-of-the-gop |access-date=March 12, 2021 |website=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[C. J. Coventry]] argues that the term has been incorrectly applied, and that it more accurately reflects the propensity of people to hide historical instances of injustice.&lt;ref name="Coventry 2020"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:33351/|title=A New Birth of Freedom: South Australia, slavery and exceptionalism|first=C.

If you look through Australian history, as well as European and American history, you will find countless examples of people speaking out against injustice and being persecuted in return. I can think of a number of people in our own time who are being persecuted by supposedly democratic governments for revealing uncomfortable information."&lt;ref name="Coventry 2020"/&gt;}} Another historian, [[David Olusoga]], made a similar argument, and said it is not limited to the left.&lt;ref name="Olusoga 2021"&gt;{{cite news |last=Olusoga|first=David|date=January 3, 2021 |title='Cancel culture' is not the preserve of the left.

According to Scalia, cancel culture can interfere with the [[right to counsel]], as some lawyers would not be willing to risk their personal and professional reputation on controversial topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scalia |first=Eugene |date=2021 |title=John Adams, Legal Representation, and the 'Cancel Culture' |journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=333–338 |via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Manavis wrote for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine that while free speech advocates are more likely to make accusations of ''cancel culture'', criticism is part of free speech and rarely results in consequences for those in power who are criticized. She argues that social media is an extension and reincarnation of a longer tradition of expression in a liberal society, "a new space for historical power structures to be solidified" and that online criticism by people who do not hold actual power in society tends to not affect existing power structures. She adds that most prominent people who criticized public opinion as canceling still have highly profitable businesses.&lt;ref name="Manavis 2020"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2020/07/cancel-culture-does-not-exist|magazine=[[New Statesman]]|date=July 16, 2020|title='Cancel culture' does not exist|first=Sarah|last=Manavis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717045438/https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/2020/07/cancel-culture-does-not-exist|archive-date=July 17, 2020|access-date=December 20, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consequence culture ===
