'''Identity politics''', also called '''identitarian politics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamoudi|first=Haider Ala|date=14 June 2010|title=Identitarian Violence and Identitarian Politics: Elections and Governance in Iraq|url=http://www.harvardilj.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/HILJ-Online_51_Hamoudi.pdf|journal=[[Harvard International Law Journal]] Online|volume=51|issue=78|pages=82–95|doi=|pmid=|access-date=24 July 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to [[political]] positions based on the interests and perspectives of social groups with which people identify. Identity politics includes the ways in which people's politics is shaped by aspects of their identity through loosely correlated social organizations. Examples include social organizations based on age, [[religion]], [[social class]] or [[caste]], [[culture]], [[dialect]], [[disability]], [[education]], [[ethnicity]], [[language]], [[nationality]], [[sex]], [[gender identity]], [[generation]], [[Job|occupation]], [[profession]], [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[political party]] affiliation, [[sexual orientation]], [[human settlement|settlement]], [[Urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] habitation, and [[military veteran|veteran status]]. Not all members of any given group are involved in identity politics. Identity politics are used by minority and civil rights organizations to form a coalition with members of the majority.

The term ''identity politics'' came into being during the latter part of the 20th century, especially the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–1968)|African-American Civil Rights Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/|title=Identity Politics|first=Cressida|last=Heyes|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Center for the Study of Language and Information|CSLI]], [[Stanford University]]| accessdate=2012-11-11|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

== History ==
The term ''identity politics'' has been used in political discourse since at least the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J. (2016). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1hHtCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150 Political Culture, Political Science, and Identity Politics: An Uneasy Alliance]''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|9781472442284}}. p. 150. Regarding the usage of the term in political discourse, Wiarda states: "There are disputes regarding the origins of the term 'identity politics' .... Almost all authors, even while disagreeing over who was the first to use the term, agree that its original usage goes back to the 1970s and even the 1960s."&lt;/ref&gt; One aim of identity politics has been for those feeling oppressed to articulate their felt oppression in terms of their own experience by a process of [[consciousness-raising]]. For example, in their terminal statement of [[black feminist]] identity politics, the [[Combahee River Collective]] said: &lt;blockquote&gt;[A]s children we realized that we were different from boys and that we were treated different—for example, when we were told in the same breath to be quiet both for the sake of being 'ladylike' and to make us less objectionable in the eyes of white people. In the process of consciousness-raising, actually life-sharing, we began to recognize the commonality of our experiences and, from the sharing and growing consciousness, to build a politics that will change our lives and inevitably end our oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html|title=The Combahee River Collective Statement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Identity politics, as a mode of organizing, is closely connected to the idea that some social groups are oppressed (such as women, [[ethnic minorities]], [[sexual minorities]], etc.); that is, individuals belonging to those groups are, by virtue of their identity, more vulnerable to forms of oppression such as [[cultural imperialism]], [[violence]], [[exploitation of labour]], [[marginalization]], or powerlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heyes|first1=Cressida|title=Identity Politics|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=3 May 2017|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Class identity politics were first described briefly in an article by L. A. Kauffman, who traced its origins to the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), an organization of the [[civil rights movement]] in the USA in the early and mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Kauffman, "The Anti-Politics of Identity," ''Socialist Review'' (Oakland, Calif.) 20, no. 1 (January–March 1990), 67–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Although SNCC invented many of the fundamental practices which currently make up identity politics, and although various [[black power]] groups extended them, they apparently found no need to apply a term. Rather, the term emerged when others outside the black freedom movements—particularly, the race- and ethnic-specific [[women's liberation movement]]s, such as Black feminism—began to adopt the practice in the late 1960s. Traces of identity politics can also be found in the early writings of the modern [[gay liberation]] movements, such as Dennis Altman's ''Homosexual: Liberation/Oppression'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altman|first=Dennis|title=Homosexual: Liberation/Oppression|year=1971|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Jeffrey|title=Coming Out: Homosexual Politics in Britain from the Nineteenth Century to the Present|year=1977|publisher=Quartet|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Week's ''Coming Out: Homosexual Politics in Britain from the Nineteenth Century to the Present'', and&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plummer|first=Ken|title=The Making of the Modern Homosexual|year=1981|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Plummer's ed ''The Making of the Modern Homosexual''.

One of the older written examples of it can be found in the Combahee River Collective Statement of April 1977, subsequently reprinted in a number of anthologies,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism'', ed. Zillah R. Eisenstein (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbara Smith]] and the Combahee River Collective have been credited with coining the term; which they defined as "a politics that grew out of our objective material experiences as Black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collier-Thomas|first1=edited by Bettye|last2=Franklin|first2=V.P.|title=Sisters in the struggle African American women in the civil rights-black power movement|date=2001|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-1603-2|page=39|edition=[Online-Ausg.].|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iR6NVzFEntgC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=From+the+Kennedy+Commission+to+the+Combahee+Collective:+Black+Feminist+Organizing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QCEKcZkYhP&amp;sig=1W60o79xMNdEzYXqibwdichzevI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6oLyp--jWAhUEa7wKHeDnBOoQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Identity%20Politics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Duchess.

Some groups have combined identity politics and [[Marxist]] [[social class]] analysis and [[class consciousness]]—the most notable example being the [[Black Panther Party]]—but this is not necessarily characteristic of the form. Another example is [[MOVE]], who mixed [[black nationalism]] with [[anarcho-primitivism]] (a radical form of [[green politics]] based on the idea that civilization is an instrument of oppression, advocating the return to a [[hunter gatherer]] society).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=by Committee|title=Philadelphia Special Investigation Commission (MOVE) Records {{!}} Temple University Libraries|url=https://library.temple.edu/scrc/philadelphia-special-1|website=library.temple.edu|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=no attrib.|title=On a Move – Website of the MOVE Organization|url=http://onamove.com/|website=onamove.com|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the politics of identity became very prominent and it was linked to a new wave of social movement activism.&lt;ref name='Calhoun'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Calhoun |first1=Craig |authorlink1=Craig Calhoun |chapter=Social Theory and the Politics of Identity|title=Social Theory and the Politics of Identity|editor=Craig Calhoun (Ed.) |publisher=Blackwell |year=1994 |isbn=978-1-55786-473-4}}{{page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White identity politics can be driven by demographic change and diversity. Increased diversity and the prospect of whites becoming a minority in America can drive many to affiliate with conservative causes including those not related to diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bartels |first=Larry |date=April 16, 2014 |title=Can the Republican Party thrive on white identity? |url= |newspaper=Washington Post |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates and criticism==

===Nature of the movement===
The term ''identity politics'' has been applied retroactively to varying movements that long predate its coinage. Historian [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] discussed identity politics extensively in his book ''[[The Disuniting of America]].''  Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of [[civil rights]], argues that a [[liberal democracy]] requires a common basis for [[culture]] and [[society]] to function.  In his view, basing politics on group marginalization fractures the civil polity, and therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization.  Schlesinger believes that "movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than...perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference".&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Chaudhary &amp; Gautam Chaudhary, Global Encyclopaedia of Political Geography, New Delhi, 2009, {{ISBN|978-81-8220-233-7}}, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] has contrasted the politics of [[gay liberation]] and identity politics by saying "... [[Peter Tatchell|[Peter] Tatchell]] also had, back in the day, ... a commitment to the politics of liberation, which encouraged gays to come out and live and engage. Now, we have the politics of identity, which invites people to stay in, to look inward, to obsess over the body and the self, to surround themselves with a moral forcefield to protect their worldview—which has nothing to do with the world—from any questioning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brendan|first1=O'Neill|title=Identity politics has created an army of vicious, narcissistic cowards|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|work=The Spectator|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Left-wing]] [[socialist]] author [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]] claims that identity politics often marginalizes the [[working class]], saying that:
{{quote|In the 1950s and 1960s, left-wing intellectuals who were both inspired and informed by a powerful labour movement wrote hundreds of books and articles on working-class issues. Such work would help shape the views of politicians at the very top of the Labour Party. Today, progressive intellectuals are far more interested in issues of identity. ... Of course, the struggles for the emancipation of women, gays, and ethnic minorities are exceptionally important causes. New Labour has co-opted them, passing genuinely progressive legislation on gay equality and women's rights, for example. But it is an agenda that has happily co-existed with the sidelining of the working class in politics, allowing New Labour to protect its radical flank while pressing ahead with Thatcherite policies.|Owen Jones|[[Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Owen|title=Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class|date=2012|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=978-1-84467-864-8|page=255|edition=updated}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===LGBT issues===

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}}}
{{See also|LGBT social movements|Queer nationalism|Political lesbianism|Bisexual politics}}
The earlier stages of the development of the modern LGBT movement were closely linked with identity politics. In order for gay and lesbian issues to be placed on the political agenda, gays and lesbians had to identify publicly with their homosexuality and 'come out'. By the 1980s, the politics of identity had become central to the gay movement's struggles.

This opened the path for change but also critique. Some activists, drawing on the work of [[Judith Butler]], stress the importance of not assuming an already existing identity, but of remaking and unmaking identities through performance. There are also conscientious supporters of identity politics who have developed their stances on the basis of [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s work and have described some forms of identity politics as [[strategic essentialism]], a form which has sought to work with [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] discourses to reform the understanding of "universal" goals.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Liberal-reformist gay and lesbian activists continue to work for full acceptance of gays and lesbians in the institutions and culture of mainstream society, but [[queer]] activists instead make a point of declaring themselves outside of the mainstream and having no desire to be accepted by or join it.  The former criticize the latter's approach as counterproductive and as perpetuating discrimination and societal attitudes against LGBT people, while the latter counter that the former seek to subsume LGBT identities in order to capitalize upon other forms of (racial, economic, geographical) privilege.

===Critiques of identity politics===
[[File:Anti-capitalism color— Restored.png|right|thumb|The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] poster "[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]]" (1911).]]
Some critics argue that groups based on a particular shared identity (e.g. race, or gender identity) can divert energy and attention from more fundamental issues. For example, [[Maoism]], which, as an offshoot of Marxist theory is focused on class conflict in [[capitalist]] societies, regards identity politics as a phenomenon that undermines potential common bonds among working-class people and leaves underlying class contradictions unaddressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unruhe |first=Jason |url=https://maoistrebelnews.com/2015/11/24/the-coming-backlash-against-identity-politics/|publisher=''Maoist Rebel News''. JasonUnruhe.com |date=2015-11-24|accessdate=2016-12-21|title=The Coming Backlash against Identity Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critiques of identity politics have also been expressed on other grounds by writers such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]],&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm, Eric (2 May 1996). "[http://banmarchive.org.uk/articles/1996%20annual%20lecture.htm Identity Politics and the Left]". 1996 Trust Lecture. Barry Amiel&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Norman Melburn Trust. amielandmelburn.org.uk.

Hence Hobsbawm argues that identity politics, such as [[queer nationalism]], [[Islamism]], [[Cornish nationalism]] or [[Ulster Loyalism]] are just other versions of [[bourgeois nationalism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== Intersectional critiques ===
In her journal article ''Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence against Women of Color,'' [[Kimberle Crenshaw]] treats identity politics as a process that brings people together based on a shared aspect of their identity. Crenshaw applauds identity politics for bringing African Americans (and other non-white people), gays and lesbians, and other oppressed groups together in community and progress.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|author-link=Kimberle Crenshaw|date=1991-01-01|title=Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color|jstor=1229039|journal=Stanford Law Review|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1241–99|doi=10.2307/1229039}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Crenshaw also points out that frequently groups come together based on a shared political identity but then fail to examine differences among themselves within their own group: "The problem with identity politics is not that it fails to transcend differences, as some critics charge, but rather the opposite—that it frequently conflates or ignores intragroup differences."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Crenshaw argues that when society thinks "black", they think black&amp;nbsp;''male'', and when society thinks feminism, they think&amp;nbsp;''white''&amp;nbsp;woman. When considering black women, at least two aspects of their identity are the subject of oppression: their race and their sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics|last=Crenshaw|first=Kimberle|publisher=University of Chicago Legal Forum|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=139–68.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crenshaw proposes instead that identity politics are useful but that we must be aware of&amp;nbsp;[[intersectionality]]&amp;nbsp;and the role it plays in identity politics. Nira Yuval-Davis supports Crenshaw's critiques&amp;nbsp;in ''Intersectionality and Feminist Politics''&amp;nbsp;and explains that "Identities are individual and collective narratives that answer the question 'who am/are I/we?"&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuval-Davis|first=Nira|date=2006-08-01|title=Intersectionality and Feminist Politics|url=http://ejw.sagepub.com/content/13/3/193|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=193–209|doi=10.1177/1350506806065752|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her journal article &amp;nbsp;''Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics and Violence against Women of Color'', Crenshaw provides the example of the&amp;nbsp;[[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]]/[[Anita Hill]]&amp;nbsp;controversy to expand on her point. Anita Hill came forward and accused Supreme Court Justice Nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment; Clarence Thomas would be the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court. Crenshaw argues that when Anita Hill came forward she was deemed anti-black in the movement against racism, and though she came forward on the feminist issue of sexual harassment, she was excluded because when considering feminism, it is the narrative of white middle-class women that prevails.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Crenshaw concludes that acknowledging intersecting categories when groups unite on the basis of identity politics is better than ignoring categories altogether.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In other words, Crenshaw argues that people should continue to unite on the basis of shared political identities, particularly in efforts to create narratives that might help oppressed groups, but should also consider intersecting categories within these groups.

One example of a group that united on the basis of identity politics and succeeded at considering the intersectional nature of their movement, is the&amp;nbsp;[[Combahee River Collective]]. The Combahee River Collective published their 'Black Feminist Statement' in 1977. In it, the black feminist group takes into account the group's identity as being made up of multiple interlocking oppressions and formed their politics around their sexual and racial identity as black women..." to build a politics that will change our lives and inevitably end our oppression".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The Combahee River Collective|last2=Collective|first2=The Combahee River|title=A Black Feminist Statement|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/wsq/v042/42.3-4.article.html|journal=WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=42|issue=3-4|pages=271–80|doi=10.1353/wsq.2014.0052}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his journal "Identity Politics Then and Now" Elin Diamond cites the Combahee River Collective as "one of the foundational documents of identity politics in the US"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Elin|date=2012-03-01|title=Identity Politics Then and Now|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0307883311000770|journal=Theatre Research International|volume=37|issue=01|pages=64–67|doi=10.1017/S0307883311000770|issn=1474-0672}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a protest against homophobia and sexism in the black liberation movement and racism in the feminist movement.

==Art and culture==
[[Disco]], though considered vapid by some (especially the punks, mods, etc.), was heavily tied to the [[gay rights movement]]&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, Bruce, The Seventies, The Great Shift in American Politics, Culture, and Society 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that British [[punk rock]] critics of disco were very supportive of the pro-black/anti-racist [[reggae]] genre.&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/disco-ma0000002552|title=Disco Music Genre Overview|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
