'''Identity politics''' are [[political]] arguments that focus upon the interest and perspectives of groups with which people identify. Identity politics includes the ways in which people's politics may be shaped by aspects of their identity through loosely correlated social organizations. Examples include social organizations based on race, class, religion, gender, [[gender identity]], [[ethnicity]], [[ideology]], nation, sexual orientation, culture, information preference, history, musical or literary preference, medical conditions, professions or hobbies. Not all members of any given group are necessarily involved in identity politics.

The term ''identity politics'' and movements linked to it came into being during the latter part of the 20th century. It can most notably be found in class movements, feminist movements, gay, lesbian and bisexual movements, disability movements, ethnic movements and post colonial movements. Identity politics is open to wide debate and critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/|title=Identity Politics|first=Cressida|last=Heyes|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Center for the Study of Language and Information|CSLI]], [[Stanford University]]| accessdate=2012-11-11|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Minority influence]] is a central component of identity politics. Minority influence is a form of [[social influence]] whereby a majority is influenced by the [[beliefs]] or [[behavior]] of a minority. Unlike other forms of influence this usually involves a personal shift in private [[opinion]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}. This personal shift in opinion is called conversion.

== History ==
The term ''identity politics'' has been used in political and academic discourse since the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} One aim of identity politics has been for those feeling oppressed to articulate their felt oppression in terms of their own experience by a process of [[consciousness-raising]]. For example, in their germinal statement of [[Black feminist]] identity politics, the [[Combahee River Collective]] said that "as children we realized that we were different from boys and that we were treated different—for example, when we were told in the same breath to be quiet both for the sake of being 'ladylike' and to make us less objectionable in the eyes of white people. In the process of consciousness-raising, actually life-sharing, we began to recognize the commonality of our experiences and, from the sharing and growing consciousness, to build a politics that will change our lives and inevitably end our oppression."&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web|title=Identity Politics|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Psychology|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identity politics as a mode of organizing is closely connected to the concept that some social groups are oppressed (such as women, [[ethnic minorities]], [[sexual minorities]], etc.), and that this makes one vulnerable to [[cultural imperialism]], [[violence]], [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]], [[marginalization]], or powerlessness. Identity politics starts from analyses of oppression to recommend a restructuring of the existing society.&lt;ref name=Stanford /&gt;

Identity politics is a phenomenon that arose first at the radical margins of [[liberal democratic]] societies in which human rights are recognized, and the term is not usually used to refer to dissident movements within single-party or authoritarian states. The elements of identity politics can be seen to be present in many of the earliest statements of feminists, ethnic movements and gay and lesbian liberation. Formally, it may even be taken back to Marx's earliest statements about a class becoming conscious of itself and developing a class identity. Class Identity politics were first described briefly in an article by L. A. Kauffman, who traced its origins to the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC), an organization of the [[civil rights movements]] in the USA in the early and mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Kauffman, "The Anti-Politics of Identity," ''Socialist Review'' (Oakland, Calif.) 20, no. 1 (January–March 1990), 67–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Although SNCC invented many of the fundamental practices, and various black power groups extended them, they apparently found no need to apply a term. Rather, the term emerged when others outside the black freedom movements—particularly, the race- and ethnic-specific women's liberation movements, such as Black feminism— began to adopt the practice in the late 1960s. Traces of identity politics can also be found in the early writings of the modern gay movement such as Dennis Altman's ''Homosexual: Liberation/Oppression'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Altman|first=Dennis|title=Homosexual: Liberation/Oppression|year=1971|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Jeffrey|title=Coming Out: Homosexual Politics in Britain from the Nineteenth Century to the Present|year=1977|publisher=Quartet|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Week's ''Coming Out: Homosexual Politics in Britain from the Nineteenth Century to the Present'', and &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plummer|first=Ken|title=The Making of the Modern Homosexual|year=1981|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Plummer's ed ''The Making of the Modern Homosexual''. One of the older written examples of it can be found in the [[Combahee River Collective Statement]] of April 1977, subsequently reprinted in a number of anthologies,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism'', ed. Zillah R. Eisenstein (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Barbara Smith]] and the [[Combahee River Collective]] have been credited with coining the term; which they defined as "a politics that grew out of our objective material experiences as Black women.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Duchess. ''From the Kennedy Commission to the Combahee Collective: Black Feminist Organizing, 1960–1980'', in ''Sisters in the Struggle: African American Women in the Civil Rights-Black Power Movement'', eds: Bettye Collier-Thomas, V. P. Franklin, [[NYU Press]], 2001, ISBN 0-8147-1603-2, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Some groups have combined identity politics and [[Marxist]] [[social class]] analysis and [[class consciousness]]—the most notable example being the [[Black Panther Party]]—but this is not necessarily characteristic of the form. Another example is [[MOVE]], who mixed [[black nationalism]] with [[anarcho-primitivism]] (a radical form of [[green politics]] based on the idea that civilization is an instrument of oppression, advocating a return to [[hunter gatherer]] society) and the related idea [[neo-luddism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

During the 1980s, the politics of identity became very prominent and was linked with new social movement activism.&lt;ref name='Calhoun'&gt;{{cite book |last1=Calhoun |first1=Craig |authorlink1=Craig Calhoun |title=Social Theory and the Politics of Identity |publisher=Blackwell |year=1994 |accessdate=2012-10-19 |isbn=978-1-55786-473-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates and criticism==
===Nature of the movement===
The term ''identity politics'' has been applied retroactively to varying movements that long predate its coinage. Historian [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] discussed identity politics extensively in his book ''[[The Disuniting of America]].''  Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of [[civil rights]], argues that a [[liberal democracy]] requires a common basis for [[culture]] and [[society]] to function.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In his view, basing politics on group marginalization fractures the civil polity, and therefore works against creating real opportunities for ending marginalization.  Schlesinger believes that "movements for civil rights should aim toward full acceptance and integration of marginalized groups into the mainstream culture, rather than...perpetuating that marginalization through affirmations of difference".&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Chaudhary &amp; Gautam Chaudhary, Global Encyclopaedia of Political Geography, New Delhi, 2009, ISBN 978-81-8220-233-7, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] has contrasted the politics of [[gay liberation]] and identity politics by saying "... [[Peter Tatchell|[Peter] Tatchell]] also had, back in the day, was a commitment to the politics of liberation, which encouraged gays to come out and live and engage. Now, we have the politics of identity, which invites people to stay in, to look inward, to obsess over the body and the self, to surround themselves with a moral forcefield to protect their worldview — which has nothing to do with the world — from any questioning."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brendan|first1=O'Neill|title=Identity politics has created an army of vicious, narcissistic cowards|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/02/identity-politics-has-created-an-army-of-vicious-narcissists/|work=The Spectator|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT issues===
{{See also|LGBT social movements|Queer nationalism|Political lesbianism|Bisexual politics}}
The earlier stages of the development of the modern gay movement were closely linked with identity politics. In order for gay and lesbian issues to be placed on the political agenda, gays and lesbians had to identify publicly with their homosexuality and 'come out' (''See Weeks''). By the 1980s, the politics of identity had become central to the gay movement's struggles. This opened the path for change but also critique. Some queer activists,{{who|date=June 2015}} drawing on the work of [[Judith Butler]], stress the importance of not assuming an already existing identity, but of remaking and unmaking identities through performance. There are also conscientious supporters of identity politics who have developed their stances on the basis of [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]]'s work, and have described some forms of identity politics as [[strategic essentialism]], a form which has sought to work with [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] discourses to reform the understanding of "universal" goals.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Liberal-reformist gay and lesbian activists continue to work for full acceptance of gays and lesbians in the institutions and culture of mainstream society, but [[queer]] activists instead make a point of declaring themselves outside of the mainstream and having no desire to be accepted by or join it.  The former criticize the latter's approach as counterproductive and as perpetuating discrimination and societal attitudes against LGBT people, while the latter counter that the former seek to subsume LGBT identities in order to capitalize upon other forms of (racial, economic, geographical) privilege.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indegayforum.org/news/show/27067.html Ndegayforum.org 27067]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indegayforum.org/news/show/27052.html Nndegayforum.org 27052]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared identity===
Still other critics have argued that groups based on shared identity, other than class (e.g.: religious identity or neurological wiring), can divert energy and attention from more fundamental issues, such as class conflict in [[capitalist]] societies. Even those who support [[gay rights]], [[freedom of religion]] or ending [[racism]], for instance, may consider these side issues at best.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Such arguments have been expressed by a number of writers, such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amielandmelburn.org.uk/articles/1996%20annual%20lecture.htm Amielandmelburn.org.uk articles]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Todd Gitlin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript235.html PBS.org], Thinktank transcript 235&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Tomasky]], [[Richard Rorty]], [[Sean Wilentz]], [[Robert W. McChesney]], Bart Landry, and [[Jim Sleeper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=115&amp;subsecID=172&amp;contentID=2049 Ppionline.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Hobsbawm, in particular, has criticized nationalisms, and the principle of national self-determination adopted internationally after [[World War I]], since national governments are often merely an expression of a ruling class or power, and their proliferation was a source of the wars of the 20th century. Hence Hobsbawm argues that identity politics, such as [[queer nationalism]], [[Islamism]], [[Cornish nationalism]] or [[Ulster Loyalism]] are just other versions of [[bourgeois nationalism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Art and culture==
Many artistic and cultural movements have articulated identity politics, such as the [[hip hop]], [[skinhead]] and [[punk subculture]]s. Identity politics have been expressed in music genres (e.g. [[hip hop music]], [[punk rock]], [[reggae]], [[soul music]]), film and [[fanzine]]s. Punk rock genres that have been centred on identity politics include [[anarcho-punk]], [[queercore]] and [[riot grrrl]]. Aside from gender and [[sexual orientation]], class identity has been expressed in [[Oi!]], originating in the  [[East End of London]], which has been typically associated with [[working class]] individuals.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Skinhead culture originated in British working class identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Craig J. Forsyth|author2=Heith Copes|title=Encyclopedia of Social Deviance|date=21 January 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781483364698|page=646|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NAjmBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA646|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many skinhead reggae, [[2 Tone]], Oi! and [[hardcore punk]] songs expressing working class pride and racial unity. When soul and reggae lyrics became expressions of [[black nationalism]] and/or the [[Rastafari movement]], many white skinheads were alienated at the shift in lyrical themes. However, [[White power skinhead]]s are focused on [[white pride]], and their music and [[zines]] reflect this. White power rock music, also known as [[Rock Against Communism]], often has lyrics about white pride and [[white separatism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Hip Hop music has expressed identity politics in the form of [[Black people|black]] and [[Chicano nationalism]], while [[Homo hop]] has expressed Queer identity politics, much like queercore has in the punk and indie scene. Hip-Hop activism draws on black liberation movements but also encompasses issues like [[environmentalism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[Lowrider]] culture was made into an artistic expression of identity politics by the [[Royal Chicano Air Force]], an organisation established to support equality for [[Mexican American]]s. Some lowriders have made [[murals]] celebrating Chicano culture and history.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[Disco]], though considered vapid by some (especially the punks, mods, etc.), was heavily tied to the [[gay rights]] movement, along with the black, feminist and Latino ones. It has been noted that British [[punk rock]] critics of disco were very supportive of the pro-black/anti-racist [[reggae]] genre.&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/disco-ma0000002552 Disco], [[Allmusic]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Christgau]] and Jim Testa have said that there were legitimate artistic reasons for being critical of disco.&lt;ref name="Christgau"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Robert |last1=Christgau |title=Pazz &amp; Jop 1978: New Wave Hegemony and the Bebop Question |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pj78.php |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Testa"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Andersen|author2=Mark Jenkins|title=Dance of days: two decades of punk in the nation's capital|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CU1jKq0TlvQC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=21 March 2011|date=1 August 2003|publisher=Akashic Books|isbn=978-1-888451-44-3|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of identity politics==
{{see also|Category:Identity politics}}
A ''[[Le Monde]]''/''[[IFOP]]'' poll in January 2011 conducted in France and Germany found that a majority felt Muslims are "not integrated properly"; an analyst for ''IFOP'' said the results indicated something "beyond linking immigration with security or immigration with unemployment, to linking Islam with a threat to identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = European poll: An Islamic threat? | date = 6 Jan 2011 | url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/01/201116112228783789.html | work = [[Al Jazeera]] | accessdate = 2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
