'''Transphobia''' consists of negative attitudes, feelings, or actions towards [[transgender]] people or [[wikt:transness|transness]] in general. Transphobia can include fear, aversion, hatred, violence or anger towards people who do not conform to social [[gender roles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hate Crime: Impact, Causes and Responses|url = https://archive.org/details/hatecrimeimpactc00neil|url-access = limited|last1 = Chakraborti |first1 = Neil |last2 = Garland |first2 = Jon |publisher = SAGE Publications, Ltd.|year = 2009|isbn = 978-1412945684|pages = [https://archive.org/details/hatecrimeimpactc00neil/page/n199 77]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Handbook of"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology, Volume 2|last1 = Chrisler |first1 = Donald R. |last2 = McCreary |first2 = Joan C.|publisher = Springer|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1441913555|pages = 366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transphobia is a type of [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]], similar to [[racism]], [[sexism]], or [[ableism]],&lt;ref&gt;Judith A.

In much of the [[Western world]], there has been a gradual establishment of policies combatting discrimination and supporting equal opportunity in all aspects of life since the 1990s. The trend is also taking shape in some [[developing nation]]s. In addition, campaigns regarding the LGBT community are being spread around the world to improve social acceptance of nontraditional gender identities.

==Etymology and use==
The word ''transphobia'' is a [[classical compound]] patterned on the term ''[[homophobia]]''. The first component is the [[English prefixes#Neo-classical|neo-classical prefix]] ''trans-'' (originally meaning "across, on the far side, beyond") from ''transgender'', and the second component ''-phobia'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|φόβος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|phóbos}}, "fear"). Along with ''[[lesbophobia]]'', ''[[biphobia]]'' and ''homophobia'', ''transphobia'' is a member of the family of terms used when [[Bigotry|intolerance]] and discrimination is directed toward [[LGBT]] people.

''Transphobia'' is not a [[phobia]] as defined in [[clinical psychology]] (i.e., an [[anxiety disorder]]). Its meaning and usage parallels ''[[xenophobia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transpeople: Repudiation, Trauma, Healing|last = Shelley |first = Christopher A.|publisher = University of Toronto Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0802097842|location =Toronto |pages = 32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noun ''transphobe'' denotes someone who harbors transphobia. The [[Adjective|adjectival]] form ''transphobic'' may be used to describe a transphobe or their actions. The words ''transphobia'' and ''transphobic'' were added to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous-updates/june-2013-update/new-words-list-june-2013/|title=New words list|date=June 2013|website=public.oed.com|access-date=23 February 2018|archive-date=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327023405/https://public.oed.com/the-oed-today/recent-updates-to-the-oed/previous-updates/june-2013-update/new-words-list-june-2013/|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that ''transmisia'', with the suffix ''-misia'' meaning "hatred", would be a more accurate term, because transphobia is more about hatred of than about fear of transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://translanguageprimer.com/transmisia/ |title=Transmisia |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= 17 August 2021|website= |publisher=The Trans Language Primer |access-date=June 23, 2023 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Transfeminist]] theorist and author [[Julia Serano]] argues that the root of transphobia is "oppositional [[sexism]]", i.e. the belief that male and female are "rigid, mutually exclusive categories, each possessing a unique and nonoverlapping set of attributes, aptitudes, abilities, and desires". She contrasts this against the belief that males and [[masculinity]] are superior to females and [[femininity]] along with people's insecurities about gender and gender norms, which she calls "traditional sexism".&lt;ref name="serano"&gt;Julia Serano. ''Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity'', Seal Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-58005-154-5|1-58005-154-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2021}}

Other transgender rights authors argue that a significant part of the oppositional sexist origin of transphobia and violence towards transsexual people is linked to psychological claims of difference between male sexuality and female sexuality in the brain's protection mechanisms from committing sex crimes. These authors argue that the paradigm of acceptable sexual behavior that assumes men's [[sexual arousal]] is category-specific and women's sex drive is lower and more inhibited causes allegations that transsexual people have neither safety system in the brain and are therefore sex criminals. They argue that studies that claim to show such sex differences have flaws, such as the possibility that more men are deterred from participating in sexual arousal studies than women due to fear of being alleged to be inappropriately sexually aroused.&lt;ref&gt;Protection of Sexual Minorities Since Stonewall: Progress and Stalemate in Developed and Developing Countries: Phil C. W. Chan Routledge, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sexuality and Equality Law; Suzanne B. Goldberg 2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|this whole paragraph is hard to follow. "safety system in the brain" needs elaboration!|date=December 2017}}

Others have argued that hostility towards transgender identity is in part due to the challenge it poses to the idea that gender is based on observable physical and behavioral characteristics determined at birth.&lt;ref name="Rad2019"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rad |first1=Mostafa Salari |last2=Shackleford |first2=Crystal |last3=Lee |first3=Kelli Ann |last4=Jassin |first4=Kate |last5=Ginges |first5=Jeremy |title=Folk theories of gender and anti-transgender attitudes: Gender differences and policy preferences |journal=PLOS ONE |date=30 December 2019 |volume=14 |issue=12 |pages=e0226967 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0226967 |pmid=31887173 |pmc=6936834 |bibcode=2019PLoSO..1426967R |issn=1932-6203|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rad and colleagues surveyed a sample of 1323 American adults, asking them to identify the gender of transgender people who [[Sex reassignment therapy|medically transitioned]], finding that the type of transition procedure mattered but its direction did not. Specifically, biological changes resulted in the target being more identified with their self-identified gender than their birth-assigned gender, but there were no significant differences between male-to-female and female-to-male transitions. Moreover, compared to male test subjects, female test subjects were more likely to identify the targets as their self-identified gender. This gender difference was larger in younger, more liberal, and less religious non-Midwestern respondents. The authors further showed that gender category beliefs (ratings of the transgender person's post-transition gender identity) were strongly associated with attitudes and feelings of warmth towards transgender people. However, gender category beliefs performed better in predicting bathroom policy preferences compared to feelings in unseen data, indicating that beliefs about what gender is and how it is determined are significantly linked to transphobia and support for anti-transgender policies. The authors argue that this pattern is consistent with theories that transphobia is rooted in a hierarchical social classification system where low-status groups (e.g., females) view the hierarchy in less essentialist ways than high-status groups (e.g., males).&lt;ref name="Rad2019" /&gt;

Transgender author and critic Jody Norton believes that transphobia is an extension of homophobia and [[misogyny]]. She argues that transgender people, like gays and lesbians, are hated and feared for challenging and undermining [[Gender role|gender norms]] and the [[gender binary]], and the "male-to-female transgender incites transphobia through her implicit challenge to the binary division of gender upon which male cultural and political hegemony depends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=Jody|title="Brain Says You're a Girl, But I Think You're a Sissy Boy": Cultural Origins of Transphobia|journal=International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies|year=1997|volume=2|pages=139–164|doi=10.1023/A:1026320611878|issue=2|s2cid=141097763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on theory of [[radicalization]], Craig McLean argues that discourse on transgender-related issues in the UK has been radicalized in response to the activities of what he terms the "anti-transgender movement," claiming that the movement pushes "a radical agenda to deny the basic rights of trans people (...) under the cover of 'free speech.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-last1=McLean |author-first1=Craig |title=The Growth of the Anti-Transgender Movement in the United Kingdom.

[[Cissexism]] (also termed cisgenderism, and related to but distinct from [[cisnormativity]] or cissexual assumption) is the appeal to norms that enforce the [[gender binary]] and [[gender essentialism]], resulting in the oppression of [[gender variant]], [[non-binary gender|non-binary]], and transgender [[gender identity|identities]].&lt;ref name="Stitt"&gt;{{Cite book|title=ACT For Gender Identity: The Comprehensive Guide |last=Stitt|first=Alex|date=2020|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1785927997|location=London|oclc=1089850112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cissexism refers to the assumption that, due to human [[sexual differentiation]], one's [[gender]] is determined solely by a [[biological sex]] of male or female (or, in the case of cisgenderism, a bivalent male or female expression), and that trans people are inferior to [[cisgender]] people.&lt;ref name="Lennon-2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Lennon|first1= Erica|last2= Mistler|first2= Brian|date= 2014|title= Cisgenderism |journal=[[TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly]] |volume=1 |issue=1–2 |pages=63–64 |doi= 10.1215/23289252-2399623|doi-access= free}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cisgender privilege'' is the set of "unearned rights afforded to nontransgender people by virtue of the fact that they are not transgender", such as access to gender-segregated spaces and teams, lower exposure to gender-based violence, and easier access to gender-specific healthcare.&lt;ref name="Nadal-SAGE"&gt;Kevin L.

Stotzer published an article in ''[[Aggression and Violent Behavior]]'' that compiled information from numerous studies reporting violence against transgender people, describing it as "shockingly common" and noting that transgender people have a high risk of experiencing sexual violence throughout their lifetimes, and while reported rates vary considerably among studies for methodological and other reasons, the most common finding is that around 50% of transgender people have been sexually assaulted.&lt;ref name="Stotzer-2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stotzer|first=Rebecca L.|title=Violence against transgender people: A review of United States data|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=14|issue=3|pages=170–179|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2009.01.006|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis on the rates of intimate partner violence found that transgender individuals are 66% more likely to experience violence of some kind from an intimate partner than cisgender subjects, and more than twice as likely to experience both sexual and physical intimate partner violence than their cisgender peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Peitzmeier|first1=Sarah M|last2=Malik|first2=Mannat|last3=Kattari|first3=Shanna K|last4=Marrow|first4=Elliot|last5=Stephenson|first5=Rob|last6=Agénor|first6=Madina|last7=Reisner|first7=Sari L|date=Sep 2020|title=Intimate Partner Violence in Transgender Populations: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Prevalence and Correlates. |journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=110|issue=9|pages=pe1–e14|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2020.305774|pmid=32673114|pmc=7427218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical violence===
Perpetrators of physical violence against transgender people are reported to have been influenced by negative attitudes against transgender people, many of whom do not report their assault to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xavier|first=Jessica|title=A needs assessment of transgendered people of color living in Washington, D.C. |journal=International Journal of Transgenderism|pages=31–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the available homicide data suggests that transgender people are murdered at a lower rate than cisgender people. However, young Black and Latina trans women appear to be at greater risk of homicide than their cisgender peers.&lt;ref name="Dinno-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stotzer|first=Rebecca L.|date=September 2017|title=Data Sources Hinder Our Understanding of Transgender Murders|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=107|issue=9|pages=1362–1363|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2017.303973|issn=0090-0036|pmc=5551619|pmid=28787204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of 81 transgender people in [[Philadelphia]] found 14% said they had been refused routine medical care because they were transgender. 18% answered 'yes' when asked if, when they went in for a check-up, "being transgender created a problem" for them.&lt;ref name="Bockting-2006" /&gt;

Additionally, a study of 223 healthcare providers indicated a correlation between transphobia and decreased performance on survey questions regarding the treatment of transgender patients, with no significant correlation to the amount of time spent learning about transgender health, leading researchers to state that "broader efforts to address transphobia in society in general, and in medical education in particular, may be required to improve the quality of medical care for [transgender and gender diverse] patients."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Stroumsa|first1=Daphna|last2=Shires|first2=Deirdre A|last3=Richardson|first3=Caroline R|last4=Jaffee|first4=Kim D|last5=Woodford|first5=Michael R|date=21 January 2019|title=Transphobia rather than education predicts provider knowledge of transgender health care|url=|journal=Medical Education|volume=53|issue=4|pages=398–407|doi=10.1111/medu.13796|pmid=30666699|hdl=2027.42/148342|s2cid=58643722|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the workplace===
Transphobia also manifests itself in the workplace. Some transgender people lose their jobs when they begin to transition and a 1995 study from [[Willamette University]] stated that a transgender person fired for following the recommended course of treatment rarely wins it back through federal or state statutes.&lt;ref name="TransEmploy"&gt;{{cite web |author=JoAnna McNamara |title=Employment discrimination and the Transsexual |publisher=[[Phyllis Randolph Frye]]|date=30 August 1996 |url=https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/files/cn69m420z |access-date=10 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of 392 trans women and 123 trans men conducted by the San Francisco Department of Public Health in 1997 found that 40% of trans women surveyed had earned money from full or part-time employment over the preceding six months.

In the hiring process, discrimination may be either open or covert, with employers sometimes finding other ostensible reasons to not hire a candidate. Additionally, when an employer fires a transgender employee, it may be a "mixed motive" case, with the employer openly citing obvious wrongdoing or [[job performance]] issues while keeping silent in regards to transphobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sears|first1=Brad|last2=Mallory|first2=Christy|date=1 July 2011|title=Documented Evidence of Employment Discrimination &amp; Its Effects on LGBT People|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/03m1g5sg|journal=The Williams Institute, UCLA|via=eScholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Workplace discrimination|Employment discrimination]] on the basis of gender identity and expression is [[Bostock v. Clayton County|illegal in the United States]]. Such discrimination is outlawed by specific legislation in the State of New Jersey and might be in other states (as it is in the states of California, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington) or city ordinances; additionally, it is covered by case law in some other states. (For example, Massachusetts is covered by cases such as ''Lie vs. Sky Publishing Co.'' and ''Jette vs. Honey Farms''.) Several other states and cities prohibit such discrimination in public employment. Sweden and the United Kingdom have also legislated against employment discrimination on the grounds of gender identity. Sometimes, however, employers discriminate against transgender employees in spite of such legal protections.&lt;ref name="TransEmploy2"&gt;{{cite web|author=barbara findlay, Q.C. |title=Transgendered people and Employment: An equality analysis |publisher=Barbara Findlay Law Office |date=June 1999 |url=http://www.barbarafindlay.com/articles/43.pdf |access-date=10 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620100912/http://www.barbarafindlay.com/articles/43.pdf |archive-date=20 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the southern U.S. grocery chain [[Winn-Dixie (supermarket)|Winn-Dixie]] fired long-time employee Peter Oiler, despite a history of repeatedly earning raises and promotions, after management learned that Oiler identified as transgender and occasionally [[crossdressing|cross-dressed]] off the job.

Prisons frequently make no attempt to accommodate transgender individuals, assigning them to facilities using only the criteria of genitalia, which is believed to contribute to the pervasiveness of prison rape with regards to transgender women.

Online transphobia remains a growing problem across various online spaces. A study by [[Brandwatch]] analyzing over ten million posts in transgender-related discussions on various [[social media platforms]] between 2015 and 2019 found over 1.5 million transphobic posts. These posts varied from promoting transphobic sentiment to advocating for [[Violence against transgender people|anti-transgender violence]] and [[Transgender genocide|genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Scale of Transphobia Online |url=https://www.brandwatch.com/reports/transphobia/ |access-date=2023-05-11 |website=Brandwatch |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people are often victims of [[online harassment]] and experience higher reported levels of online harassment compared to their cisgender heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 October 2019 |title=Transgender people treated 'inhumanely' online |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50166900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Powell |first1=Anastasia |last2=Scott |first2=Adrian J |last3=Henry |first3=Nicola |date=March 2020 |title=Digital harassment and abuse: Experiences of sexuality and gender minority adults |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1477370818788006 |journal=European Journal of Criminology |language=en |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=199–223 |doi=10.1177/1477370818788006 |s2cid=149537486 |issn=1477-3708|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study on transphobic cyberbullying by Evelyn et al. found that participants most frequently reported being bullied on social media platforms, alongside frequently reporting bullying in [[online video game]]s and [[dating app]]s. Most of the bullying was found to be from anonymous users or people unknown to the participants, and often in the form of transphobic insults, intersectional sexist, homophobic and/or racist insults, [[Outing|outing their identity]], threats of harm, and sexual harassment. Participants even reported transphobic cyberbullying from other transgender individuals, usually by [[Gender policing|policing]] or outing their identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Evelyn |first=Sophie |title=A Phenomenological Investigation into Cyberbullying as Experienced by People Identifying as Transgender or Gender Diverse |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|year=2022 |volume=19 |issue=11 |page=6560 |doi=10.3390/ijerph19116560 |pmid=35682144 |pmc=9180504 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online transphobia has potential to lead to real-world violence and threats. An example of this is when far-right Twitter account [[Libs of TikTok]] made a series of posts spreading misinformation that [[Boston Children's Hospital]] was performing [[Hysterectomy|hysterectomies]] on minors. This led to a series of death threats and bomb threats being made against the hospital and individual physicians, and individual physicians being [[Doxing|doxxed]] and harassed in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Human Rights Campaign Foundation |date=8 December 2022 |title=ONLINE HARASSMENT, OFFLINE VIOLENCE: UNCHECKED HARASSMENT OF GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE PROVIDERS AND CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AND ITS OFFLINE VIOLENT CONSEQUENCES |url=https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/HRCF-OnlineHarassmentOfflineViolence.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Libs of TikTok has similarly posted about several other LGBT-themed events, such as [[Drag Queen Story Hour]]s, often leading to said events receiving mass threats of violence and being canceled or postponed by organizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is "Grooming?"

The [[LGBT grooming conspiracy theory]]- claiming that LGBTQ people and allies are systematically grooming children- has been promoted online by both users and mainstream politicians such as [[Marjorie Taylor Greene]] and [[Lauren Boebert]]. Former US President [[Donald Trump]] claimed in a video posted to [[Truth Social]] on January 31, 2023, that "the left-wing gender insanity being pushed at our children is an act of child abuse" and that if re-elected, he would pass numerous laws significantly limiting gender-affirming care for minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-01-31 |title=Trump vows to 'stop' gender-affirming care for minors if re-elected president |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-vows-stop-gender-affirming-care-minors-re-elected-president-rcna68461 |access-date=2023-09-02 |website=NBC News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study on Twitter found that use of the term "groomer" in tweets spiked on multiple occasions, including the passing of the [[Florida Parental Rights in Education Act]], the signing into law of said act, and Twitter posting a statement that tweets calling transgender or nonbinary people "groomers" violates its hate speech policy.&lt;ref name="HRC-2022"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Human Rights Campaign Foundation |title=DIGITAL HATE: Social Media's Role In Amplifying Dangerous Lies About LGBTQ+ People. |url=https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/CCDH-HRC-Digital-Hate-Report-2022-single-pages.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Twitter's prior public stance against transphobia and homophobia on its platform, the company was criticized by organizations such as the [[Human Rights Campaign]] for being inefficient. One audit by the organization found that Twitter failed to act on 99 out of 100 of the most viewed anti-LGBT tweets between January and July 2022.&lt;ref name="HRC-2022" /&gt; The [[acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk]] has led to significantly loosened hate speech restrictions, especially in terms of anti-LGBTQ content. Following Musk's takeover, tweets linking LGBT people to grooming rose by 119%, and retweets and mentions of right-wing figures' anti-LGBT tweets increased by over 1200%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Gogarty |first=Kayla |title=Anti-LGBTQ hate has increased on Twitter since Elon Musk officially acquired the company |url=https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/anti-lgbtq-hate-has-increased-twitter-elon-musk-officially-acquired-company |access-date=2023-05-11 |website=Media Matters for America |date=13 December 2022 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Muldowney |first=Decca |date=2023-03-28 |title=Elon Musk's Twitter Makes Millions Off Anti-LGBT 'Groomer' Tweets: Report |language=en |work=The Daily Beast |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musks-twitter-makes-millions-off-anti-lgbt-groomer-tweets-report |access-date=2023-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a 2020 study on [[Facebook]] by [[Media Matters for America]] found that right-leaning sources took up a vast majority of interactions in transgender topics compared to left-leaning or queer sources, with anti-LGBT outlets such as [[The Daily Wire]] and [[LifeSiteNews]] earning the highest engagements out of any source analyzed in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2020-07-20 |title=The right is dominating Facebook engagement on content about trans issues |url=https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/right-dominating-facebook-engagement-content-about-trans-issues |access-date=2023-06-10 |website=Media Matters for America |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In religion===

====In Christianity====
{{see also|Christianity and transgender people|Anti-gender movement}}
{{Unreliable sources|section|date=January 2018}}
In North America, organizations associated with the [[Christian right]], including the [[American Family Association]], [[Family Research Council]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality]], believe that "[[wikt:transgenderism|transgenderism]]" is unnatural and that transgender people are and remain the sex they were assigned at birth. These organizations oppose laws and policies intended to accommodate transgender people, such as allowing them to change their legal sex, use the washroom corresponding to the gender with which they identify, or become ordained Christian ministers. It is their position that God created people's bodies as they are meant to be, that accepting transgender people would violate scripture and [[natural law]], and that the Bible refers to male and female only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/transsexu9a.htm|title=Beliefs among religious conservatives about the causes &amp; cures of transsexuality (Cont'd)|access-date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance website, under [[Pope John Paul II]], the [[Holy See]] first stated its opposition to reassignment surgery in 2000, although it was not made public until 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/transsexu15.htm|title=Catholic beliefs about the causes &amp; cures of transsexuality|access-date=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people face particular challenges in attempting to integrate their faith with their gender identity. One author says "expectations [based on gender] are usually predicated upon our genitalia and begin from the moment of birth, continuing throughout our lives."&lt;ref name="Sheridan2001"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sheridan |first=Vanessa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UuQPAQAAIAAJ |title=Crossing Over: Liberating the Transgendered Christian |page=31 |date=2001 |publisher=Pilgrim Press |oclc=47126733 |isbn=9780829814460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian denominations use biblical notions of gender and gender roles to support their views. These include "So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them" (Genesis 1:27) and "The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God" (Deuteronomy 22:5).&lt;ref name="Denise L 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Denise L.|title=Transgender, Transsexual, and Gender Queer Individuals with a Christian Upbringing: The Process of Resolving Conflict Between Gender Identity and Faith.|journal=Journal of Religion &amp; Spirituality in Social Work: Social Thought|date=15 February 2013|volume=32|issue=1|pages=60–83|doi=10.1080/15426432.2013.749079|s2cid=216087109 |url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/Levy_Denise_2013_Transgender%20Transsexual%20and%20Gender%20Queer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Views of gender identity based on the Christian faith do not always coincide with the ideologies of transgender individuals.{{Clarification needed|reason=Sentence meaning is unclear and uncited|date=August 2023}} However, if they do not conform to these expectations, they may face rejection. Many transgender Christians seek out an "individualized relationship with God", often facing "a period of denial and struggle" as well as depression, disconnection, dissatisfaction, and spiritual difficulty before "discovering a sense of self that feels integral and true".&lt;ref name=Sabia2018&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sabia-Tanis |first=Justin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pkv7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 |title=Trans-Gender: Theology, Ministry, and Communities of Faith |page=38 |date=2018-06-25 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=9781725239005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many transgender individuals face barriers within the church, such as "fear and unfamiliarity on the part of the congregation, language issues, physical layout that separates people by gender, programs that exclude or separate by gender, pathologizing or designating trans issues as sinful, and overt hostility".&lt;ref&gt;Tanis, J. (2003). ''Trans-gendered: Theology, ministry, and communities of faith'', Cleveland, OH: The Pilgrim Press. p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denise L 2013"/&gt;

====In Islam====
The Islamic faith has historically supported heteronormative, binary gender identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alipour |first=M. |date=2 January 2017 |title=Islamic shari'a law, neotraditionalist Muslim scholars and transgender sex-reassignment surgery: A case study of Ayatollah Khomeini's and Sheikh al-Tantawi's fatwas |journal=International Journal of Transgenderism  |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=91–103 |doi=10.1080/15532739.2016.1250239 |s2cid=152120329 |issn=1553-2739|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This support is reinforced by cultural norms and traditional readings of sacred texts which prohibit a wide range of identities. Despite this history, progressive Muslims have built arguments that support transgender Muslims on long-established doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zaharin|first1=A. A.

In 1988, gender reassignment surgery was declared acceptable under Islamic law by scholars at Egypt's [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]], the world's oldest Islamic university. In Iran during 1987, [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]], the supreme religious leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran at that time, also declared transgender surgical operations as acceptable (see [[transgender rights in Iran]]). The foundation for this accepting attitude in contrast to intolerance of homosexuality is the belief that a person is born transgender but chooses to be homosexual. Despite this acceptance among some conservative Muslim scholars and leaders, transgender individuals within the Muslim community still face particular challenges.

Today, there are some Muslim communities that explicitly welcome transgender Muslims, including some which have trans leadership. Masjid Al-Rabia, founded in 2017, is a trans-led, women-centred, LGBTQ+ affirming mosque based in Chicago, IL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://masjidalrabia.org/about-masjidalrabia|title=About Masjid Al-Rabia|website=Masjid Al-Rabia|access-date=2 November 2021|archive-date=2 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211102162626/https://masjidalrabia.org/about-masjidalrabia|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Northampton, Massachusetts, the Pioneer Valley Progressive Muslims (Masjid Al-Inshirah) was founded in 2010 by a transgender Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2013/09/23/lgbt-muslims-make-progress-path-acceptance|title=LGBT Muslims Make Progress on the Path to Acceptance|website=The Advocate|date=23 September 2013|publisher=Pride Publishing, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Power |first=Tynan |author-link=Tynan Power|editor-last1=Goldberg|editor-first1=Abbie E.|editor-last2=Beemyn|editor-first2=Genny|date=2021 |chapter=Muslim People|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Trans Studies|location=United States|publisher=SAGE Publishing|pages=553–555|doi=10.4135/9781544393858.n188 |isbn=9781544393810|s2cid=242422061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Muslims for Progressive Values]] has founded Unity Mosques in Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; and Los Angeles, California; as well as outside the United States.

==In feminism==
{{See also|Feminist views on transgender topics}}

Some positions within feminism have been considered transphobic. This may include criticism of [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] or [[sex reassignment surgery]] (SRS) as a personal choice or medical invention, or the position that trans women are not women in a literal sense and should not be allowed access to women-only spaces.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt; Some [[second-wave feminist]]s perceive trans men and women respectively as "traitors" and "infiltrators" to womanhood.&lt;ref name="Erickson-Schroth 2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erickson-Schroth |first1=Laura |title=Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community |date=12 May 2014 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0199325351 |pages=568–569 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Ef1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA568|quote="Some feminists have perceived transmasculine people as traitors—that is, as women who identify politically with men. When inclusive of trans men, these feminists have often gendered them as women. Conversely, these feminists have tended to perceive transfeminine people as infiltrators of womanhood and of women's space. Many commentators refer to feminists who think in these ways as 'trans-exclusionary radical feminists' (TERFs).&amp;nbsp;...'The fetishistic (often infantalizing) embrace of trans men by lesbian communities is ungendering, othering, and transphobic.'"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Second-wave feminist]] and activist [[Gloria Steinem]] expressed concerns in 1977 about transsexuality and SRS, writing that in many cases, transsexuals "surgically mutilate their own bodies."&lt;ref name="Steinem-OutrageousActs"/&gt;{{rp|227}} She concluded that "feminists are right to feel uncomfortable about the need for and uses of transsexualism."&lt;ref name="Steinem-OutrageousActs"/&gt;{{rp|228}} For some years, this led to Steinem being characterized as transphobic.&lt;ref name="bm-trans-exclusion-steinem"/&gt; In 2013, she repudiated the interpretation of her text as an altogether condemnation of SRS, stating that her position was informed by accounts of [[gay men]] choosing to transition as a way of coping with societal [[homophobia]]. She added that she sees transgender people as living "authentic lives" that should be "celebrated".&lt;ref name="advocate-steinem-oped"/&gt;

[[Radical feminist]] [[Janice Raymond]]'s 1979 book, ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]'', was and is still controversial due to its unequivocal condemnation of transsexual surgeries.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt; In the book Raymond says, "All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves .... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive" and that trans people should be "morally mandated out of existence".&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"/&gt;

Another site of conflict between feminists and [[trans women]] has been the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]]. In the early 1990s, the festival ejected a transsexual woman, Nancy Burkholder.&lt;ref name="vangelder"/&gt; In 2014, the festival "passionately rejected" accusations that it believed transgender women are "less than" other women.&lt;ref name="michfest-vogel"/&gt; The activist group [[Camp Trans]] had protested the "womyn-born-womyn" intention and advocated for greater acceptance of trans women within the feminist community. The festival had considered allowing only post-operative trans women to attend, but this was criticized as [[classist]], as many trans women cannot afford sex reassignment surgery.&lt;ref name="sreedhar-transforming-feminism"/&gt;

Trans women such as [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]] challenged the feminist conception of "biological woman". Stone worked as a sound engineer for [[Olivia Records]] from about 1974 to 1978, resigning as the controversy over a trans woman working for a lesbian-identified enterprise increased.&lt;ref name="Goldberg-Stone"/&gt; The debate continued in Raymond's book,&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"/&gt; which devoted a chapter to criticism of "the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist." Groups like [[Lesbian Organization of Toronto]] then voted to exclude trans lesbians.&lt;ref name="ross1995"/&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] described "[[wikt:transgenderism|transgenderism]]" as "deeply problematic from a feminist perspective and [stated] that transsexualism should be seen as a violation of human rights."&lt;ref name="jeffreys1997"/&gt;

In 2017, with regard to the question of whether trans women are women, [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]] expressed the view that "trans women are trans women", meaning that while she acknowledges them to face discrimination on the basis of being transgender and sees this as a serious issue, she thinks that their experiences should not be conflated with those of women who face oppression on the basis of being born [[female]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/3/15/14910900/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-transgender-women-comments-apology |title=The controversy over Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and trans women, explained |author=Emily Crockett |publisher=Vox |date=15 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After sustaining severe criticism for her views, Adichie opined that the American [[Left-wing politics|Left]] is "creating its own decline" and is "very cannibalistic." She explained that she sees trans women as women despite her views, but stood behind her position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-says-the-american-left-is-creating-its-own-decline_us_59db6dbae4b072637c454c4d |title=Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Says The American Left 'Is Creating Its Own Decline' |author=Claire Fallon |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=9 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[poststructuralist]] feminist and lesbian [[Judith Butler]], particularly their books ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' (1990)&lt;ref name="butler-1990" /&gt; and ''Bodies That Matter'' (1993),&lt;ref name="butler-1993" /&gt; argues that the "violent inscription" of gender as a social construct on human bodies leads to violence against those who do not conform to such binaristic gender dichotomies.

Feminists who oppose the inclusion of trans women in women's spaces have been labeled "[[TERF]]s", short for "trans-exclusionary radical feminists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/health-family/transgender-for-beginners-trans-terf-cis-and-safe-spaces-1.3769653|title=Transgender for beginners: Trans, terf, cis and safe spaces|last=O'Connell|first=Jennifer|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=16 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those at whom the term is directed, in turn, have perceived their labeling as "TERF" to be a [[pejorative|slur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Michelle Goldberg|date=4 August 2014|title=What Is a Woman?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2|magazine=The New Yorker|quote=TERF stands for "trans-exclusionary radical feminist."

Historian [[Joanne Meyerowitz]] documented transphobia within the [[gay rights movement]] in the mid 20th century in response to publicity surrounding the transition of [[Christine Jorgensen]]. Jorgensen, who made frequent [[Homophobia|homophobic]] remarks and insisted she was not connected to or identified with gay men, was a polarizing figure among activists:

{{blockquote|In 1953, for example, ''ONE'' magazine published a debate among its readers as to whether gay men should denounce Jorgensen. In the opening salvo, the author Jeff Winters accused Jorgensen of a "sweeping disservice" to gay men. "As far as the public knows," Winters wrote, "you were merely another unhappy homosexual who decided to get drastic about it." For Winters, Jorgensen's story simply confirmed the false belief that all men attracted to other men must be basically feminine," which, he said, "they are not." Jorgensen's precedent, he thought, encouraged the "reasoning" that led "to legal limitations upon the homosexual, mandatory injections, psychiatric treatment – and worse." In the not-so-distant past, scientists had experimented with castrating gay men.|author=[[Joanne Meyerowitz]]&lt;ref name="meyerowitz2002"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Meyerowitz |first=Joanne J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFP2PmYPBBAC |title=How sex changed: a history of transsexuality in the United States |date=2002 |isbn=9780674009257 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |oclc=654274727}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several prominent figures in [[second wave feminism]] have also been accused of transphobic attitudes, culminating in 1979 with the publication of ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]'' by [[Radical feminism|radical lesbian feminist]] [[Janice Raymond]], who popularized the term ''[[shemale]]'' as derogatory slur referring to [[trans women]] in 1994,&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"/&gt; and her statements on transsexuality and transsexual people have been criticized by many in the [[LGBT]] and [[feminism|feminist]] communities as extremely [[transphobic]] and as constituting [[hate speech]].&lt;ref name="rose2004"&gt;Rose, Katrina C.

In 1950s America, there was a debate among gay men and women about those who felt they were of the opposite sex. Gay men and women who were trying to melt quietly into the majority society criticized them as "freaks" who brought unwanted disreputable attention upon them. Such attitudes were widespread at the time.&lt;ref name="GLBTphobia"&gt;{{cite web |last=Weiss |first=Jillian Todd |title=GL vs. BT: The Archaeology of Biphobia and Transphobia Within the U.S. Gay and Lesbian Community |url=http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/glvsbt.htm |access-date=7 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329150447/http://phobos.ramapo.edu/~jweiss/glvsbt.htm |archive-date=29 March 2016 }}{{better source needed|date=April 2016|reason=professor cut/paste of a published journal paper is not the best source and may be copyvio }} quoting Kay Brown of Transhistory.net [defunct since 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[trans men]] face rejection from lesbian communities they had been part of prior to transition. Journalist Louise Rafkin writes, "there are those who are feeling curiously uncomfortable standing by as friends morph into men. Sometimes there is a generational flavor to this discomfort; many in the over-40 crowd feel particular unease", stating that this was "shaking the foundation of the lesbian-feminist world".&lt;ref name="rafkin"&gt;Rafkin, Louise (22 June 2003) [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/06/22/CM254728.DTL Straddling Sexes: Young lesbians transitioning into men are shaking the foundation of the lesbian-feminist world.] ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Trans men were part of the protest at the 2000 [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]], the first time the '[[womyn-born womyn]] only' policy has been used against trans males, women supporting the transgender community and young gender-variant women.&lt;ref name="mantilla2000"&gt;Mantilla, Karla (1 October 2000).

In the early 1970s, conflicts began to emerge due to different syntheses of lesbian, [[feminist]] and transgender political movements, particularly in the United States. San Francisco trans activist and entertainer [[Beth Elliott]] became the focus of debate over whether to include transgender lesbians in the movement, and she was eventually blacklisted by her own movement.&lt;ref name="rubin2003"&gt;Henry Rubin (2003).

===Bisexual communities and binarism===
One view is that the word ''bisexual'' is transphobic, as "bi" means "two" (thus implying a belief in the [[gender binary|binary view of gender]]). Some people, such as scholar [[Shiri Eisner]], say that some make the claim that the term "erases nonbinary genders and sexes out of existence",&lt;ref name="Eisner1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eisner|first1=Shiri|title=Bi: Notes for a Bisexual Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CbJaZIosLwQC&amp;pg=PT27|date=2 July 2013|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=978-1580054751|access-date=28 December 2014|quote=Yet another way in which bisexuality has been recently imagined is as inherently binary, and therefore intrinsically transphobic. [...] As the argument classically goes, since the word bisexuality has bi (literally: two) in it, it inherently refers to a two-gender structure.

However, some bisexual individuals and scholars object to the notion that bisexuality means sexual attraction to only two genders, arguing that since ''bisexual'' is not simply about attraction to two sexes and encompasses gender as well, it can include attraction to more than one&lt;ref name="biresource.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=BRC Brochure 2010 |year=2010 |publisher=Bisexual Resource Council/[[Bisexual Resource Center]] |work=biresource.net |access-date=8 July 2013 |url=http://www.biresource.net/BRC_Brochure_2010.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731101822/http://www.biresource.net/BRC_Brochure_2010.pdf |archive-date=31 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or more than two genders&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Doesn't identifying as bisexual reinforce a false gender binary?|publisher=[[American Institute of Bisexuality]]|date=2014|access-date=27 May 2014|url=http://bisexual.org/qna/doesnt-identifying-as-bisexual-reinforce-a-false-gender-binary/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is occasionally defined as such.&lt;ref name="Eisner1"/&gt; Others, such as the [[American Institute of Bisexuality]], say that the term "is an open and inclusive term for many kinds of people with same-sex and different-sex attractions"&lt;ref name="bisexual.org2"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the difference between bisexual and terms like pansexual, polysexual, omnisexual, ambisexual, and fluid?|publisher=[[American Institute of Bisexuality]]|date=2014|access-date=27 May 2014|url=http://bisexual.org/qna/what-is-the-difference-between-bisexual-and-terms-like-pansexual-polysexual-omnisexual-ambisexual-and-fluid/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the scientific classification ''bisexual'' only addresses the physical, biological sex of the people involved, not the gender-presentation."&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"/&gt;

To deal with issues related to transphobia and the gender binary, some individuals have taken on terms such as ''[[pansexual]]'', ''omnisexual'', or ''[[polysexual]]'' in place of the term ''bisexual''. The American Institute of Bisexuality argues that these terms "describe a person with homosexual and heterosexual attractions, and therefore people with these labels are also bisexual"&lt;ref name="bisexual.org2"/&gt; and that the notion that bisexuality is a reinforcement of a gender binary is a concept that is founded upon "anti-science, anti-Enlightenment philosophy that has ironically found a home within many Queer Studies departments at universities across the Anglophone world".&lt;ref name="bisexual.org"/&gt; Eisner agrees with this view, stating that "allegations of binarism have little to do with bisexuality's actual attributes or bisexual people's behavior in real life" and that the allegations are an attempt to separate the bisexual and transgender communities politically.&lt;ref name="Eisner1"/&gt;

==Consequences==

Whether intentional or not, transphobia and cissexism have severe consequences for the target of the negative attitude. Transphobia creates significant stresses for transgender people which can lead them to feel shame, low [[self-esteem]], [[social alienation|alienation]] and inadequacy. Transgender youth often try to cope with the stress by running away from home, dropping out of school, using drugs or [[Self-mutilation|self-harming]].&lt;ref name="Handbook of" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Disparities in Psychiatric Care: Clinical and Cross-Cultural Perspectives|last = Ruiz MD|first = Pedro|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0781796392|pages = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide rates among transgender people are thought to be especially high, because of how they are treated by their families and by society.&lt;ref name="Lennon-2014" /&gt;

The 2015 United States Transgender Survey, the largest such survey ever carried out (with 27,715 respondents), found that one in ten respondents suffered transphobic violence at the hands of a family member and 8% were forced to leave their homes for being transgender. The majority of those who were openly transgender or perceived as transgender at school were victims of some form of mistreatment on account of this, including verbal abuse (54%), physical attacks (24%), and sexual assault (13%). 17% experienced such severe mistreatment that they had to leave school. Support from one's community or family was correlated with more positive outcomes related to mental health and social functioning.&lt;ref name="usts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Executive-Summary-FINAL.PDF|title=Executive Summary|work=U.S. Transgender Survey|publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality|location=Washington|access-date=9 January 2017|archive-date=1 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201032258/http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Executive-Summary-FINAL.PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===
In adulthood, the effects of aggression and violence against various groups of transgender people has also been documented in domains such as mental and physical health, and safety and discrimination in the military. Transgender related bias, or discrimination, victimization, and rejection, affects transgender adults and the severity of PTSD symptoms they report. A systematic review completed in 2018 examined 77 studies that reported mental health [[Disparities in mental health care|disparities]] and [[social stress]] felt by TGD adults. The analysis found associations between TGD identity and anxiety, depression, PTSD, substance use, and [[suicidality]], as well as added social stress factors such as violence, discrimination, and exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Valentine|first1=Sarah E.|last2=Shipherd|first2=Jillian C.|date=2018|title=A systematic review of social stress and mental health among transgender and gender non-conforming people in the United States|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=66|pages=24–38|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2018.03.003|pmid=29627104|pmc=6663089|issn=0272-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt; When examining posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use in transgender adult communities, records indicated that transgender adults who have PTSD are more likely to be diagnosed with a [[substance use disorder]] within their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Keuroghlian|first1=Alex S.|last2=Reisner|first2=Sari L.|last3=White|first3=Jaclyn M.|last4=Weiss|first4=Roger D.|date=1 July 2015|title=Substance Use and Treatment of Substance Use Disorders in a Community Sample of Transgender Adults|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|volume=152|pages=139–146|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.04.008|issn=0376-8716|pmc=4458188|pmid=25953644}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[National Institutes of Health|National Institute of Health]] (NIH) analysis conducted with data collected at a [[Community health centers in the United States|community health center]] in the United States compared transgender and cisgender adult [[patient]]s on various possible health disparities.

===United States military===
Strong associations between [[military sexual assault]] (MSA) and PTSD have been documented in both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Military sexual trauma|last1=Hyun|first1=J.K.|last2=Kimerling|first2=R.|date=2009|journal=Research Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nationwide survey of military personnel in 2015 found that 17.2% of transgender [[veteran]]s reported experiencing MSA, and nearly two times more [[Trans man|transgender men]] (30%) had a MSA experience when compared to [[Trans woman|transgender women]] (15.2%). Links have been found between MSA experienced by transgender veterans and increased depression symptom severity, drug use, and PTSD symptom severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Beckman|first1=Kerry|last2=Shipherd|first2=Jillian|last3=Simpson|first3=Tracy|last4=Lehavot|first4=Keren|date=30 March 2018|title=Military Sexual Assault in Transgender Veterans: Results From a Nationwide Survey|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|volume=31|issue=2|pages=181–190|doi=10.1002/jts.22280|pmid=29603392|pmc=6709681|issn=0894-9867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posttraumatic stress disorder has also been associated with suicidality and substance use among adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Blanco|first1=Carlos|last2=Xu|first2=Yang|last3=Brady|first3=Kathleen|last4=Pérez-Fuentes|first4=Gabriela|last5=Okuda|first5=Mayumi|last6=Wang|first6=Shuai|date=2013|title=Comorbidity of posttraumatic stress disorder with alcohol dependence among US adults: Results from National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|volume=132|issue=3|pages=630–638|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.04.016|pmid=23702490|pmc=3770804|issn=0376-8716}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, records reflect that veterans who identify as transgender increasingly experience PTSD and [[Suicidal ideation|suicide ideation]], plans, and attempts. Further, transgender specific stigma experienced while in the military and PTSD have been associated with deaths by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lehavot|first1=Keren|last2=Simpson|first2=Tracy L.|last3=Shipherd|first3=Jillian C.|date=15 February 2016|title=Factors Associated with Suicidality Among a National Sample of Transgender Veterans|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|volume=46|issue=5|pages=507–524|doi=10.1111/sltb.12233|pmid=26878597|issn=0363-0234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This could be worsened by racial health disparities that exist within the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) Healthcare System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Andrea|last2=Borrero|first2=Sonya|last3=Wessel|first3=Charles|last4=Washington|first4=Donna L.|last5=Bean-Mayberry|first5=Bevanne|last6=Corbelli|first6=Jennifer|last7=Batch|first7=Bryan C.|last8=Breland|first8=Jessica Y.|last9=DiLeone|first9=Brooke|last10=Foynes|first10=Melissa Ming|last11=Keene|first11=Robin|date=2016|title=Racial and Ethnic Health Care Disparities Among Women in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System: A Systematic Review|journal=Women's Health Issues|volume=26|issue=4|pages=401–409|doi=10.1016/j.whi.2016.03.009|pmid=27138241|issn=1049-3867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, racial health disparities between non-Hispanic Black transgender veterans (BTV) and non-Hispanic White transgender veterans (WTV) have been acknowledged. Non-Hispanic Black transgender veterans are at increased odds of having an array of physical health issues/diseases, serious mental illnesses, alcohol use, tobacco use, homelessness, and previous [[Imprisonment|incarceration]] when compared to the WTV. Non-Hispanic White transgender veterans had increased odds of depression, obesity, and [[hypercholesterolemia]] when compared to BTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=George R.|last2=Jones|first2=Kenneth T.|date=16 July 2014|title=Racial Health Disparities in a Cohort of 5,135 Transgender Veterans|journal=Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities|volume=1|issue=4|pages=257–266|doi=10.1007/s40615-014-0032-4|issn=2197-3792|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous incarceration plays a larger role in the PTSD and homelessness that transgender veterans may experience. Specifically, transgender veterans that have a history of previous incarceration are more likely to have PTSD or to experience homelessness when compared to previously incarcerated veterans who are not transgender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=George R.|last2=Jones|first2=Kenneth T.|date=2015|title=Health Correlates of Criminal Justice Involvement in 4,793 Transgender Veterans|journal=LGBT Health|volume=2|issue=4|pages=297–305|doi=10.1089/lgbt.2015.0052|pmid=26788770|issn=2325-8292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty and homelessness===
Nearly one third of U.S. transgender people responding to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey lived in poverty, compared to 14% of the population. During the 12 months prior to the survey, 30% of employed transgender people were either fired or mistreated for being transgender, from verbal abuse to sexual violence. 30% had been homeless at some point in their life, and 12% had been homeless during the previous year. Family and community support were correlated with significantly lower rates of homelessness and poverty.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

===Violence and harassment===
During the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 46% of respondents had been verbally harassed and 9% had been physically attacked for being transgender. 10% had been sexually assaulted during the previous year, and 47% had been sexually assaulted at some point in their life.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

Evidence collected by the Transgender Day of Remembrance and National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs on the homicide rates of transgender individuals suggests that the homicide rates of young trans women who are Black or Latina are "almost certainly higher" than those of cisgender women of the same race.&lt;ref name="Dinno-2017"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dinno|first=Alexis|date=Sep 2017|title=Homicide Rates of Transgender Individuals in the United States: 2010–2014|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=107|issue=9|pages=1441–1447|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2017.303878|pmid=28727530|pmc=5551594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In public restrooms====
During the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 12% of respondents reported being verbally harassed in a public restroom. 1% reported being sexually assaulted in a public restroom for being transgender, and 1% reported being otherwise physically assaulted for being transgender. 9% reported being denied the right to use a public restroom consistent with their gender.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

===Health===
During the year prior to the 2015 U.S. survey, 59% of respondents reported avoiding using a public restroom out of fear of violence or harassment. 32% limited the amount they ate or drink in order to avoid using a public restroom. 8% reported suffering a urinary tract infection, kidney infection, or other kidney problem as a result of avoiding public restrooms.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

33% reported having negative experiences with a healthcare professional related to being transgender, such as verbal harassment or denial of treatment. 23% reported that they did not seek treatment for a condition out of fear of being mistreated, while 33% did not seek treatment because they were unable to afford it.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

During the month prior to the survey, 39% of American transgender people experienced major psychological distress, compared to 5% of the general population of the United States. 40% had attempted suicide at some point in their life, compared to 4.6 percent of the American population. Family and community support were correlated with far lower rates of suicide attempts and of major psychological distress.&lt;ref name="usts"/&gt;

A study conducted on transgender women of color in San Francisco has shown a higher correlation between transphobia and risk of transgender women engaging in HIV risk behavior. The study shows that the transgender youth face social discrimination, and they may not have a social role model. The young adults in this group have shown a higher risk of engaging in unprotected receptive anal intercourse when the exposure to transphobia is high. Therefore, as per the study shows a correlation between transphobia and high risk of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sugano|first1=Eiko|last2=Nemoto|first2=Tooru|last3=Operario|first3=Don|date=2006|title=The Impact of Exposure to Transphobia on HIV Risk Behavior in a Sample of Transgendered Women of Color in San Francisco|journal=AIDS and Behavior|volume=10|issue = 2|pages=217–225|doi=10.1007/s10461-005-9040-z|pmid=16362237|citeseerx=10.1.1.554.5857|s2cid=6642842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mental health====
People who are transgender are more likely to experience some type of psychological distress because of the harassment and discrimination that comes with transphobia. Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education conducted a nationwide survey on college campuses examining the psychological effects on transgender people, with a sample size of 86. Out of these 86 participants, 54% stated they have attended psychological counseling before and 10% had been hospitalized for reasons related to mental health. The final results of the study show that over twice as many participants who considered themselves transgender (43%) had engaged in self-injurious behavior, versus those who considered themselves male or female (16%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes|first=J.|title=The Center for Collegiate Mental Health: Practice and research working together |journal=Journal of College Counseling|pages=101–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Effrig|first1=Jessica C.|last2=Bieschke|first2=Kathleen J.|last3=Locke|first3=Benjamin D.|date=1 September 2011|title=Examining Victimization and Psychological Distress in Transgender College Students|journal=Journal of College Counseling|volume=14|issue=2|pages=143–157|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1882.2011.tb00269.x|issn=2161-1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Virupaksha, Muralidhar, and Ramakrishna, suicide attempts among transgender people globally range from 32% to 50%. In India, 31% to 50% of transgender people have tried to commit [[suicide]] before age 20. 50% of transgender people in Australia and 45% of those in England have attempted suicide at least once.&lt;ref name="Suicide"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Virupaksha|first1=H.

According to the study ''Transphobia Among Transgenders of Color'' by the [[University of California, San Francisco]], transphobia affects the psychological vulnerability of transgender people of color as compared to those of other ethnicities. Acts of transphobia such as undue denial of services, unfair dismissal from work places or stigmatization have far-reaching effects on the subjects such as low self-esteem, under-performance, stress, withdrawal or even depression. When it comes to the minorities, who are already proven to be undergoing various forms of discrimination, the consequences are even more exaggerated. Transgender people of color are more significantly associated with depression than their white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prevention.ucsf.edu/uploads/pubs/presentations/pdf/APHA_Nemoto.pdf|title=Transphobia Among Transgenders of Color|work=Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, University of California, San Francisco|date=November 2004|access-date=15 November 2017|archive-date=16 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116021212/https://prevention.ucsf.edu/uploads/pubs/presentations/pdf/APHA_Nemoto.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information regarding the effects of transphobia with respect to minority identities has not been well documented. In a 2018 review of mental health research regarding transgender individuals, only 4 out of 77 studies that were reviewed examined the intersectionality of transgender and racial identities. There were other studies that included disproportionately high amounts of transgender individuals who are in multiple minority groups, but the authors note that it is difficult to tell if these studies generalize to the transgender/ gender nonconforming community as a whole due to lack of extensive study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Valentine|first1=Sarah E|last2=Shipherd|first2=Jillian C|date=March 2018|title=A systematic review of social stress and mental health among transgender and gender non-conforming people in the United States|url=|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=66 December 2018|pages=24–38|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2018.03.003|pmid=29627104|pmc=6663089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help transgender people work through traumatic experiences, minority stress, and internalized transphobia, mental health practitioners have begun integrating the gender-affirmative model into [[cognitive behavioral therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Austin|first1=Ashley|last2=Craig|first2=Shelley L.|date=2015|title=Transgender Affirmative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Clinical Considerations and Applications |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|volume=46|issue=1|pages=21–29|doi=10.1037/a0038642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[person-centered therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Person-Centered Counselling for Trans and Gender Diverse People |last=Hope|first=Sam|date=2020|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1785925429|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[acceptance and commitment therapy]].&lt;ref name="Stitt"/&gt;

====Pregnancy issues====

Many transgender people transition without undergoing surgery to remove reproductive organs or to reconstruct genitals, thus transition does not necessarily remove the ability or the desire to reproduce. While the same-sex issues surrounding the birth and parenting of children have gained a degree of acceptance, trans practices of parenting have received much less attention and acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trans Pregnancy |url=https://transpregnancy.leeds.ac.uk/about/ |website=University of Leeds |access-date=November 5, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 a transgender man, [[Thomas Beatie]], became pregnant because his wife was infertile. His pregnancy drew world-wide attention. He commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Doctors have discriminated against us, turning us away due to their religious beliefs. Health care professionals have refused to call me by a male pronoun or recognize Nancy as my wife. Receptionists have laughed at us. Friends and family have been unsupportive; most of Nancy's family doesn't even know I'm transgender.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web |title='Pregnant Man' Thomas Beatie Splits From Wife Nancy: Why The Break-Up After 9 Years [PHOTOS] |url=https://www.ibtimes.com/pregnant-man-thomas-beatie-splits-wife-nancy-why-break-after-9-years-photos-555171 |date=2012-04-21 |website=International Business Times |access-date=November 5, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

My findings were quoted neutrally in one sentence of the 15 page final report. "Some have held that it would be preferable to modify society's sex role expectations of men and women than to modify either the body or the mind of individuals to fit these expectations. (Raymond 1980)." This was the only part of my paper that made it into the published report. The conclusion of the report was that transsexual surgery is "controversial" and "must be considered experimental." To give my submission credit for these conclusions is fatuous in the context of reading a report that was obviously informed by multiple sources.}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

West didn't have the time to check: avoiding any association with a tainted form of feminism took precedence over sharing a message about domestic violence.

But note the end result of this: a feminist has withdrawn support for another feminist speaking against male violence, ''because a man told her to.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
