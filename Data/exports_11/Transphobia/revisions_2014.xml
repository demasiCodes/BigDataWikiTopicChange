'''Transphobia''' (or less commonly '''transprejudice''') is a range of antagonistic attitudes and feelings against [[transsexuality]] and transsexual or [[transgender]] people, based on the expression of their internal gender identity (see [[Phobia#Terms for prejudice|Phobia – Terms for prejudice]]). Researchers describe transphobia as emotional disgust, fear, anger or discomfort felt or expressed towards people who do not conform to society's gender expectations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hate Crime: Impact, Causes and Responses|last = Chakraborti|first = Neil and Jon Garland|publisher = SAGE Publications, Ltd.|year = 2009|isbn = 1412945682|location = |pages = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology, Volume 2|last = Chrisler, Donald R.

The related term '''cissexism''' (which is sometimes used synonymously with transphobia or '''cisgenderism''') refers to the assumption that, due to human [[sexual differentiation]], one's [[gender]] is determined solely by a [[biological sex]] of male or female (based on the assumption that all people must have either an XX or XY sex-chromosome pair, or in the case of cisgenderism, a bivalent male or female expression), and that trans people are inferior to [[Cisgender|cis]] people, being in "defiance of nature".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Lennon|first= Erica|last2= Mistler|first2= Brian|date= 2014|title= Cisgenderism|url= |journal=Transgender Studies Quarterly |publisher= |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=63-64 |doi= 10.1215/23289252-2399623|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether intentional or not, both transphobia and cissexism have severe consequences for the target of the negative attitude. Many trans people also experience homophobia and [[heterosexism]] from people who associate their [[gender identity]] with [[homosexuality]], or because they also have a [[non-heterosexual]] sexual orientation. Attacking someone on the basis of a perception of their [[gender identity]] rather than a perception of their [[sexual orientation]] is known as "[[trans bashing]]", as opposed to "[[gay bashing]]". Homophobia and transphobia are correlated.&lt;ref name="Lives" /&gt;

== Etymology and use ==
''Transphobia'' is a [[portmanteau]] word patterned on the term ''[[homophobia]]''. It derives from the English [[English prefixes#Neo-classical|neo-classical prefix]] ''trans-'' (meaning "across, on the far side, beyond") from ''transgender'' and the root ''-phobia'' (from the {{lang-el|φόβος}}, ''phóbos'', "fear") found in ''homophobia''. Along with ''[[biphobia]]'', ''homophobia'' and ''transphobia'' are members of the family of terms used when [[Bigotry|intolerance]] and discrimination is directed toward [[LGBT]] people.

''Transphobia'' need not be a [[phobia]] as defined in [[clinical psychology]] (i.e., an [[anxiety disorder]]). Its meaning and use typically parallel those of ''[[xenophobia]]''.

The [[Adjective|adjectival]] form ''transphobic'' describes things or qualities related to transphobia, whereas the noun ''transphobe'' is a label for people thought to harbor transphobia.

==Origins==
The [[Transfeminism|transfeminist]] theorist and author [[Julia Serano]] argues in her book ''[[Whipping Girl]]'' that transphobia is rooted in [[sexism]]. She locates the origins of both transphobia and [[homophobia]] in what she calls "oppositional sexism", the belief that male and female are "rigid, mutually exclusive categories, each possessing a unique and nonoverlapping set of attributes, aptitudes, abilities, and desires". Serano contrasts oppositional sexism with "traditional sexism", the belief that males and [[masculinity]] are superior to females and [[femininity]]. Furthermore, she writes that transphobia is fueled by insecurities people have about gender and gender norms.&lt;ref name=serano&gt;Julia Serano. ''Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity'', Seal Press, 2007. ISBN 978-1-58005-154-5, ISBN 1-58005-154-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The transgender author and critic Jody Norton believes that transphobia is an extension of homophobia and [[misogyny]]. She argues that transgender people, like gays and lesbians, are hated and feared for challenging and undermining [[Gender role|gender norms]] and the [[gender binary]]. Norton writes that the "male-to-female transgender incites transphobia through her implicit challenge to the binary division of gender upon which male cultural and political hegemony depends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norton|first=Jody|title="Brain Says You're a Girl, But I Think You're a Sissy Boy": Cultural Origins of Transphobia|journal=International Journal of Sexuality and Gender Studies|year=1997|volume=2, Number 2|pages=139–164|doi=10.1023/A:1026320611878|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manifestations ==
===Harassment and violence===
{{see also|Violence against LGBT people}}
Harassment and violence directed against transgender people is often called [[trans bashing]], and can be physical, sexual or verbal. Whereas [[gay bashing]] is directed against a target's real or perceived [[sexual orientation]], trans bashing is directed against the target's real or perceived expressed [[gender identity]]. The term has also been applied to [[hate speech]] directed at transgender people&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2007/4-27/view/columns/10484.cfm Demagogues of defamation Gay: Where is the outrage when cable TV’s talking heads trash trans people?]&lt;/ref&gt; and to depictions of transgender people in the media that reinforce negative stereotypes about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary|last=McNamara|title=Transgender Artists, Work Gaining Acceptance|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2001-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable victims of violent crimes motivated by transphobia include [[Brandon Teena]], [[Gwen Araujo]], [[Angie Zapata]], [[Nizah Morris]], and [[Lauren Harries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4218250.stm|title=Transsexual to move to 'safer' LA|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 September 2005}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Psychological Association]], transgender children are likelier than other children to experience harassment and violence in school, foster care, residential treatment centers, homeless centers and juvenile justice programs.&lt;ref name="Cisgenderism"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cisgenderism in psychology: pathologising and misgendering children from 1999 to 2008|year = 2011|url = http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/72252/2/YGA%20%26%20PH%202011%20Cisgenderism.pdf|last = Ansara and Peter Hegarty|first = Y.

Three-quarters report having felt unsafe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As adults, transgender people are frequently subjected to ridicule, stares, taunting and threats of violence, even when just walking down the street or walking into a store.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transgender Voices: Beyond Women and Men|last = Girshick|first = Lori B.|publisher = University Press of New England|year = 2008|isbn = 158465838X|location = Hanover and London|pages = 133–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; A U.S. survey of 402 older, employed, high-income transgender people found that 60% reported violence or harassment because of their gender identity. 56% had been harassed or verbally abused, 30% had been assaulted, 17% had had objects thrown at them, 14% had been robbed and 8% had experienced what they characterized as an unjustified arrest.&lt;ref name="Lives"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Lives of Transgender People|last = Beemyn|first = Genny|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 0231143079|location = New York|pages = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of 81 transgender people in [[Philadelphia]] found 30% reported feeling unsafe in public because they were transgender, with 19% feeling uncomfortable for the same reason. When asked if they had ever been forced to have sex, experienced violence in their home, or been physically abused, the majority answered yes to each question.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transgender Health and HIV Prevention: Needs Assessment Studies from Transgender Communities Across the United States|last = Bockting|first = Walter O.|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2006|isbn = 0789030152|location = |pages = 41–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of American studies on sexual violence towards transgender people found that around 50% of transgender people have been sexually assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stotzer|first=Rebecca|title=Violence against transgender people: A review of United States data|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=14|issue=3|pages=170-179|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178909000202|accessdate=9 April 2014|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2009.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When transgender people are murdered, they are often shot or stabbed repeatedly, riddled with bullets or bludgeoned beyond recognition.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Educational Psychology|last = Salkind|first = Neil|publisher = SAGE|year = 2008|isbn = 1412916887|location = |pages = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misgendering and exclusion===
Misgendering is a word coined by [[Transsexualism|transsexual]] American writer and biologist [[Julia Serano]] to refer to the experience of being labeled by someone as having a gender other than the one you identify with. Misgendering can be deliberate or accidental. It ordinarily takes the form of a person using pronouns (including "it") to describe someone that are not the ones that person prefers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Queer Youth Cultures|last = Driver|first = Susan|publisher = State University of New York Press|year = 2008|isbn = 0791473384|location = |pages = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transgender Explained For Those Who Are Not|last = Herman|first = Joanne|publisher = AuthorHouse|year = 2009|isbn = 1449029574|pages = 50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Riddle of Gender: Science, Activism, and Transgender Rights|last = Rudacille|first = Deborah|publisher = Pantheon|year = 2005|isbn = 0375421629|location = |pages = 164–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transgender Rights|last = Currah|first = Paisley|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 2006|isbn = 0816643121|pages = 194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Transgender Employment Experiences: Gendered Perceptions and the Law|last = Bender-Baird|first = Kyla|publisher = SUNY Press|year = 2011|isbn = 1438436742|pages = 5–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling a person "ma'am" or "sir" in contradiction to the person's gender identity,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Q &amp; A: Queer in Asian America|last = Eng|first = David L.|publisher = Temple University Press|year = 1998|isbn = 1566396409|location = |pages = 232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Looking Queer: Body Image and Identity in Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, and Transgender Communities (Haworth Gay &amp; Lesbian Studies)|last = DeCecco|first = John|publisher = Routledge|year = 2012|isbn = 0789004631|location = New Jersey|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; using a pre-transition name for someone instead of a post-transition one,&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Transgender Phenomenon|last = Ekins|first = Richard|publisher = |year = |isbn = 1847877265|location = |pages = 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Just One of the Guys?: Transgender Men and the Persistence of Gender Inequality|last = Schilt|first = Kristen|publisher = University Of Chicago Press|year = 2011|isbn = 1847877265|location = |pages = 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Media willfully misgender Chelsea Manning|date = 22 August 2013|url = http://www.salon.com/2013/08/22/media_willfully_misgender_chelsea_manning/|last = McDonough|first = Katie|publisher = Salon Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; or insisting that a person behave consistently with their assigned rather than self-identified gender, for example by using a bathroom designated for males even though the person identifies as female.

In 2008, Allen Andrade beat to death Colorado transgender teenager Angie Zapata, who he afterwards described to police as "it."&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homofiles: Theory, Sexuality, and Graduate Studies|last = Battis|first = Jess|publisher = Lexington Books|year = 2011|isbn = 0739131915|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, after murdered 21-year-old New York trans woman Islan Nettles was referred to as "he" by a speaker at her memorial service, transgender actress [[Laverne Cox]] characterized misgendering as "part of the violence that led to Islan's death."&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

In 2014, a Connecticut trans girl known only as Jane Doe (due to her status as a minor) has several times been placed in facilities for men and boys during her continuing imprisonment without charges. She has also been misgendered by the writers of some letters to the editor of the Hartford Courant.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.courant.com/keyword/jane-doe&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people often are excluded from entitlements or privileges reserved for people whose gender identity they share, but whose assigned gender they do not. It is very common, for example, for transgender women to be stopped or questioned when they use public bathrooms designated for women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

Homeless shelters, hospitals and prisons have denied trans women admission to women's areas and forced them to sleep and bathe in the presence of men.&lt;ref name="transparent"&gt;{{cite book |last= Beam|first= Cris |title= Transparent |publisher= Harvest Books |date=January 2008|isbn= 978-0-15-603377-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation has been changing in some areas, however. For example, on February 8, 2006, New York City's Department of Homeless Services announced an overhaul of its housing policy with the goal of specifically ending discrimination against transgender people in its shelters.&lt;ref name="housing"&gt;{{cite web

===As users of healthcare===
{{See also|Healthcare and the LGBT community}}
A study of 81 transgender people in [[Philadelphia]] found 14% said they had been refused routine medical care because they were transgender. 18% answered yes when asked if, when they went in for a check-up, "being transgendered create[d] a problem" for them.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Transgender people depend largely on the medical profession to receive not only [[Hormone replacement therapy (trans)|hormone replacement therapy]], but also vital care. In one case, [[Robert Eads]] died of ovarian cancer after being refused treatment by more than two dozen doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ftminfo.net/sundance.html|title=FTM Informational Network&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;|accessdate=2009-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the US-based National Center For Transgender Equality's 2011 survey, 19% had been [[refused medical care]] due to their transgender or gender non-conforming status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Injustice at Every Turn A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://transequality.org/PDFs/Executive_Summary.pdf|publisher=transequality.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that refusal of treatment due to transphobia is not uncommon.
Another example of this is the case of [[Tyra Hunter]]. Hunter was involved in an automobile accident, and when [[Emergency medical services|rescue workers]] discovered she was transgender, they backed away and stopped administering treatment. She later died in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glaa.org/archive/1998/margiehunter1211.shtml|title=Victory in Tyra Hunter case&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;|accessdate=2009-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many European countries, any transgender person who wishes to change their legal gender must first be sterilized. Several countries are reviewing this law; Sweden repealed it in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pazulka|first=Nicole|title=17 European Countries Force Transgender Sterilization|url=http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/02/most-european-countries-force-sterilization-transgender-people-map|accessdate=August 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the workplace ===
Transphobia also manifests itself in the workplace. Some transgender people lose their [[employment|jobs]] when they begin to transition. A study from [[Willamette University]] stated that a transsexual person fired for following the recommended course of treatment rarely wins it back through federal or state statutes.&lt;ref name="TransEmploy"&gt;{{cite web |author=JoAnna McNamara
|title=Employment discrimination and the Transsexual|publisher=[[Willamette University]]|date=30 August 1996|url=http://www.willamette.edu/~rrunkel/gwr/mcnamara|accessdate=10 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News stories from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Associated Press]] cite a 1999 study by the [[San Francisco Department of Public Health]] finding a 70 percent [[unemployment]] rate amongst the city's transgender population. On February 18, 1999, the San Francisco Department of Public Health issued the results of a 1997 survey of 392 trans women and 123 trans men, which found that 40 percent of those trans women surveyed had earned money from full or part-time employment over the preceding six months. For trans men, the equivalent statistic was 81 percent. The survey also found that 46 percent of trans women and 57 percent of trans men reported [[employment discrimination]].&lt;ref name="transhealth"&gt;{{cite web |author=The Transgender Community Health Project |title=Sociodemographics|work=Descriptive Results|publisher=[http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu HIVInSite]|date=18 February 1999|url=http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=cftg-02-02#S5.1X|accessdate=7 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 American study found that among educators, trans educators are 10-20% likelier to experience workplace harassment than their gay and lesbian colleagues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the hiring process, discrimination may be either open or covert, with employers finding other ostensible reasons not to hire a candidate or just not informing prospective employees at all as to why they are not being hired. Additionally, when an employer fires or otherwise discriminates against a transgender employee, it may be a "mixed motive" case, with the employer openly citing obvious wrongdoing, job performance issues or the like (such as excessive tardiness, for example) while keeping silent in regards to transphobia.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

[[Workplace discrimination|Employment discrimination]] on the basis of gender identity and expression is [[Legal aspects of transsexualism in the United States#Discrimination|illegal in some U.S. cities, towns and states]]. Such discrimination is outlawed by specific legislation in the State of New Jersey and might be in other states (as it is in the states of California, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington) or city ordinances; additionally, it is covered by case law in some other states. (For example, Massachusetts is covered by cases such as Lie vs. Sky Publishing Co. and Jette vs. Honey Farms.) Several other states and cities prohibit such discrimination in public employment. Sweden and the United Kingdom has also legislated against employment discrimination on the grounds of gender identity. Sometimes, however, employers discriminate against transgender employees in spite of such legal protections.&lt;ref name="TransEmploy2"&gt;{{cite web |author=barbara findlay, Q.C. |title=Transgendered people and Employment: An equality analysis |publisher=[http://www.barbarafindlay.com/ barbara findlay Law Office]|date=June 1999|url=http://www.barbarafindlay.com/articles/43.pdf|accessdate=10 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is at least one high-profile employment-related court case unfavorable to transgender people. In 2000, the southern U.S. grocery chain [[Winn-Dixie (supermarket)|Winn-Dixie]] fired longtime employee Peter Oiler, despite a history of repeatedly earning raises and promotions, after management learned that the married, heterosexual truck driver occasionally [[crossdressing|cross-dressed]] off the job. Management argued that this hurt Winn-Dixie's corporate image. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed a lawsuit against Winn-Dixie on behalf of Oiler but a judge dismissed it.&lt;ref name="ACLUWinnDixie"&gt;{{cite web |author=Ronald L. Wilson |title=Oliver v. Winn-Dixie Complaint |date=23 October 2000 |url=http://www.aclufl.org/legislature_courts/legal_department/briefs_complaints/oiler_complaint.cfm |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes transgender people facing employment discrimination turn to [[sex industry|sex work]] to survive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacques|first=Juliet|title='No wonder many transsexual people end up in sex work'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/25/transsexual-people-sex-work|accessdate=30 March 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing them at additional risk of such things as encountering troubles with the law, including arrest and criminal prosecution; enduring workplace violence; and possibly contracting [[sexually transmitted disease]]s such as [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="transhealth" /&gt;

=== From government ===
Transgender people also face the denial of [[right of asylum]] or inhuman treatment in process of asylum-seeking. For example, Fernada Milan, a transsexual woman from [[Guatemala]] was placed in an asylum center for males in [[Denmark]] and while there, was raped by several men. She was in danger of deportation into Guatemala where transgender people have no rights and face possible execution, but has since been granted entry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uncommon-scents.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/what-im-most-afraid-of-when-i-go-back.html Transgender woman Fernada raped in a Danish centre for asylum seekers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender disenfranchisement is the practice of creating or upholding barriers that keep transgender individuals from [[voting]] and therefore restrict the principles of [[universal suffrage]].
{{See also|Transgender disenfranchisement in the United States}}

===In social conservatism===
The [[Christian Right]] has become increasingly involved in campaigning against transgender-inclusive antidiscrimination legislation. Much of this transphobia is based on conservative [[Catholic]] [[natural law]] theory, derived from the work of [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and then modified by [[John Finnis]], [[Robert P. George]] and other conservative Catholics to posit human 'essences' that are 'immutable' (like 'biological sex' or 'genetical or chromosomal sex') to discourage government funding for reassignment surgery, or inclusion within anti-discrimination legislation, such as [[Canada]]'s contemporary Bill C-279, intended to outlaw discrimination on the basis of gender identity.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

According to the Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance website, under Pope [[John Paul II]], the [[Holy See|Vatican]] adopted its current opposition to reassignment surgery in 2000, although it was not made official until 2003. Other Christian Right opponents of transgender rights include the US [[Family Research Council]], the late [[Charles Socarides]] and the [[American Family Association]], [[REAL Women of Canada]], [[Focus on the Family]], Canada's Lifesite and [[Family First New Zealand]]. Transgender rights activists and [[LGBT|LGB]] and other supporters question why a sectarian religious philosophy, such as "natural law" theory, should be binding on those who do not share these a priori religious conservative perceptions of gender identity and the morality of reassignment surgery or transsexuality, citing [[religious freedom]], freedom from religion and religious compulsion and [[separation of church and state]] as benchmarks of healthy democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religioustolerance.org/transsexu9a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religioustolerance.org/transsexu15.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radical feminist]] [[Janice Raymond]]'s 1979 book, ''The Transsexual Empire'', was and still is controversial due to its unequivocal condemnation of transsexual surgeries. In the book Raymond says, "All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves .... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive."&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymond|first=J.|year=1994|title=The Transsexual Empire|publisher=Teachers College Press|edition=2nd|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Perhaps the most visible site of conflict between feminists and [[trans women]] has been the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]]. The festival ejected a transsexual woman, Nancy Burkholder, in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="vangelder"&gt;

Simon and Schuster, ISBN 978-0-684-83957-8&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the festival has maintained an intention that it is for "[[womyn-born-womyn]]" only.&lt;ref&gt;http://michfest.com/festival_community_statements.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The activist group [[Camp Trans]] formed to protest the "womyn-born-womyn" intention and to advocate for greater acceptance of trans women within the feminist community. A number of prominent transgender activists and [[Transfeminism|transfeminists]] were involved in Camp Trans including [[Riki Wilchins]], Jessica Xavier, and [[Leslie Feinberg]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The festival considered allowing only post-operative trans women to attend, however this was criticized as [[Class discrimination|classist]], as many trans women cannot afford [[sex reassignment surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Kimberly Nixon is a trans woman who volunteered for training as a rape crisis counselor at [[Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter]] in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1995. When Nixon's transsexual status was determined, she was expelled. The staff decided that Nixon's status made it impossible for her to understand the experiences of their clients, and also required their clients to be genetically female. Nixon disagreed, disclosing her own history of partner abuse and sued for discrimination. Nixon's attorneys argued that there was no basis for the dismissal, citing Diana Courvant's experiences as the first publicly transsexual woman to work in a [[Women only space|women-only]] domestic violence shelter. In 2007 the Canadian Supreme Court refused to hear Nixon's appeal, ending the case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.egale.ca/index.asp?lang=E&amp;menu=34&amp;item=1147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/issues/nixon/jan082001_lakeman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perelle"&gt;

Outside Canada, not all rape survivors organisations refuse to support transsexual rape survivors. Wellington Independent Rape Crisis featured former [[sex worker]], [[New Zealand Labour Party]] MP and the world's first transsexual elected national representative [[Georgina Beyer]] on one of its "Take Back the Night" marches as a rape survivor herself, and Beyer has also assisted the Auckland-based HELP Foundation for sexual abuse counselling, prevention and support, appearing in a poster campaign to call for higher levels of government funding.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Transsexual women such as [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]] challenged the feminist conception of "biological woman". Stone worked as a sound engineer for [[Olivia Records]] from about 1974 to 1978, resigning as the controversy over a trans woman working for a lesbian-identified enterprise increased.&lt;ref name="sayer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sayer|first=Susan|title=From Lesbian Nation to Queer Nation|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6655/is_n2_v21/ai_n28666686/|publisher=Hecate|date=1995-10-01|accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate continued in Raymond's book,&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"/&gt; which devoted a chapter to criticism of "the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist." Groups like [[Lesbian Organization of Toronto]] then voted to exclude trans lesbians.&lt;ref name="ross1995"&gt;
Ross, Becki (1995). ''The House that Jill Built: A Lesbian Nation in Formation.'' University of Toronto Press, ISBN 978-0-8020-7479-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] labeled transgenderism "deeply problematic from a feminist perspective and [stated] that transsexualism should be seen as a violation of human rights."&lt;ref name="jeffreys1997"&gt;
Jeffreys, Sheila (1997). Transgender Activism: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective. "Journal of Lesbian Studies", Vol. 1(3/4) 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Andrea Dworkin]], a noted [[anti-pornography feminist]] supported the right of trans women to be considered authentic women in her book ''Women-Hating'' (1978). Other cisgender feminist support came from the work of [[poststructuralist]] feminist [[Judith Butler]], particularly her books ''Gender Trouble'' (1990) and ''Bodies That Matter'' (1993), which argue that the violent "inscription" of gender as a social construct on human bodies leads to violence against those that violate such binaristic gender dichotomies.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Butler (1990). ''Gender Trouble''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Butler (1993). ''Bodies That Matter''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Butler is lesbian. Most younger lesbian and other cisgender feminists strongly dissent from feminist transphobia. The latter is now generally regarded as archaic, rooted in feminists' historical distrust of patriarchal medical definitions of and interventions into women's physicality.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===In the gay, lesbian, and bisexual communities===
{{POV-section|date=June 2011}}
[[LGBT|LGB]] communities are sometimes uncomfortable with transgender individuals and issues; authors and observers, such as transgender author Jillian Todd Weiss, have written that "there are social and political forces that have created a split between gay/lesbian communities and bisexual/transgender communities, and these forces have consequences for civil rights and community inclusion. 'Biphobia' and 'transphobia' are a result of these social and political forces, not psychological forces causing irrational fears in aberrant individuals."&lt;ref name="weiss2004"&gt;Weiss JT (2004). GL vs BT The archaeology of biphobia and transphobia within U.S. gay and lesbian community. ''[[Journal of Bisexuality]]'', 3, 25-55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sears"&gt;Sears, J.T., and Williams, W.L. (1997). Overcoming Heterosexism and Homophobia. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":fone"&gt;Fone, B.R.S. (1998). ''The Columbia Anthology of Gay Literature: Readings from Western Antiquity to the Present Day.'' Columbia University Press, ISBN 9780231096706.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weiss traces this back to [[social constructions]] created by early [[sexologists]] which split [[homosexuality]] into sexual orientation (sexual object choice) and gender identity (sexual self-identification as male or female): "This scientific rationalism and [[medicalization]] of homosexuality confirmed it as a unitary, monolithic phenomenon.  This created a monosexist (exclusively same-sex) 'homosexual identity,' and a corresponding tension between identification as homosexual, on the one hand, and passing as heterosexual and/or engaging in heterosexual relationships."&lt;ref name="weiss2004"/&gt;

Historian [[Joanne Meyerowitz]] documented transphobia within the [[gay rights movement]] in the mid 20th century in response to publicity surrounding the transition of [[Christine Jorgensen]]. Jorgensen, who made frequent homophobic remarks and insisted she was not connected to or identified with gay men, was a polarizing figure among activists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1953, for example, ''ONE'' magazine published a debate among its readers as to whether gay men should denounce Jorgensen. In the opening salvo, the author Jeff Winters accused Jorgensen of a "sweeping disservice" to gay men. "As far as the public knows," Winters wrote, "you were merely another unhappy homosexual who decided to get drastic about it." For Winters, Jorgensen's story simply confirmed the false belief that all men attracted to other men must be basically feminine," which, he said, "they are not." Jorgensen's precedent, he thought, encouraged the "reasoning" that led "to legal limitations upon the homosexual, mandatory injections, psychiatric treatment – and worse." In the not-so-distant past, scientists had experimented with castrating gay men.&lt;ref name="mayerowitz2002"&gt;Meyerowitz, Joanne (2002). ''How Sex Changed: A History of Transsexuality in the United States.'' Harvard University Press ISBN 9780674009257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several prominent figures in [[second wave feminism]] have also been accused of transphobic attitudes, culminating in 1979 with the publication of ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]'' by lesbian ethicist [[Janice Raymond]], who popularized the term [[shemale]] as a slur of [[trans women]].&lt;ref name="Raymond 1994"/&gt;

Trans women are sometimes denied entry to women's spaces. The feminist [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]], for instance, has received much criticism for limiting its attendance to "[[womyn-born womyn]]".&lt;ref name="womynfest"&gt;{{cite web

Some trans men face ostracism and rejection from [[lesbian]] communities they had been part of prior to transition. Journalist Louise Rafkin writes, "There are those who are feeling curiously uncomfortable standing by as friends morph into men. Sometimes there is a generational flavor to this discomfort; many in the over-40 crowd feel particular unease."&lt;ref name="rafkin"&gt;Rafkin, Louise (June 22, 2003) [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/06/22/CM254728.DTL Straddling Sexes: Young lesbians transitioning into men are shaking the foundation of the lesbian-feminist world.] ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Trans men were part of the protest at the 2000 [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]], "the first time the 'womyn-born-womyn only' policy has been used against trannie boys, boydykes, FTM's, [[Lesbian Avengers]] and young [[gender-variant]] women."&lt;ref name="mantilla2000"&gt;Mantilla, Karla (October 1, 2000).

While many gays and lesbians feel that ''transgender'' is simply a name for a part of their own community (i.e. the LGBT community), others actively reject the idea that transgender people are part of their community, seeing them as entirely separate and distinct.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

Nor is it solely [[radical feminist]] lesbians who are antagonistic to transgender rights and inclusion. The centre-right [[Independent Gay Forum]] website has opposed transgender inclusion within the proposed US [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]], which would outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity within the area of paid employment within the United States, arguing that sexual orientation alone was a more pragmatic objective. However, New Zealand LGBT individuals have repeatedly called for the direct inclusion of gender identity within [[New Zealand Human Rights Act 1993]], its national anti-discrimination statute, instead of the current indirect inclusion that exists.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

In the early 1970s, conflicts began to emerge due to different syntheses of lesbian, [[feminist]] and transgender political movements, particularly in the United States. San Francisco trans activist and entertainer Beth Elliott became the focus of debate over whether to include transsexual lesbians in the movement, and she was eventually blacklisted by her own movement.&lt;ref name="rubin2003"&gt;Henry Rubin (2003). ''Self-made Men: Identity and Embodiment Among Transsexual Men.'' Vanderbilt 
University Press, ISBN 978-0-8265-1435-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nettick"&gt;Geri Nettick, Beth Elliot (1996). "Mirrors: Portrait of a Lesbian Transexual." Badboy Books ISBN 978-1-56333-435-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the terms ''man'' and ''woman'' also become unclear in a similar way under this philosophy, and many{{who|date=August 2014}} feel that the only real recourse is to accept that the mind and feeling of a person is the only thing that gives that person identity, and so a person that has a female identity and mind is indeed a woman. According to this thinking, it becomes clear that in at least a categorical sense, transgender people should only be accepted in the LGB community if they themselves self-identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual, and the blanket assumption on the part of some gay, lesbian and bisexual people on the nature of those transgender people who are in their LGB community with a view to dis-inclusion constitutes an issue of transphobia.&lt;ref name="GLBTphobia"&gt;GLBTphobia&lt;/ref&gt; The implacability of this question has been overcome by the rise in the 1990s of [[queer theory]] and the [[queer]] community, which defines ''queer'' as embracing all variants of sexual identity, sexual desire, and sexual acts that fall outside normative definitions of heterosexuality; thus a heterosexual man or woman as well as a transgender person of any sex can be included in the category of queer through their own choice.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Consequences==
Transphobia creates significant stresses for transgender people which can lead them to feel shame, low [[self-esteem]], [[social alienation|alienation]] and inadequacy. Transgender youth often try to cope with the stress by running away from home, dropping out of school, using drugs or [[Self-mutilation|cutting]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Disparities in Psychiatric Care: Clinical and Cross-Cultural Perspectives|last = Ruiz MD|first = Pedro|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year = 2009|isbn = 0781796393|location = |pages = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is difficult to obtain accurate statistics, [[suicide]] rates among transgender people are thought to be especially high, because of how they are treated by their families and by society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Suicide attempts reported by transgender and gender non-conforming adults vastly exceed the rate of the general U.S. population, 41 percent versus 4.6 percent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |first=Ann H. |last=Haas |author2=Philip Rodgers |title=Suicide Attempts Among Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Adults |number= |institution=American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and Williams Institute, UCLA School of Law |year=2014 | url = http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/AFSP-Williams-Suicide-Report-Final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
