'''Nonviolence''' (''[[ahimsa]]'') is a [[philosophy]] and strategy for [[social change]] that rejects the use of [[violence]]. Thus, nonviolence is an alternative to passive acceptance of oppression or of armed struggle against it.  Nonviolence practitioners use diverse methods in their campaigns for social change, including critical forms of education and persuasion, [[civil disobedience]] and nonviolent [[direct action]], and targeted communication via mass media.

In modern times, nonviolence is a powerful tool for social protest.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Brian Adler, Neil Towne, ''Looking Out/Looking In: Interpersonal Communication'', 9th ed. Harcourt Brace College Publishers, p. 416, 1999. "In the twentieth century, nonviolence proved to be a powerful tool for political change."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester R. Kurtz, Jennifer E. Turpin, ''Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict'', p.557, 1999. "In the West, nonviolence is well recognized for its tactical, strategic, or political aspects. It is seen as a powerful tool for redressing social inequality."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Kurlansky]], ''Nonviolence: The History of a Dangerous Idea'', Foreward by [[Dalai Lama]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=loIfgZgr9BsC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=all+religions++nonviolence&amp;ei=bw_nSqSdBKa2NMalmYcM#v=onepage&amp;q=dangerous&amp;f=false p. 5-6], Modern Library (April 8, 2008), ISBN 0812974476 "Advocates of nonviolence — dangerous people — have been there throughout history, questioning the greatness of Caesar and Napoleon and the Founding Fathers and Roosevelt and Churchill."&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples of its use in [[nonviolent resistance]] and [[nonviolent revolution]], including [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] leading a decades-long nonviolent struggle against [[British Raj|British rule in India]], which eventually helped [[India]] win its independence in 1947, [[Martin Luther King]]'s adoption of Gandhi's nonviolent methods in the struggle to win [[civil rights]] for [[African American]]s, and [[César Chávez]]'s campaigns of nonviolence in the 1960s to protest the treatment of farm workers in California.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley M. Burstein and Richard Shek: ''"World History Ancient Civilizations "'', page 154. Holt, Rinhart and Winston, 2005.  As Chavez once explained, "Nonviolence is not inaction. It is not for the timid or the weak. It is hard work, it is the patience to win."&lt;/ref&gt; The 1989 "[[Velvet Revolution]]" in [[Czechoslovakia]] that saw the overthrow of the [[Communist]] government&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.radio.cz/history/history15.html RP's History Online - Velvet Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt; is considered one of the most important of the largely nonviolent [[Revolutions of 1989]].&lt;ref name=Ives2001&gt;{{Cite web | title = No Fear | url = http://salsa.net/peace/article38.html |date=19 October 2001 | location = Palo Alto College | author = Ives, Susan | accessdate = 2009-05-17 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently the nonviolent campaigns of [[Leymah Gbowee]] and the women of [[Liberia]] were able to achieve peace after a 14-year civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Graham, [http://augustafreepress.com/2009/10/26/peacebuilding-alum-talks-practical-app-of-nonviolence/ Peacebuilding alum talks practical app of nonviolence], Augusta Free Press, October 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This story is captured in a 2008 documentary film [[Pray the Devil Back to Hell]].

(2010) "To Abolish War." ''Journal of Aggression, Conflict, and Peace Research'' 2(4): 44-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "nonviolence" is often linked with or even used as a synonym for [[pacifism]]; however, the two concepts are fundamentally different. Pacifism denotes the rejection of the use of violence as a personal decision on moral or spiritual grounds, but does not inherently imply any inclination toward change on a sociopolitical level.  Nonviolence on the other hand, presupposes the intent of (but does not limit it to) social or political change as a reason for the rejection of violence. Also, a person may advocate nonviolence in a specific context while advocating violence in other contexts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Forms==

Advocates of nonviolence believe cooperation and consent are the roots of political power: all regimes, including bureaucratic institutions, financial institutions, and the armed segments of society (such as the military and police); depend on compliance from citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = The Politics of Nonviolent Action | publisher = Porter Sargen | year = 1973 | page = 12 | isbn = 9780875580685}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a national level, the strategy of nonviolence seeks to undermine the power of rulers by encouraging people to withdraw their consent and cooperation. The forms of nonviolence draw inspiration from both religious or ethical beliefs and political analysis. Religious or ethically based nonviolence is sometimes referred to as ''principled,'' ''philosophical,'' or ''ethical'' nonviolence, while nonviolence based on political analysis is often referred to as ''tactical,'' ''strategic,'' or ''pragmatic'' nonviolence. Commonly, both of these dimensions may be present within the thinking of particular movements or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/nv2.htm Two Kinds of Nonviolent Resistance] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[Gene Sharp]], in his book ''The Politics of Nonviolent Action,'' suggests that the absence of nonviolence from mainstream historical study is because elite interests are not served by the dissemination of techniques for social struggle that rely on the collective power of a mobilized citizenry rather than on access to wealth or weaponry. This does not seem to fit in any of the established sections, but it is a good point. --&gt;

===Philosophical===
[[Image:Mahavir.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Mahavira]],To liberate one's self, Mahavira taught the necessity of right faith, right knowledge and right conduct. Right conduct includes five great vows out of which first is Nonviolence (Ahimsa) - to cause no harm to any living being in any manner]]

Love of the enemy, or the realization of the humanity of all people, is a fundamental concept of ''philosophical'' nonviolence. The goal of this type of nonviolence is not to defeat the enemy, but to win them over and create love and understanding between all.&lt;ref name="CRMV"&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/nvpower.htm Nonviolent Resistance &amp; Political Power] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans (U.S.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mark Kurlansky "All religions discuss the power of nonviolence and the evil of violence." Such principles or tenets can be found in each of the major [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] religious traditions ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]) as well as in the major [[Dharmic]] religious traditions ([[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]). Examples of nonviolence found in religion and spirituality include the [[Sermon on the Mount]] when [[Jesus]] urges his followers to "love thine enemy," in the [[Taoist]] concept of ''[[wu wei|wu-wei]]'', or effortless action, in the philosophy of the martial art [[Aikido]], in the [[Buddhist]] principle of ''[[metta]]'', or loving-kindness towards all beings; and in the principle of ''[[ahimsa]]'', or nonviolence toward any being, shared by [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and some forms of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kurlansky, ''Nonviolence: The History of a Dangerous Idea‎'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=loIfgZgr9BsC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=all+religions++nonviolence&amp;ei=bw_nSqSdBKa2NMalmYcM#v=onepage&amp;q=all%20religions%20%20nonviolence&amp;f=false p. 7-13], [http://books.google.com/books?id=loIfgZgr9BsC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=all+religions++nonviolence&amp;ei=bw_nSqSdBKa2NMalmYcM#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam&amp;f=false p. 33].&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, focus on both nonviolence and forgiveness of sin can be found in the story of [[Abel]] in the [[Qur'an]]; [[Liberal movements within Islam]] have consequently used this story to promote [[Jewish]] ideals of nonviolence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Nonviolence is also part of modern [[paganism|pagan]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Madden, Raven Grimassi, Starhawk, ''Exploring the Pagan Path: Wisdom from the Elders'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=f611rWb4YjUC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=nonviolence+pagan+starhawk&amp;ei=vRPnSubBD4TWNNawoN4L#v=onepage&amp;q=nonviolence&amp;f=false p. 259], Career Press, 2005 ISBN 1-56414-788-6&lt;/ref&gt; An American author, [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862) had a major impact on the philosophy of nonviolence. [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mohandas Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] were influenced by Thoreau.

===Pragmatic===
The fundamental concept of ''pragmatic'' (or ''tactical'' or ''strategic'') nonviolence is to create a social dynamic or political movement that can effect social change without necessarily winning over those who wish to maintain the status quo.&lt;ref name="CRMV"/&gt;

In modern industrial democracies, nonviolence has been used extensively by political sectors without mainstream political power such as labor, peace, environment and women's movements. Lesser known is the role that nonviolence has played and continues to play in undermining the power of repressive political regimes in the developing world and the former eastern bloc. Susan Ives emphasized this point with a quote from Walter Wink, "In 1989, thirteen nations comprising 1,695,000,000 people experienced nonviolent revolutions that succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations... If we add all the countries touched by major nonviolent actions in our century (Korea, the Philippines, South Africa... the independence movement in India...) the figure reaches 3,337,400,000, a staggering 65% of humanity! All this in the teeth of the assertion, endlessly repeated, that nonviolence doesn't work in the 'real' world."&lt;ref name=Ives2001/&gt;

As a technique for social struggle, nonviolence has been described as "the politics of ordinary people", reflecting its historically mass-based use by populations throughout the world and history. Maybe the first of its kind which had huge political impact on history started from March 1 movement in Korea and later it influenced Gandhi's campaign as well. The March 1 Movement was a catalyst for the establishment of the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] in [[Shanghai]] in April 1919 and also gave influence on [[nonviolent resistance]] in India and many other countries&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreafocus.or.kr/design2/layout/content_print.asp?group_id=102423&lt;/ref&gt;
.
Struggles most often associated with nonviolence are the non co-operation campaign for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], the movement to attain [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights]] for [[African American]]s, led by [[Martin Luther King]] and [[James Bevel]], and [[People Power Revolution|People Power]] in the [[Philippines]].

Also of primary significance is the notion that just means are the most likely to lead to just ends. When Gandhi said that "the means may be likened to the seed, the end to a tree," he expressed the philosophical kernel of what some refer to as ''[[prefigurative politics]]''. Martin Luther King, a student of Gandhian nonviolent resistance, concurred with this tenet of the method, concluding that "...nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek." Proponents of nonviolence reason that the actions taken in the present inevitably re-shape the social order in like form. They would argue, for instance, that it is fundamentally irrational to use violence to achieve a peaceful society. People have come to use nonviolent methods of struggle from a wide range of perspectives and traditions. A landless peasant in Brazil may nonviolently occupy a parcel of land for purely practical motivations. If they do not, the family will starve. A Buddhist monk in Thailand may "ordain" trees in a threatened forest, drawing on the teachings of Buddha to resist its destruction. A waterside worker in England may go on strike in socialist and union political traditions. All the above are using nonviolent methods but from different standpoints. Likewise, secular political movements have utilized nonviolence, either as a tactical tool or as a strategic program on purely pragmatic and strategic levels, relying on its political effectiveness rather than a claim to any religious, moral, or ethical worthiness.
[[Image:Salt March.jpg|thumb|200px|Gandhi used the weapon of nonviolence against [[British Raj]]]]

Respect or love for opponents also has a pragmatic justification, in that the technique of separating the deeds from the doers allows for the possibility of the doers changing their behavior, and perhaps their beliefs. Martin Luther King said, "Nonviolence means avoiding not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit. You not only refuse to shoot a man, but you refuse to hate him."{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Finally, the notion of ''[[Satya]]'', or truth, is central to the Gandhian conception of nonviolence. Gandhi saw truth as something that is multifaceted and unable to be grasped in its entirety by any one individual. All carry pieces of the truth, he believed, but all need the pieces of others’ truths in order to pursue the greater truth. This led him to believe in the inherent worth of dialogue with opponents, in order to understand motivations. On a practical level, the willingness to listen to another's point of view is largely dependent on reciprocity. In order to be heard by one's opponents, one must also be prepared to listen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Nonviolence has even obtained a level of institutional recognition and endorsement at the global level. On November 10, 1998, the [[United Nations]] General Assembly proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the International [[Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]].

===Living===
For many, practicing nonviolence goes deeper than withholding from violent behavior or words. It means caring in one's heart for everyone, even those one strongly disagrees with, that is who are antithetical or opposed. For some, this principle entails a commitment to restorative or [[transformative justice]] and [[prison abolition]]. By extrapolation comes the necessity of caring for those who are not practicing nonviolence, who are violent. Of course no one can simply will themselves to have such care, and this is one of the great personal challenges posed by nonviolence - once one believes in nonviolence in theory, how can the person live it? It requires an opening of the heart and mind to all of existence, and a deep love for all that is. Because we are all interconnected, to love oneself is to love everyone; to hate another is to hate oneself. Because we learn violence, it is necessary to unlearn that violence through practicing love and compassion at every possible opportunity.{{Or|date=August 2010}}

===Respect===
Nonviolence, for many, involves a respect and reverence for all sentient and non-sentient beings. This might include the practice of not eating animal flesh ([[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]]), religious practices of non-harm to all beings ([[Jainism]], for example), and caring for the welfare of all beings. [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[James Bevel]], and other nonviolent proponents advocated vegetarianism as part of their nonviolent philosophy.  Buddhists extend this respect for life to animals, plants, and even minerals.

==Methods==
[[Image:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]]]]
Nonviolent action generally comprises three categories: ''Acts of Protest and Persuasion'', ''Noncooperation'', and ''Nonviolent Intervention''.&lt;ref name= "UN"&gt;[http://www.un.org/events/nonviolence/2008/background.shtml United Nations International Day of Non-Violence], United Nations, 2008. see [[International Day of Non-Violence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acts of protest====
Nonviolent acts of protest and persuasion are symbolic actions performed by a group of people to show their support or disapproval of something. The goal of this kind of action is to bring public awareness to an issue, persuade or influence a particular group of people, or to facilitate future nonviolent action. The message can be directed toward the public, opponents, or people affected by the issue.  Methods of protest and persuasion include speeches, public communications, [[petition]]s, symbolic acts, art, [[Demonstration (people)|processions (marches), and other public assemblies]].&lt;ref name="sharp2005" &gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = Waging Nonviolent Struggle | publisher = Extending Horizon Books | year = 2005 | pages = 50–65 | isbn = 0875581625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Noncooperation====
Noncooperation involves the purposeful withholding of cooperation or the unwillingness to initiate in cooperation with an opponent. The goal of noncooperation is to halt or hinder an industry, political system, or economic process. Methods of noncooperation include [[labor strike]]s, [[boycotts|economic boycotts]], [[civil disobedience]], [[Tax resistance|tax refusal]], and general disobedience.&lt;ref name="sharp2005" /&gt;

====Nonviolent intervention====
Nonviolent intervention, compared to protest and noncooperation, is a more direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example to maintain an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example to drastically forward a nonviolent struggle into the opponent's territory. Intervention is often more immediate and effective than the other two methods, but is also harder to maintain and more taxing to the participants involved.  Methods of intervention includes occupations ([[sit-ins]]), [[blockade]]s, fasting ([[hunger strikes]]), truck cavalcades, and dual sovereignty/parallel government.&lt;ref name="sharp2005" /&gt;

Tactics must be carefully chosen, taking into account political and cultural circumstances, and form part of a larger plan or strategy. [[Gene Sharp]], a political scientist and nonviolence activist, has written extensively about methods of nonviolence. In his book "Waging Nonviolent Struggle" he describes 198 methods of nonviolent action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | url = http://peacemagazine.org/198.htm  | title = The Methods of Nonviolent Action | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | year = 1973 | publisher = Peace magazine | accessdate = 2008-11-07 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Greece, [[Aristophanes]]' [[Lysistrata]] gives the fictional example of women withholding sexual favors from their husbands until war was abandoned. The deterrence of violent attack and promotion peaceful resolution of conflicts, as a method of intervention across borders, has occurred throughout history with some failures (at least on the level of deterring attack) such as the [[Human shield action to Iraq|Human Shields]] in [[Iraq]] because it failed to ascertain the value of the goal compared with the value of human life in its context of war; but also many successes, such as the work of the Guatemala Accompaniment Project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nisgua.org/ Network in Solidarity with the People of Guatemala]&lt;/ref&gt; Several non-governmental organizations, including [[Peace Brigades International]] and [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]], are working in this area.  Their primary tactics are unarmed accompaniment, human rights observation, and reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PBI's principles | url=http://www.peacebrigades.org/about-pbi/how-we-work/ | work=Peace Brigades International | publisher=PBI General Assembly | date=1992, 2001 | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Christian Peace Maker Teams Mission Statement | url=http://www.cpt.org/about/mission | work=Christian Peacemaker Team | publisher=CPT founding conference | year=1986 | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another powerful tactic of nonviolent intervention invokes public scrutiny of the oppressors as a result of the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to violently repress nonviolent resisters, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = The Politics of Nonviolent Action | publisher = P. Sargent Publisher | year = 1973 | page =  657 | isbn = 9780875580685}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = Waging Nonviolent Struggle | publisher = Extending Horizon Books | year = 2005 | page = 381 | isbn = 0875581625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green politics ==
{{Green politics sidebar}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}
Nonviolence has been a central concept in green political philosophy. It is included in the [[Global Greens Charter]]. Greens believe that society should reject the current patterns of violence and embrace nonviolence. Green Philosophy draws heavily on both Gandhi and the Quaker traditions, which advocate measures by which the escalation of violence can be avoided, while not cooperating with those who commit violence. These greens believe that the current patterns of violence are incompatible with a sustainable society because it uses up limited resources and many forms of violence, especially nuclear weapons, are damaging for the environment. Violence also diminishes one and the group.

Some green political parties, like the Dutch [[GroenLinks]], evolved out of the cooperation of the peace movement with the environmental movement in their resistance to [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear energy]].

As Green Parties have moved from the fringes of society towards becoming more and more influential in government circles, this commitment to nonviolence has had to be more clearly defined. In many cases, this has meant that the party has had to articulate a position on nonviolence that differentiates itself from classic pacifism. The leader of the [[German Greens]], for example, was instrumental in the NATO intervention in [[Serbia]], arguing that being in favor of nonviolence should never lead to passive acceptance of genocide. Similarly, [[Elizabeth May]] of the [[Green Party of Canada]] has stated that the Canadian intervention in [[Afghanistan]] is justified as a means of supporting women's rights.

This support for military action by Green Party leaders has led to criticism from within its membership in Canada and Germany, because the bombing of Serbia and military movements against the Afghan Taliban are viewed as clear violations of nonviolent principles.

==Revolution==
Certain individuals ([[Barbara Deming]], [[Danilo Dolci]], [[Devere Allen]] etc.) and party groups (e.g. [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]], [[Pacifist Socialist Party]] or [[War Resisters League]]) have advocated [[nonviolent revolution]] as an alternative to violence as well as elitist reformism. This perspective is usually connected to militant [[anti-capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Many leftist and socialist movements &lt;!-- which movements? --&gt; have hoped to mount a "peaceful revolution" by organizing enough strikers to completely paralyze it. With the state and corporate apparatus thus crippled, the workers would be able to re-organize society along radically different lines. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Some have argued that a relatively nonviolent revolution would require fraternisation with military forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1555 Dan Jakopovich: Revolution and the Party in Gramsci's Thought: A Modern Application.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Leon Trotsky]], [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], [[Subhash Chandra Bose]], [[George Orwell]], [[Ward Churchill]]&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Ward et al. ''[[Pacifism as Pathology]]''. [[Arbeiter Ring Publishing|Arbeiter Ring]], 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malcolm X]] were fervent critics of nonviolence, arguing variously that nonviolence and pacifism are an attempt to impose the morals of the [[bourgeoisie]] upon the [[proletariat]], that violence is a necessary accompaniment to revolutionary change, or that the right to self-defense is fundamental.

In the midst of violent repression of radical [[African American]]s in the United States during the 1960s, [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] member [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] said of the nonviolent tactics of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The concept of nonviolence is a false ideal. It presupposes the existence of compassion and a sense of justice on the part of one's adversary. When this adversary has everything to lose and nothing to gain by exercising justice and compassion, his reaction can only be negative."&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson, George. Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters of George Jackson. Lawrence Hill Books, 1994. ISBN 1-55652-230-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;Walters, Wendy W. At Home in Diaspora. U of Minnesota Press, 2005. ISBN 0-8166-4491-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Malcolm X also clashed with civil rights leaders over the issue of nonviolence, arguing that violence should not be ruled out where no option remained:
:"I believe it's a crime for anyone being brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself."&lt;ref&gt;X, Malcolm and Alex Haley:''"The Autobiography of Malcolm X"'', page 366. Grove Press, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

Lance Hill criticizes nonviolence as a failed strategy and argues that black armed self-defense and civil violence motivated civil rights reforms more than peaceful appeals to morality and reason (see Lance Hill's "Deacons for Defense").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncpress.unc.edu/books/t-5056.html The Deacons for Defense:Armed Resistance and the Civil Rights Movement] By Lance Hill, The University of North Carolina Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''How Nonviolence Protects the State'', anarchist [[Peter Gelderloos]] criticizes nonviolence as being ineffective, racist, statist, patriarchal, tactically and strategical inferior to militant activism, and deluded.&lt;ref&gt;Gelderloos, Peter. ''How Nonviolence Protects the State''. Boston: [[South End Press]], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gelderloos claims that traditional histories whitewash the impact of nonviolence, ignoring the involvement of militants in such movements as the [[Indian independence movement]] and the [[Civil Rights movement]] and falsely showing Gandhi and King as being their respective movements' most successful activists.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p.7-12.&lt;/ref&gt; He further argues that nonviolence is generally advocated by privileged white people who expect "oppressed people, many of whom are people of color, to suffer patiently under an inconceivably greater violence, until such time as the Great White Father is swayed by the movement's demands or the pacifists achieve that legendary 'critical mass.'"&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficacy of nonviolence was also challenged by some anti-capitalist protesters advocating a "diversity of tactics" during street demonstrations across Europe and the US following the anti-[[World Trade Organization]] protests in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] in 1999. American [[feminism|feminist]] writer [[D. A. Clarke]], in her essay "A Woman With A Sword," suggests that for nonviolence to be effective, it must be "practiced by those who could easily resort to force if they chose." This argument reasons that nonviolent tactics will be of little or no use to groups that are traditionally considered incapable of violence, since nonviolence will be in keeping with people's expectations for them and thus go unnoticed. Such is the principle of ''dunamis'' (from the Greek: δύνάμις or, restrained power).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
