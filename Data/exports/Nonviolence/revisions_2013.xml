'''Nonviolence''' is the practice of being harmless to self and others under every condition.  It comes from the belief that hurting people, animals or the environment is unnecessary to achieve an outcome and refers to a general philosophy of abstention from violence based on moral, religious or spiritual principles.&lt;ref&gt;A clarification of this and related terms appears in [[Gene Sharp]], ''Sharp's Dictionary of Power and Struggle: Language of Civil Resistance in Conflicts'', Oxford University Press, New York, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, the philosophy of nonviolence is rooted in the simple belief that God is harmless. Mahavira (599 BCE–527 BCE[1]),the twenty-fourth "tirthankara" of Jain religion was the Torch-bearer of "[[Ahimsa]]" and introduced the word to world in large and applied in his life.  Therefore, to more strongly connect with God, one must likewise be harmless.  Nonviolence also has 'active' or 'activist' elements, in that believers accept the need for nonviolence as a means to achieve political and [[social change]]. Thus, for example, the Gandhian ''[[ahimsa]]'' is a philosophy and strategy for [[social change]] that rejects the use of [[violence]], but at the same time sees [[nonviolent action]] (also called [[civil resistance]]) as an alternative to passive acceptance of oppression or armed struggle against it.  In general, advocates of an activist philosophy of nonviolence use diverse methods in their campaigns for social change, including critical forms of education and persuasion, mass noncooperation [[civil disobedience]] and nonviolent [[direct action]] and social, political, cultural and economic forms of intervention.

In modern times, nonviolent methods of action have been a powerful tool for social protest and revolutionary social and political change.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Brian Adler, Neil Towne, ''Looking Out/Looking In: Interpersonal Communication'', 9th ed. Harcourt Brace College Publishers, p. 416, 1999. "In the twentieth century, nonviolence proved to be a powerful tool for political change."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester R. Kurtz, Jennifer E. Turpin, ''Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict'', p.557, 1999. "In the West, nonviolence is well recognized for its tactical, strategic, or political aspects. It is seen as a powerful tool for redressing social inequality."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Kurlansky]], ''Nonviolence: The History of a Dangerous Idea'', Foreword by [[Dalai Lama]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=loIfgZgr9BsC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=all+religions++nonviolence&amp;ei=bw_nSqSdBKa2NMalmYcM#v=onepage&amp;q=dangerous&amp;f=false p. 5-6], Modern Library (April 8, 2008), ISBN 0-8129-7447-6 "Advocates of nonviolence — dangerous people — have been there throughout history, questioning the greatness of Caesar and Napoleon and the Founding Fathers and Roosevelt and Churchill."&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples of their use. Fuller surveys may be found in the entries on [[civil resistance]], [[nonviolent resistance]] and [[nonviolent revolution]]. Here certain movements particularly influenced by a philosophy of nonviolence should be mentioned, including [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] leading a decades-long nonviolent struggle against [[British Raj|British rule in India]], which eventually helped [[India]] win its independence in 1947, [[Martin Luther King]]'s adoption of Gandhi's nonviolent methods in the struggle to win [[civil rights]] for [[African American]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"James L.

It is not for the timid or the weak. It is hard work, it is the patience to win."&lt;/ref&gt; The 1989 "[[Velvet Revolution]]" in [[Czechoslovakia]] that saw the overthrow of the [[Communist]] government&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.radio.cz/history/history15.html RP's History Online - Velvet Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt; is considered one of the most important of the largely nonviolent [[Revolutions of 1989]].&lt;ref name=Ives2001&gt;{{Cite web | title = No Fear | url = http://salsa.net/peace/article38.html |date=19 October 2001 | location = Palo Alto College | author = Ives, Susan | accessdate = 2009-05-17 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently the nonviolent campaigns of [[Leymah Gbowee]] and the women of [[Liberia]] were able to achieve peace after a 14-year civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Graham, [http://augustafreepress.com/2009/10/26/peacebuilding-alum-talks-practical-app-of-nonviolence/ Peacebuilding alum talks practical app of nonviolence], Augusta Free Press, October 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This story is captured in a 2008 documentary film [[Pray the Devil Back to Hell]]. In an essay, "To Abolish War," evolutionary biologist [[Judith Hand]] advocated the use of nonviolent direct action to dismantle the global [[war]] machine.&lt;ref name = "TAW"&gt;Hand, Judith L. (2010) "To Abolish War." ''Journal of Aggression, Conflict, and Peace Research'' 2(4): 44-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "nonviolence" is often linked with or even used as a synonym for peace, and despite being frequently equated with passivity and pacifism, this is rejected by non-violent advocates and activists.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Peter and Jack DuVall (2001) "A Force More Powerful: A Century of Non-Violent Conflict"(Palgrave Macmillan)&lt;/ref&gt; Non-violence (with a hyphen) refers more specifically to the absence of violence and is always the choice to do no harm or the least harm, and passivity is the choice to do nothing.  Sometimes non-violence is the same as being passive, and other times it isn't. So for example, if a house is burning down, the most harmless appropriate action is to put the fire out, not to sit by and passively let the fire burn.   There is considerable confusion and contradiction written about non-violence, harmlessness and passivity. A person may advocate nonviolence in a specific context while advocating violence in other contexts. For example, someone who passionately opposes abortion as a life-saving practice may concurrently advocate violence to kill an abortionist.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts, Introduction, in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009 [http://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s pp. 3 and 13-20.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==

Advocates of nonviolent action believe cooperation and consent are the roots of political power: all regimes, including bureaucratic institutions, financial institutions, and the armed segments of society (such as the military and police); depend on compliance from citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = The Politics of Nonviolent Action | publisher = Porter Sargent | year = 1973 | page = 12 | isbn = 978-0-87558-068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a national level, the strategy of nonviolent action seeks to undermine the power of rulers by encouraging people to withdraw their consent and cooperation. The forms of nonviolence draw inspiration from both religious or ethical beliefs and political analysis. Religious or ethically based nonviolence is sometimes referred to as ''principled,'' ''philosophical,'' or ''ethical'' nonviolence, while nonviolence based on political analysis is often referred to as ''tactical,'' ''strategic,'' or ''pragmatic'' nonviolent action. Commonly, both of these dimensions may be present within the thinking of particular movements or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/nv2.htm Two Kinds of Nonviolent Resistance] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[Gene Sharp]], in his book ''The Politics of Non-violent Action,'' suggests that the absence of nonviolent action from mainstream historical study is because elite interests are not served by the dissemination of techniques for social struggle that rely on the collective power of a mobilized citizenry rather than on access to wealth or weaponry. This does not seem to fit in any of the established sections, but it is a good point. --&gt;

===Philosophical===
[[Image:Mahavir.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Mahavira]],To liberate one's self, Mahavira taught the necessity of right faith, right knowledge and right conduct. Right conduct includes five great vows out of which first is Nonviolence (Ahimsa) - to cause no harm to any living being in any manner]]

Love of the enemy, or the realisation of the humanity of all people, is a fundamental concept of ''philosophical'' nonviolence. The goal of this type of nonviolence is not to defeat the enemy, but to develop tolerance for all by understanding and loving all beings.&lt;ref name="CRMV"&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/nvpower.htm Nonviolent Resistance &amp; Political Power] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans (U.S.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mark Kurlansky, "all religions discuss the power of nonviolence and the evil of violence." Such principles or tenets can be found in each of the major [[Indian religions|Indian religious traditions]] ([[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]]) as well as in the major [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] religious traditions ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]]{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}). The [[Chandogya Upanishad]], which is part of the [[Upanishads]], one of the principal scriptures of [[Hinduism]] that dates to the 8th or 7th century BCE, bars violence against "all creatures" (''sarva-bhuta'') and establishes nonviolence as a code of conduct for Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 2-5; English translation: Schmidt p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Jainism]] preaches the mantra "Ahimsa Parmo-Dharam" which means non-violence is the supreme religion and has very comprehensively defined non violence to not just mean abstaining from violence but also means to have a deep reverence for life, for it believes that all life howsoever small is sacred and should be given the freedom to live. Examples of nonviolence found in religion and spirituality include the [[Sermon on the Mount]] in which [[Jesus]] urges his followers, "love your enemies," in the [[Taoist]] concept of ''[[wu wei|wu-wei]]'', or effortless action, in the philosophy of the martial art [[Aikido]], in the [[Buddhist]] principle of ''[[metta]]'', or loving-kindness towards all beings, in the principle of ''[[ahimsa]]'', or nonviolence toward any being, shared by [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kurlansky, ''Nonviolence: The History of a Dangerous Idea'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=loIfgZgr9BsC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=all+religions++nonviolence&amp;ei=bw_nSqSdBKa2NMalmYcM#v=onepage&amp;q=all%20religions%20%20nonviolence&amp;f=false p. 7-13], [http://books.google.com/books?id=loIfgZgr9BsC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=all+religions++nonviolence&amp;ei=bw_nSqSdBKa2NMalmYcM#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam&amp;f=false p. 33].&lt;/ref&gt; Nonviolence is also part of modern [[paganism|pagan]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Madden, Raven Grimassi, Starhawk, ''Exploring the Pagan Path: Wisdom from the Elders'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=f611rWb4YjUC&amp;pg=PA260&amp;dq=nonviolence+pagan+starhawk&amp;ei=vRPnSubBD4TWNNawoN4L#v=onepage&amp;q=nonviolence&amp;f=false p. 259], Career Press, 2005 ISBN 1-56414-788-6&lt;/ref&gt; American author [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862) had a major impact on the philosophy of nonviolence. [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Mohandas Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] were influenced by Thoreau.

===Pragmatic===
The fundamental concept of ''pragmatic'' (or ''tactical'' or ''strategic'') nonviolent action is to create a social dynamic or political movement that can effect social change without necessarily winning over those who wish to maintain the status quo.&lt;ref name="CRMV"/&gt;

[[Nicolas Walter]] noted the idea that non-violence might work "runs under the surface of Western political thought without
ever quite disappearing".&lt;ref name="nw"&gt;Nicolas Walter, "Non-Violent Resistance:Men Against War". Reprinted
in Nicolas Walter, ''Damned Fools in Utopia'' edited by [[David Goodway]]. PM Press 2010.  
ISBN 160486222X (pp. 37-78).&lt;/ref&gt; Walter noted [[Étienne de La Boétie|Étienne de La Boétie's]]
''Discourse on Voluntary Servitude'' (sixteenth century) and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|P.B. Shelley's]]  
''[[The Masque of Anarchy]]'' (1819) contain arguments for resisting tyranny without 
using violence.&lt;ref name="nw" /&gt; In 1838, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] helped
found the [[Non-Resistance Society|New England Non-Resistance Society]],a society devoted to achieving racial and 
gender equality through the rejection of all violent actions.&lt;ref name="nw" /&gt;

In modern industrial democracies, nonviolent action has been used extensively by political sectors without mainstream political power such as labor, peace, environment and women's movements. Lesser known is the role that nonviolent action has played and continues to play in undermining the power of repressive political regimes in the developing world and the former eastern bloc. Susan Ives emphasizes this point by quoting [[Walter Wink]]: {{Quotation|"In 1989, thirteen nations comprising 1,695,000,000 people experienced nonviolent revolutions that succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations ... If we add all the countries touched by major nonviolent actions in our century (the Philippines, South Africa ... the independence movement in India ...), the figure reaches 3,337,400,000, a staggering 65% of humanity! All this in the teeth of the assertion, endlessly repeated,that nonviolence doesn't work in the 'real' world."|Walter Wink|Christian theologian&lt;ref name=Ives2001/&gt;}}

As a technique for social struggle, nonviolent action has been described as "the politics of ordinary people", reflecting its historically mass-based use by populations throughout the world and history.

Struggles most often associated with nonviolence are the [[Non-cooperation movement|non-cooperation campaign]] for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], the movement to attain [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights]] for [[African American]]s, led by Rev. Dr [[Martin Luther King]], and the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]].

Also of primary significance is the notion that just means are the most likely to lead to just ends. When Gandhi said that "the means may be likened to the seed, the end to a tree," he expressed the philosophical kernel of what some refer to as ''[[prefigurative politics]]''. Martin Luther King, a student of Gandhian nonviolent resistance, concurred with this tenet, concluding that "nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek." Proponents of nonviolence reason that the actions taken in the present inevitably re-shape the social order in like form. They would argue, for instance, that it is fundamentally irrational to use violence to achieve a peaceful society.

People have come to use nonviolent methods of struggle from a wide range of perspectives and traditions. A landless peasant in Brazil may nonviolently occupy a parcel of land for purely practical motivations. If they do not, the family will starve. A Buddhist monk in Thailand may "ordain" trees in a threatened forest, drawing on the teachings of Buddha to resist its destruction. A waterside worker in England may go on strike in socialist and union political traditions. All the above are using nonviolent methods but from different standpoints. Likewise, secular political movements have utilized nonviolent methods, either as a tactical tool or as a strategic program on purely pragmatic and strategic levels, relying on their political effectiveness rather than a claim to any religious, moral or ethical worthiness.
[[Image:Salt March.jpg|thumb|200px|Gandhi used the weapon of nonviolence against [[British Raj]]]]

Respect or love for opponents also has a pragmatic justification, in that the technique of separating the deeds from the doers allows for the possibility of the doers changing their behaviour, and perhaps their beliefs. Martin Luther King wrote, "Nonviolent resistance... avoids not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit. The nonviolent resister not only refuses to shoot his opponent, but he also refuses to hate him." &lt;ref name="Jr.2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Luther King, Jr.|authorlink=Martin Luther King, Jr.|title=Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vnJ1NY5mbXEC&amp;pg=PT114|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-0070-0|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the notion of ''[[Satya]]'', or truth, is central to the Gandhian conception of nonviolence. Gandhi saw truth as something that is multifaceted and unable to be grasped in its entirety by any one individual. All carry pieces of the truth, he believed, but all need the pieces of others’ truths in order to pursue the greater truth. This led him to believe in the inherent worth of dialogue with opponents, in order to understand motivations. On a practical level, the willingness to listen to another's point of view is largely dependent on reciprocity. In order to be heard by one's opponents, one must also be prepared to listen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Nonviolence has obtained a level of institutional recognition and endorsement at the global level. On November 10, 1998, the [[United Nations]] General Assembly proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the International [[Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]].

===Living===
For many, practicing nonviolence goes deeper than abstaining from violent behavior or words. It means overriding the impulse to be hateful and holding love in the heart for everyone, even those with whom one strongly disagrees. This requires an opening of the heart and mind to all of existence, and a deep love for all that is. Because we are all interconnected, to love oneself is to love everyone; to hate another is to hate oneself. Because violence is learned, it is necessary to unlearn violence by practicing love and compassion at every possible opportunity.  For some, the commitment to non-violence entails a belief in restorative or [[transformative justice]], an abolition of the death penalty and other harsh punishments.  This may involve the necessity of caring for those who are violent.

===Respect for All Life===
Nonviolence, for many, involves a respect and reverence for all [[Sentience#Animal_rights_and_sentience|sentient]] and [[Biocentrism (ethics)|non-sentient beings]]. This might include [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionism]], the practice of not eating animal flesh ([[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]]), spiritual practices of [[Ahimsa|non-harm]] to all beings and caring for the rights of all beings. [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[James Bevel]], and other nonviolent proponents advocated vegetarianism as part of their nonviolent philosophy.  Buddhists extend this respect for life to animals, plants, and even minerals, while Jains extend this respect for life to animals, plants and even micro-organisms.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Methods==
[[Image:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King]]]]
Nonviolent action generally comprises three categories: ''Acts of Protest and Persuasion'', ''Noncooperation'', and ''Nonviolent Intervention''.&lt;ref name= "UN"&gt;[http://www.un.org/events/nonviolence/2008/background.shtml United Nations International Day of Non-Violence], United Nations, 2008. see [[International Day of Non-Violence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acts of protest===

Nonviolent acts of protest and persuasion are symbolic actions performed by a group of people to show their support or disapproval of something. The goal of this kind of action is to bring public awareness to an issue, persuade or influence a particular group of people, or to facilitate future nonviolent action. The message can be directed toward the public, opponents, or people affected by the issue.  Methods of protest and persuasion include speeches, public communications, [[petition]]s, symbolic acts, art, [[Demonstration (people)|processions (marches), and other public assemblies]].&lt;ref name="sharp2005" &gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = Waging Nonviolent Struggle | publisher = Extending Horizon Books | year = 2005 | pages = 50–65 | isbn = 0-87558-162-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noncooperation===

Noncooperation involves the purposeful withholding of cooperation or the unwillingness to initiate in cooperation with an opponent. The goal of noncooperation is to halt or hinder an industry, political system, or economic process. Methods of noncooperation include [[labour strike]]s, [[boycotts|economic boycotts]], [[civil disobedience]], [[sex strike]], [[Tax resistance|tax refusal]], and general disobedience.&lt;ref name="sharp2005" /&gt;

===Nonviolent intervention===

Compared with protest and noncooperation, nonviolent intervention is a more direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example to maintain an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example, to drastically forward a nonviolent struggle into the opponent's territory. Intervention is often more immediate and effective than the other two methods, but is also harder to maintain and more taxing to the participants involved.

[[Gene Sharp]], a political scientist who seeks to advance the worldwide study and use of strategic nonviolent action in conflict, has written extensively about the methods of nonviolent action.  In his book ''Waging Nonviolent Struggle'' he describes 198 methods of nonviolent action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://peacemagazine.org/198.htm  | title = The Methods of Nonviolent Action | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | year = 1973 | publisher = Peace magazine | accessdate = 2008-11-07 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Greece, [[Aristophanes]]' [[Lysistrata]] gives the fictional example of women withholding sexual favors from their husbands until war was abandoned. A modern work of fiction inspired by Gene Sharp and by Aristophanes is ''[[A Door into Ocean]]'' by [[Joan Slonczewski]], depicting an ocean world inhabited by women who use nonviolent means to repel armed space invaders. Other methods of nonviolent intervention include occupations ([[sit-in]]s), [[blockade]]s, fasting ([[hunger strikes]]), truck cavalcades, and dual sovereignty/parallel government.&lt;ref name="sharp2005" /&gt;

Tactics must be carefully chosen, taking into account political and cultural circumstances, and form part of a larger plan or strategy.

Successful [[Third Party Nonviolent Intervention|nonviolent cross-border intervention]] projects include the Guatemala Accompaniment Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nisgua.org/ Network in Solidarity with the People of Guatemala]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peace Brigades International]] and [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]]. Developed in the early 1980s, and originally inspired by the Gandhian [[Shanti Sena]], the primary tools of these organisations have been nonviolent protective accompaniment, backed up by a global support network which can respond to threats, local and regional grassroots diplomatic and [[peacebuilding]] efforts, human rights observation and witnessing, and reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PBI's principles | url=http://www.peacebrigades.org/about-pbi/how-we-work/ | work=Peace Brigades International | publisher=PBI General Assembly | date=1992, 2001 | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Christian Peace Maker Teams Mission Statement | url=http://www.cpt.org/about/mission | work=Christian Peacemaker Team | publisher=CPT founding conference | year=1986 | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another powerful tactic of nonviolent intervention invokes public scrutiny of the oppressors as a result of the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = The Politics of Nonviolent Action | publisher = P.

==Revolution==
Certain individuals ([[Barbara Deming]], [[Danilo Dolci]], [[Devere Allen]] etc.) and party groups (e.g. [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]], [[Pacifist Socialist Party]] or [[War Resisters League]]) have advocated [[nonviolent revolution]] as an alternative to violence as well as elitist reformism. This perspective is usually connected to militant [[anti-capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Many leftist and socialist movements &lt;!-- which movements? --&gt; have hoped to mount a "peaceful revolution" by organising enough strikers to completely paralyse the state and corporate apparatus, allowing workers to re-organise society along radically different lines. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Some have argued that a relatively nonviolent revolution would require fraternisation with military forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1555 Daniel Jakopovich: Revolution and the Party in Gramsci's Thought: A Modern Application.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Leon Trotsky]], [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and [[Ward Churchill]]&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Ward et al. ''[[Pacifism as Pathology]]''. [[Arbeiter Ring Publishing|Arbeiter Ring]], 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malcolm X]] were fervent critics of nonviolence, arguing variously that nonviolence and pacifism are an attempt to impose the morals of the [[bourgeoisie]] upon the [[proletariat]], that violence is a necessary accompaniment to revolutionary change, or that the right to self-defense is fundamental.  Non-violent activists responding to these arguments point to the success of non-violent struggles against the Nazi regimes in [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|Denmark]] and even in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Aryan woman, protesting against the arrest of their Jewish husbands, secured the release of their husbands even at the height of Nazi power&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]] argued that the nonviolent resistance strategy of Gandhi could be effective in countries with "a free press and the right of assembly", which could make it possible "not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary"; however, he was skeptical of Gandhi's approach being effective in the opposite sort of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. ''Reflections on Gandhi'', Partisan Review, January 1949.  Found at http://www.orwell.ru/library/reviews/gandhi/english/e_gandhi on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] similarly affirmed Gandhi's approach while criticizing aspects of it.  He argued that "[t]he advantage of non-violence as a method of expressing moral goodwill lies in the fact that it protects the agent against the resentments which violent conflict always creates in both parties to a conflict, and it proves this freedom of resentment and ill-will to the contending party in the dispute by enduring more suffering than it causes."  However, Niebuhr also held "[t]he differences between violent and non-violent methods of coercion and resistance are not so absolute that it would be possible to regard violence as a morally impossible instrument of social change."&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, Reinhold. ''Moral Man and Immoral Society'', Charles Scribner's Sons.  1932.  Chapter 9.  Found at http://www.colorado.edu/ReligiousStudies/chernus/4800/MoralManAndImmoralSociety/Section6.htm on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of repression of radical [[African American]] groups in the United States during the 1960s, [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] member [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] said of the nonviolent tactics of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The concept of nonviolence is a false ideal. It presupposes the existence of compassion and a sense of justice on the part of one's adversary. When this adversary has everything to lose and nothing to gain by exercising justice and compassion, his reaction can only be negative."&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson, George.

Malcolm X also clashed with civil rights leaders over the issue of nonviolence, arguing that violence should not be ruled out where no option remained:
:"I believe it's a crime for anyone being brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself."&lt;ref&gt;X, Malcolm and Alex Haley:''"The Autobiography of Malcolm X"'', page 366. Grove Press, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

Lance Hill criticizes nonviolence as a failed strategy and argues that black armed self-defense and civil violence motivated civil rights reforms more than peaceful appeals to morality and reason (see Lance Hill's "Deacons for Defense").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncpress.unc.edu/books/t-5056.html The Deacons for Defense:Armed Resistance and the Civil Rights Movement] By Lance Hill, The University of North Carolina Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''How Nonviolence Protects the State'', [[anarchist]] [[Peter Gelderloos]] criticises nonviolence as being ineffective, racist, statist, patriarchal, tactically and strategically inferior to militant activism, and deluded.&lt;ref&gt;Gelderloos, Peter. ''How Nonviolence Protects the State''. Boston: [[South End Press]], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gelderloos claims that traditional histories whitewash the impact of nonviolence, ignoring the involvement of militants in such movements as the [[Indian independence movement]] and the [[Civil Rights movement]] and falsely showing Gandhi and King as being their respective movement's most successful activist.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p.7-12.&lt;/ref&gt; He further argues that nonviolence is generally advocated by privileged white people who expect "oppressed people, many of whom are people of color, to suffer patiently under an inconceivably greater violence, until such time as the Great White Father is swayed by the movement's demands or the pacifists achieve that legendary 'critical mass.'"&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., p.23.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand anarchism also includes a section committed to nonviolence called [[anarcho-pacifism]].&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence "Resisting the Nation State, the pacifist and anarchist tradition" by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt; The main early influences were the thought of [[Henry David Thoreau]]&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; and [[Leo Tolstoy]] while later the ideas of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] gained importance.&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; It developed "mostly in Holland, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], before and during the [[Second World War]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=George Woodcock|first=George|last=Woodstock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|quote=Finally, somewhat aside from the curve that runs from anarchist individualism to anarcho-syndicalism, we come to Tolstoyanism and to pacifist anarchism that appeared, mostly in the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the United states, before and after the Second World War and which has continued since then in the deep in the anarchist involvement in the protests against nuclear armament.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficacy of nonviolence was also challenged by some anti-capitalist protesters advocating a "diversity of tactics" during street demonstrations across Europe and the US following the anti-[[World Trade Organization]] protests in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] in 1999. American [[feminism|feminist]] writer [[D. A. Clarke]], in her essay "A Woman With A Sword," suggests that for nonviolence to be effective, it must be "practiced by those who could easily resort to force if they chose." This argument reasons that nonviolent tactics will be of little or no use to groups that are traditionally considered incapable of violence, since nonviolence will be in keeping with people's expectations for them and thus go unnoticed. Such is the principle of ''dunamis'' (from the Greek: δύναμις, meaning power).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Indian [[guru]] [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh|Osho Rajneesh]] heavily criticised teachings of nonviolence, on psychological and spiritual grounds:

:Why in India is there so much public violence? It is because of the teachings of nonviolence. [[Ahimsa|For five thousand years people have been taught to be non-violent]]; they have learnt the trick of pretending. And all that has happened is that they have [[Psychological repression|repressed]] their violence. They are sitting on volcanoes - any excuse, any small excuse, and the violence is triggered. And then it goes on spreading like a wild fire.

:Whenever there is a Hindu-Mohammedan riot, you can see the real faces of the people of this country - murderous. And just a day before, the Hindu was praying in the temple and the Mohammedan was praying in the [[mosque]], and one was reading the [[Vedas]] and the other was reading the [[Koran]], and they looked so pious. Let there be a riot, and all that piousness simply evaporates as if it had never been there, and they are ready to kill, rape.... They are ready to do anything!
:This violence erupts again and again in this country because of the teaching, a wrong teaching, which is based on [[Psychological repression|repression]]. Whenever you repress something, it will come up again and again.
:I teach you awareness, not repression. That's why I don't talk about nonviolence. (...) And the more you become aware, the more your life will attain to silence, peace, love. They are by-products of awareness.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://oshosearch.net/Convert/Articles_Osho/Philosophia_Perennis_Vol_1/Osho-Philosophia-Perennis-Vol-1-00000007.html   Osho ''Philosophia Perennis'' Vol 1, Subject 7 ''Awareness: The Master Key'']
&lt;/ref&gt;

William P. Meyers argued that nonviolence encourages violence by the state and corporations. He further accuses the FBI undermining [[Earth First!]] with notions of NonViolence in a deliberate (and successful) attempt to render the group harmless and ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiipublishing.com/books/nonviolence.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
