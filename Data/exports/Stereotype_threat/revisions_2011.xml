'''Stereotype threat''' is the experience of [[anxiety]] or concern in a situation where a person has the potential to confirm a negative [[stereotype]] about their social group.&lt;ref name="GilovichKeltner2006" /&gt; First described by social psychologist [[Claude Steele]] and his colleagues, stereotype threat has been shown to reduce the performance of individuals who belong to negatively stereotyped groups. For example, stereotype threat can lower the intellectual performance of African-Americans taking the [[SAT|SAT reasoning test]] used for college entrance in the United States, due to the stereotype that African-Americans are less intelligent than other groups.&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Claude M.|last2=Aronson|first2=Joshua|title=Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=69|issue=5|year=1995|pages=797–811|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797|pmid=7473032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its introduction into the scientific literature in 1995, stereotype threat has become one of the most widely studied topics in the field of [[social psychology]].&lt;ref name="An Integrated Process Model of Stereotype Threat Effects on Performance"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmader|first1=Toni|last2=Johns|first2=Michael|last3=Forbes|first3=Chad|title=An integrated process model of stereotype threat effects on performance|journal=Psychological Review|volume=115|issue=2|year=2008|pages=336–356|issn=1939-1471|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.115.2.336|pmid=18426293|pmc=2570773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotype threat is a potential contributing factor to long-standing racial and gender gaps in academic performance. However, it may occur whenever an individual's performance might confirm a negative stereotype. This is because stereotype threat is thought to arise from the particular situation rather than from an individual's personality traits or characteristics. Since most people have at least one [[social identity]] which is negatively stereotyped, most people are vulnerable to stereotype threat if they encounter a situation in which the stereotype is relevant. Situational factors that increase stereotype threat include the difficulty of the task, the individual's belief that the task measures their ability, and the relevance of the negative stereotype to the task. Individuals show stronger stereotype threat effects when they want to do well on the task, identify strongly with the stereotyped group, or expect discrimination due to the negative stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Contending with Group Image: The Psychology of Stereotype and Social Identity Threat | year = 2002 | journal = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | pages = 439 | volume = 34 | issue = 379 | last1 = Steele| first1 =  Claude M. | last2 =  Spencer | first2 =  Steven J. | last3 =  Aronson| first3 =  Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated experiences of stereotype threat can lead to a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] of undermined confidence, poorer performance, and loss of interest in the relevant area of achievement.&lt;ref name="GilovichKeltner2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilovich|first1=Thomas|last2=Keltner|first2=Dacher|last3=Nisbett|first3=Richard E.|title=Social psychology|year=2006|publisher=W.W.

In the early 1990s, Claude Steele, in collaboration with Joshua Aronson, performed the first experiments demonstrating that stereotype threat can undermine intellectual performance. They had African-American and European-American college students take a difficult verbal portion of the [[Graduate Record Examination]] test. As would be expected based on national averages, the African-American students performed less well on the test. In a subsequent experiment, Steele and Aronson changed the instructions of the test so that participants no longer believed that the test accurately measured intellectual performance. This change reduced the performance gap between the two groups.&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson" /&gt; Steele and Aronson concluded that changing the instructions on the test can reduce African-American students' concern about confirming a negative stereotype about their group. Supporting this conclusion, they found that African-American students who regarded the test as a measure of intelligence had more thoughts related to negative stereotypes of their group. Steele and Aronson measured this through a word completion task. They found that African-Americans who thought the test measured intelligence were more likely to complete word fragments using words that are associated with relevant negative stereotypes (''e.g.'' completing __mb as "dumb" rather than "numb").&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson" /&gt;

More than 300 published papers document the effects of stereotype threat on performance in a variety of domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arizona.edu/sites/arizona.edu/files/users/user14/Stereotype%20Threat%20Overview.pdf |title=Stereotype Threat: An Overview |last1=Stroessner |first1=Steve |last2=Good |first2=Catherine |date= |work=www.dingo.sbs.arizona.edu |publisher=Reducing Stereotype Threat.org |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study on chess players revealed that women players performed more poorly than expected when they were told they would be playing against a male opponent. In contrast, women who were told that their opponent was female performed as would be predicted by past ratings of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maass|first1=Anne|last2=D'Ettole|first2=Claudio|last3=Cadinu|first3=Mara|title=Checkmate?

In one experiment, women who took a mathematics exam along with two other women got 70% of the answers right, while those doing the same exam in the presence of two men got an average score of 55%.&lt;ref name="InzlichtBen-Zeev2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inzlicht|first1=M.|last2=Ben-Zeev|first2=T.|title=A Threatening Intellectual Environment: Why Females Are Susceptible to Experiencing Problem-Solving Deficits in the Presence of Males|journal=Psychological Science|volume=11|issue=5|year=2000|pages=365–371|issn=0956-7976|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers Vishal Gupta, Daniel Turban, and Nachiket Bhawe extended stereotype threat research to [[entrepreneurship]], a traditionally male-stereotyped profession. Their study revealed that stereotype threat can depress women's entrepreneurial intentions while boosting men's intentions. However, when entrepreneurship is presented as a gender-neutral profession, men and women express a similar level of interest in becoming entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name = "Stereotype Threat and Entrepreneurial Intentions"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=V. K.|last2=Bhawe|first2=N.

When it was described as a test of athletic ability, European-American students performed worse, but when the description mentioned intelligence, African-American students performed worse.&lt;ref name="StoneLynch1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Jeff|last2=Lynch|first2=Christian I.|last3=Sjomeling|first3=Mike|last4=Darley|first4=John M.|title=Stereotype threat effects on Black and White athletic performance.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=77|issue=6|year=1999|pages=1213–1227|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, findings suggest that stereotype threat may occur in any situation where an individual faces the potential of confirming a negative stereotype. For example, stereotype threat can negatively affect the performance of [[European Americans]] in athletic situations&lt;ref name="White Men Can't Jump"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Jeff|last2=Perry|first2=W.|last3=Darley|first3=John|title="White Men Can't Jump": Evidence for the Perceptual Confirmation of Racial Stereotypes Following a Basketball Game|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|volume=19|issue=3|year=1997|pages=291–306|issn=0197-3533|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1903_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as men who are being tested on their social sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Stereotype Threat in Men"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Anne M.|last2=Eagly|first2=Alice H.|title=Stereotype Threat in Men on a Test of Social Sensitivity|journal=Sex Roles|volume=52|issue=7–8|year=2005|pages=489–496|issn=0360-0025|doi=10.1007/s11199-005-3714-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of stereotype threat can shift depending on which group identity is salient to the situation. For example, Asian-American women are subject to a gender stereotype that expects them to be poor at mathematics, and a racial stereotype that expects them to do particularly well. Subjects from this group performed better on a math test when their racial identity was made salient; and worse when their gender identity was made salient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = Stereotype Susceptibility: Identity Salience and Shifts in Quantitative Performance| year = 1999| journal = Psychological Science| pages = 80–83| volume = 10| issue = 1| last1 = Shih | first1 =  Margaret| last2 =  Pittinsky | first2 =  Todd L.| last3 =  Ambady | first3 =  Nalini |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from Osborne (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Osborne|first1=Jason W.|title=Linking Stereotype Threat and Anxiety|journal=Educational Psychology|volume=27|issue=1|year=2007|pages=135–154|issn=0144-3410|doi=10.1080/01443410601069929}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Certain individuals appear to be more likely to experience stereotype threat than others. Individuals who are highly identified with a particular domain appear to be more vulnerable to experiencing stereotype threat. Therefore, students who are highly identified with doing well in school may, ironically, be more likely to underperform when under stereotype threat.&lt;ref name="When White Men Can't Do Math"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aronson|first1=J|title=When White Men Can't Do Math: Necessary and Sufficient Factors in Stereotype Threat|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=35|issue=1|year=1999|pages=29–46|issn=00221031|doi=10.1006/jesp.1998.1371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While research suggests that stereotypes may play a role in test score [[achievement gap]]s, it does not prove that that stereotypes are the primary source of the gaps. According to Paul R. Sackett, Chaitra M. Hardison, and Michael J. Cullen, both the media and scholarly literature have wrongly concluded that eliminating stereotype threat can completely eliminate differences in test performance between [[European-American]] and [[African-American]] individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal ||last1=Sackett|first1=Paul R.|last2=Hardison|first2=Chaitra M.|last3=Cullen|first3=Michael J.|title=On interpreting stereotype threat as accounting for African American-White differences on cognitive tests |journal=American Psychologist |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=7–13 |year=2004 |month=January |pmid=14736315 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.7 |url=http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/igc/studies/ss03/sackitt_hardison_cullen_2004.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1935-990X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Sackett et al. have pointed out that in Steele and Aronson's (1995) experiments where stereotype threat was removed, there was still a remaining achievement gap that closely correlates with the gap between African-American and European-Americans' average scores on large-scale standardized tests such as the SAT. In subsequent correspondence between Sackett et al. and Steele and Aronson, Sackett et al. wrote that "They [Steele and Aronson] agree that it is a misinterpretation of the Steele and Aronson (1995) results to conclude that eliminating stereotype threat eliminates the African American-White test-score gap." Sackett et al. have expressed concern that this misunderstanding of stereotype threat research may shift public policy away from addressing other long-standing causes of achievement gaps such as [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[economic inequality|socioeconomic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sackett|first1=Paul R.|last2=Hardison|first2=Chaitra M.|last3=Cullen|first3=Michael J.|title=On the Value of Correcting Mischaracterizations of Stereotype Threat Research|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|year=2004|pages=48–49|issn=1935-990X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
Although numerous studies demonstrate the effects of stereotype threat on performance, questions remain about the specific mental processes which underlie these effects. Steele and Aronson originally speculated that anxiety and narrowed attention, resulting from attempts to suppress stereotype-related thoughts, contribute to the observed deficits in performance. In 2008, Toni Schmader, Michael Johns, and Chad Forbes published an integrated model of stereotype threat that focused on three interrelated factors: 1) stress arousal, which impairs the processing of information in the [[prefrontal cortex]]; 2) performance monitoring, which narrows attention; and, 3) efforts to suppress negative thoughts and emotions.&lt;ref name="An Integrated Process Model of Stereotype Threat Effects on Performance"/&gt; Schmader et al. suggest that these three factors summarize the pattern of evidence that has been accumulated by past experiments on stereotype threat. For example, stereotype threat has been shown to disrupt [[working memory]],&lt;ref name="Working Memory"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmader|first1=Toni|last2=Johns|first2=Michael|title=Converging Evidence That Stereotype Threat Reduces Working Memory Capacity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=85|issue=3|year=2003|pages=440–452|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.3.440|pmid=14498781}}&lt;/ref&gt; increase self-consciousness about one's performance,&lt;ref name="Causal Mechanisms of Stereotype Threat"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beilock|first1=S.

A number of studies looking at physiological and neurological responses support Schmader, Johns, and Forbes' integrated model of the processes that produce stereotype threat. Supporting an explanation in terms of stress arousal, one study found that African-Americans under stereotype threat exhibit larger increases in arterial [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref name = "blood pressure"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blascovich J, Spencer SJ, Quinn D, Steele C |title=African Americans and high blood pressure: the role of stereotype threat |journal=Psychologial Science |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=225–9 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11437305 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found increased cardiovascular activation amongst women who watched a video in which men outnumbered women at a math and science conference.&lt;ref name="Mary Murphy study"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=M.

S. M.|last2=Major|first2=B.|last3=Gangi|first3=C. E.|last4=Mendes|first4=W. B.|title=From "In the Air" to "Under the Skin": Cortisol Responses to Social Identity Threat|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=37|issue=2|year=2011|pages=151–164|issn=0146-1672|doi=10.1177/0146167210392384|pmid=21239591}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In regards to performance monitoring and vigilance, studies of brain activity have supported the idea that stereotype threat increases both of these processes. Forbes and colleagues evoked electroencephalogram ([[EEG]]) signals which measure electrical activity along the scalp. This allowed the researchers ascertain that individuals experiencing stereotype threat were more vigilant for performance related stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The role of devaluing and discounting in performance monitoring: a neurophysiological study of minorities under threat | year = 2008 | journal = Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience | pages = 253–261 | volume = 3 | last1 = Forbes | first1 =  C. | last2 =  Schmader | first2 =  T.| last3 =  Allen | first3 =  J.J.B.|doi=10.1093/scan/nsn012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another used functional magnetic resonance ([[fMRI]]) to investigate brain activity associated with stereotype threat. The researchers found that women experiencing stereotype threat while taking a math test showed heightened activation in the ventral stream of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC), a neural region thought to be associated with social and emotional processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The negative consequences of threat: A functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying women's underperformance in math | year = 1995 | journal = Psychological Science | pages = 168–175 | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | last1 = Krendle | first1 =  Anne C. | last2 =  Richeson | first2 =  Jennifer A. | last3 =  Kelley | first3 =  William M. | last4 =  Heatherton | first4 =  Todd F. |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02063.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wraga and colleagues found that women under stereotype threat showed increased activation in the ventral ACC and the amount of this activation predicted performance decrements on the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wraga|first1=M.|last2=Helt|first2=M.|last3=Jacobs|first3=E.|last4=Sullivan|first4=K.|title=Neural basis of stereotype-induced shifts in women's mental rotation performance|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=2|issue=1|year=2006|pages=12–19|issn=1749-5016|doi=10.1093/scan/nsl041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term consequences==

Although decreased performance is the most recognized consequence of stereotype threat, studies have shown that it can also lead individuals to blame themselves for perceived failures,&lt;ref name="Women and computers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koch|first1=S|last2=Muller|first2=S|last3=Sieverding|first3=M|title=Women and computers.

Over the long-term, the chronic experience of stereotype threat may lead individuals to disidentify with the domain in which they are experiencing the threat. For example, a woman may stop seeing herself as "a math person" after experiencing a series of situations in which she experienced stereotype threat. This ''disidentification'' is thought to be a psychological coping strategy to maintain self-esteem in the face of failure.&lt;ref name="Learning in a Man's World"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Jennifer|last2=James|first2=Jacquelyn B.|last3=Barnett|first3=Rosalind Chait|title=Learning in a Man's World: Examining the Perceptions of Undergraduate Women in Male-Dominated Academic Areas|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=26|issue=1|year=2002|pages=46–50|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1111/1471-6402.00042}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to long-term psychological outcomes, the physiological consequences of threat may pose health risks to certain groups who frequently experience threat. For example, some researchers have hypothesized that the higher death rates for African-Americans from hypertension-related disorders may stem from the chronic activation of the cardiovascular system in response to stereotype threat.&lt;ref name="blood pressure"/&gt;

== Interventions ==
Additional research seeks ways to boost the test scores and academic achievement of students in negatively-stereotyped groups. In one study, teaching college women about stereotype threat and its effects on performance was sufficient to eliminate the predicted gender gap on a difficult math test.&lt;ref name="pmid15733195"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johns M, Schmader T, Martens A |title=Knowing is half the battle: teaching stereotype threat as a means of improving women's math performance |journal=Psychological Science |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=175–9 |year=2005 |month=March |pmid=15733195 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00799.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach involves persuading participants that intelligence is malleable and can be increased through effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Aronson J, Fried CB, Good C|title=Reducing the Effects of Stereotype Threat on African American College Students by Shaping Theories of Intelligence|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=38|issue=2|year=2002|pages=113–125|issn=00221031|doi=10.1006/jesp.2001.1491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third type of intervention involves having participants write about a value that is important to them, a process referred to in the research literature as [[self-affirmation]]. In 2006, researchers Geoffrey L. Cohen, Julio Garcia, Nancy Apfel, and Allison Master found that a self-affirmation exercise, in the form of a brief in-class writing assignment, significantly improved the grades of [[African-American]] middle-school students and reduced the racial achievement gap by 40%. Cohen et al. have suggested that the racial achievement gap could be at least partially ameliorated by brief and targeted social-psychological interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cohen GL, Garcia J, Apfel N, Master A |title=Reducing the racial achievement gap: a social-psychological intervention |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5791 |pages=1307–10 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16946074 |doi=10.1126/science.1128317}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such intervention was attempted with UK medical students, who were given a written assignment and a clinical assessment. For the written assignment, the gap closed not by an improvement in the performance of ethnic minority students, but by a worsening of white students' performance. For the clinical assessment, both groups improved performance, maintaining the racial difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woolf K, McManus IC, Gill D, Dace J |title=The effect of a brief social intervention on the examination results of UK medical students: a cluster randomised controlled trial |journal=BMC Medical Education |volume=9|pages=35 |year=2009 |month=June |pmid= 19552810|doi=10.1186/1472-6920-9-35 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6920/9/35/ |pmc=2717066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth type of intervention for stereotype threat involves increasing participants' feelings of social belonging within the academic environment.
