'''Stereotype threat''' is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of conforming to [[stereotype]]s about their social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apa.org/research/action/stereotype|title=Stereotype threat widens achievement gap|last=|first=|date=July 15, 2006|work=American Psychological Association|access-date=2019-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steele CM, Aronson J | title = Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 69 | issue = 5 | pages = 797–811 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 7473032 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797 | author-link1 = Claude Steele }} [http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Good-rec2-Steele_&amp;_Aronson_95.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotype threat is purportedly a contributing factor to long-standing [[Race and intelligence|racial]] and [[Gender gaps in mathematics and reading|gender gaps]] in academic performance. It may occur whenever an individual's performance might confirm a negative stereotype because stereotype threat is thought to arise from a particular situation, rather than from an individual's [[personality trait]]s or characteristics. Since most people have at least one [[social identity]] which is negatively stereotyped, most people are vulnerable to stereotype threat if they encounter a situation in which the stereotype is relevant. Situational factors that increase stereotype threat can include the difficulty of the task, the belief that the task measures their abilities, and the relevance of the stereotype to the task. Individuals show higher degrees of stereotype threat on tasks they wish to perform well on and when they identify strongly with the stereotyped group. These effects are also increased when they expect [[discrimination]] due to their identification with a negatively stereotyped group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Steele | first1 = Claude M. | last2 = Spencer | first2 = Steven J. | last3 = Aronson | first3 = Joshua | name-list-format = vanc | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2601(02)80009-0 | title = Contending with group image: the psychology of stereotype and social identity threat | series = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 34 | pages = 379–440 | date = 2002 | isbn = 9780120152346 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated experiences of stereotype threat can lead to a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] of diminished confidence, poor performance, and loss of interest in the relevant area of achievement.&lt;ref name="GilovichKeltner2006"&gt;{{citation|author-last1=Gilovich|author-first1=Thomas|author-last2=Keltner|author-first2=Dacher|author-last3=Nisbett|author-first3=Richard E. | name-list-format = vanc |contribution=Being a member of a stigmatized group: stereotype threat|editor-last1=Gilovich|editor-first1=Thomas|editor-last2=Keltner|editor-first2=Dacher|editor-last3=Nisbett|editor-first3=Richard E. |title=Social psychology |pages=467–468 |publisher=W.W.

Since its introduction into the academic literature, stereotype threat has become one of the most widely studied topics in the field of [[social psychology]].&lt;ref name="Schmader2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmader T, Johns M, Forbes C | title = An integrated process model of stereotype threat effects on performance | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 115 | issue = 2 | pages = 336–56 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18426293 | pmc = 2570773 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.115.2.336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stereotype threat has been argued to show a reduction in the performance of individuals who belong to negatively stereotyped groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Steele|first1=Claude M|title=Advances in experimental social psychology, volume 34|pages=379–440|postscript=.|editor-last=Zanna|editor-first=Mark P. | name-list-format = vanc |contribution=Contending with group image: the psychology of stereotype and social identity threat|location=Amsterdam|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780120152346|ref=harv|last2=Spencer|first2=Steven J.|last3=Aronson|first3=Joshua|author-link1=Claude Steele|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steele CM | title = A threat in the air.

According to the theory, if negative stereotypes are present regarding a specific group, group members are likely to become [[Anxiety|anxious]] about their performance, which may hinder their ability to perform to their full potential. Importantly, the individual does not need to subscribe to the stereotype for it to be activated. It is hypothesized that the mechanism through which anxiety (induced by the activation of the stereotype) decreases performance is by depleting [[working memory]] (especially the phonological aspects of the working memory system).&lt;ref name="BeilockEtAl2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beilock SL, Rydell RJ, McConnell AR | title = Stereotype threat and working memory: mechanisms, alleviation, and spillover | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology.

Some researchers have suggested that stereotype threat should not be interpreted as a factor in real-life performance gaps, and have raised the possibility of [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name="Ganley2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoet2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flore2014" /&gt; Other critics have focused on correcting what they claim are misconceptions of early studies showing a large effect.&lt;ref name="Sackett2004a" /&gt; However, meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown significant evidence for the effects of stereotype threat, though the phenomenon defies over-simplistic characterization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen HH, Ryan AM | title = Does stereotype threat affect test performance of minorities and women?

The opposite of stereotype threat is '''stereotype boost''', which is when people perform better than they otherwise would have, because of exposure to [[positive stereotype]]s about their social group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation|last1=Shih|first1=Margaret J.|title=Stereotype threat: theory, process, and application|pages=5–6, 141–143|year=2011|editor-last1=Inzlicht|editor-first1=Michael|contribution=Stereotype boost: positive outcomes from the activation of positive stereotypes|location=New York, New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199732449|ref=harv|last2=Pittinsky|first2=Todd L.|last3=Ho|first3=Geoffrey C.|name-list-format=vanc|editor-last2=Schmader|editor-first2=Toni}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=G_EIrkhfQLsC&amp;pg=5 Preview 1.] [https://books.google.com/books?id=G_EIrkhfQLsC&amp;pg=141 Preview 2.]&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of stereotype boost is '''stereotype lift''', which is people achieving better performance because of exposure to negative stereotypes about other social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Empirical studies==
As of 2011, more than 300 published papers show the effects of stereotype threat on performance in a variety of domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diversity.arizona.edu/sites/diversity/files/stereotype_threat_overview.pdf|title=Stereotype Threat: An Overview|last1=Stroessner|first1=Steve|last2=Good|first2=Catherine| name-list-format = vanc |website=diversity.arizona.edu|publisher=Reducing Stereotype Threat.org|access-date=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the stereotype threat that occurs depends on how the task is framed. If a task is framed to be neutral, stereotype threat is not likely to occur; however, if tasks are framed in terms of active stereotypes, participants are likely to perform worse on the task. For example, a study on chess players revealed that female players performed more poorly than expected when they were told they would be playing against a male opponent. In contrast, women who were told that their opponent was female performed as would be predicted by past ratings of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maass|first1=Anne|last2=D'Ettole|first2=Claudio|last3=Cadinu|first3=Mara| name-list-format = vanc |year=2008|title=Checkmate?

Researchers Vishal Gupta, Daniel Turban, and Nachiket Bhawe extended stereotype threat research to [[entrepreneurship]], a traditionally male-stereotyped profession. Their study revealed that stereotype threat can depress women's entrepreneurial intentions while boosting men's intentions. However, when entrepreneurship is presented as a gender-neutral profession, men and women express a similar level of interest in becoming entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="Stereotype Threat and Entrepreneurial Intentions"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Gupta VK, Bhawe NM |year=2007|title=The Influence of Proactive Personality and Stereotype Threat on Women's Entrepreneurial Intentions|journal=[[Journal of Leadership &amp; Organizational Studies]]|volume=13|issue=4|pages=73–85|doi=10.1177/10717919070130040901|issn=1071-7919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another experiment involved a golf game which was described as a test of "natural athletic ability" or of "sports intelligence". When it was described as a test of athletic ability, European-American students performed worse, but when the description mentioned intelligence, African-American students performed worse.&lt;ref name="StoneLynch1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Jeff|last2=Lynch|first2=Christian I.|last3=Sjomeling|first3=Mike|last4=Darley|first4=John M. | name-list-format = vanc |year=1999|title=Stereotype threat effects on Black and White athletic performance|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|volume=77|issue=6|pages=1213–1227|citeseerx=10.1.1.687.5039|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1213|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have demonstrated how stereotype threat can negatively affect the performance of European Americans in athletic situations&lt;ref name="White Men Can't Jump"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Jeff|last2=Perry|first2=W.|last3=Darley|first3=John | name-list-format = vanc |year=1997|title="White Men Can't Jump": Evidence for the Perceptual Confirmation of Racial Stereotypes Following a Basketball Game|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|volume=19|issue=3|pages=291–306|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1903_2|issn=0197-3533}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the performance of men who are being tested on their social sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Stereotype Threat in Men"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Anne M.|last2=Eagly|first2=Alice H.| name-list-format = vanc |year=2005|title=Stereotype Threat in Men on a Test of Social Sensitivity|journal=Sex Roles|volume=52|issue=7–8|pages=489–496|doi=10.1007/s11199-005-3714-x|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the framing of a task can produce stereotype threat in most individuals, certain individuals appear to be more likely to experience stereotype threat than others. Individuals who highly identify with a particular group appear to be more vulnerable to experiencing stereotype threat than individuals who do not identify strongly with the stereotyped group.

The mere presence of other people can evoke stereotype threat. In one experiment, women who took a mathematics exam along with two other women got 70% of the answers right, whereas women who took the same exam in the presence of two men got an average score of 55%.&lt;ref name="InzlichtBen-Zeev2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Inzlicht M, Ben-Zeev T | title = A threatening intellectual environment: why females are susceptible to experiencing problem-solving deficits in the presence of males | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 365–71 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11228906 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00272 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.24.1847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a study conducted by Desert, Preaux, and Jund in 2009 was to see if children from lower [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic groups]] are affected by stereotype threat. The study compared children that were 6–7 years old with children that were 8–9 years old from multiple elementary schools. These children were presented with the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's Matrices]] test, which is an intellectual ability test. Separate groups of children were given directions in an evaluative way and other groups were given directions in a non-evaluative way. The "evaluative" group received instructions that are usually given with the Raven Matrices test, while the "non-evaluative" group was given directions which made it seem as if the children were simply playing a game. The results showed that third graders performed better on the test than the first graders did, which was expected. However, the lower socioeconomic status children did worse on the test when they received directions in an evaluative way than the higher socioeconomic status children did when they received directions in an evaluative way. These results suggested that the framing of the directions given to the children may have a greater effect on performance than socioeconomic status. This was shown by the differences in performance based on which type of instructions they received. This information can be useful in classroom settings to help improve the performance of students of lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desert|first=Michael| first2 = Marie | last2 = Preaux | first3 = Robin | last3 = Jund | name-list-format = vanc |year=2009|title=So young and already victims of stereotype threat: Socio-economic status and performance of 6 to 9 years old children on Raven's progressive matrices|journal=European Journal of Psychology of Education|volume=24|issue=2|pages=207–218|doi=10.1007/BF03173012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been studies on the effects of stereotype threat based on age. A study was done on 99 senior citizens ranging in age from 60–75 years. These seniors were given multiple tests on certain factors and categories such as memory and physical abilities, and were also asked to evaluate how physically fit they believe themselves to be. Additionally, they were asked to read articles that contained both positive and negative outlooks about seniors, and they watched someone reading the same articles. The goal of this study was to see if priming the participants before the tests would affect performance. The results showed that the control group performed better than those that were primed with either negative or positive words prior to the tests. The control group seemed to feel more confident in their abilities than the other two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Horton | first1 = Sean | first2 = Joseph | last2 = Baker | first3 = William | last3 = Pearce | first4 = Janice | last4 = Deakin | name-list-format = vanc |year=2010|title=Immunity to Popular Stereotypes of Aging?

Many psychological experiments carried out on Stereotype Threat focus on the physiological effects of negative stereotype threat on performance, looking at both high and low status groups. Scheepers and Ellemers tested the following hypothesis: when assessing a performance situation on the basis of current beliefs the low status group members would show a physiological threat response, and high-status members would also show a physiological threat response when examining a possible alteration of the status quo(Scheepers &amp; Ellemers, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Daan|last2=Ellemers|first2=Naomi| name-list-format = vanc | date=March 2005|title=When the pressure is up: The assessment of social identity threat in low and high status groups|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=41|issue=2|pages=192–200|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2004.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this experiment were in line with expectations. As predicted, participants in the low status condition showed higher blood pressure immediately after the status feedback, while participants in the high-status condition showed a spike in blood pressure while anticipating the second round of the task.

In 2012, Scheepers et al. hypothesized that when high social power is stimulated 'an efficient cardiovascular pattern (challenge)' is produced, whereas, 'an inefficient cardiovascular pattern' or threat is caused by the activation of low social power (Scheepers, de Wit, Ellemers &amp; Sassenberg, 2012). Two experiments were carried out in order to test this hypothesis. The first experiment looked at power priming and the second experiment related to role play. Both results from these two experiments provided evidence in support for the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Daan|last2=de Wit|first2=Frank|last3=Ellemers|first3=Naomi|last4=Sassenberg|first4=Kai | name-list-format = vanc |date=January 2012|title=Social power makes the heart work more efficiently: Evidence from cardiovascular markers of challenge and threat|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=48|issue=1|pages=371–374|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cleopatra Abdou]] and Adam Fingerhut were the first to develop experimental methods to study stereotype threat in a health care context,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abdou CM, Fingerhut AW | title = Stereotype threat among black and white women in health care settings | journal = Cultural Diversity &amp; Ethnic Minority Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–23 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25045944 | pmc = 5449200 | doi = 10.1037/a0036946 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the first study indicating that health care stereotype threat is linked with adverse health outcomes and disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abdou CM, Fingerhut AW, Jackson JS, Wheaton F | title = Healthcare Stereotype Threat in Older Adults in the Health and Retirement Study | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–8 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26497263 | pmc = 4755717 | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2015.07.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2015/10/20/stereotypes-can-hurt-a-patients-care|title=Stereotypes Can Hurt a Patient's Care|last=Preidt|first=Robert | name-list-format = vanc |work=U.S. News and World Report|access-date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews have shown significant evidence for the effects of stereotype threat.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pennington CR, Heim D, Levy AR, Larkin DT|date=2016-01-11|title=Twenty Years of Stereotype Threat Research: A Review of Psychological Mediators|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|issue=1|pages=e0146487|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1146487P|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0146487|pmc=4713435|pmid=26752551}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However they also point to ways in which the phenomenon defies over-simplistic characterization. For instance, one meta-analysis found that with female subjects "subtle threat-activating cues produced the largest effect, followed by blatant and moderately explicit cues" while with minorities "moderately explicit stereotype threat-activating cues produced the largest effect, followed by blatant and subtle cues".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Mechanisms==
Although numerous studies demonstrate the effects of stereotype threat on performance, questions remain as to the specific cognitive factors that underlie these effects. Steele and Aronson originally speculated that attempts to suppress stereotype-related thoughts lead to anxiety and the narrowing of [[attention]]. This could contribute to the observed deficits in performance. In 2008, [[Toni Schmader]], Michael Johns, and Chad Forbes published an integrated model of stereotype threat that focused on three interrelated factors:

#[[Stress (psychological)|stress]] arousal;
# performance monitoring, which narrows attention; and,
# efforts to suppress negative thoughts and emotions.&lt;ref name="Schmader2008" /&gt;

When a large portion of these resources are spent focusing on anxiety and performance pressure, the individual is likely to perform worse on the task at hand.

A number of studies looking at physiological and neurological responses support Schmader and colleagues' integrated model of the processes that produce stereotype threat. Supporting an explanation in terms of stress arousal, one study found that African Americans under stereotype threat exhibit larger increases in arterial [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="blood pressure"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blascovich J, Spencer SJ, Quinn D, Steele C | title = African Americans and high blood pressure: the role of stereotype threat | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 225–9 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11437305 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found increased cardiovascular activation amongst women who watched a video in which men outnumbered women at a math and science conference.&lt;ref name="Mary Murphy study"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murphy MC, Steele CM, Gross JJ | title = Signaling threat: how situational cues affect women in math, science, and engineering settings | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 10 | pages = 879–85 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17894605 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01995.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have similarly found that individuals under stereotype threat display increased heart rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Croizet JC, Després G, Gauzins ME, Huguet P, Leyens JP, Méot A | title = Stereotype threat undermines intellectual performance by triggering a disruptive mental load | journal = Personality &amp; Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 30 | issue = 6 | pages = 721–31 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15155036 | doi = 10.1177/0146167204263961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotype threat may also activate a [[Neuroendocrine system|neuroendocrine stress response]], as measured by increased levels of [[cortisol]] while under threat.&lt;ref name="Cortisol"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Townsend SS, Major B, Gangi CE, Mendes WB | title = From "in the air" to "under the skin": cortisol responses to social identity threat | journal = Personality &amp; Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–64 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21239591 | pmc = 3538844 | doi = 10.1177/0146167210392384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological reactions that are induced by stereotype threat can often be subconscious, and can distract and interrupt cognitive focus from the task.

With regard to performance monitoring and vigilance, studies of brain activity have supported the idea that stereotype threat increases both of these processes. Forbes and colleagues recorded [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) signals that measure electrical activity along the scalp, and found that individuals experiencing stereotype threat were more vigilant for performance-related stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forbes CE, Schmader T, Allen JJ | title = The role of devaluing and discounting in performance monitoring: a neurophysiological study of minorities under threat | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–61 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 19015117 | pmc = 2566773 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsn012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gray727 anterior cingulate cortex.png|thumb|right|300px|Researchers found that women experiencing stereotype threat while taking a math test showed heightened activation in the ventral stream of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC).]]

Another study used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to investigate brain activity associated with stereotype threat. The researchers found that women experiencing stereotype threat while taking a math test showed heightened activation in the ventral stream of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC), a neural region thought to be associated with social and emotional processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krendl AC, Richeson JA, Kelley WM, Heatherton TF | title = The negative consequences of threat: a functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying women's underperformance in math | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 168–75 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18271865 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02063.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wraga and colleagues found that women under stereotype threat showed increased activation in the ventral ACC and that the amount of this activation predicted performance decrements on the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wraga M, Helt M, Jacobs E, Sullivan K | title = Neural basis of stereotype-induced shifts in women's mental rotation performance | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–9 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 18985116 | pmc = 2555429 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsl041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals were made aware of performance-related stimuli, they were more likely to experience stereotype threat.

A study conducted by Boucher, Rydell, Loo, and Rydell has shown that stereotype threat not only affects performance, but can also affect the ability to learn new information. In the study, undergraduate men and women had a session of learning followed by an assessment of what they learned. Some participants were given information intended to induce stereotype threat, and some of these participants were later given "gender fair" information, which it was predicted would reduce or remove stereotype threat. As a result, participants were split into four separate conditions: control group, stereotype threat only, stereotype threat removed before learning, and stereotype threat removed after learning. The results of the study showed that the women who were presented with the "gender fair" information performed better on the math related test than the women who were not presented with this information. This study also showed that it was more beneficial to women for the "gender fair" information to be presented prior to learning rather than after learning. These results suggest that eliminating stereotype threat prior to taking mathematical tests can help women perform better, and that eliminating stereotype threat prior to mathematical learning can help women learn better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boucher |first1 = Kathryn L.| first2 = Robert | last2 = Rydell | first3 = Katie | last3 = Van Loo| first4 = Michael | last4 = Rydell | name-list-format = vanc |year=2012|title=Reducing Stereotype threat in order to facilitate learning|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=42|issue=2|pages=174–179|doi=10.1002/ejsp.871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original study==

Aronson, C.M. Steele, M.F. Salinas, M.J. Lustina, ''Readings About the Social Animal'', 8th edition, ed. E. Aronson]]
In 1995, [[Claude Steele]] and [[Joshua Aronson]] performed the first experiments demonstrating that stereotype threat can undermine intellectual performance.&lt;ref name=SteeleAronson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/intelligence-and-the-stereotype-threat.html|title=Intelligence and the Stereotype Threat|last=Paul|first=Annie Murphy|date=2012-10-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-13|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steele and Aronson measured this through a word completion task.&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson" /&gt;

They had African-American and [[European American|European-American]] college students take a difficult verbal portion of the [[Graduate Record Examination]] test. As would be expected based on national averages, the African-American students did not perform as well on the test. Steele and Aronson split students into three groups: stereotype-threat (in which the test was described as being "diagnostic of intellectual ability"), non-stereotype threat (in which the test was described as "a laboratory problem-solving task that was nondiagnostic of ability"), and a third condition (in which the test was again described as nondiagnostic of ability, but participants were asked to view the difficult test as a challenge). All three groups received the same test.

Steele and Aronson concluded that changing the instructions on the test could reduce African-American students' concern about confirming a negative stereotype about their group. Supporting this conclusion, they found that African-American students who regarded the test as a measure of intelligence had more thoughts related to negative stereotypes of their group. Additionally, they found that African Americans who thought the test measured intelligence were more likely to complete word fragments using words associated with relevant negative stereotypes (e.g., completing "__mb" as "dumb" rather than as "numb").

Adjusted for previous SAT scores, subjects in the non-diagnostic-challenge condition performed significantly better than those in the non-diagnostic-only condition and those in the diagnostic condition. In the first experiment, the race-by-condition interaction was marginally significant. However, the second study reported in the same paper found a significant interaction effect of race and condition. This suggested that placement in the diagnostic condition significantly impacted African Americans compared with European Americans.&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson" /&gt;

==Stereotype lift and stereotype boost==
Stereotype threat concerns how stereotype cues can harm performance. However, in certain situations, stereotype activation can also lead to performance enhancement through stereotype lift or stereotype boost. Stereotype lift increases performance when people are exposed to negative stereotypes about another group.&lt;ref name="Walton 2003 456–467"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Walton GM, Cohen GL |title=Stereotype lift|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=39|issue=5|pages=456–467|doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(03)00019-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enhanced performance has been attributed to increases in [[self-efficacy]] and decreases in self-doubt as a result of negative [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Walton 2003 456–467"/&gt; Stereotype boost suggests that positive stereotypes may enhance performance.&lt;ref name="Shih, M.

Although stereotype boost is similar to stereotype lift in enhancing performance, stereotype lift is the result of a negative outgroup stereotype, whereas stereotype boost occurs due to activation of a positive [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] stereotype.&lt;ref name="Shih, M. J. 2012 141–156"/&gt;

Consistent with the positive racial stereotype concerning their superior quantitative skills, [[Asian American]] women performed better on a math test when their Asian identity was [[Priming (psychology)|primed]] compared to a [[Treatment and control groups|control condition]] where no social identity was primed. Conversely, these participants did worse on the math test when instead their gender identity—which is associated with stereotypes of inferior quantitative skills—was made salient, which is consistent with stereotype threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Shih M, Pittinsky TL, Trahan A |title=Domain-specific effects of stereotypes on performance|journal=Self and Identity|year=2006|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1080/15298860500338534|url=https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/getFile.aspx?Id=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steen LA | title = Mathematics education: a predictor of scientific competitiveness | journal = Science | volume = 237 | issue = 4812 | pages = 251–302 | date = July 1987 | pmid = 17772052 | doi = 10.1126/science.237.4812.251 | url = http://www.stolaf.edu/people/steen/Papers/87predict.pdf | citeseerx = 10.1.1.367.4122 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203040055/http://www.stolaf.edu/people/steen/Papers/87predict.pdf | archive-date = 3 December 2013 | bibcode = 1987Sci...237..251S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Reproducibility|replications]] of this result have been attempted.

Studies examining stereotype threat in Black Americans have found that when subjects are aware of the stereotype of [[Criminal stereotype of African Americans|Black criminality]], anxiety about encountering police increases. This, in turn, can lead to self-regulatory efforts, more anxiety, and other behaviors that are commonly perceived as suspicious to police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Najdowski CJ, Bottoms BL, Goff PA | title = Stereotype threat and racial differences in citizens' experiences of police encounters | journal = Law and Human Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 463–77 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26030449 | doi = 10.1037/lhb0000140 | url = https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/lhb-lhb0000140.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because police officers tend to perceive Black people as threatening, their reactions to these anxiety-induced behaviors are commonly more harsh than reactions to White people with the same behavior, and influences whether or not they decide to [[Police brutality in the United States|shoot the person]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eberhardt JL, Goff PA, Purdie VJ, Davies PG | title = Seeing black: race, crime, and visual processing | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 87 | issue = 6 | pages = 876–93 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15598112 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.87.6.876 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.486.8434 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graham S, Lowery BS | title = Priming unconscious racial stereotypes about adolescent offenders | journal = Law and Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 483–504 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15638206 | doi = 10.1023/B:LAHU.0000046430.65485.1f | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-20470-001 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.595.3436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Correll J, Park B, Judd CM, Wittenbrink B | title = The police officer's dilemma: using ethnicity to disambiguate potentially threatening individuals | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 1314–29 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12500813 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-08203-006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Correll J, Park B, Judd CM, Wittenbrink B |date=3 July 2007|title=The influence of stereotypes on decisions to shoot |url=https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/bernd.wittenbrink/research/pdf/cpjw07.pdf|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1102–1117 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.450}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Correll J, Park B, Judd CM, Wittenbrink B, Sadler MS, Keesee T | title = Across the thin blue line: police officers and racial bias in the decision to shoot | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 6 | pages = 1006–23 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17547485 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1006 | url = http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/bernd.wittenbrink/research/pdf/cpjwsk07.pdf | biorxiv =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long run, the chronic experience of stereotype threat may lead individuals to disidentify with the stereotyped group. For example, a woman may stop seeing herself as "a math person" after experiencing a series of situations in which she experienced stereotype threat. This disidentification is thought to be a psychological coping strategy to maintain [[self-esteem]] in the face of failure.&lt;ref name="Learning in a Man's World"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Jennifer|last2=James|first2=Jacquelyn B.|last3=Barnett|first3=Rosalind Chait| name-list-format = vanc |title=Learning in a Man's World: Examining the Perceptions of Undergraduate Women in Male-Dominated Academic Areas|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=26|issue=1|year=2002|pages=46–50|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1111/1471-6402.00042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated exposure to anxiety and nervousness can lead individuals to choose to distance themselves from the stereotyped group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/thread/arts-culture-society/article9022211.ece|title=Math is awesome, math culture is terrible|last=Desikan|first=Shubashree|date=2016-08-23|work=The Hindu|access-date=2019-10-13|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much of the research on stereotype threat has examined the effects of coping with negative stereotype on academic performance, recently there has been an emphasis on how coping with stereotype threat could "spillover" to dampen self-control and thereby affect a much broader category of behaviors, even in non-stereotyped domains.&lt;ref name="stereotype threat spillover"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Inzlicht M, Kang SK | title = Stereotype threat spillover: how coping with threats to social identity affects aggression, eating, decision making, and attention | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = 3 | pages = 467–81 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20649368 | doi = 10.1037/a0018951 | url = http://michaelinzlicht.com/research/publications/Inzlicht%20&amp;%20Kang,%202010.pdf | citeseerx = 10.1.1.600.1063 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003450/http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/research/publications/Inzlicht%20%26%20Kang%2C%202010.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by [[Michael Inzlicht]] and colleagues suggest that, when women cope with negative stereotypes about their math ability, they perform worse on math tests, and that, well after completing the math test, women may continue to show deficits even in unrelated domains.

==Mitigation==
{{Prose|section|date=April 2019}}
Additional research seeks ways to boost the test scores and academic achievement of students in negatively stereotyped groups. There are many ways to combat the effects of stereotype threat.

# In one study, teaching college women about stereotype threat and its effects on performance was sufficient to eliminate the predicted gender gap on a difficult math test.&lt;ref name="pmid15733195"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johns M, Schmader T, Martens A | title = Knowing is half the battle: teaching stereotype threat as a means of improving women's math performance | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–9 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15733195 | doi = 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00799.x | url = https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01584247/file/geriatrics-01-00020%20%281%29.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Making people aware of the fact that they will not necessarily perform worse despite the existence of a stereotype can boost their performance. However, other research has found the opposite effect. In one study, women were given a text "summarizing an experiment in which stereotypes, and not biological differences, were shown to be the cause of women's underperformance in math", and then they performed a math exercise. It was found that "women who properly understood the meaning of the information provided, and thus became knowledgeable about stereotype threat, performed significantly worse at a calculus task".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomasetto C, Appoloni A |title=A lesson not to be learned?

# Have participants engage in [[self-affirmation]], which is a process in which participants write about a value that is important to them. In 2006, researchers Geoffrey L. Cohen, Julio Garcia, Nancy Apfel, and Allison Master found that a self-affirmation exercise (in the form of a brief in-class writing assignment) significantly improved the grades of African-American middle-school students, and reduced the racial achievement gap by 40%. Cohen et al. have suggested that the racial achievement gap could be at least partially ameliorated by brief and targeted social-psychological interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen GL, Garcia J, Apfel N, Master A | title = Reducing the racial achievement gap: a social-psychological intervention | journal = Science | volume = 313 | issue = 5791 | pages = 1307–10 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16946074 | doi = 10.1126/science.1128317 | bibcode = 2006Sci...313.1307C }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such intervention was attempted with UK medical students, who were given a written assignment and a clinical assessment.

For the clinical assessment, both groups improved their performance maintaining the racial difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woolf K, McManus IC, Gill D, Dacre J | title = The effect of a brief social intervention on the examination results of UK medical students: a cluster randomised controlled trial | journal = BMC Medical Education | volume = 9 | pages = 35 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19552810 | pmc = 2717066 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6920-9-35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing participants to think about a positive value or attribute about themselves prior to completing the task seemed to make them less susceptible to stereotype threat.
# Increase participants' feelings of social belonging within the academic world. Greg Walton and Geoffrey Cohen were able to boost the grades of African-American college students, as well as eliminate the racial achievement gap over the first year of college, by telling participants that concerns about social belonging tend to lessen over time.&lt;ref name="Social belonging"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walton GM, Cohen GL | title = A question of belonging: race, social fit, and achievement | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 1 | pages = 82–96 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17201544 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.92.1.82 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.320.7960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing individuals to feel as though they are welcomed into a desirable group makes them more likely to ignore stereotypes. If minority college students are welcomed into the world of academia, they are less likely to be influenced by the negative stereotypes of poor minority performance on academic tasks.
# Construct environments and have the physical objects in the environment not reflect one majority group. Researchers argued that individuals make decisions about group membership based on the group's environment and proved that altering the physical objects in a room boosted minority participation.

==Criticism==
The stereotype threat explanation of [[achievement gap]]s has attracted criticism. Some studies have cautioned that stereotype threat should not be interpreted as a factor in real-world performance gaps.&lt;ref name="Sackett2004a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoet2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ganley2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L.

According to Paul R. Sackett, Chaitra M. Hardison, and Michael J. Cullen, both the media and scholarly literature have wrongly concluded that eliminating stereotype threat could completely eliminate differences in test performance between European Americans and African Americans.&lt;ref name="Sackett2004a"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sackett PR, Hardison CM, Cullen MJ | title = On interpreting stereotype threat as accounting for African American-White differences on cognitive tests | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–13 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14736315 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.7 | url = http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/igc/studies/ss03/sackitt_hardison_cullen_2004.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130404150510/http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/igc/studies/ss03/sackitt_hardison_cullen_2004.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2013-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sackett et al. have pointed out that, in Steele and Aronson's (1995) experiments where stereotype threat was removed, an achievement gap of approximately one [[standard deviation]] remained between the groups, which is very close in size to that routinely reported between African American and European Americans' average scores on large-scale standardized tests such as the SAT. In subsequent correspondence between Sackett et al. and Steele and Aronson, Sackett et al. wrote that "They [Steele and Aronson] agree that it is a misinterpretation of the Steele and Aronson (1995) results to conclude that eliminating stereotype threat eliminates the African American-White test-score gap."&lt;ref name="Sackett2004b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sackett|first1=Paul R.|last2=Hardison|first2=Chaitra M.|last3=Cullen|first3=Michael J. | name-list-format = vanc |title=On the Value of Correcting Mischaracterizations of Stereotype Threat Research|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|year=2004|pages=48–49|issn=1935-990X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.48|url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2004-sackett.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050208/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2004-sackett.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in that same correspondence, Steele and Aronson point out that "it is the stereotype threat conditions, and not the no-threat conditions, that produce group differences most like those of real-life testing."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steele|first=Claude M.|last2=Aronson|first2=Joshua A.|date=January 2004|title=Stereotype threat does not live by Steele and Aronson (1995) alone|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14736323|journal=The American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|pages=47–48; discussion 48–49|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.47|issn=0003-066X|pmid=14736323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur R. Jensen]] criticised stereotype threat theory on the basis that it invokes an additional mechanism to explain effects which could be, according to him, explained by other, well-known, and well-established theories, such as test anxiety and especially the [[Yerkes–Dodson law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yerkes | first1 = Robert M. | author-link1 = Robert M.

Test anxiety tends to lower performance levels on tests in proportion to the degree of complexity and the amount of mental effort they require of the subject. The relatively greater effect of test anxiety in the black samples, who had somewhat lower SAT scores, than the white subjects in the Stanford experiments constitutes an example of the Yerkes-Dodson law ... by conducting the same type of experiment using exclusively white (or black) subjects, divided into lower- and higher-ability groups, it might be shown that the phenomenon attributed to stereotype threat has nothing to do with race as such, but results from the interaction of ability level with test anxiety as a function of test complexity. | ref = harv | postscript = . | url = https://archive.org/details/gfactorscienc00jens }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Diamond ''et al'' state "that one problem with the Yerkes-Dodson law is that it invokes an ill-defined distinction between 'simple' versus 'complex' tasks." They further articulate that, "Yerkes and Dodson may have the dubious distinction to be the most highly cited, but largely unread, paper in the history of science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diamond DM, Campbell AM, Park CR, Halonen J, Zoladz PR | title = The temporal dynamics model of emotional memory processing: a synthesis on the neurobiological basis of stress-induced amnesia, flashbulb and traumatic memories, and the Yerkes-Dodson law | journal = Neural Plasticity | volume = 2007 | pages = 60803 | date = 2007 | pmid = 17641736 | pmc = 1906714 | doi = 10.1155/2007/60803 | ref = harv | id = 60803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gijsbert Stoet and [[David C. Geary]] reviewed the evidence for the stereotype threat explanation of the achievement gap in mathematics between men and women. They concluded that the relevant stereotype threat research has many methodological problems, such as not having a control group, and that some literature on this topic misrepresents stereotype threat as more well established than it is. Still, they did find evidence for a marginally significant (d=0.17) effect of stereotype-threat.&lt;ref name="Stoet2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Stoet G, Geary DC | doi = 10.1037/a0026617 | title = Can stereotype threat explain the gender gap in mathematics performance and achievement? | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 16 | pages = 93–102 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc =  }} [http://volition.gla.ac.uk/~stoet/pdf/Stoet-Geary-RGP2012.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112130459/http://volition.gla.ac.uk/~stoet/pdf/Stoet-Geary-RGP2012.pdf |date=2016-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Steven J.|last2=Logel|first2=Christine|last3=Davies|first3=Paul G.|date=2016|title=Stereotype Threat|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26361054|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=67|pages=415–437|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-073115-103235|issn=1545-2085|pmid=26361054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published on ''[[Psychology Today]]'' in 2015, psychologist [[Lee Jussim]] pointed out that, in their study, Steele and Aronson controlled for prior [[SAT]] scores using [[analysis of covariance]], which caused the difference between black and white students' test scores in the "non-diagnostic" test group to nearly disappear. Jussim demonstrated that, using the same technique to control for prior temperatures, he could cause [[Nome, Alaska]] and [[Tampa, Florida]] to appear to have nearly the same average temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rabble-rouser/201512/is-stereotype-threat-overcooked-overstated-and-oversold|title=Is Stereotype Threat Overcooked, Overstated, and Oversold?|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2019-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Steele and Aronson point out, the larger literature beyond their 1995 paper "shows the effect of stereotype  threat  on  an  array  of  tests—SATs, IQ tests, and French language tests to list  only  a  few—sometimes with a co-variance adjustment, but many times without."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Publication bias ===

The strength and type of the effect has also been questioned. Flore and Wicherts concluded the reported effect is small, but also that the field is inflated by [[publication bias]]. They argue that, correcting for this, the most likely true effect size is near zero (see meta-analytic plot, highlighting both the restriction of large effect to [[Statistical power|low-powered]] studies, and the plot asymmetry which occurs when publication bias is active).&lt;ref name="Flore2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flore PC, Wicherts JM | title = Does stereotype threat influence performance of girls in stereotyped domains?

Earlier meta-analyses reached similar conclusions. For instance, Ganley et al. (2013)&lt;ref name="Ganley2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ganley CM, Mingle LA, Ryan AM, Ryan K, Vasilyeva M, Perry M | title = An examination of stereotype threat effects on girls' mathematics performance | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 10 | pages = 1886–97 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23356523 | doi = 10.1037/a0031412 | url = https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2013-ganley.pdf | citeseerx = 10.1.1.353.4436 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140719005546/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2013-ganley.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 19 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; examined math stereotype threat in a well-powered (total N ~ 1000) multi-experiment study. This allowed examination of potential moderators such as age and implicit vs explicit methods. Significant gender differences in math were found, but "no evidence that the mathematics performance of school-age girls was impacted by stereotype threat" was found. Further, they found that evidence for stereotype threat in children reflects [[publication bias]]: large, well-controlled studies find smaller or non-significant effects, while among the many [[Statistical power|underpowered]] studies run, researchers selectively published those in which [[false-positive]] effects reached significance:&lt;ref name=Ganley2013/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;nonsignificant findings were almost always reported in an article along with some significant stereotype threat effects found either at another age (Ambady et al., 2001; Muzzatti &amp; Agnoli, 2007), only with certain students (Keller, 2007), on certain items (Keller, 2007; Neuville &amp; Croizet, 2007), or in certain contexts (Huguet &amp; Regner, 2007, Study 2; Picho &amp; Stephens, 2012; Tomasetto et al., 2011). Importantly, none of the three unpublished dissertations showed a stereotype threat effect. This observation suggests the possibility that publication bias is occurring. Publication bias refers to the fact that studies with null results are often not written up for publication or accepted for publication (Begg, 1994). This bias is a serious concern, especially if these results are being used to make recommendations for interventions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The single largest experimental test of stereotype threat (N = 2064), conducted on Dutch high school students, found no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flore |first1=Paulette |last2=Mulder |first2=Joris |last3=Wicherts |first3=Jelte | name-list-format = vanc |date=2018 |title= The influence of gender stereotype threat on mathematics test scores of Dutch high school students: a registered report |journal=Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology |volume= |issue= |pages= 1–35|doi=10.1080/23743603.2018.1559647 |url=https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/29125573/MTO_Flore_influence_of_gender_stereotype_CRiSP_2019.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as David Nussbaum points out, the same experimental procedures for testing stereotype threat's effects may produce radically differing results in differing cultural contexts, and while this may prove an ongoing challenge for researchers it in no way disproves the existence of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@davenuss79/the-replicability-issue-and-stereotype-threat-research-a988d6f8b080|title=The replicability issue and stereotype threat research|last=Nussbaum|first=Dave|date=2018-02-01|website=Medium|access-date=2019-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he goes on to argue:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Seeing a large literature such as that of cognitive dissonance—and if we dare add, ST—as corrupted beyond interpretability simply because the motive for corruption exists (to publish) and the means exists (e.g., p-hacking) is to disregard the impact of other investigator motives and to embrace, in our view, an unlikely possibility.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
