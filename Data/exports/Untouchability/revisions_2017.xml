'''Untouchability''' is the practice of [[Social rejection|ostracising]] a group by segregating them from the mainstream by social custom or legal mandate. The excluded group could be one that did not accept the norms of the excluding group and historically included foreigners, nomadic tribes, law-breakers and criminals and those suffering from a contagious disease. It could also be a group that did not accept change of customs enforced by a certain group. This exclusion was a method of punishing  law-breakers and also protected traditional societies against contagion from strangers and the infected. A member of the excluded group is known as an '''Untouchable'''.

The term is commonly associated with treatment of the [[Dalit]] communities, who are considered "polluting" among the people of [[South Asia]], but the term has been used for other groups as well, such as the [[Burakumin]] of [[Japan]], [[Cagots]] in Europe, or the [[Al-Akhdam]] in [[Yemen]].

Untouchability has been made illegal in post-independence India, and Dalits substantially empowered, and attempts have been continuously made to end the hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Modern Anthropology of India: Ethnography, Themes and Theory|page=302|publisher=Routledge|authors=Peter Berger, Frank Heidemann|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBgLb8XIGR8C&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=forms+of+social+mobility+which+led+to+dalits+entry+into&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsqrHj7djWAhVBq48KHR-_BT8Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=forms%20of%20social%20mobility%20which%20led%20to%20dalits%20entry%20into&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sarah Pinto, an anthropologist, untouchability in India applies to people whose work relates to "death, bodies, meat, and bodily fluids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Where There Is No Midwife: Birth and Loss in Rural India |first=Sarah |last=Pinto |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-85745-448-5 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5V-_NssEMSsC&amp;pg=PA47 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the name of untouchability,  Dalits have faced work and descent-based [[Caste discrimination|discrimination]] at the hands of the [[Sanskritisation|dominant castes]]. Instances of caste discrimination at different places and times included:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/wadwiu Who are Dalits? &amp; What is Untouchability? — Portal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], untouchability was born about 400 AD, due to the struggle for supremacy between [[Buddhism]] and [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanism]] (an ancient term for Brahmanical Hinduism).&lt;ref&gt; However, these claims have never been verified by any historical evidence.{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/article-in-rss-mouthpiece-misquotes-ambedkar-on-untouchability/article1-1338054.aspx|title=Top RSS leader misquotes Ambedkar on untouchability}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Government action in India===
During the time of Indian independence, [[Dalit]] activists began calling for separate electorates for untouchables in India to allow for fair representation. Officially labeled the Minorities Act, it would guarantee representation for Sikhs, Muslims, Christian, and Untouchables in the newly formed Indian government. The Act was supported by British representatives such as [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. A separation within [[Hindu]] society was opposed by national leaders at the time such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]], although he took no exception with the demands of the other minorities. He began a hunger strike to protest this type of affirmative action, citing that it would create an unhealthy divide within the religion. At the [[Round Table Conferences (India)]], he provided this explanation for his reasoning:&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't mind untouchables if they so desire, being converted to Islam or Christianity. I should tolerate that, but I cannot possibly tolerate what is in store for Hinduism if there are two divisions set forth in the villages. Those who speak of the political rights of the untouchables don't know their India, don't know how Indian society is today constituted and therefore I want to say with all the emphasis that I can command that if I was the only person to resist this thing that I would resist it with my life.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Ravinder. "Gandhi, Ambedkar and the Poona pact, 1932." ''South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies'' 8.1-2 (1985): 87-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Mahatma Gandhi]] achieved some success through his hunger strike. Dalit activists faced pressure from the Hindu population at large to end his protest at the risk of his ailing health. The two sides eventually came to a compromise where the number of guaranteed seats for Untouchables would be reduced, but not totally eliminated.

The 1950 national [[constitution of India]] legally abolished the practice of untouchability and provided measures for [[Reservation in India|positive discrimination]] in both educational institutions and public services for Dalits and other social groups who lie within the caste system. These are supplemented by official bodies such as the [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes]].

Despite this, instances of prejudice against Dalits still occur in some rural areas, as evidenced by events such as the [[Kherlanji massacre]].
