'''Untouchability''' is the social practice of ostracising a (usually) minority [[endogamy|endogamous]] group by regarding them as "ritually polluted" and segregating them from the mainstream by social custom or legal mandate. The excluded group could be one that did not accept the norms of the excluding group and historically included foreigners, nomadic tribes, law-breakers and criminals. This exclusion was a method of punishing  law-breakers and also protected against contagion from strangers. A member of the excluded group is known as an '''untouchable'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=untouchable&amp;searchmode=none Untouchable definition from the Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term is commonly associated with treatment of the [[Dalit]] class among Hindus of [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]], but the term has been used for other groups as well, such as the [[Burakumin]] of [[Japan]] or the [[Al-Akhdam]] in Yemen. Untouchability has been made illegal in post-Independence India but prejudice continues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/06/0602_030602_untouchables.html India's "Untouchables" Face Violence, Discrimination.] Hillary Mayell

===Untouchability in Kerala===
The declaration by princely states of Kerala between 1936 and 1947 that temples were open to all Hindus went a long way towards ending the system of untouchability in Kerala.  However some historical forms of untouchability existed in Kerala, [[Nairs]] and [[Namboothiris]], who constituted the [[forward caste]]s forbid those belonging to lower castes within certain proximity to them, believing that the presence of lower castes would pollute them.  Ezhava and other lower caste were untouchable people in Kerla.  [[Savarna]] kept Ezhava from many feets than other lower caste . 

A [[Nair]] was expected to instantly cut down a [[Thiyya|Tiar]] or [[Mukkuvar|Mucua]] who presumed to defile him by touching his person, and a similar fate awaited a slave who did not turn out of the road as a Nair passed.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=FnB3k8fx5oEC&amp;pg=PA291 Castes and tribes of Southern India, Volume 7 By Edgar Thurston, K. Rangachari, p.251&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the people of the Nayadi, Kanisan and Mukkuvan caste were forbidden to come within 72, 32 and 24 feet respectively from [[Nairs]].  In modern India, observance of untouchability is a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nairs.in/acha_a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
