'''Untouchability''' is the practice of [[Social rejection|ostracizing]] a group by segregating them from the mainstream by social custom or legal mandate. The excluded group could be one that did not accept the norms of the excluding group and historically included foreigners, nomadic tribes, law-breakers and criminals and those suffering from a contagious disease. It could also be a group, that did not accept change of customs enforced by a certain group. This exclusion was a method of punishing  law-breakers and also protected traditional societies against contagion from strangers and the infected. A member of the excluded group is known as an '''Untouchable'''.

The term is commonly associated with treatment of the [[Dalit]] communities, who are considered "polluting" among the people of [[South Asia]], but the term has been used for other groups as well, such as the [[Burakumin]] of [[Japan]], [[Cagots]] in Europe, or the [[Al-Akhdam]] in Yemen. Untouchability has been made illegal in post-independence India, and Dalits substantially empowered, although some prejudice against them continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Modern Anthropology of India: Ethnography, Themes and Theory|page=164|publisher=Routledge|authors=Peter Berger, Frank Heidemann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Untouchability and discrimination===
In the name of untouchability,  Dalits have faced work and descent-based discrimination at the hands of the [[Sanskritisation|dominant castes]]. Instances of this discrimination at different places and times included:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/wadwiu Who are Dalits? &amp; What is Untouchability? — Portal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government action in India===
The 1950 national [[constitution of India]] legally abolished the practice of untouchability and provided measures for [[Reservation in India|positive discrimination]] in both educational institutions and public services for Dalits and other social groups who lie within the caste system. These are supplemented by official bodies such as the [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes]].

Despite this, instances of prejudice against Dalits still occur in some rural areas, as evidenced by events such as the [[Kherlanji massacre]]. 

In recent times, there has been some radical reforms in the social sector of India. The famous [[Vithoba Temple, Pandharpur]] became the first temple in India to allow priests from backward classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lord Vithoba temple makes history by having women and lower-caste priests|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/05/lord-vithoba-temple-makes-history-by-having-women-and-lower-caste-priests/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
