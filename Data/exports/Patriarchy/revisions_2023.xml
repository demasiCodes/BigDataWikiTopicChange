"I shall define patriarchy as a system of social structures, and practices in which men dominate, oppress and exploit women." "There are six main patriarchal structures which together constitute a system of patriarchy.

Patriarchy is associated various ideas forming patriarchal [[ideology]] that acts to explain and justify it, and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women, divine commandment, or other fixed structures. Sociologists hold varied opinions on whether patriarchy is a social product or an outcome of innate differences between the sexes. [[Sociobiologists]] compare human gender roles to sexed behavior in other primates and some argue that gender inequality comes primarily from genetic and reproductive differences between men and women. [[Social constructionists]] contest this argument, arguing that gender roles and gender inequity are instruments of power and have become social norms to maintain control over women.

Historically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=978-0-02-865960-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.&lt;ref name="Lockard p88"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions: A Global History |edition=3rd |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |location=Stamford, Conn. |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-285-78312-3 |page=88 |quote=Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies thanks to patriarchy, a system whereby men largely control women and children, shape ideas about appropriate gender behavior, and generally dominate society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pateman 2016"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Nancy A. |editor-last=Naples |encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies, Volume 5 |first1=Carole |last1=Pateman |chapter=Sexual Contract |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9 |chapter-url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468 |doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468 |quote=The heyday of the patriarchal structures analyzed in ''The Sexual Contract'' extended from the 1840s to the late 1970s [...] Nevertheless, men's government of women is one of the most deeply entrenched of all power structures |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-history===
Several researchers have stated that the first evidence of patriarchal structures, signs of a [[sexual division of labour]], dates from around 2 million years ago, deep within humanity's evolutionary past.&lt;ref name="Wrangham2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Betuel2020" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alger2020" /&gt; Other  [[anthropology|anthropological]], [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychological]] evidence suggests that most [[prehistoric]] societies were relatively [[egalitarian]],{{r|Lockard p88}} and suggests that patriarchal social structures did not develop until after the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, following social and technological developments such as [[agriculture]] and [[domestication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Women in Ancient Civilizations |editor=Adas, Michael |title=Agricultural and pastoral societies in ancient and classical history |publisher=Temple University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-56639-832-9 |pages=118–119 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&amp;pg=PA118 |author1=Hughes, Sarah Shaver |author2=Hughes Brady |name-list-style=amp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eagly99"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eagly, Alice H. |author2=Wood, Wendy |name-list-style=amp |title=The Origins of Sex Differences in Human Behavior: Evolved Dispositions Versus Social Roles |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=July 1999 |pages=408–423 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/facets/eagly&amp;wood.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120527003250/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/facets/eagly&amp;wood.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 May 2012 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="erdal"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erdal |first1=David |title=Modelling the early human mind |last2=Whiten |first2=Andrew |date=1996 |publisher=McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge |isbn=978-0-9519420-1-7 |editor-last1=Mellars |editor-first1=Paul |series=Cambridge McDonald Monograph Series |location=Cambridge Oakville, Connecticut |chapter=Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution |editor-last2=Gibson |editor-first2=Kathleen Rita |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-okQAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert M.

[[Marxist]] theory, as articulated mainly by [[Friedrich Engels]] in ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'', assigns the origin of patriarchy to the emergence of [[private property]], which has traditionally been controlled by men. In this view, men directed household production and sought to control women in order to ensure the passing of family property to their own (male) offspring, while women were limited to household labor and producing children.{{refn|name=Cannell &amp; Green}}{{refn|name=Gardiner}}&lt;ref name="Bryson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryson |first=Valerie |editor1=Kramarae, Cheris |editor2=Spender, Dale |title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge, Volume 2 |date=2000 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-92088-9 |page=791 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAOUAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22this+understanding+was+developed+by+frederick+engels%22 |chapter=Feminism: Marxist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner disputes this idea, arguing that patriarchy emerged before the development of class-based society and the concept of private property.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lerner |first=Gerda |url=https://archive.org/details/womenhistory00lern |title=The creation of patriarchy |date=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-503996-2 |location=New York |pages=238–239 |oclc=13323175}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2019}}

Domination by men of women is found in the [[Ancient Near East]] as far back as 3100 BCE, as are restrictions on a woman's reproductive capacity and exclusion from "the process of representing or the construction of history".&lt;ref name="Strozier"/&gt; According to some researchers, with the appearance of the [[Hebrews]], there is also "the exclusion of woman from the God-humanity covenant".&lt;ref name="Strozier"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Ancient history===
A prominent Greek general [[Meno (general)|Meno]], in the Platonic dialogue of the same name, sums up the prevailing sentiment in [[Classical Greece]] about the respective virtues of men and women. He says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=W.R.M. Lamb |title=Plato in Twelve Volumes |volume=3 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1967 |chapter=71E: Meno |chapter-url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text=Meno:section=71e |access-date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote | First of all, if you take the virtue of a man, it is easily stated that a man's virtue is this—that he be competent to manage the affairs of his city, and to manage them so as to benefit his friends and harm his enemies, and to take care to avoid suffering harm himself. Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband. | Meno | Plato in Twelve Volumes}}

The works of [[Aristotle]] portrayed women as morally, intellectually, and physically inferior to men; saw women as the property of men; claimed that women's role in society was to reproduce and to serve men in the household; and saw male domination of women as natural and virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fishbein, Harold D. |title=Peer prejudice and discrimination: the origins of prejudice |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychology Press |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-8058-3772-8 |page=27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBwAYLFPP3sC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dubber, Markus Dirk |title=The police power: patriarchy and the foundations of American government |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-231-13207-7 |pages=5–7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjdbRF8PXhUC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bar On, Bat-Ami |title=Engendering origins: critical feminist readings in Plato and Aristotle |publisher=SUNY Press |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-7914-1643-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UVq3z2Kd6cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the great Greek thinkers believed that women were inferior. Aristotle's teacher [[Plato]] laid out his vision of the most just society in his work [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]. In it, Plato argues that women would have complete educational and political equality in such a society, and would serve in the military. The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] also valued the participation of women, who were treated as intellectual equals.

[[Gerda Lerner]], author of ''The Creation of Patriarchy,'' states that Aristotle believed that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle believed to be perfect and superior. [[Maryanne Cline Horowitz]] stated that Aristotle believed that "soul contributes the form and model of creation". This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must be caused by a woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about when they grow up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.&lt;ref name="Lerner1986"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lerner |first=Gerda |date=1986 |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/creationofpatria00lern |chapter-url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Chapter 10: Symbols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egypt]] left no philosophical record, but [[Herodotus]] left a record of his shock at the contrast between the roles of Egyptian women and the women of [[Athens]]. He observed that Egyptian women attended market and were employed in [[trade]]. In ancient Egypt, [[Middle class|middle-class]] women were eligible to sit on a local [[tribunal]], engage in [[real estate]] transactions, and inherit or bequeath [[property]]. Women also secured loans, and witnessed legal documents. [[Women in Classical Athens|Athenian women]] were denied such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ptahhotep, trans. John A. Wilson.

During this time period in China, gender roles and patriarchy remained shaped by [[Confucianism]]. Adopted as the official religion in the [[Han dynasty]], Confucianism has strong dictates regarding the behavior of women, declaring a woman's place in society, as well as outlining virtuous behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Adler |first=Joseph A. |date=Winter 2006 |title=Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

===Asia===

In ancient [[Japan]], power in society was more evenly distributed, particularly in the religious domain, where [[Shinto]]ism worships the goddess [[Amaterasu]], and ancient writings were replete with references to great priestesses and magicians. However, at the time contemporary with [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in the West, "the emperor of Japan changed Japanese modes of worship", giving supremacy to male deities and suppressing female spiritual power in what religious feminists have called a "patriarchal revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ellwood |first=Robert |date=1986 |title=Patriarchal Revolution in Ancient Japan: Episodes from the "Nihonshoki" Sūjin Chronicle |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25002039 |journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=23–37 |jstor=25002039 |issn=8755-4178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China's [[Ming dynasty]], widowed women were expected to never remarry, and unmarried women were expected to remain chaste for the duration of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=My Country and My People |last=Lin |first=Yutang |author-link=Lin Yutang |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford City Press |orig-date=1935 |isbn=978-1-84902-664-2 |oclc=744466115}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Biographies of Exemplary Women]]'', a book containing biographies of women who lived according to the Confucian ideals of virtuous womanhood, popularized an entire genre of similar writing during the Ming dynasty.

In China's [[Qing dynasty]], laws governing morality, sexuality, and gender-relations continued to be based on Confucian teachings. Men and women were both subject to strict laws regarding sexual behavior, however men were punished infrequently in comparison to women. Additionally, women's punishment often carried strong social stigma, "rendering [women] unmarriageable", a stigma which did not follow men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruskola |first=Teemu |title=Law, Sexual Morality, and Gender Equality in Qing and Communist China |journal=The Yale Law Journal |volume=103 |issue=8 |year=1994 |pages=2531–2565 |jstor=797055 |doi=10.2307/797055 |url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7574&amp;context=ylj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the [[People's Republic of China]], laws governing morality which were written as egalitarian were selectively enforced favoring men, permissively allowing [[female infanticide]], while infanticide of any form was, by the letter of the law, prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jimmerson |first=Julie |date=Winter 1991 |title=Female Infanticide in China: An Examination of Cultural and Legal Norms |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/80n7k798 |journal=Pacific Basin Law Journal |volume=8 |pages=33 |via=eScholarship.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
Although many 16th and 17th century theorists agreed with Aristotle's views concerning the place of women in society, none of them tried to prove political obligation on the basis of the patriarchal family until sometime after 1680. The patriarchal political theory is closely associated with Sir [[Robert Filmer]]. Sometime before 1653, Filmer completed a work entitled ''[[Patriarcha]]''. However, it was not published until after his death. In it, he defended the [[divine right of kings]] as having title inherited from [[Adam]], the first man of the human species, according to [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gordon |first=Schochet |title=Patriarchy and Paternalism |encyclopedia=Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World |date=2004 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |isbn=978-0-684-31200-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the latter half of the 18th century, clerical sentiments of patriarchy were meeting challenges from intellectual authorities – [[Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopedia]] denies inheritance of paternal authority stating, "... reason shows us that mothers have rights and authority equal to those of fathers; for the obligations imposed on children originate equally from the mother and the father, as both are equally responsible for bringing them into the world. Thus the positive laws of God that relate to the obedience of children join the father and the mother without any differentiation; both possess a kind of ascendancy and jurisdiction over their children...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Encyclopedie, Paternal Authority |journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert – Collaborative Translation Project |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.040/--paternal-authority?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=education |access-date=1 April 2015 |date=February 2003 |last1=Louis |first1=Chevalier de Jaucourt (Biography)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, various women began to question the commonly accepted patriarchal interpretation of [[Christian scripture]]. [[Quaker]] [[Sarah Grimké]] voiced skepticism about the ability of men to translate and interpret passages relating to the roles of the sexes without bias. She proposed alternative translations and interpretations of passages relating to women, and she applied historical and cultural criticism to a number of verses, arguing that their admonitions applied to specific historical situations, and were not to be viewed as universal commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durso |first=Pamela R. |title=The Power of Woman: The Life and writings of Sarah Moore Grimké |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQFTJJgK8esC |date=2003 |publisher=Mercer University Press |location=Macon, Ga. |isbn=978-0-86554-876-3 |pages=130–138 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] used Grimké's criticism of biblical sources to establish a basis for feminist thought. She published ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', which proposed a feminist reading of the Old and New Testament. This tendency was enlarged by feminist theory, which denounced the patriarchal Judeo-Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Castro, Ginette |title=American Feminism: a contemporary history |url=https://archive.org/details/americanfeminism00castrich |url-access=registration |publisher=NYU Press |date=1990 |page=[https://archive.org/details/americanfeminism00castrich/page/31 31]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2020 social theorist and theologian [[Elaine Storkey]] retold the stories of thirty biblical women in her book ''Women in a Patriarchal World'' and applied the challenges they faced to women today.

The sociologist [[Sylvia Walby]] defines patriarchy as "a system of social structures and practices in which men dominate, oppress, and exploit women".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; [[Social stratification]] along gender lines, with power predominantly held by men, has been observed in most societies.{{r|Lockard p88|Meagher|Hennessy}}

==Feminist theory==
[[File:Fight Patriarchy graffiti in Turin.jpg|thumb|"FIGHT PATRIARCHY" – a graffito in [[Turin]]]]

Feminist theorists have written extensively about patriarchy either as a primary cause of women's oppression, or as part of an interactive system. [[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of [[oppression]] of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]] believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Alison Jaggar]] also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.

Interactive systems theorists [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Heidi Hartmann]] believe that patriarchy and [[capitalism]] interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other [[Socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] use the terms ''patriarchal capitalism'' or ''capitalist patriarchy'' to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Tong"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction |last1=Rosemarie |first1=Tong |last2=Botts |first2=Tina Fernandes |date=2017-07-18 |isbn=978-0-8133-5070-7 |edition=Fifth |location=New York |oclc=979993556}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hartmann, the term ''patriarchy'' redirects the focus of oppression from the [[Division of labour|labour division]] to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a [[gender]]. In its being both systematic and universal, therefore, the concept of patriarchy represents an adaptation of the Marxist concept of class and [[Class conflict|class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartmann |first1=Heidi |title=The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism |journal=Capital and Class |volume=8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lindsey German]] represents an outlier in this regard. German argued for a need to redefine the origins and sources of the patriarchy, describing the mainstream theories as providing "little understanding of how women's oppression and the nature of the family have changed historically. Nor is there much notion of how widely differing that oppression is from class to class."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/german/1981/xx/patriarchy.htm |title=Lindsey German: Theories of Patriarchy (Spring 1981) |website=www.marxists.org |access-date=2020-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the patriarchy is not the result of men's oppression of women or sexism per se, with men not even identified as the main beneficiaries of such a system, but [[Capital (economics)|capital]] itself. As such, female liberation needs to begin "with an assessment of the material position of women in capitalist society."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In that, German differs from Young or Hartmann by rejecting the notion ("eternal truth") that the patriarchy is  at the root of female oppression.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Audre Lorde]], an African American feminist writer and theorist, believed that [[racism]] and patriarchy were intertwined systems of oppression.&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; [[Sara Ruddick]], a philosopher who wrote about "good mothers" in the context of maternal ethics, describes the dilemma facing contemporary mothers who must train their children within a patriarchal system. She asks whether a "good mother" trains her son to be competitive, individualistic, and comfortable within the hierarchies of patriarchy, knowing that he may likely be economically successful but a mean person, or whether she resists patriarchal ideologies and [[Socialization|socializes]] her son to be cooperative and communal but economically unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gerda Lerner]], in her 1986 ''The Creation of Patriarchy'', makes a series of arguments about the origins and reproduction of patriarchy as a system of oppression of women, and concludes that patriarchy is [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] and seen as natural and invisible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some feminist theorists believe that patriarchy is an unjust [[social system]] that is harmful to both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David A. J. Richards |title=Resisting Injustice and the Feminist Ethics of Care in the Age of Obama: "Suddenly ...

Because patriarchy is a social construction, it can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tickner, Ann J. |chapter=Patriarchy |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries P-Z |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-24352-0 |pages=1197–1198 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaggar, Young, and Hartmann are among the feminist theorists who argue that the system of patriarchy should be completely overturned, especially the [[Heteropatriarchy|heteropatriarchal]] family, which they see as a necessary component of female oppression. The family not only serves as a representative of the greater civilization by pushing its own affiliates to change and obey, but performs as a component in the rule of the patriarchal state that rules its inhabitants with the head of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org |title=Violence against Women and Media: Advancements and Challenges of a Research and Political Agenda |last=Montiel |first=Aimée Vega |date=8 October 2014 |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many feminists (especially scholars and activists) have called for culture repositioning as a method for deconstructing patriarchy. Culture repositioning relates to [[culture change]]. It involves the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chigbu |first=Uchendu Eugene |title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community |journal=Community, Work &amp; Family |date=2015 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=334–350 |doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506 |s2cid=144448501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the widespread use of the term ''patriarchy'', early feminists used ''[[Chauvinism#Male chauvinism|male chauvinism]]'' and ''sexism'' to refer roughly to the same phenomenon.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25"&gt;{{cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |author-link=bell hooks |chapter=Understanding patriarchy |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G28LTQltyVAC&amp;pg=PA17 |title=The will to change: men, masculinity, and love |publisher=Washington Square Press |date=2004 |pages=17–25 |isbn=978-0-7434-8033-8 |quote=Patriarchy is a political-social system that insists that males are inherently dominating, superior to everything and everyone deemed weak, especially females, and endowed with the right to dominate and rule over the weak and to maintain that dominance through various forms of psychological terrorism and violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[bell hooks]] argues that the new term identifies the ideological system itself (that men claim dominance and superiority to women) that can be believed and acted upon by either men or women, whereas the earlier terms imply only men act as oppressors of women.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25" /&gt;

Sociologist [[Joan Acker]], analyzing the concept of patriarchy and the role that it has played in the development of feminist thought, says that seeing patriarchy as a "universal, trans-historical and trans-cultural phenomenon" where "women were everywhere oppressed by men in more or less the same ways […] tended toward a biological essentialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acker |first1=Joan |title=The Problem with Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1989 |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=235 |doi=10.1177/0038038589023002005 |s2cid=143683720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Pollert has described use of the term patriarchy as circular and conflating description and explanation. She remarks the discourse on patriarchy creates a "theoretical impasse ... imposing a structural label on what it is supposed to explain" and therefore impoverishes the possibility of explaining [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pollert |first1=Anna |title=Gender and Class Revisited, or the Poverty of 'Patriarchy' |journal=Sociology |date=1996 |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=235 |doi=10.1177/0038038596030004002 |s2cid=145758809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also considerable variation in the role that gender plays in human societies, and there is no academic consensus on to what extent [[Biological determinism|biology determines]] human social structure.

=== Patriarchy as a human universal ===
An early theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] offered an explanation for the origin of patriarchy which starts with the view that females almost always invest more energy into producing offspring than males, and, therefore in most [[species]] females are a [[limiting factor]] over which males will compete. This is sometimes referred to as [[Bateman's principle]]. It suggests females place the most important preference on males who control more resources that can help her and her offspring, which in turn causes an [[evolutionary pressure]] on males to be competitive with each other in order to gain resources and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Buss |first1=David Michael |last2=Schmitt |first2=David P. |date=May 2011 |title=Evolutionary psychology and feminism |journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] |volume=64 |issue=9–10 |pages=768–787 |doi=10.1007/s11199-011-9987-3 |s2cid=7878675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[sociobiologist]]s, such as [[Steven Goldberg]], argue that social behavior is primarily determined by [[genetics]], and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than [[social conditioning]]. Goldberg contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of [[Culture|human culture]]. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, "The [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all."&lt;ref name="Goldberg, Steven"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberg |first=Steven |title=The inevitability of patriarchy |date=1974 |publisher=W. Morrow |isbn=978-0-688-05175-4 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg has critics among anthropologists. Concerning Goldberg's claims about the "feelings of both men and women", [[Eleanor Leacock]] countered in 1974 that the data on women's attitudes are "sparse and contradictory", and that the data on male attitudes about male–female relations are "ambiguous". Also, the effects of [[colonialism]] on the cultures represented in the studies were not considered.&lt;ref name="Leacock, Eleanor"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leacock |first=Eleanor |author-link=Eleanor Leacock |date=June 1974 |title=Reviewed Work: ''The Inevitability of Patriarchy'' by Steven Goldberg |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=363–365 |doi=10.1525/aa.1974.76.2.02a00280 |jstor=674209 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist and psychologist [[Barbara Smuts]] argues that patriarchy evolved in humans through conflict between the reproductive interests of males and the reproductive interests of females. She lists six ways that it emerged:{{Further explanation needed|reason=|date=December 2020}}
# a reduction in female allies
# elaboration of male-male alliances
# increased male control over resources
# increased hierarchy formation among men
# female strategies that reinforce male control over females

=== Sex hormones and social structure ===
Patriarchal and matriarchal social structure in primates may be mediated by [[sex hormone]]s.

In humans, patriarchal social structure may have evolved due to intersexual selection (i.e. female mate selection), or intrasexual selection (i.e. male-male competition).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Physical features associated with testosterone, such as facial hair and lower voices, are sometimes used to gain a better understanding of sexual pressures in the human evolutionary environment.  These features may have appeared as a result of female mate selection, or because of male-male competition. Men with beards and low voices are perceived as more dominant, aggressive, and high-status compared to their cleanshaven higher-voiced counterparts, meaning that men with facial hair and lower voices may be more likely to attain a high status and increase their reproductive success.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A lover or a fighter?

==Social theory==

Sociologists tend to reject predominantly biological explanations of patriarchy&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Macionis, John J. (2012). ''Sociology'' (13th ed.). Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-205-18109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contend that socialization processes are primarily responsible for establishing [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name="Henslin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of Sociology |first=James M. |last=Henslin |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=2001 |pages=65–67, 240 |isbn=978-0-536-94185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to standard sociological theory, patriarchy is the result of sociological constructions that are passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="Sanderson"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Evolution of Human Sociality |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionhumanso00sand |url-access=limited |last=Sanderson |first=Stephen K. |date=2001 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-8476-9534-8 |location=Lanham, Maryland |page=[https://archive.org/details/evolutionhumanso00sand/page/n209 198]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constructions are most pronounced in societies with traditional cultures and less economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology: A Global Introduction |first1=John J. |last1=Macionis |last2=Plummer |first2=Ken |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Harlow |date=2000 |page=347 |isbn=978-0-13-040737-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in modern, developed societies, however, gender messages conveyed by family, mass media, and other institutions largely favor males having a dominant status.&lt;ref name="Henslin"/&gt;

Although patriarchy exists within the scientific atmosphere,{{Clarify|reason=what is the scientific atmosphere?|date=December 2020}} "the periods over which women would have been at a physiological disadvantage in participation in hunting through being at a late stage of pregnancy or early stage of child-rearing would have been short",&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|157}} during the time of the nomads, patriarchy still grew with power. Lewontin and others argue that such biological determinism unjustly limits women. In his study, he states women behave a certain way not because they are biologically inclined to, but rather because they are judged by "how well they conform to the stereotypical local image of femininity".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|137}}

Feminists{{Who|date=December 2020}} believe that people have gendered biases, which are perpetuated and enforced across generations by those who benefit from them.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; For instance, it has historically been claimed that women cannot make rational decisions during their menstrual periods. This claim cloaks the fact that men also have periods of time where they can be aggressive and irrational; furthermore, unrelated effects of aging and similar medical problems are often blamed on menopause, amplifying its reputation.&lt;ref name=Coney&gt;{{cite book |last=Coney |first=Sandra |title=The menopause industry: how the medical establishment exploits women |publisher=Hunter House |location=Alameda, California |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-89793-161-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/menopauseindustr00cone}}&lt;/ref&gt; These biological traits and others specific to women, such as their ability to get pregnant, are often used against them as an attribute of weakness.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney" /&gt;

Sociologist [[Sylvia Walby]] has composed six overlapping structures that define patriarchy and that take different forms in different cultures and different times:
# The household: women are more likely to have their labor expropriated by their husbands such as through housework and raising children
# Paid work: women are likely to be paid less and face exclusion from paid work
# The state: women are unlikely to have formal power and representation
# Violence: women are more prone to being abused
# Sexuality: women's sexuality is more likely to be treated negatively
# Culture: representation of women in media, and popular culture is "within a patriarchal gaze".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The idea that patriarchy is natural has, however, come under attack from many sociologists, explaining that patriarchy evolved due to historical, rather than biological, conditions. In technologically simple societies, men's greater physical strength and women's common experience of pregnancy combined to sustain patriarchy.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;Gradually, technological advances, especially industrial machinery, diminished the primacy of physical strength in everyday life. Introduction of household appliances reduced the amount of manual labor needed in the households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How the appliance boom moved more women into the workforce |url=https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/how-appliance-boom-moved-more-women-workforce |website=Penn Today |date=30 January 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de V.

==Psychoanalytic theories==
While the term ''patriarchy'' often refers to male domination generally, another interpretation sees it as literally "rule of the father".&lt;ref name="Mitchell_409"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Juliet |author-link=Juliet Mitchell |chapter=The cultural revolution |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwG0AAAAIAAJ |title=Psychoanalysis and feminism |page=409 |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |date=1974 |isbn=978-0-394-47472-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; So some people{{Who|date=September 2018}} believe patriarchy does not refer simply to male power over women, but the expression of power dependent on age as well as gender, such as by older men over women, children, and younger men. Some of these younger men may inherit and therefore have a stake in continuing these conventions. Others may rebel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eherenreich |first=Barbara |chapter=Life without father |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_zeRtk81pcC |editor-last1=McDowell |editor-first1=Linda |editor-last2=Pringle |editor-first2=Rosemary |title=Defining women: Social institutions and gender divisions |publisher=Polity/Open University |location=London |date=1992 |isbn=978-0-7456-0979-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/definingwomensoc0000unse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cockburn |first=Cynthia |title=Brothers: male dominance and technological change |publisher=Pluto |location=London Concord, Massachusetts |date=1991 |isbn=978-0-7453-0583-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=September 2018}}

Arguing from this standpoint, radical feminist [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote in her 1970 ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marx was on to something more profound than he knew when he observed that the family contained within itself in embryo all the antagonisms that later develop on a wide scale within the society and the state. For unless revolution uproots the basic social organisation, the biological family – the vinculum through which the psychology of power can always be smuggled – the tapeworm of exploitation will never be annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Firestone |first=Shulamith |author-link=Shulamith Firestone |title=The dialectic of sex: the case for feminist revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/dialecticofsexca0000fire |url-access=registration |publisher=Quill |location=New York |date=1970 |isbn=978-0-688-12359-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
