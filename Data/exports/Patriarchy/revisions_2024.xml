'''Patriarchy''' is a [[social system]] in which men typically hold authority and responsibility while also excluding women from it. In [[anthropology]], it refers to a family or [[clan]] structure where the father or eldest male holds supremacy within the family, while in [[feminist theory]], it encompasses a broader social structure where men collectively dominate societal norms and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Definition of PATRIARCHY |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/patriarchy |date=3 June 2023 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=patriarchy |encyclopedia=Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/patriarchy |date=2 June 2023 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Meaning of patriarchy in English |encyclopedia=Cambridge Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriarchal [[ideology]] acts to explain and rationalize patriarchy by attributing [[gender inequality]] to inherent [[Gender essentialism|natural differences between men and women]], divine commandment, or other fixed structures.{{r|Green 2010}} [[Sociologist]]s tend to disagree with some of the predominantly biological explanations of patriarchy and contend that [[socialization]] processes are primarily responsible for establishing [[gender role]]s.{{r|Henslin 2001}} [[Sociobiologist]]s compare human gender roles to sexed behavior in other primates and some{{Who|date=December 2023}} argue that gender inequality comes primarily from genetic and reproductive differences between men and women. [[Social constructionists]] contest this argument, arguing that gender roles and gender inequity are instruments of power and have become social norms to maintain control over women.

Historically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa|author-link=Fedwa Malti-Douglas |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=978-0-02-865960-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal, unless the criteria of complete exclution of women in authority is applied.&lt;ref name="Lockard p88"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions: A Global History |edition=3rd |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |location=Stamford, Conn. |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-285-78312-3 |page=88 |quote=Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies thanks to patriarchy, a system whereby men largely control women and children, shape ideas about appropriate gender behavior, and generally dominate society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pateman 2016"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Nancy A. |editor-last=Naples |encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies, Volume 5 |first1=Carole |last1=Pateman |author-link=Carole Pateman|chapter=Sexual Contract |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9 |chapter-url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468 |doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468 |quote=The heyday of the patriarchal structures analyzed in ''The Sexual Contract'' extended from the 1840s to the late 1970s [...] Nevertheless, men's government of women is one of the most deeply entrenched of all power structures |pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Patriarchy is a social system in which men are the primary [[authority]] figures in the areas of [[political leader]]ship, [[moral authority]] and control of [[property]].&lt;ref name="Catalano p187"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Catalano |first1=D. Chase J. |last2=Griffin |first2=Pat |editor1-last=Adams |editor1-first=Maurianne |editor2-last=Bell |editor2-first=Lee Anne |title=Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-1-317-68869-3 |page=187 |edition=3rd |doi=10.4324/9781315775852-8 |chapter=Sexism, Heterosexism, and Trans* Oppression: An Integrated Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sociologist [[Sylvia Walby]] defines patriarchy as "a system of social structures and practices in which men dominate, oppress, and exploit women".&lt;ref name="Walby 1989"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Walby |first=Sylvia |title=Theorising Patriarchy |date=1989 |journal=Sociology |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=213–234 |doi=10.1177/0038038589023002004 |jstor=42853921 |s2cid=220676988 |quote=I shall define patriarchy as a system of social structures, and practices in which men dominate, oppress and exploit women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Social stratification]] along gender lines, with power predominantly held by men, has been observed in most, but not all societies.{{r|Lockard p88|Meagher 2011|Hennessy 2012}}

==History==

===Pre-history===
====Sexual division of labour====
Some preconditions for the eventual development of patriarchy were the emergence of increased [[paternal investment]] in the offspring, also referred to as [[fatherhood]], and of a [[sexual division of labour]]. Several researchers have stated that the first signs of a sexual division of labour dates from around 2 million years ago, deep within humanity's evolutionary past.&lt;ref name="Wrangham 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Betuel 2020" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alger 2020" /&gt; It has been connected to an evolutionary process during a period of resource scarcity in Africa approximately 2 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Betuel 2020"&gt;{{cite web |last=Betuel |first=Emma |title=Why ancient men had to evolve from carousers to doting dads — or die |url=https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/the-first-stay-at-home-dad |website=Inverse |access-date=11 December 2023 |date=21 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alger 2020"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last1=Alger |first1=Ingela |last2=Hooper |first2=Paul L. |last3=Cox |first3=Donald |last4=Stieglitz |first4=Jonathan |last5=Kaplan |first5=Hillard S. |date=2020-05-19 |title=Paternal provisioning results from ecological change |magazine=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=117 |issue=20 |pages=10746–10754 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1917166117 |issn=0027-8424 |pmc=7245097 |pmid=32358187 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 book ''[[Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]]'',&lt;ref name="Wrangham 2009"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wrangham |first=Richard |title=Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human |publisher=Basic Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-465-01362-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; British [[Primatology|primatologist]] [[Richard Wrangham]] suggests that the origin of the [[Sexual_division_of_labour|division of labor]] between males and females may have originated with the invention of cooking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bradt |first1=Steve |title=Invention of cooking drove evolution of the human species, new book argues |url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/06/invention-of-cooking-drove-evolution-of-the-human-species-new-book-argues/ |website=The Harvard Gazette |access-date=11 December 2023 |date=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rehg 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rehg |first=Jennifer |date=2010 |title=Review of 'Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human' |url=https://thekeep.eiu.edu/the_councilor/vol71/iss1/1 |journal=The Councilor: A Journal of the Social Studies |volume=71 |issue=1 |at=Article 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is estimated to have happened simultaneously with [[Control of fire by early humans|humans gaining control of fire]] between 1 and 2 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Herculano-Houzel 2016"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Herculano-Houzel |first=Suzana |date=2016 |title=The Human Advantage: A New Understanding of How Our Brain Became Remarkable |publisher=The MIT Press |doi=10.7551/mitpress/9780262034258.001.0001 |isbn=978-0-262-03425-8}}{{page needed|date=December 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was early proposed by [[Friedrich Engels]] in an [[The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man|unfinished essay from 1876]].
====Sex hierarchies====
[[anthropology|Anthropological]], [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychological]] evidence suggests that most [[prehistoric]] societies were relatively [[egalitarian]],{{r|Lockard p88}} and suggests that patriarchal social structures did not develop until after the end of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch, following social and technological developments such as [[agriculture]] and [[domestication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Women in Ancient Civilizations |editor=Adas, Michael |title=Agricultural and pastoral societies in ancient and classical history |publisher=Temple University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-56639-832-9 |pages=118–119 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&amp;pg=PA118 |author1=Hughes, Sarah Shaver |author2=Hughes Brady |name-list-style=amp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eagly 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eagly, Alice H. |author2=Wood, Wendy |name-list-style=amp |title=The Origins of Sex Differences in Human Behavior: Evolved Dispositions Versus Social Roles |journal=American Psychologist |volume=54 |issue=6 |date=July 1999 |pages=408–423 |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/facets/eagly&amp;wood.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120527003250/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/facets/eagly&amp;wood.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 May 2012 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erdal 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erdal |first1=David |title=Modelling the early human mind |last2=Whiten |first2=Andrew |date=1996 |publisher=McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge |isbn=978-0-9519420-1-7 |editor-last1=Mellars |editor-first1=Paul |series=Cambridge McDonald Monograph Series |location=Cambridge Oakville, Connecticut |chapter=Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution |editor-last2=Gibson |editor-first2=Kathleen Rita |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-okQAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert M.

[[Marxist]] theory, as articulated mainly by [[Friedrich Engels]] in ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' (1884), assigns the origin of patriarchy to the emergence of [[private property]], which has traditionally been controlled by men. In this view, men directed household production and sought to control women in order to ensure the passing of family property to their own (male) offspring, while women were limited to household labor and producing children.{{r|Cannell 1996|Gardiner 1999}}&lt;ref name="Bryson 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryson |first=Valerie |editor1=Kramarae, Cheris |editor2=Spender, Dale |title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge, Volume 2 |date=2000 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-92088-9 |page=791 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QAOUAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22this+understanding+was+developed+by+frederick+engels%22 |chapter=Feminism: Marxist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner disputes this idea, arguing that patriarchy emerged before the development of class-based society and the concept of private property.&lt;ref name="Lerner p53"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lerner |first=Gerda |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |date=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-503996-2 |location=New York |series=Women and History, Volume 1 |pages=50–53 |quote=But in a situation in which ecological conditions and irregularities in biological reproduction threatened the survival of the group, people would search for more reproducers — that is, women. Thus, the first appropriation of private property consists of the appropriation of the labor of women as ''reproducers''. Aaby concludes: 'The connection between the reification of women on the one hand and the state and private property on the other is exactly the opposite of that posed by Engels and his followers. Without the reification of women as a historically given socio-structural feature, the origin of private property and the state will remain inexplicable.' If we follow Aaby’s argument, which I find persuasive, we must conclude that in the course of the agricultural revolution the exploitation of human labor and the sexual exploitation of women become inextricably linked. |url=https://archive.org/details/creationofpatria00lern/page/50/mode/1up?ref=ol&amp;view=theater |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domination by men of women is found in the [[Ancient Near East]] as far back as 3100 BCE, as are restrictions on a woman's reproductive capacity and exclusion from "the process of representing or the construction of history".&lt;ref name="Strozier 2002"/&gt; According to some researchers, with the appearance of the [[Hebrews]], there is also "the exclusion of woman from the God-humanity covenant".&lt;ref name="Strozier 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lerner p8"/&gt;

The archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] argues that waves of [[kurgan hypothesis|kurgan]]-building invaders from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Ukrainian steppes]] into the early agricultural cultures of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]] in the Aegean, the Balkans and southern Italy instituted male hierarchies that led to the rise of patriarchy in [[Western society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gimbutas |first=Marija |chapter=The end of Old Europe: the intrusion of Steppe Pastoralists from South Russia and the transformation of Europe |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktftAAAAMAAJ |title=The Civilization of the Goddess: The World of Old Europe |pages=351–510 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=San Francisco, California |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-06-250337-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Taylor argues that the rise of patriarchal domination was associated with the appearance of socially stratified hierarchical polities, institutionalised violence and the separated individuated ego associated with a period of climatic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Steven |chapter=What's wrong with human beings? |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mSPtBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12 |title=The Fall: The Insanity of the Ego in Human History |pages=17–19 |publisher=O Books |location=Winchester |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-905047-20-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Western history===
A prominent Greek general [[Meno (general)|Meno]], in the Platonic dialogue of the same name, sums up the prevailing sentiment in [[Classical Greece]] about the respective virtues of men and women. He says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=W.R.M. Lamb |title=Plato in Twelve Volumes |volume=3 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1967 |chapter=71E: Meno |chapter-url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text=Meno:section=71e |access-date=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote | First of all, if you take the virtue of a man, it is easily stated that a man's virtue is this—that he be competent to manage the affairs of his city, and to manage them so as to benefit his friends and harm his enemies, and to take care to avoid suffering harm himself. Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband. | Meno | Plato in Twelve Volumes}}

The works of [[Aristotle]] portrayed women as morally, intellectually, and physically inferior to men; saw women as the property of men; claimed that women's role in society was to reproduce and to serve men in the household; and saw male domination of women as natural and virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fishbein, Harold D. |title=Peer prejudice and discrimination: the origins of prejudice |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychology Press |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-8058-3772-8 |page=27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBwAYLFPP3sC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dubber, Markus Dirk |title=The police power: patriarchy and the foundations of American government |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-231-13207-7 |pages=5–7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjdbRF8PXhUC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bar On, Bat-Ami |title=Engendering origins: critical feminist readings in Plato and Aristotle |publisher=SUNY Press |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-7914-1643-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UVq3z2Kd6cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the great Greek thinkers believed that women were inferior. Aristotle's teacher [[Plato]] laid out his vision of the most just society in his work [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]. In it, Plato argues that women would have complete educational and political equality in such a society, and would serve in the military. The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] also valued the participation of women, who were treated as intellectual equals.

Lerner states that Aristotle believed that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle believed to be perfect and superior. [[Maryanne Cline Horowitz]] stated that Aristotle believed that "soul contributes the form and model of creation". This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must be caused by a woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about when they grow up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.&lt;ref name="Lerner p199"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lerner |first=Gerda |date=1986 |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |series=Women and History, Volume 1 |pages=199–211 |isbn=978-0-19-503996-2 |chapter=Symbols |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/creationofpatria0000lern/page/199/mode/1up?view=theater |chapter-url-access=registration}}{{page range too broad|date=December 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egypt]] left no philosophical record, but [[Herodotus]] left a record of his shock at the contrast between the roles of Egyptian women and the women of [[Athens]]. He observed that Egyptian women attended market and were employed in [[trade]]. In ancient Egypt, [[Middle class|middle-class]] women were eligible to sit on a local [[tribunal]], engage in [[real estate]] transactions, and inherit or bequeath [[property]]. Women also secured loans, and witnessed legal documents. [[Women in Classical Athens|Athenian women]] were denied such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ptahhotep, trans. John A. Wilson.

[[Hellenization|Greek influence]] spread, however, with the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], who was educated by Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bristow |first=John Temple |title=What Paul Really Said About Women: an Apostle's liberating views on equality in marriage, leadership, and love |location=New York |date=1991 |publisher=HarperOne |isbn=978-0-06-061063-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Western history===
Although many 16th- and 17th-century theorists agreed with Aristotle's views concerning the place of women in society, none of them tried to prove political obligation on the basis of the patriarchal family until sometime after 1680. The patriarchal political theory is closely associated with Sir [[Robert Filmer]]. Sometime before 1653, Filmer completed a work entitled ''[[Patriarcha]]''. However, it was not published until after his death. In it, he defended the [[divine right of kings]] as having title inherited from [[Adam]], the first man of the human species, according to [[Judeo-Christian-Islamic]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gordon |first=Schochet |title=Patriarchy and Paternalism |encyclopedia=Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World |date=2004 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |isbn=978-0-684-31200-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the latter half of the 18th century, clerical sentiments of patriarchy were meeting challenges from intellectual authorities – [[Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' denies inheritance of paternal authority stating, "... reason shows us that mothers have rights and authority equal to those of fathers; for the obligations imposed on children originate equally from the mother and the father, as both are equally responsible for bringing them into the world. Thus the positive laws of God that relate to the obedience of children join the father and the mother without any differentiation; both possess a kind of ascendancy and jurisdiction over their children...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Encyclopedie, Paternal Authority |journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert – Collaborative Translation Project |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.040/--paternal-authority?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=education |access-date=1 April 2015 |date=February 2003 |last1=Louis |first1=Chevalier de Jaucourt (Biography)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, various women began to question the commonly accepted patriarchal interpretation of [[Christian scripture]]. [[Quaker]] [[Sarah Grimké]] voiced skepticism about the ability of men to translate and interpret passages relating to the roles of the sexes without bias. She proposed alternative translations and interpretations of passages relating to women, and she applied historical and cultural criticism to a number of verses, arguing that their admonitions applied to specific historical situations, and were not to be viewed as universal commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durso |first=Pamela R. |title=The Power of Woman: The Life and writings of Sarah Moore Grimké |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQFTJJgK8esC |date=2003 |publisher=Mercer University Press |location=Macon, Ga. |isbn=978-0-86554-876-3 |pages=130–138 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] used Grimké's criticism of biblical sources to establish a basis for feminist thought. She published ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', which proposed a feminist reading of the Old and New Testament. This tendency was enlarged by feminist theory, which denounced the patriarchal Judeo-Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Castro, Ginette |title=American Feminism: a contemporary history |url=https://archive.org/details/americanfeminism00castrich/page/31/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration |publisher=NYU Press |date=1990 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2020, social theorist and theologian [[Elaine Storkey]] retold the stories of thirty biblical women in her book ''Women in a Patriarchal World'' and applied the challenges they faced to women today.

===Asian history===

In ancient [[Japan]], power in society was more evenly distributed, particularly in the religious domain, where [[Shinto]]ism worships the goddess [[Amaterasu]], and ancient writings were replete with references to great priestesses and magicians. However, at the time contemporary with [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in the West, "the emperor of Japan changed Japanese modes of worship", giving supremacy to male deities and suppressing belief in female spiritual power in what feminist scholars in the field of religious studies have called a "patriarchal revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ellwood |first=Robert |date=1986 |title=Patriarchal Revolution in Ancient Japan: Episodes from the "Nihonshoki" Sūjin Chronicle |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25002039 |journal=Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=23–37 |jstor=25002039 |issn=8755-4178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient China, gender roles and patriarchy were shaped by [[Confucianism]]. Adopted as the official religion in the [[Han dynasty]], Confucianism has strong dictates regarding the behavior of women, declaring a woman's place in society, as well as outlining virtuous behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Adler |first=Joseph A. |date=Winter 2006 |title=Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

In China's [[Qing dynasty]], laws governing morality, sexuality, and gender-relations continued to be based on Confucian teachings. Men and women were both subject to strict laws regarding sexual behavior, however men were punished infrequently in comparison to women. Additionally, women's punishment often carried strong [[social stigma]], "rendering [women] unmarriageable", a stigma which did not follow men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruskola |first=Teemu |title=Law, Sexual Morality, and Gender Equality in Qing and Communist China |journal=The Yale Law Journal |volume=103 |issue=8 |year=1994 |pages=2531–2565 |jstor=797055 |doi=10.2307/797055 |url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7574&amp;context=ylj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the [[People's Republic of China]], laws governing morality which were written as egalitarian were selectively enforced favoring men, with insufficient enforcement against [[female infanticide]] in various areas, while infanticide of any form was, by the letter of the law, prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jimmerson |first=Julie |date=Winter 1991 |title=Female Infanticide in China: An Examination of Cultural and Legal Norms |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/80n7k798 |journal=Pacific Basin Law Journal |volume=8 |pages=33 |via=eScholarship.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although patriarchy exists within the scientific atmosphere,{{Clarify|reason=what is the scientific atmosphere?|date=December 2020}} "the periods over which women would have been at a physiological disadvantage in participation in hunting through being at a late stage of pregnancy or early stage of child-rearing would have been short".&lt;ref name="Lewontin 1984" /&gt;{{rp|157}} During the time of the nomads, patriarchy still grew with power. Lewontin and others argue that such biological determinism unjustly limits women. In his study, he states women behave a certain way not because they are biologically inclined to, but rather because they are judged by "how well they conform to the stereotypical local image of femininity".&lt;ref name="Lewontin 1984" /&gt;{{rp|137}}

Feminists{{Who|date=December 2020}} believe that people have gendered biases, which are perpetuated and enforced across generations by those who benefit from them.&lt;ref name="Lewontin 1984" /&gt; For instance, it has historically been claimed that women cannot make rational decisions during their menstrual periods. This claim cloaks the fact that men also have periods of time where they can be aggressive and irrational; furthermore, unrelated effects of aging and similar medical problems are often blamed on menopause, amplifying its reputation.&lt;ref name="Coney 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coney |first=Sandra |title=The menopause industry: how the medical establishment exploits women |publisher=Hunter House |location=Alameda, California |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-89793-161-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/menopauseindustr00cone/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; These biological traits and others specific to women, such as their ability to get pregnant, are often used against them as an attribute of weakness.&lt;ref name="Lewontin 1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney 1994" /&gt;

Sociologist [[Sylvia Walby]] has composed six overlapping structures that define patriarchy and that take different forms in different cultures and different times:&lt;ref name="Walby 1989" /&gt;

# The household: women are more likely to have their labor expropriated by their husbands such as through housework and raising children
# Paid work: women are likely to be paid less and face exclusion from paid work
# The state: women are unlikely to have formal power and representation
# Violence: women are more prone to being abused
# Sexuality: women's sexuality is more likely to be treated negatively
# Culture: representation of women in different cultural contexts

The idea that patriarchy is natural has, however, come under attack from many sociologists, explaining that patriarchy evolved due to historical, rather than biological, conditions. In technologically simple societies, men's greater physical strength and women's common experience of pregnancy combined to sustain patriarchy.&lt;ref name="Lewontin 1984" /&gt; Gradually, technological advances, especially industrial machinery, diminished the primacy of physical strength in everyday life.

'''Patriarchy and Feminism'''

Patriarchy generally falls under two categories, "traditional patriarchy" and "structural patriarchy" (Pierik).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pierek |first=B. T. |title=A History of Patriarchy? |url=https://studenttheses.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A2605417/view |journal=Leiden University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional patriarchy refers to the idea that the father is the head of the household and is at the top of families’ social hierarchies. This patriarchal structure is most apparent in the American representation of a nuclear family; the father works and brings home an income while the mother takes care of the children and the household. This economic power dynamic in the home typically places the desires of the man/father/husband as priority over the desires of the woman/mother/wife. 

Structural patriarchy expands the range of this social hierarchy outside of just the home and family dynamic. The typical influence that men hold in the home is extended to their social and professional positions. Women are often considered the caretakers of the workplace when in a professional setting while men do the labor. This dynamic can be seen in an office setting, with men as sources of income for the business and women in roles as secretaries to care for the workplace. This system leans into the idea that men are typically placed in higher-power positions in society due to the traditional role of a financial provider, and women fall into caretaker roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=Mayank |last2=Madabushi |first2=Jayakrishna S. |last3=Gupta |first3=Nihit |last4=Gupta |first4=Mayank |last5=Madabushi |first5=Jayakrishna S. |last6=Gupta |first6=Nihit |date=2023-06-10 |title=Critical Overview of Patriarchy, Its Interferences With Psychological Development, and Risks for Mental Health |journal=Cureus |language=en |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=e40216 |doi=10.7759/cureus.40216 |doi-access=free |issn=2168-8184 |pmc=10332384 |pmid=37435274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Development of Feminism'''

The extended presence of patriarchal structures has led to the establishment of feministic ideals over centuries (Brunell).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2024-09-17 |title=Feminism {{!}} Definition, History, Types, Waves, Examples, &amp; Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/feminism |access-date=2024-10-25 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several prominent fronts led to and continue to push the development of feminism; including paid and unpaid labor and expectations of gender roles(Thompson).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2017-01-10 |title=Sylvia Walby: Six Structures of Patriarchy - ReviseSociology |url=https://revisesociology.com/2017/01/10/patriarchy-structure-walby-sylvia/#google_vignet |access-date=2024-10-25 |website=revisesociology.com |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are traditionally viewed as the breadwinners in a patriarchal society, and women are seen as homemakers. Formal job occupations outside of the home, traditionally carried out by men in a patriarchal society, are paid labor. Any work done inside of the home without financial compensation, traditionally carried out by women in patriarchal societies, is unpaid labor. Until 1974, women were not allowed to have their bank accounts, which pushed the financial divide further and placed men in higher economic positions. (Adam)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=When Could Women Open A Bank Account? – Forbes Advisor |url=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/when-could-women-open-a-bank-account/ |access-date=2024-10-25 |website=www.forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uneven financial compensation between these levels of labor is one of the factors that pushed feministic ideals forward. 

'''The Role of Patriarchy in Feminism'''

With men being expected to bring home an income to support a family and the entire household, the strain of the increasing cost of living makes that ideal impractical. Because of this economic strain, many households rely on multiple incomes from both men and women. When women would traditionally be expected to stay home and provide childcare, they now have to seek it out elsewhere to provide for the family, which in turn drives up the cost of living further. With this reliance on further income and sourcing traditionally female childcare roles outside of the home, patriarchal norms start to become less relevant. This breakdown of traditional roles leads to the natural decrease of a gender-specific social structure.

'''Feminist Ideologies'''

Feminism is not a direct opposition to patriarchy, it is a theory in response to patriarchy. Feminism focuses on the empowerment of women in society and the dismissal of traditional gender roles that are oppressive. Traditional female roles in the household are largely abandoned, and equal opportunity for women is the largest ideal that feminism stands with. Feminist theories believe that financial and social opportunities should be equally available for all. 

This social division of gender roles as caretakers and providers is broken down to better allow women to participate outside of caring for a home and children. Financial opportunity refers to employment pursuits, access to one's own finances, and wage equality for job positions that are available for both men and women. The wage gap issues and traditional roles as unpaid laborers for the family significantly drive the growth of feminism in modern social settings. Which in turn shuts down patriarchal structures.

===Feminist theory===
[[File:Fight Patriarchy graffiti in Turin.jpg|thumb|"FIGHT PATRIARCHY" – a graffito in [[Turin]]]]

Feminist theorists have written extensively about patriarchy either as a primary cause of women's oppression, or as part of an interactive system. [[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of [[oppression]] of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression.&lt;ref name="Lerner p8" /&gt; Feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]] believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy.&lt;ref name="Lerner p238"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lerner |first=Gerda |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |date=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-503996-2 |location=New York |series=Women and History, Volume 1 |pages=238–239 |quote=In its narrow meaning, patriarchy refers to the system, historically derived from Greek and Roman law, in which the male head of the household had absolute legal and economic power over his dependent female and male family members. [...] Patriarchy in its wider definition means the manifestation and institutionalization of male dominance over women and children in the family and the extension of male dominance over women in society in general. |url=https://archive.org/details/creationofpatria00lern/page/238/mode/1up?ref=ol&amp;view=theater |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alison Jaggar]] also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.

Interactive systems theorists [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Heidi Hartmann]] believe that patriarchy and [[capitalism]] interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other [[Socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] use the terms ''patriarchal capitalism'' or ''capitalist patriarchy'' to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Tong 2017"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction |last1=Tong |first1=Rosemarie |last2=Botts |first2=Tina Fernandes |date=2017 |isbn=978-0-8133-5070-7 |edition=Fifth |location=New York |oclc=979993556}}{{page needed|date=December 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hartmann, the term ''patriarchy'' redirects the focus of oppression from the [[Division of labour|labour division]] to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a [[gender]]. In its being both systematic and universal, therefore, the concept of patriarchy represents an adaptation of the Marxist concept of class and [[Class conflict|class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartmann |first1=Heidi |title=The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism |journal=Capital and Class |volume=8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lindsey German]] represents an outlier in this regard. German argued for a need to redefine the origins and sources of the patriarchy, describing the mainstream theories as providing "little understanding of how women's oppression and the nature of the family have changed historically. Nor is there much notion of how widely differing that oppression is from class to class."&lt;ref name="German 1981"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/german/1981/xx/patriarchy.htm |title=Lindsey German: Theories of Patriarchy (Spring 1981) |website=www.marxists.org |access-date=2020-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the patriarchy is not the result of men's oppression of women or sexism per se, with men not even identified as the main beneficiaries of such a system, but [[Capital (economics)|capital]] itself. As such, female liberation needs to begin "with an assessment of the material position of women in capitalist society."&lt;ref name="German 1981" /&gt; In that, German differs from Young or Hartmann by rejecting the notion ("eternal truth") that the patriarchy is at the root of female oppression.&lt;ref name="German 1981" /&gt;

[[Audre Lorde]], an African American feminist writer and theorist, believed that [[racism]] and patriarchy were intertwined systems of oppression.&lt;ref name="Tong 2017" /&gt; [[Sara Ruddick]], a philosopher who wrote about "good mothers" in the context of maternal ethics, describes the dilemma facing contemporary mothers who must train their children within a patriarchal system. She asks whether a "good mother" trains her son to be competitive, individualistic, and comfortable within the hierarchies of patriarchy, knowing that he may likely be economically successful but a mean person, or whether she resists patriarchal ideologies and [[Socialization|socializes]] her son to be cooperative and communal but economically unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Lerner p8" /&gt;

Lerner, in her 1986 book ''The Creation of Patriarchy'', makes a series of arguments about the origins and reproduction of patriarchy as a system of oppression of women, and concludes that patriarchy is [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] and seen as natural and invisible.&lt;ref name="Lerner p238" /&gt;

Some feminist theorists believe that patriarchy is an unjust [[social system]] that is harmful to both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David A. J. Richards |title=Resisting Injustice and the Feminist Ethics of Care in the Age of Obama: "Suddenly ...

Jaggar, Young, and Hartmann are among the feminist theorists who argue that the system of patriarchy should be completely overturned, especially the [[Heteropatriarchy|heteropatriarchal]] family, which they see as a necessary component of female oppression. The family not only serves as a representative of the greater civilization by pushing its own affiliates to change and obey, but performs as a component in the rule of the patriarchal state that rules its inhabitants with the head of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org |title=Violence against Women and Media: Advancements and Challenges of a Research and Political Agenda |last=Montiel |first=Aimée Vega |date=8 October 2014 |publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many feminists (especially scholars and activists) have called for culture repositioning as a method for deconstructing patriarchy. Culture repositioning relates to [[culture change]]. It involves the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chigbu |first=Uchendu Eugene |title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community |journal=Community, Work &amp; Family |date=2015 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=334–350 |doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506 |s2cid=144448501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the widespread use of the term ''patriarchy'', early feminists used ''[[Chauvinism#Male chauvinism|male chauvinism]]'' and ''sexism'' to refer roughly to the same phenomenon.&lt;ref name="hooks p17"&gt;{{cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |author-link=bell hooks |chapter=Understanding patriarchy |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G28LTQltyVAC&amp;pg=PA17 |title=The will to change: men, masculinity, and love |publisher=Washington Square Press |date=2004 |pages=17–25 |isbn=978-0-7434-8033-8 |quote=Patriarchy is a political-social system that insists that males are inherently dominating, superior to everything and everyone deemed weak, especially females, and endowed with the right to dominate and rule over the weak and to maintain that dominance through various forms of psychological terrorism and violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[bell hooks]] argues that the new term identifies the ideological system itself (that men claim dominance and superiority to women) that can be believed and acted upon by either men or women, whereas the earlier terms imply only men act as oppressors of women.&lt;ref name="hooks p17" /&gt;

Sociologist [[Joan Acker]], analyzing the concept of patriarchy and the role that it has played in the development of feminist thought, says that seeing patriarchy as a "universal, trans-historical and trans-cultural phenomenon" where "women were everywhere oppressed by men in more or less the same ways […] tended toward a biological essentialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acker |first1=Joan |title=The Problem with Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1989 |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=235 |doi=10.1177/0038038589023002005 |s2cid=143683720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Pollert has described use of the term patriarchy as circular and conflating description and explanation. She remarks the discourse on patriarchy creates a "theoretical impasse ... imposing a structural label on what it is supposed to explain" and therefore impoverishes the possibility of explaining [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pollert |first1=Anna |title=Gender and Class Revisited, or the Poverty of 'Patriarchy' |journal=Sociology |date=1996 |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=235 |doi=10.1177/0038038596030004002 |s2cid=145758809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also considerable variation in the role that gender plays in human societies, and there is no academic consensus on to what extent [[Biological determinism|biology determines]] human social structure.  The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' states that "...many cultures bestow power preferentially on one sex or the other...."&lt;ref name="Britannica 2018"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Matriarchy |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |date=2018 |access-date=23 June 2018 |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/matriarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anthropologists, such as Floriana Ciccodicola, have argued that patriarchy is a [[cultural universal]],&lt;ref name="Ciccodicola 2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ciccodicola |first=Floriana |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq9QSx4CQLAC&amp;pg=PA160 |title=Practicing anthropology in development processes: new perspectives for a radical anthropology |date=2012 |publisher=Edizioni Nuova Cultura |isbn=978-88-6134-791-5 |location=Roma |page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the masculinities scholar [[David Buchbinder]] suggests that [[Roland Barthes]]' description of the term ''[[ex-nomination]],'' i.e. patriarchy as the 'norm' or common sense, is relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchbinder |first=David |title=Studying men and masculinities |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-415-57829-5 |location=Abingdon, Oxon, UK; New York, N.Y. |pages=106–107 |chapter=Troubling patriarchy |author-link=David Buchbinder |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmfUzE4WnW8C&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=How is it relevant?|date=December 2020}}  However, there do exist cultures that some anthropologists have described as matriarchal.  Among the [[Mosuo]] (a tiny society in [[Yunnan|Yunnan Province]], China), for example, women exert greater power, authority, and control over decision-making.&lt;ref name="Macionis 2012" /&gt; Other societies are [[matrilinear]] or [[matrilocal]], primarily among [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous tribal groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schlegel |first=Alice |title=Male dominance and female autonomy: domestic authority in matrilineal societies |date=1972 |publisher=HRAF Press |isbn=978-0-87536-328-8 |location=New Haven, Connecticut}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[hunter-gatherer]] groups, such as the [[!Kung]] of southern Africa,{{r|Lockard p88}} have been characterized as largely [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].&lt;ref name="Erdal 1996" /&gt;

Some proponents{{Who|date=December 2020}} of the [[Biological determinism|biological determinist]] understanding of patriarchy argue that because of human female biology, women are more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this basis, "the existence of a [[Sexual division of labour|sexual division of labor]] in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological."&lt;ref name="Lewontin 1984"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The determined patriarchy |chapter-url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10348941 |last1=Lewontin |first1=Richard C. |last2=Rose |first2=Steven |last3=Kamin |first3=Leon J. |author-link1=Richard Lewontin |title=Not in our genes: biology, ideology, and human nature |pages=132–163 |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |date=1984 |isbn=978-0-14-022605-8 |oclc=10348941}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|157}}{{Verify source|date=December 2020}} Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent "sexual division".&lt;ref name="Lewontin 1984" /&gt;{{Verify source|date=December 2020}}

=== Evolutionary biology ===
An early theory in [[evolutionary biology]], sometimes referred to as [[Bateman's principle]], argues that females almost always invest more energy into producing offspring than males, and therefore, females are a [[limiting factor]] over which males of most species will compete. This idea suggests that females prefer males who control more resources that can help her and her offspring, which in turn causes an [[evolutionary pressure]] on males to be competitive with each other in order to gain resources and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Buss |first1=David Michael |last2=Schmitt |first2=David P. |date=May 2011 |title=Evolutionary psychology and feminism |journal=[[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] |volume=64 |issue=9–10 |pages=768–787 |doi=10.1007/s11199-011-9987-3 |s2cid=7878675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociobiologist [[Steven Goldberg]] argues that social behavior is primarily determined by [[genetics]], and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than [[social conditioning]]. Goldberg contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of [[Culture|human culture]]. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, "The ethnographic studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all."&lt;ref name="Goldberg 1974"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberg |first=Steven |title=The inevitability of patriarchy |date=1974 |publisher=W. Morrow |isbn=978-0-688-05175-4 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg has critics among anthropologists. Concerning Goldberg's claims about the "feelings of both men and women", [[Eleanor Leacock]] countered in 1974 that the data on women's attitudes are "sparse and contradictory", and that the data on male attitudes about male–female relations are "ambiguous". Also, the effects of [[colonialism]] on the cultures represented in the studies were not considered.&lt;ref name="Leacock 1974"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leacock |first=Eleanor |author-link=Eleanor Leacock |date=June 1974 |title=Reviewed Work: ''The Inevitability of Patriarchy'' by Steven Goldberg |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=363–365 |doi=10.1525/aa.1974.76.2.02a00280 |jstor=674209 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist and psychologist [[Barbara Smuts]] argues that patriarchy evolved in humans through conflict between the respective reproductive interests of males and females. She lists six ways it may have emerged:&lt;ref name="Smuts 1995" /&gt;{{Further explanation needed|reason=|date=December 2020}}

# a reduction in female allies
# elaboration of male-male alliances
# increased male control over resources
# increased hierarchy formation among men
# female strategies that reinforce male control over females

==Psychoanalytic theories==
While the term ''patriarchy'' often refers to male domination generally, another interpretation sees it as literally "rule of the father".&lt;ref name="Mitchell 1974"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Juliet |author-link=Juliet Mitchell |chapter=The cultural revolution |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwG0AAAAIAAJ |title=Psychoanalysis and feminism |page=409 |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |date=1974 |isbn=978-0-394-47472-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; So some people{{Who|date=September 2018}} believe patriarchy does not refer simply to male power over women, but the expression of power dependent on age as well as gender, such as by older men over women, children, and younger men. Some of these younger men may inherit and therefore have a stake in continuing these conventions. Others may rebel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eherenreich |first=Barbara |chapter=Life without father |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4_zeRtk81pcC |editor-last1=McDowell |editor-first1=Linda |editor-last2=Pringle |editor-first2=Rosemary |title=Defining women: Social institutions and gender divisions |publisher=Polity/Open University |location=London |date=1992 |isbn=978-0-7456-0979-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/definingwomensoc0000unse/mode/1up?view=theater}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cockburn |first=Cynthia |title=Brothers: male dominance and technological change |publisher=Pluto |location=London Concord, Massachusetts |date=1991 |isbn=978-0-7453-0583-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=September 2018}}

Arguing from this standpoint, radical feminist [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote in her 1970 ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marx was on to something more profound than he knew when he observed that the family contained within itself in embryo all the antagonisms that later develop on a wide scale within the society and the state. For unless revolution uproots the basic social organisation, the biological family – the vinculum through which the psychology of power can always be smuggled – the tapeworm of exploitation will never be annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Firestone |first=Shulamith |author-link=Shulamith Firestone |title=The dialectic of sex: the case for feminist revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/dialecticofsexca0000fire/mode/1up?view=theater |url-access=registration |publisher=Quill |location=New York |date=1970 |isbn=978-0-688-12359-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Gender Inequality today ==

Additionally, most perpetrators are male, which some view as reinforcing traditional power structures associated with patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sima Bahouse, the Executive director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, emphasized the urgent need to eliminate poverty for women and girls, advocating for inclusive fiscal policies that promote equitable redistribution and progressive taxation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Key priorities include enhancing public services and creating gender-responsive social protection systems that specifically benefit women and girls in poverty. Investing in the care economy is highlighted as essential for alleviating their poverty and fostering sustainable economic growth. The speaker rejected excuses about the difficulty or cost of these initiatives, asserting that a fair and sustainable future for all women and girls is achievable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Impact of Patriarchy on Mental Health ==
The patriarchal framework of gender norms has established specific behavioral expectations for individuals according to their biological sex. Some individuals may not desire to adhere to the strict "acceptable behaviors" or gender boundaries set by society, which could be traumatic for some. These individuals are excluded and faced with alienation, making them more vulnerable to sexual violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, LGBTQ+ members frequently fall victim to sexual abuse and harassment. Consequently, a patriarchal society creates an inherently unsafe and harmful environment for non-conforming women and those who do not adhere to rigid societal norms of gender and sexuality. While this power disparity is often perceived as primarily benefiting men, it also poses hidden risks to their psychological well-being.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

With social media being very present today, individuals are increasingly susceptible to the negative impacts of patriarchy on their mental health. The internet has facilitated the spread of gender-based discrimination, reinforced patriarchal norms, and propagated negative representations of women. Research has shown that "social media use may be linked to adverse mental health effects, such as suicidal thoughts, feelings of loneliness, and reduced empathy".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, social media platforms often feature curated images that promote unrealistic body standards or lifestyles, leading to feelings of comparison, jealousy, and anxiety among users.
