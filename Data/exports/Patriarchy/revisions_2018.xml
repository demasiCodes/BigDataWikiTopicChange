'''Patriarchy''' is a [[social system]] in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], [[social privilege]] and control of property. Some patriarchal societies are also [[patrilineal]], meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.

Patriarchy is associated with a set of ideas, a patriarchal [[ideology]] that acts to explain and justify this dominance and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women. Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that [[gender role]]s in a society affect power differentials between men and women.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henslin"/&gt;

Historically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher= Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=0-02-865960-0}}{{Page needed |date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions |volume=1 |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=9780547047669 |location= |pages=111–114 |quote="Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|first1=Carole|last1=Pateman|title=Sexual Contract|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|year=2016|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the term ''patriarchy'' was used to refer to [[autocratic]] rule by the male head of a family.

[[Marxist]] theory, as articulated mainly by [[Friedrich Engels]], assigns the origin of patriarchy to the emergence of [[private property]], which has traditionally been controlled by men. In this view, men directed household production and sought to control women in order to ensure the passing of family property to their own (male) offspring, while women were limited to household labor and producing children.{{refn|name=Cannell &amp; Green}}{{refn|name=Gardiner}}&lt;ref name="Bryson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryson |first=Valerie |editor1=Kramarae, Cheris |editor2=Spender, Dale |title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge, Volume 2 |date=2000 |location=New York; Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0-41-5-92088-9 |page=791 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/Routledge_International_Encyclopedia_of.html?id=QAOUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT850&amp;dq=patriarchy |chapter=Feminism: Marxist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner disputes this idea, arguing that patriarchy emerged before the development of class-based society and the concept of private property.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13323175|title=The creation of patriarchy|last=1920-2013.|first=Lerner, Gerda,|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195039963|location=New York|oclc=13323175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] argues that waves of [[kurgan hypothesis|kurgan]]-building invaders from the Ukrainian steppes into the early agricultural cultures of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]] in the Aegean, the Balkans and southern Italy instituted male hierarchies that led to the rise of patriarchy in [[Western society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gimbutas |first=Marija | chapter = The end of Old Europe: the intrusion of Steppe Pastoralists from South Russia and the transformation of Europe | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ktftAAAAMAAJ |title=The Civilization of the Goddess: The World of Old Europe | pages = 351&amp;ndash;510 |publisher=Harper Collins | location = San Francisco, California |year=1992 |isbn=978-0062503374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Taylor argues that the rise of patriarchal domination was associated with the appearance of socially stratified hierarchical polities, institutionalised violence and the separated individuated ego associated with a period of climatic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Steven | chapter = What's wrong with human beings? | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mSPtBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12 |title=The Fall: The Insanity of the Ego in Human History | pages = 17&amp;ndash;19 | publisher = O Books | location = Winchester | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1905047208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeological findings on kurgans belonging to both [[Yamnaya]] and [[Scythians]] demonstrate an abundance of women warriors,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, David W.

===Ancient history===
A prominent Greek general [[Meno (general)|Meno]], in the Platonic dialogue of the same name, sums up the prevailing sentiment in [[Classical Greece]] about the respective virtues of men and women. He says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=W.R.M. Lamb, |title=Plato in Twelve Volumes |volume=3 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1967 |chapter=71E: Meno |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text=Meno:section=71e |accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband. | Meno | Plato in Twelve Volumes}}

The works of [[Aristotle]] portrayed women as morally, intellectually, and physically inferior to men; saw women as the property of men; claimed that women's role in society was to reproduce and to serve men in the household; and saw male domination of women as natural and virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fishbein, Harold D.|title=Peer prejudice and discrimination: the origins of prejudice|edition= 2nd|publisher=Psychology Press|date=2002|isbn=978-0-8058-3772-8|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBwAYLFPP3sC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dubber, Markus Dirk|title=The police power: patriarchy and the foundations of American government|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13207-7|pages=5–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjdbRF8PXhUC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bar On, Bat-Ami|title=Engendering origins: critical feminist readings in Plato and Aristotle|publisher=SUNY Press|date=1994|isbn=978-0-7914-1643-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UVq3z2Kd6cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerda Lerner]], author of ''The Creation of Patriarchy,'' states that Aristotle believed that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle believed to be perfect and superior. Maryanne Cline Horowitz stated that Aristotle believed that "soul contributes the form and model of creation". This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must be caused by a woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about when they grow up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.&lt;ref name="Lerner1986"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lerner, |first=Gerda |date=1986 |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Chapter 10: Symbols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egypt]] left no philosophical record, but [[Herodotus]] left a record of his shock at the contrast between the roles of Egyptian women and the women of Athens. He observed that Egyptian women attended market and were employed in [[trade]]. In ancient Egypt, middle-class women were eligible to sit on a local [[tribunal]], engage in [[real estate]] transactions, and inherit or bequeath [[property]]. Women also secured loans, and witnessed legal documents. Athenian women were denied such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ptahhotep, trans. John A. Wilson.

During this time period in China, gender roles and patriarchy remained shaped by Confucianism. Adopted as the official religion in the [[Han dynasty]], Confucianism has strong dictates regarding the behavior of women, declaring a woman's place in society, as well as outlining virtuous behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Joseph A.|date=Winter 2006|title=Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

===Modern history===
Although many 16th and 17th century theorists agreed with Aristotle's views concerning the place of women in society, none of them tried to prove political obligation on the basis of the patriarchal family until sometime after 1680. The patriarchal political theory is closely associated with Sir [[Robert Filmer]]. Sometime before 1653, Filmer completed a work entitled ''Patriarcha''. However, it was not published until after his death. In it, he defended the divine right of kings as having title inherited from [[Adam]], the first man of the human species, according to [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Gordon|first=Schochet|title=Patriarchy and Paternalism|encyclopedia=Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World|date=2004|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=068431200X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the latter half of the 18th century, clerical sentiments of patriarchy were meeting challenges from intellectual authorities – [[Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopedia]] denies inheritance of paternal authority stating, "... reason shows us that mothers have rights and authority equal to those of fathers; for the obligations imposed on children originate equally from the mother and the father, as both are equally responsible for bringing them into the world. Thus the positive laws of God that relate to the obedience of children join the father and the mother without any differentiation; both possess a kind of ascendancy and jurisdiction over their children...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedie, Paternal Authority|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.040/--paternal-authority?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=education|publisher=Digital Library Platform &amp; Services (DLPS), University of Michigan |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, various women began to question the commonly accepted patriarchal interpretation of Christian scripture. One of the foremost of these was [[Sarah Grimké]], who voiced skepticism about the ability of men to translate and interpret passages relating to the roles of the sexes without bias. She proposed alternative translations and interpretations of passages relating to women, and she applied historical and cultural criticism to a number of verses, arguing that their admonitions applied to specific historical situations, and were not to be viewed as universal commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durso|first=Pamela R.|title=The Power of Woman: The Life and writings of Sarah Moore Grimké|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQFTJJgK8esC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2003|publisher=Mercer University Press|location=Macon, Ga.|isbn=978-0-86554-876-3|pages=130–138|edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] used Grimké's criticism of biblical sources to establish a basis for feminist thought. She published ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', which proposed a feminist reading of the Old and New Testament.

In China's [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]], laws governing morality, sexuality, and gender-relations continued to be based on Confucian teachings. Men and women were both subject to strict laws regarding sexual behavior, however men were punished infrequently in comparison to women. Additionally, women's punishment often carried strong social stigma, "rendering [women] unmarriageable," a stigma which did not follow men.&lt;ref&gt;Ruskola, Teemu. “Law, Sexual Morality, and Gender Equality in Qing and Communist China.” ''The Yale Law Journal'', vol. 103, no. 8, 1994, pp. 2531–2565.

In the modern era, the concept of Patriarchy is asserted to manifest itself in [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]] control, rather than simply being about an individual's sexism.

==Feminist theory==
Feminist theorists have written extensively about patriarchy either as a primary cause of women's oppression, or as part of an interactive system. [[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of oppression of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]] believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Alison Jaggar]] also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.

Interactive systems theorists [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Heidi Hartmann]] believe that patriarchy and capitalism interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other [[Socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] use the terms ''patriarchal capitalism'' or ''capitalist patriarchy'' to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Tong"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction|last=Rosemarie|first=Tong|publisher=|others=Botts, Tina Fernandes|date=2017-07-18|isbn=9780813350707|edition= Fifth |location=New York|pages=|oclc=979993556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Hartmann, the term patriarchy redirects the focus of oppression from the labour division to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a gender. In its being both systematic and universal, therefore, the concept of patriarchy represents an adaptation of the Marxist concept of class and class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartmann |first1=Heidi |title=The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism |journal=Capital and Class |volume=8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Audre Lorde]], an African American feminist writer and theorist, believed that [[racism]] and patriarchy were intertwined systems of oppression.&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; [[Sara Ruddick]], a philosopher who wrote about "good mothers" in the context of maternal ethics, describes the dilemma facing contemporary mothers who must train their children within a patriarchal system. Does a "good mother," she asks, train her son to be competitive, individualistic, and comfortable within the hierarchies of patriarchy, knowing that he may likely be economically successful but a mean person? Or does a good mother resist patriarchal ideologies and socialize her son to be cooperative and communal but economically unsuccessful?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gerda Lerner]], in her 1986 ''The Creation of Patriarchy'', makes a series of arguments about the origins and reproduction of patriarchy as a system of oppression of women, and concludes that patriarchy is socially constructed and seen as natural and invisible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some feminist theorists believe that patriarchy is an unjust social system that is harmful to both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A. J.

Because patriarchy is a social construction, it can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tickner, Ann J.|chapter=Patriarchy|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries P-Z|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=2001|isbn=978-0-415-24352-0|pages=1197–1198|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaggar, Young, and Hartmann are among the feminist theorists who argue that the system of patriarchy should be completely overturned, especially the [[Heteropatriarchy|heteropatriarchal]] family, which they see as a necessary component of female oppression. The family not only serves as a representative of the greater civilization by pushing its own affiliates to change and obey, but performs as a component in the rule of the patriarchal state that rules its inhabitants with the head of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org|title=Violence against Women and Media: Advancements and Challenges of a Research and Political Agenda|last=Montiel|first=Aimée Vega|date=8 October 2014|publisher=UNESCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many feminists (especially scholars and activists) have called for culture repositioning as a method for deconstructing patriarchy. Culture repositioning relates to [[culture change]]. It involves the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chigbu|first=Uchendu Eugene|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|date=2015|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the widespread use of the term ''patriarchy'', early feminists used ''male [[chauvinism]]'' and ''sexism'' to refer roughly to the same phenomenon.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25"&gt;{{cite book|last=hooks | first = bell|chapter=Understanding patriarchy|chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G28LTQltyVAC&amp;pg=PA17|title=The will to change: men, masculinity, and love|publisher=Washington Square Press|date=2004|pages=17–25|isbn=9780743480338|quote=Patriarchy is a political-social system that insists that males are inherently dominating, superior to everything and everyone deemed weak, especially females, and endowed with the right to dominate and rule over the weak and to maintain that dominance through various forms of psychological terrorism and violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[bell hooks]] argues that the new term identifies the ideological system itself (that men claim dominance and superiority to women) that can be believed and acted upon by either men or women, whereas the earlier terms imply only men act as oppressors of women.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25" /&gt;

Sociologist Joan Acker, analyzing the concept of patriarchy and the role that it has played in the development of feminist thought, says that seeing  patriarchy as a universal, trans-historical and trans-cultural phenomenon where "women were everywhere oppressed by men in more or less the same ways […] tended toward a biological essentialism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acker |first1=John |title=The Problem with Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1989 |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Pollart has described attempts the use of patriarchy as circular and conflating description and explanation. She remarks the discourse on patriarchy creates a ‘theoretical impasse […] imposing a structural label on what it is supposed to explain’ and therefore impoverishes the possibility to explain gender inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pollart |first1=Anne |title=Gender and Class Revisited, or the Poverty of Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1996 |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological versus social theories==
{{Main|Sex differences in humans|Social construction of gender difference}}

As a common standard of differentiation between sexes, advocates for a patriarchal society like to focus on the influences that hormones have over biological systems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Hormones have been declared as the "key to the sexual universe" because they are present in all animals and are the driving force in two critical developmental stages: sex-determinism in the fetus, and puberty in the teenage individual.&lt;ref name=Lewontin&gt;{{cite book | chapter = The determined patriarchy | chapterurl = https://athens.indymedia.org/media/upload/2016/09/06/Steven_Rose_Richard_Lewontin_Leon_J._Kamin-Not_In_Our_Genes__Biology_Ideology_and_Human_Nature__-Penguin_Books_Ltd_1990.pdf | last1 = Lewontin | first1 = Richard C. | last2 = Rose | first2 = Steven | last3 = Kamin | first3 = Leon J. | author-link1 = Richard Lewontin | title = Not in our genes: biology, ideology, and human nature | pages = 132&amp;ndash;163 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | date = 1984 | isbn = 9780140226058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing a critical role in the development of the brain and behavior, testosterone and estrogen have been labeled the "male-hormone" and "female-hormone" respectively as a result of the impact they have when masculinizing or feminizing an individual.

Sociologists tend to reject predominantly biological explanations of patriarchy&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Macionis, John J. (2012). ''Sociology'' (13th ed.). Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0205181090}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contend that socialization processes are primarily responsible for establishing [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name="Henslin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of Sociology|first=James M.|last=Henslin|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=2001|pages=65–67, 240|isbn=9780536941855}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to standard sociological theory, patriarchy is the result of sociological constructions that are passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="Sanderson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Evolution of Human Sociality|last=Sanderson|first=Stephen K.|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847695348|location=Lanham, Maryland|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constructions are most pronounced in societies with traditional cultures and less economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociology: A Global Introduction|first1=John J.|last1=Macionis|last2=Plummer |first2 = Ken |publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Harlow|date=2000|page=347|isbn= 9780130407375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in modern, developed societies, however, gender messages conveyed by family, mass media, and other institutions largely favor males having a dominant status.&lt;ref name="Henslin"/&gt;

Biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] asserts that patriarchy persists through social and political reasons, rather than purely biological causes. Opponents of [[gender feminism]], such as [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], have argued that patriarchy has its origin in biological factors.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;{{cite book |author=Sommers, Christina Hoff |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers |title=Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women |date=1995 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-80156-8 |page=320|title-link=Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Undue weight inline|Independent source preferred|date=September 2018}}

This is called [[biological determinism]], which looks at humanity from a strictly biological point of view. Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male [[testosterone]] hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour; which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.

A hypothetical patriarchal culture based primarily on a hormonally-driven increased rate of male successes, thus require a certain critical level of societal evolution{{clarify|date=May 2016}} before it could evolve. Other proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this simple basis, "the existence of a sexual division of labor in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological."&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|157}} Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent "sexual division".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;

Although patriarchy exists within the scientific atmosphere, "the periods over which women would have been at a physiological disadvantage in participation in hunting through being at a late stage of pregnancy or early stage of child-rearing would have been short",&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|157}} during the time of the nomads, patriarchy still grew with power. Lewontin and others argue that such biological determinism unjustly limits women. In his study, he states women behave a certain way not because they are biologically inclined to, but rather because they are judged by "how well they conform to the stereotypical local image of femininity".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|137}}

Feminists believe that people have gendered biases, which are perpetuated and enforced across generations by those who benefit from them.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; For instance, it has historically been claimed that women cannot make rational decisions during their menstrual periods. This claim cloaks the fact that men also have periods of time where they can be aggressive and irrational; furthermore, unrelated effects of aging and similar medical problems are often blamed on menopause, amplifying its reputation.&lt;ref name=Coney&gt;{{cite book | last = Coney | first = Sandra | title = The menopause industry: how the medical establishment exploits women | publisher = Hunter House | location = Alameda, California | date = 1994 | isbn = 9780897931618 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These biological traits and others specific to women, such as their ability to get pregnant, are often used against them as an attribute of weakness.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney" /&gt;

A growing body of research has found key points of the biological argument to be groundless. For example, it was asserted for over a century that women were not as intellectually competent as men because they have slightly smaller brains on average.&lt;ref name="Gould1980"&gt;{{cite book |last= Gould | first= Stephen |title= The panda's thumb: more reflections in natural history |pages= 152–159 |publisher= Norton |location = New York |date= 1992 |origyear= 1980 |isbn= 978-0393340839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no substantiated significant difference in average intelligence has been found between the sexes. On the other hand, men have a greater variability in intelligence, and except in tests of reading comprehension, in tests of perceptual speed and associative memory, males typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring individuals.&lt;ref name="Hedges and Nowell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedges | first1 = Larry V. | last2 = Nowell | first2 = Amy | title = Sex differences in mental test scores, variability, and numbers of high-scoring individuals | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 269 | issue = 5220 | pages = 41&amp;ndash;45 | doi = 10.1126/science.7604277 | pmid = 7604277 | jstor = 2889145 | date = 7 July 1995 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, no discrepancy in intelligence is assumed between men of different heights, even though on average taller men have been found to have slightly larger brains.&lt;ref name="Gould1980"/&gt; Feminists assert that although women may excel in certain areas and men in others, women are just as competent as men.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; Therefore, through the growing power of the patriarchal system, a gender bias is created in the work force, leading to a situation in which "men are more likely to be cabinet ministers or parliamentarians, business executives or tycoons, Nobel Prize-winning scientists or fellows of academies, doctors or airline pilots. [As for] [w]omen [they] are more likely to be secretaries, laboratory technicians, office cleaners, nurses, airline stewardesses, primary school teachers, or social workers."&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|132}}

Within the structure of a patriarchal society, patriarchal biases and values are more likely to be promoted in the educational system. Particularly in mathematical and scientific fields, boys are presumed to have more keen spatial abilities than girls, whereas girls are supposed to assume better linguistic skills. These stereotypical manifestations within educational institutions contract with the notions of differently gendered brains and a "relationship between intelligence and brain size".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|143}} However, there is "no correlation between skull capacity and hence brain weight and 'intellectual power'",&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|143}} yet there is still a constant struggle of gender bias in science.

Sociologist [[Sylvia Walby]] has composed six overlapping structures that define patriarchy and that take different forms in different cultures and different times:
# The state: women are unlikely to have formal power and representation
# The household: women are more likely to do the housework and raise the children
# Violence: women are more prone to being abused
# Paid work: women are likely to be paid less
# Sexuality: women's sexuality is more likely to be treated negatively
# Culture: representation of women in media, and popular culture is "within a patriarchal gaze".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Walby | first = Sylvia | title = Theorizing patriarchy |page=20 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Oxford, UK Cambridge, Massachusetts | date = 1990 | isbn = 9780631147688 }}

Some [[sociobiologist]]s, such as [[Steven Goldberg]], argue that social behavior is primarily determined by [[genetics]], and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than social conditioning. Goldberg also contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of human culture. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, "The ethnographic studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all."&lt;ref name="Goldberg, Steven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldberg | first = Steven | title = The inevitability of patriarchy | publisher = W. Morrow | location = New York | date = 1974 | isbn = 9780688051754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg has critics among anthropologists. Concerning Goldberg's claims about the "feelings of both men and women", [[Eleanor Leacock]] countered in 1974 that the data on women's attitudes are "sparse and contradictory", and that the data on male attitudes about male–female relations are "ambiguous". Also, the effects of colonialism on the cultures represented in the studies were not considered.&lt;ref name="Leacock, Eleanor"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Leacock | first = Eleanor | author-link = Eleanor Leacock | title = Reviewed Work: ''The Inevitability of Patriarchy'' by Steven Goldberg | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 363&amp;ndash;365 | doi = 10.1525/aa.1974.76.2.02a00280 | jstor = 674209 | date = June 1974 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] offered an explanation for the origin of patriarchy which starts with the view that females almost always invest more energy into producing offspring than males, and therefore in most [[species]] females are a [[limiting factor]] over which males will compete. This is sometimes referred to as [[Bateman's principle]]. It suggests females place the most important preference on males who control more resources that can help her and her offspring, which in turn causes an [[evolutionary pressure]] on males to be competitive with each other in order to gain resources and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = David Michael | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = David P. | title = Evolutionary psychology and feminism | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 64 | issue = 9&amp;ndash;10 | pages = 768&amp;ndash;787 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-011-9987-3 | date = May 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bateman's principle is controversial and has been challenged by several studies on species ranging from [[albatrosses]] to [[lions]], suggesting that female individuals are either not particularly disadvantaged in terms of reproductive investment or find means of circumventing such disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;Tang-Martinez, Zuleyma (20 January 2017).

The idea that patriarchy is natural has, however, come under attack from many sociologists, explaining that patriarchy evolved due to historical, rather than biological, conditions. In technologically simple societies, men's greater physical strength and women's common experience of pregnancy combined together to sustain patriarchy.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; Gradually, technological advances, especially industrial machinery, diminished the primacy of physical strength in everyday life. Similarly, contraception has given women control over their reproductive cycle.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

There is considerable variation in the role that gender plays in human societies. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' states, "The consensus among modern anthropologists and sociologists is that while many cultures bestow power preferentially on one sex or the other, matriarchal societies in this original, evolutionary sense have never existed."&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Matriarchy|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/matriarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The masculinities scholar [[David Buchbinder]] suggests that [[Roland Barthes]]' description of the term ''[[ex-nomination]]'' (i.e. patriarchy as the 'norm' or common sense) is relevant, "[f]or as long as patriarchy remained tacit as a key principle of experiencing gender difference and hence a dominant discourse in the organization of society, it was difficult to contest its power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Buchbinder | first = David | author-link = David Buchbinder | chapter = Troubling patriarchy | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TmfUzE4WnW8C&amp;pg=PA106 | title = Studying men and masculinities | pages = 106–107 | publisher = Routledge | location = Abingdon, Oxon, UK; New York, N.Y. | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780415578295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Mosuo]] (a tiny society in the Yunnan Province in China), however, women exert greater power, authority, and control over decision-making.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other societies are [[matrilinear]] or [[matrilocal]], primarily among indigenous tribal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlegel|first=Alice|title=Male dominance and female autonomy: domestic authority in matrilineal societies|date=1972|publisher=HRAF Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn =9780875363288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[hunter-gatherer]] groups have been characterized as largely [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].&lt;ref name="erdal"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Erdal | first1 = David | last2 = Whiten | first2 = Andrew | chapter = Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-okQAQAAIAAJ | editor-last1 = Mellars | editor-first1 = Paul | editor-last2 = Gibson | editor-first2 = Kathleen Rita | title = Modelling the early human mind | publisher = McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge | location = Cambridge Oakville, Connecticut | series = Cambridge McDonald Monograph Series | date = 1996 | isbn = 9780951942017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anthropologists, such as Ciccodicola, have argued that patriarchy is a [[cultural universal]].&lt;ref name="Ciccodicola2012"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ciccodicola | first = Floriana | title = Practicing anthropology in development processes: new perspectives for a radical anthropology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq9QSx4CQLAC&amp;pg=PA160 | page = 160 | publisher = Edizioni Nuova Cultura | location = Roma | date = 2012 | isbn = 9788861347915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Barbara Smuts argues that patriarchy evolved in humans through conflict between the reproductive interests of males and the reproductive interests of females. She lists six ways that it emerged:
# a reduction in female allies
# elaboration of male-male alliances
# increased male control over resources
# increased hierarchy formation among men
# female strategies that reinforce male control over females
# the evolution of language and its power to create ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, Barbara. "The Evolutionary Origins of Patriarchy."  Human Nature, Vol. 6, No. 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic theories==
While the term ''patriarchy'' often refers to male domination generally, another interpretation sees it as literally "rule of the father".&lt;ref name="Mitchell_409"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = Juliet | author-link = Juliet Mitchell | chapter = The cultural revolution | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DwG0AAAAIAAJ | title = Psychoanalysis and feminism | page = 409 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | date = 1974 | isbn = 9780394474724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So some people{{Who|date=September 2018}} believe patriarchy does not refer simply to of male power over women, but the expression of power dependent on age as well as gender, such as by older men over women, children, and younger men. Some of these younger men may inherit and therefore have a stake in continuing these conventions. Others may rebel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eherenreich | first = Barbara | chapter = Life without father | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4_zeRtk81pcC | editor-last1 = McDowell | editor-first1 = Linda | editor-last2 = Pringle | editor-first2 = Rosemary | title = Defining women: Social institutions and gender divisions | publisher = Polity/Open University | location = London | date = 1992 | isbn = 9780745609799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cockburn | first = Cynthia | title = Brothers: male dominance and technological change | publisher = Pluto | location = London Concord, Massachusetts | date = 1991 | isbn = 9780745305837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=September 2018}}

This psychoanalytic model is based upon revisions of Freud's description of the normally neurotic family using the analogy of the story of [[Oedipus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Lacan | first = Jaques | author-link = Jaques Lacan | chapter = The mirror stage as formative of the function of the I as revealed in psychoanalytic experience (1949) | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XFtrNAEACAAJ |editor-last= Sheridan |editor-first= Alan |title= Écrits: a selection | publisher= Routledge |location= London |date=2001 |origyear= 1977 |isbn= 9780415253925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mulvey | first = Laura | author-link = Laura Mulvey | chapter = The Oedipus myth: beyond the riddles of the Sphinx | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=P6awCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177 | title = Visual and other pleasures | pages = 177&amp;ndash;200 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire England New York | date = 2009 | edition=   2nd | isbn = 9780230576469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who fall outside the Oedipal triad of mother/father/child are less subject to male authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Antigone's claim: kinship between life and death | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | date = 2000 | isbn = 9780231118958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The operations of power in such cases are usually enacted unconsciously. All are subject, even fathers are bound by its strictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Dalton|first=Penelope| author-link = Pen Dalton|date=2008| chapter=Complex family relations|title=Family and other relations: a thesis examining the extent to which family relationships shape the relations of art|chapterurl =http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/758|publisher=[[University of Plymouth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is represented in unspoken traditions and conventions performed in everyday behaviors, customs, and habits.&lt;ref name="Mitchell_409" /&gt; The triangular relationship of a father, a mother and an inheriting eldest son frequently form the dynamic and emotional narratives of popular culture and are enacted [[Performativity|performatively]] in rituals of courtship and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dalton | first = Pen | author-link = Pen Dalton| chapter = Theoretical perspectives | chapterurl = https://www.mheducation.co.uk/openup/chapters/0335196489.pdf | title = The gendering of art education: modernism, identity, and critical feminism | pages = 9&amp;ndash;32 | publisher = Open University | location = Buckingham England Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | date = 2001 | isbn = 9780335196494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide conceptual models for organising power relations in spheres that have nothing to do with the family, for example, politics and business.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

Arguing from this standpoint, radical feminist [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote in her 1970 ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marx was on to something more profound than he knew when he observed that the family contained within itself in embryo all the antagonisms that later develop on a wide scale within the society and the state. For unless revolution uproots the basic social organisation, the biological family – the vinculum through which the psychology of power can always be smuggled – the tapeworm of exploitation will never be annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Firestone |first=Shulamith | author-link = Shulamith Firestone | title = The dialectic of sex: the case for feminist revolution | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Zxy2AAAAIAAJ | publisher = Quill | location = New York | date = 1970 | isbn = 9780688123598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
