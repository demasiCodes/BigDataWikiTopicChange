The term is often used to mean societal control by men in general, although this is more properly termed ''andrarchy''. Many construe this to mean a [[gender]] [[hierarchy]] in which men dominate or exploit women, but that need not be the case. 

Some [[feminism|feminist]] writers have considered patriarchy to be the basis on which most modern societies have been formed. They argue that it is necessary and desirable to get away from this model in order to achieve equality of the sexes.  Some critics argue that these writers are oversimplifying the complexities of society, and/or that such [[gender roles]] are not necessarily harmful.

Patriarchy is distinct from [[patrilineality]] and [[patrilocality]].
