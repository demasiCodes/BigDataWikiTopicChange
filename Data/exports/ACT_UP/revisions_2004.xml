'''ACT-UP''', or the '''Aids Coalition to Unleash Power''', "is a diverse, non-partisan group of individuals ... committed to direct action to end the [[AIDS]] crisis." - from the ACT-UP/New York website.

ACT-UP was formed in March of [[1987]] at the [[Lesbian]] and [[Gay]] Community Services Center in New York. Three weeks later they held their first protest on [[Wall Street]]. [[As of 2004]] there are over 70 chapters worldwide and thousands of members. ACT-UP uses non-violent [[direct action]] and often [[civil disobedience]] to bring attention to the AIDS crisis.

They are well known for their provocative demonstrations and their famous slogan/logo: "Silence = Death" with an uninverted [[pink triangle]].

In the early [[1990s]], activists from ACT-UP founded two other direct action [[gay rights]] groups, [[Queer Nation]] and [[Lesbian Avengers]].
