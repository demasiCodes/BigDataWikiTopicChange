ACT-UP was formed in March of [[1987]] at the [[Lesbian]] and [[Gay]] Community Services Center in [[New York City|New York]]. Three weeks later they held their first [[protest]] on [[Wall Street]].  ACT-UP uses non-violent [[direct action]], innovative graphic design, and often [[civil disobedience]] to bring attention to the AIDS crisis.  ACT-UP also sought to stem the spread of HIV by engaging in frank public discussions about AIDS, sexuality and sexual practices.

They are well known for their provocative [[demonstrations]] and their famous slogan/logo '''"Silence = Death"''' with an inverted [[pink triangle]], which is reminiscent of the pink triangle assigned to accused homosexual men in [[Nazi]] prison and death camps.

In the early [[1990s]], [[activists]] from ACT-UP founded two other direct action [[gay rights]] groups, [[Queer Nation]] and [[Lesbian Avengers]].
