'''AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power''' ('''ACT UP''') is an international, [[grassroots]] political group working to end the [[AIDS pandemic]]. The group works to improve the lives of [[people with AIDS]] through [[direct action]], medical research, treatment and advocacy, and working to change legislation and public policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actupny.org/|title=ACT UP new york|work=actupny.org|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crimp1"&gt;Crimp, Douglas.  ''AIDS Demographics''. Bay Press, 1990. (Comprehensive early history of ACT UP, discussion of the various signs and symbols used by ACT UP).&lt;/ref&gt;

ACT UP was formed in March 1987 at the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center|Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center]] in [[New York City]]. [[Larry Kramer]] was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. Kramer spoke out against the current state of the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]] (GMHC), which he perceived as politically impotent. Kramer had co-founded the GMHC but had resigned from its board of directors in 1983. According to [[Douglas Crimp]], Kramer posed a question to the audience: "Do we want to start a new organization devoted to political action?" The answer was "a resounding yes". Approximately 300 people met two days later to form ACT UP.&lt;ref name="crimp1"/&gt;

At the [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]], in October 1987, ACT UP New York made their debut on the national stage, as an active and visible presence in both the march, the main rally, and at the [[civil disobedience]] at the [[United States Supreme Court Building]] the following day.&lt;ref name="crimp1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;Stein, Marc, "[http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/march-on-washington/exhibit/by-marc-stein Memories of the 1987 March on Washington]" for ''[http://outhistory.org/ OutHistory.org]'', August 2013. Accessed October 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Inspired by this new approach to radical, direct action, other participants in these events returned home to multiple cities and formed local ACT UP chapters in Boston, Chicago, Rhode Island, San Francisco, and other locations, first around the United States, and eventually internationally.&lt;ref name="crimp1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Northeastern/&gt;

==ACT UP New York actions==

The following chronological accounts of New York ACT UP actions are drawn from Douglas Crimp's history of ACT UP, the [[ACT UP Oral History Project]], and the online Capsule History of ACT UP, New York.&lt;ref name="ACTUPNY"&gt;ACT UP New York: Capsule History, [http://www.actupny.org/documents/capsule-home.html Actupny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wall Street===
On March 24, 1987, 250 ACT UP members demonstrated at [[Wall Street]] and Broadway to demand greater access to experimental AIDS drugs and for a coordinated national policy to fight the disease.&lt;ref name="ACTUPNY1"&gt;ACT UP New York: First Demonstration Flyer, [http://www.actupny.org/documents/1stFlyer.html Actupny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  An Op/Ed article by Larry Kramer published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' the previous day described some of the issues ACT UP was concerned with.&lt;ref name="kramer1"&gt;Kramer, Larry. Interview with Sarah Schulman and Jim Hubbard. ACTUP Oral History Project. February 16, 2005. MIX: The New York Lesbian &amp; Gay Experimental Film Festival.  December 11, 2005, [http://www.actuporalhistory.org/interviews/images/kramer.pdf Actuporalhistory.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Seventeen ACT UP members were arrested during this [[civil disobedience]].&lt;ref name="ACTUPNY2"&gt;ACT UP New York: Capsule History - 1987, [http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-87.html Actupny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 1988, ACT UP returned to Wall Street for a larger demonstration in which over 100 people were arrested.&lt;ref name="ACTUPNY3"&gt;ACT UP New York: Capsule History - 1988, [http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-88.html Actupny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 1989, seven ACT UP members infiltrated the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and chained themselves to the VIP balcony to protest the high price of the only approved AIDS drug, [[Zidovudine|AZT]]. The group displayed a banner that read, "SELL WELLCOME" referring to the pharmaceutical sponsor of AZT, [[Burroughs Wellcome]], which had set a price of approximately $10,000 per patient per year for the drug, well out of reach of nearly all [[HIV]] positive persons. Several days following this demonstration, Burroughs Wellcome lowered the price of AZT to $6,400 per patient per year.&lt;ref name="ACTUPNY4"&gt;ACT UP New York: Capsule History - 1989, [http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-89.html Actupny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Post Office===
ACT UP held their next action at the New York City General Post Office on the night of April 15, 1987, to an audience of people filing last minute tax returns. This event also marked the beginning of the conflation of ACT UP with the [[Silence=Death Project]], which created a poster consisting of a right side up [[pink triangle]] (an upside-down pink triangle was used to mark gays in [[Nazi concentration camps]]) on a black background with the text "SILENCE = DEATH". Douglas Crimp said this demonstration showed the "media savvy" of ACT UP because the [[broadcasting|television media]] "routinely do stories about down-to-the-wire tax return filers". As such, ACT UP was virtually guaranteed media coverage.&lt;ref name="crimp1" /&gt;

===''Cosmopolitan'' magazine===
In January 1988, ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine published an article by [[Robert E. Gould]], a psychiatrist, entitled "Reassuring News About AIDS: A Doctor Tells Why You May Not Be At Risk."&lt;ref name="crimp1" /&gt; The main contention of the article was that in unprotected vaginal sex between a man and a woman who both had "healthy genitals" the risk of HIV transmission was negligible, even if the male partner was infected. Women from ACT UP who had been having informal "dyke dinners" met with Dr. Gould in person, questioning him about several misleading facts (that penis to vagina transmission is impossible, for example) and questionable journalistic methods (no [[peer review]], bibliographic information, failing to disclose that he was a psychiatrist and not a practitioner of [[internal medicine]]), and demanded a retraction and apology.&lt;ref name="maggenti1"&gt;Maggenti, Maria. Interview with Sarah Schulman and Jim Hubbard. ACTUP Oral History Project. February 16, 2005. MIX: The New York Lesbian &amp; Gay Experimental Film Festival.  December 11, 2005, [http://www.actuporalhistory.org/interviews/images/maggenti.pdf Actupralhistory.org]&lt;/ref&gt; When he refused, in the words of Maria Maggenti, they decided that they "had to shut down Cosmo." According to those who were involved in organizing the action, it was significant in that it was the first time the women in ACT UP organized separately from the main body of the group.&lt;ref name="carlomusto1"&gt;Carlomusto, Jean. Interview with Sarah Schulman and Jim Hubbard. ACTUP Oral History Project. February 16, 2005. MIX: The New York Lesbian &amp; Gay Experimental Film Festival.  December 11, 2005, [http://www.actuporalhistory.org/interviews/images/carlomusto.pdf Actuporalhistory.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, filming the action itself, the preparation and the aftermath were all consciously planned and resulted in a video short directed by [[Jean Carlomusto]] and [[Maria Maggenti]], titled, "Doctor, Liars, and Women: AIDS Activists Say No To Cosmo." The action consisted of approximately 150 activists protesting in front of the Hearst building (parent company of Cosmopolitan) chanting "Say no to Cosmo!" and holding signs with slogans such as "Yes, the Cosmo Girl CAN get AIDS!"&lt;ref name="crimp1" /&gt; Although the action did not result in any arrests, it brought significant television media attention to the controversy surrounding the article. [[Phil Donahue]], Nightline, and a local talk show called "People Are Talking" all hosted discussions of the article. On the latter, two women, Chris Norwood and Denise Ribble took the stage after the host, [[Richard Bey]], cut Norwood off during an exchange about whether heterosexual women are at risk from AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Treichler, Paula. ''How To Have Theory In An Epidemic''. Duke University Press, 1999. (Discussion of the Cosmopolitan controversy and media representation)&lt;/ref&gt; Footage from all of these media appearances was edited into "Doctors, Liars, and Women." Cosmopolitan eventually issued a partial retraction of the contents of the article.&lt;ref name="maggenti1" /&gt;

===Women and the CDC'S AIDS Definition===
Following their participation in the Cosmopolitan protest, ACT UP's Women's Caucus targeted the Center for Disease Control for its narrow definition of what constituted HIV/AIDS. While causes of HIV transmission, like unprotected vaginal or anal sex, were similar among both men and women, the symptoms of the virus varied greatly. As historian Jennifer Brier noted, "for men, full-blown AIDS often caused [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], while women experienced bacterial pneumonia, pelvic inflammatory disease, and cervical cancer." Since the CDC's definition did not account for such symptoms as a result of AIDS, American women in the 1980s were often diagnosed with AIDS Related Complex (or ARC) or HIV. "In this process," Brier explained, "these women effectively were denied the Social Security benefits that men with AIDS had fought hard to secure, and won, in the late 1980s."&lt;ref&gt;Brier 2009, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 1990, attorney Theresa McGovern filed suit representing 19 New Yorkers who claimed they were unfairly denied disability benefits because of the CDC's narrow definition of AIDS. At an October 2, 1990, protest to raise attention for McGovern's lawsuit, two hundred ACT UP protesters gathered in Washington and chanted "How many more have to die before you say they qualify," and carried posters to the rally with the tagline "Women Don't Get AIDS/ They Just Die From It."&lt;ref name = brier174&gt;Brier 2009, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;
The CDC's initial reaction to calls of the revising the AIDS definition included setting the threshold of AIDS for both men and women at a T cell count of under 200. However, McGovern dismissed this suggestion. "Lots of women who show up at hospitals don't get T cells taken. No one knows they have HIV. I knew how many of our clients were dying of AIDS and not counted."  Rather, McGovern, along with the ACLU and the New Jersey Women and AIDS Network, called for adding fifteen conditions to the list of the CDC's surveillance case definition, which was eventually adopted in January 1993. Six months later, the Clinton administration revised federal criteria for evaluating HIV status and making it easier for women with AIDS to secure Social Security benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence 1997, p. 148-149&lt;/ref&gt; The Women's Caucus' role in altering the CDC's definition helped to not only drastically increase availability of federal benefits to American women, but helped uncover a more accurate number of HIV/AIDS infected women in the United States; "under the new model, the number of women with AIDS in the United States increased almost 50 percent."&lt;ref name = brier174/&gt;

Members of the ACT UP Women's Caucus collectively authored a handbook for two teach-ins held prior to the 1989 CDC demonstration, where ACT UP members learned about issues motivating the action. The handbook, edited by [[Maria Maggenti]], formed the basis for the ACT UP/New York Women and AIDS Book Group's book titled Women, AIDS and Activism, edited by Cynthia Chris and Monica Pearl, and assembled by Marion Banzhaf, Kim Christensen, Alexis Danzig, Risa Denenberg, [[Zoe Leonard]], Deb Levine, Rachel (Sam) Lurie, [[Catherine Gund|Catherine Saalfield (Gund)]], Polly Thistlethwaite, Judith Walker, and Brigitte Weil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ACT UP women's caucus: women and AIDS handbook|last=Rosenblum|first=Illith|last2=Maggenti|first2=Maria|last3=ACT UP (Organization)|date=1989|publisher=AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|location=New York, N.Y.|language=English|oclc = 23144032}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in Spanish in 1993 titled El Mujer, el SIDA, y el Activismo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La mujer, el SIDA y el activismo|last=Banzhaf|first=Marion|last2=ACT UP (Organization)|last3=New York Women and AIDS Book Group|date=1993|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896084558|location=Boston, Mass.|language=Spanish|oclc = 32616186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the original Women and AIDS Handbook Group included Amy (Jaimie) Bauer, Heidi Dorow, Ellen Neipris, [[Ann Northrop]], Sydney Pokorney, Karen Ramspacher, [[Maxine Wolfe]], and Brian Zabcik.

===FDA===
On October 11, 1988, ACT UP had one of its most successful demonstrations (both in terms of size and in terms of national media coverage) when it successfully shut down the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) for a day.&lt;ref name="LAFDA"&gt;{{cite news | title = Police Arrest AIDS Protesters Blocking Access to FDA Offices | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 11 October 1988  | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-11/news/mn-3909_1_police-arrest-aids-protesters | accessdate = 2012-12-07  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AtlanticFDA"&gt;{{cite news | last = Crimp | first = Douglas | title = Before Occupy: How AIDS Activists Seized Control of the FDA in 1988 | publisher = [[The Atlantic]]| date = 6 December 2011  | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/12/before-occupy-how-aids-activists-seized-control-of-the-fda-in-1988/249302/ | accessdate = 2012-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Media reported that it was the largest such demonstration since demonstrations against the Vietnam War.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

{{quote|The AIDS activists shut down the large facility by blocking doors, walkways and a road as FDA workers reported to work. Police told some workers to go home rather than wade through the throng.

"Hey, hey, FDA, how many people have you killed today?" chanted the crowd, estimated by protest organizers at between 1,100 and 1,500. The protesters hoisted a black banner that read "Federal Death Administration".

Police officers, wearing surgical gloves and helmets, started rounding up the hundreds of demonstrators and herding them into buses shortly after 8:30 a.m. Some protesters blocked the buses from leaving for 20 minutes.

Authorities arrested at least 120 protesters, and demonstration leaders said they were aiming for 300 arrests by day's end.&lt;ref name="LAFDA"/&gt;}}

At this action, activists demonstrated their thorough knowledge of the FDA drug approval process. ACT UP presented precise demands for changes that would make experimental drugs available more quickly, and more fairly. "The success of SEIZE CONTROL OF THE FDA can perhaps best be measured by what ensued in the year following the action. Government agencies dealing with AIDS, particularly the FDA and NIH, began to listen to us, to include us in decision-making, even to ask for our input."&lt;ref name="AtlanticFDA"/&gt;

==="Stop the Church"===
ACT UP disagreed with Cardinal [[John Joseph O'Connor]] on the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Roman Catholic Archdiocese]]'s public stand against [[safe sex]] education in New York City Public Schools, [[condom]] distribution, the Cardinal's public views on homosexuality, as well as Catholic opposition to [[abortion]]. This led to the first Stop the Church protest on December 10, 1989, at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]].&lt;ref name="ACTUPNY"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pose/&gt;&lt;ref name=crouch/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACTUPNY"/&gt;{{sfn|Faderman|2015|p=434}}

In December 1989, approximately 4,500 [[protester]]s mobilized by ACT-UP and [[Women's Health Action and Mobilization|WHAM!]] gathered outside a [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] at the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;ACT UP. [http://www.actupny.org/YELL/stopchurch99.html 10 Year Anniversary of "Stop the Church"] Accessed July 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters had indicated in advance that they planned to protest and, while pretending to be church ushers, handed out flyers explaining why they would disrupt the service to those entering the church.{{sfn|Faderman|2015|p=434}}&lt;ref name=pose/&gt;  Plainclothes police officers, who were expecting trouble, were sitting in the pews during mass.&lt;ref name=pose/&gt;

Originally, the plan was just to be a "die-in" during the homily but the protest quickly descended into "pandemonium."&lt;ref name=pose/&gt; While O'Connor went on with mass, activists stood up and announced why they were protesting.{{sfn|Faderman|2015|p=434}}  O'Connor asked worshipers to "pay no attention to" those disrupting the mass.{{sfn|Faderman|2015|p=434}} One protester, Tom Keane, "in a gesture large enough for all to see,"{{sfn|Faderman|2015|pp=434-435}} [[Host desecration|desecrated the Eucharist]] by spitting it out of his mouth, crumbling it into pieces, and dropping them to the floor.&lt;ref name=rude/&gt;&lt;ref name=keane/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACTUPNY"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wages/&gt;&lt;ref name=scalia/&gt;&lt;ref name=carroll/&gt; He then laid on the floor of the church in an attempt to prevent others from receiving [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Communion]] and was later arrested.&lt;ref name=pose/&gt;

One-hundred and eleven protesters were arrested, including 43 inside the church.&lt;ref name=Sindelar/&gt; Some, who refused to move, had to be carried out of the church on stretchers.&lt;ref name=pose/&gt; Only minor charges were filed, punished primarily by [[community service]] sentences; some protesters who refused the sentences were tried, but did not serve jail time.&lt;ref name=Sindelar /&gt;

The protests were widely condemned by public and church officials, members of the public, the mainstream media, and some in the gay community.&lt;ref name=carroll/&gt; As a result of the St. Patrick's Cathedral action, ACT UP was publicly condemned by Mayor [[Edward Koch]] and some media for what they viewed as militancy and disrespect. NY Gov. [[Mario Cuomo]] "deplored the demonstration." The Cathedral protest was criticized as "stupid and wrong-headed" by [[Andy Humm]], a spokesman for the [[Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Rights]], while one ACT UP leader, [[Peter Staley]], denounced the protest as an "utter failure" and a "selfish, macho thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DE113EF930A35752C0A966958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Rude, Rash, Effective, Act-Up Shifts AIDS Policy | first=Jason | last=Deparle | date=January 3, 1990 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its planning, members of ACT UP were divided on the wisdom of the protest with some saying that protest should not target worshipers; others said it was more important to gain attention than it was to avoid offending the people attending the mass.&lt;ref name=pose/&gt;

[[Robert Hilferty]]'s [[Documentary film|documentary]] about the protest, ''Stop the Church'', was originally scheduled to air on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. The film was eventually dropped from national broadcast by PBS, but still aired on [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] stations in several major cities including [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinfels, Peter.

The incident has been compared to the 2012 trial of [[Pussy Riot]] for [[hooliganism]] and incitement of religious hatred in [[Moscow]] after their protest at the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]].  A [[Radio Free Europe]] [[Radio Liberty]] article about the Moscow trial described the Stop the Church protest as "seminal", contributing to early 1990s reforms granting Americans with HIV and AIDS federal protection from discrimination, a U.S. government office on AIDS policy, and millions of dollars for biomedical research.  "ACT UP activists now say the St. Patrick's protest changed the way many Americans viewed the Catholic Church. It was no longer untouchable, and its policies -- on everything from condoms and abortion to gay marriage and women priests -- were no longer sacrosanct."  [[Jim Hubbard]], an ACT UP member and maker of the documentary "[[United in Anger]]" about ACT UP history, said "I wasn't clear about what going inside the church would add at the time. But now I think that the shock of going inside and confronting the cardinal really worked.  It helped bring ACT UP to mainstream attention. It brought the crisis to a point where the government and the mainstream media really had to start dealing with it."&lt;ref name=Sindelar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/before-pussy-riot-act-up-confronted-church-and-won/24668230.html|title=Decades Before Pussy Riot, U.S. Group Protested Catholic Church -- And Got Results|author=Daisy Sindelar|date=2012-08-06|publisher=Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIH demonstration===
In May 1990, ACT UP organized a large choreographed demonstration at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) Campus. According to Kramer, this was their best demonstration, but was almost completely ignored by the media because of a large fire in Washington, D.C. on the same day.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Day of Desperation===
On January 22, 1991, during [[Operation Desert Storm]], ACT UP activist John Weir and two other activists entered the studio of the [[CBS Evening News]] at the beginning of the broadcast. They shouted "AIDS is news. Fight AIDS, not Arabs!" and Weir stepped in front of the camera before the control room cut to a commercial break. The same night ACT UP demonstrated at the studios of the [[MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour]]. The next day activists displayed banners in [[Grand Central Terminal]] that said "Money for AIDS, not for war" and "One AIDS death every 8 minutes."  One of the banners was handheld and displayed across the train timetable and the other attached to bundles of balloons that lifted it up to the ceiling of the station's enormous main room. These actions were part of a coordinated protest called "Day of Desperation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actupny.org/diva/synDesperation.html Day of Desperation Synopsis]. ACT UP New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seattle schools===
In December 1991, ACT UP's Seattle chapter distributed over 500 safer-sex packets outside Seattle high schools.  The packets contained a pamphlet titled "How to Fuck Safely", which was photographically illustrated and included two men performing fellatio.  The Washington state legislature subsequently passed a "Harmful to Minors" law making it illegal to distribute sexually explicit material to underage persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Graphic Anti-Aids Pamphlet Disgusting, Say Teens -- `We Don't Need A Four-Letter Word To Get The Point Across' At Franklin|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19911203&amp;slug=1320783|accessdate=27 March 2012 | work=The Seattle Times|first=Paula|last=Bock|date=December 3, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boston and New England==
"In January 1988, [ACT UP/Boston] held its first protest at the Boston offices of the Department of Health and Human Services, regarding delays and red tape surrounding approval of AIDS treatment drugs. ACT UP/Boston's agenda included demands for a compassionate and comprehensive national policy on AIDS; a national emergency AIDS project; intensified drug testing, research, and treatment efforts; and a full-scale national educational program within reach of all. The organization held die-ins and sleep-ins, provided freshman orientation for Harvard Medical School students, negotiated successfully with a major pharmaceutical corporation, affected state and national AIDS policies, pressured health care insurers to provide coverage for people with AIDS, influenced the thinking of some of the nation's most influential researchers, served on the Massachusetts committee that created the nation's first online registry of clinical trials for AIDS treatments, distributed information and condoms to the congregation at Cardinal [[Bernard Francis Law]]'s Confirmation Sunday services at [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross (Boston)|Holy Cross Cathedral in Boston]], and made aerosolized [[pentamidine]] an accessible treatment in New England."&lt;ref name=Northeastern&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/press_releases/archived_press/#act |title=ACT UP/Boston Historical Records |publisher=Northeastern University Libraries Archives |date=January 2008 |access-date=2018-04-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527111957/http://www.lib.neu.edu/archives/press_releases/archived_press/#act |archive-date=2018-05-27 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Los Angeles ==

ACT UP Los Angeles (ACT UP/LA) was founded December 4, 1987 and disbanded in 1997. During their run they tackled healthcare access, political issues around LGBTQ civil rights, and supported national ACT UP campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Benita, Roth.

Memorable actions by ACT UP/LA are the protests and demonstrations in county based locations such as the USC county hospital, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, and the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll4/id/5799 ACT UP/LA Archival images available at the ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives at USC]&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with the Women's Caucus of this chapter they put on a “Week of Outrage,” in conjunction with the national organization, which consisted of demonstrations, a teach-in, safe-sex vending event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ucla.on.worldcat.org/oclc/26785950 ACT UP Los Angeles news, housed at UCLA's Southern Regional Library Facility]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Women's Caucus (WC) of ACT UP/LA served an important collaboration between men and women who were being affected by HIV and AIDS.&lt;ref name="oac.cdlib.org"&gt;[https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c81g0pcv/ Finding Aid for the ACT UP/Los Angeles records, 1990-1992 located in the UCLA Library Special Collections]&lt;/ref&gt; WC within the ACT UP/LA organization was unique because in this chapter they had a significant amount of control over how they included women's issues into the organizations larger gay male actions. Men were present in the WC, but only as allies, which harvested a collaboration for effective actions, rallies, and any acts of resistance for the whole organization as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Benita. “Feminist Boundaries in the Feminist-Friendly Organization: The Women’s Caucus of ACT UP/LA.” Gender &amp; Society, vol. 12, no. 2, 1998, 129-145.&lt;/ref&gt; While the collaboration was not always perfect, at the end it created a stronger force against discrimination of HIV+ people in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Verta, Rubb, Leila J. “Women’s Culture and Lesbian Feminist Activism.” Community Activism and Feminist Politics, edited by Nancy A. Naples, Routledge, 1988, 57-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the work that the WC did was distribute statistical information about women who are HIV+, the lack of appropriate screening and health care access, information about safer sex practices (in English and Spanish), as well as acts of action to push for better. Lauren Leary was an integral in the organization because her worked revolved around gathering existing research about HIV and AIDS in women and men and current treatment options. An ACT UP national collective of women came together to create the “Women’s Treatment and Research Agenda” in 1991.&lt;ref name="oac.cdlib.org"/&gt;

==Washington D.C.==
===Condoming of Jesse Helms' house===
On September 5, 1991, ACT UP engulfed Senator [[Jesse Helms]]'s Washington D.C. home in a 15-foot giant condom to protest his ongoing, aggressive oppression of [[people with AIDS]] (PWAs), which included opposition to AIDS funding, and many untrue and homophobic statements about HIV and AIDS. Helms had been active in passing laws stigmatizing the disease, and his staunch attempts to block federal funding for, and education about, HIV and AIDS had significantly increased the death toll. Some of the harmful legislation he enacted is still in place.&lt;ref name="yt2"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS-w4Pqvkuw&lt;/ref&gt; The condom was inflated and the message on it read: "A CONDOM TO PREVENT UNSAFE POLITICS. HELMS IS DEADLIER THAN A VIRUS." The event was captured live on the news.&lt;ref name="yt1"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuKlz8TGOic&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first action of the affinity ACT group TAG (Treatment Action Guerillas).&lt;ref name="helms1"&gt;https://actipedia.org/project/condom-jesse-helms-house&lt;/ref&gt; While the police were called, no one was arrested, and the group was allowed to take the condom down, though they did receive a parking ticket.&lt;ref name="helms1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yt2"/&gt; In 2019 the event was reenacted using a fictional protagonist and antagonist in the FX television series, ''[[Pose (TV series)|POSE]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.out.com/television/2019/7/31/poses-condom-over-house-scene-actually-happened-heres-how Pose's ‘Condom Over the House’ Scene Actually Happened — Here's How]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of ACT UP==
[[File:Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill protest.jpg|thumb|right|ACT UP protests in [[New York City]] against [[Uganda]]'s [[Anti-Homosexuality Bill]]]]
ACT UP was organized as a leaderless and effectively [[anarchist]] network. This was intentional on Larry Kramer's part: he describes it as "democratic to a fault."&lt;ref name="kramer1" /&gt; It followed a committee structure with each committee reporting to a coordinating committee meeting once a week. Actions and proposals were generally brought to the coordinating committee and then to the floor for a vote, but this wasn't required - any motion could be brought to a vote at any time.&lt;ref name="carlomusto1" /&gt; [[Gregg Bordowitz]], an early member, said of the process:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is how grassroots, democratic politics work. To a certain extent, this is how democratic politics is supposed to work in general. You convince people of the validity of your ideas. You have to go out there and convince people.&lt;ref name="bordowitz1"&gt;Bordowitz, Gregg. Interview with Sarah Schulman and Jim Hubbard. ACTUP Oral History Project. February 16, 2005. MIX: The New York Lesbian &amp; Gay Experimental Film Festival.  December 11, 2005, [http://www.actuporalhistory.org/interviews/images/bordowitz.pdf Actuporalhistory.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is not to say that it was in practice purely anarchic or democratic. Bordowitz and others admit that certain people were able to communicate and defend their ideas more effectively than others. Although Larry Kramer is often labeled the first "leader" of ACT UP, as the group matured, those people that regularly attended meetings and made their voice heard became conduits through which smaller "affinity groups" would present and organize their ideas. Leadership changed hands frequently and suddenly.&lt;ref name="bordowitz1" /&gt;
*Some of the Committees were:
**Action Committee
**Finance Committee
**Outreach Committee
**Treatment and Data Committee
**Media Committee
**Graphics Committee
**Housing Committee
Note: As ACT UP had no formal organizing plan, the titles of these committees are somewhat variable and some members remember them differently than others.

In addition to Committees, there were also Caucuses, bodies set up by members of particular communities to create space to pursue their needs. Among those active in the late 1980s and/or early 1990s were the Women's Caucus (sometimes referred to as the Women's Committee)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://herstories.prattinfoschool.nyc/omeka/exhibits/show/nomoreinvisiblewomenexhibition|title=No More Invisible Women Exhibition · Herstories: Audio/Visual Collections of the LHA|website=herstories.prattinfoschool.nyc|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Latino/Latina Caucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nacla.org/article/latinos-act-transnational-aids-activism-1990s|title=Latinos ACT UP: Transnational AIDS Activism in the 1990s|website=NACLA|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with committees and caucuses, ACT UP New York relied heavily on "affinity groups".  These groups often had no formal structure, but were centered on specific advocacy issues and personal connections, often within larger committees.  Affinity groups supported overall solidarity in larger, more complex political actions through the mutual support provided to members of the group.  Affinity groups often organized to perform smaller actions within the scope of a larger political action, such as the "Day of Desperation", when the Needle Exchange group presented NY City Health Department officials with thousands of used syringes they had collected through their exchange (contained in water cooler bottles).

=== Gran Fury ===
[[Gran Fury]] functioned as the anonymous art collective that produced all of the artistic media for ACT UP. The group remained anonymous because it allowed the collective to function as a cohesive unit without any one voice being singled out. The mission of the group was to bring an end to the AIDS Crisis by making reference to the issues plaguing society at large, especially homophobia and the lack of public investment in the AIDS epidemic, through bringing art works into the public sphere in order to reach the maximum audience. The group often faced censorship in their proceedings, including being rejected for public billboard space and being threatened with censorship in art exhibitions. When faced with this censorship, Gran Fury often posted their work illegally on the walls of the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Gober, Robert, Bob Gober, and Gran Fury. "Gran Fury." ''BOMB'', no. 34 (1991): 8–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===DIVA-TV===
DIVA-TV, an acronym for "Damned Interfering Video Activist Television," was an affinity group within ACT UP that videotaped and documented [[AIDS]] activism. Its founding members are [[Catherine Gund]], [[Ray Navarro]], [[Ellen Spiro]], [[Gregg Bordowitz]], Robert Beck, Costa Pappas, [[Jean Carlomusto]], Rob Kurilla, George Plagianos.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Juhaz, "Diva TV and ACT UP," Encyclopedia of Social Movement Media, editor John D. H. Downing.&lt;/ref&gt; One of their early works is "Like a Prayer" (1991), documenting the 1989 ACT UP protests at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] against New York [[John Joseph O'Connor|Cardinal O'Connor]]'s position on AIDS and [[contraception]]. In the video, Ray Navarro, an ACT UP/DIVA TV activist,&lt;ref name="Leap Into the Void"&gt;A Day Without an Artist: Ray Navarro [http://imoralist.blogspot.com/2008/12/day-without-artist-ray-navarro.html Leap Into the Void]&lt;/ref&gt; serves as the narrator, dressed up as [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]. The documentary aims to show mass media bias as it juxtaposes original protest footage with those images shown on the nightly news.

Although less as a "collective" after 1990, DIVA TV continued documenting (over 700 camera hours) the direct actions of ACT UP, activists, and the community responses to HIV/AIDS, producing over 160 video programs for public access television channels - as the weekly series "AIDS Community Television" from 1991–1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actupny.org/divatv|title=DIVA TV (Damned Interfering Video Activists)|work=actupny.org|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1994-96 the weekly call-in public access series "ACT UP Live"; film festival screenings; and continuing on-line documentation and streaming internet webcasts. The video activism of DIVA TV ultimately switched media in 1997 with the establishing and continuing development of the ACT UP (New York) website.   The most recent DIVA TV-genre video program documenting the history and activism of ACT UP (New York) is the feature-length documentary: "Fight Back, Fight AIDS: 15 Years of ACT UP" (2002), screened at the Berlin Film Festival and exhibited worldwide. DIVA TV programs and camera-original videotapes are currently re-mastered, archived and preserved, and publicly accessible in the collection of the "AIDS Video Activist Video Preservation Project" at the New York Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digilib.nypl.org/dynaweb/ead/human/mssroyal/|title=AIDS Activist Videotape Collection, 1983-2000: Table of Contents|work=nypl.org|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional independence===
ACT UP had an early debate about whether to register the organization as a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit in order to allow contributors [[tax exemption]]s. Eventually they decided against it, because as Maria Maggenti said, "they didn't want to have anything to do with the government."&lt;ref name="maggenti1" /&gt; This kind of uncompromising ethos characterized the group in its early stages; eventually it led to a split between those in the group who wanted to remain wholly independent and those who saw opportunities for compromise and progress by "going inside [the institutions and systems they were fighting against]."&lt;ref name="harrington1"&gt;Harrington, Mark. Interview with Sarah Schulman and Jim Hubbard. ACTUP Oral History Project. February 16, 2005. MIX: The New York Lesbian &amp; Gay Experimental Film Festival.  December 11, 2005, [http://www.actuporalhistory.org/interviews/images/harrington.pdf Actuporalhistory.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
ACT UP, while extremely prolific and certainly effective at its peak, suffered from extreme internal pressures over the direction of the group and of the AIDS crisis. After the action at NIH, these tensions resulted in an effective severing of the Action Committee and the Treatment and Data Committee, which reformed itself as the [[Treatment Action Group]] (TAG).&lt;ref name="harrington1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Maxine. Interview with Sarah Schulman and Jim Hubbard. ACTUP Oral History Project. February 16, 2005. MIX: The New York Lesbian &amp; Gay Experimental Film Festival.  December 11, 2005, [http://www.actuporalhistory.org/interviews/images/wolfe.pdf Actuporalhistory.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Several members describe this as a "severing of the dual nature of ACT UP".

In 2000 ACT UP/Chicago was inducted into the [[Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&amp;todo=year |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017032241/http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?page=inductees&amp;todo=year |archivedate=2015-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACT UP chapters continue to meet and protest, albeit with a smaller membership.  ACT UP/NY and ACT UP/Philadelphia are particularly robust, with other chapters active elsewhere.

[[Housing Works]], New York's largest AIDS service organization and Health GAP, which fights to expand treatment for people with AIDS throughout the world, are direct outgrowths of ACT UP.

==Factionalism in San Francisco==
In 2000, [[ACT UP/Golden Gate]] changed its name to Survive AIDS, to avoid confusion with ACT UP/San Francisco (ACT UP/SF). The two had previously split apart in 1990, but continued to share the same essential philosophy. In 1994, ACT UP/SF began [[AIDS denialism|rejecting the scientific consensus]] regarding the cause of AIDS and the connection to HIV, and the two groups became openly hostile to each other, with mainstream gay and AIDS organizations also condemning ACT UP/SF.&lt;ref name="Vicious"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/content/printVersion/306128 |title=Men Behaving Viciously; How ACT UP San Francisco spreads spit, fake blood, used cat litter, and potentially deadly misinformation through the AIDS community |publisher=San Francisco Weekly |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117015600/http://www.sfweekly.com/content/printVersion/306128 |archivedate=2009-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group would link up with [[PETA|People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] against animal research into AIDS cures.&lt;ref name="Vicious"/&gt; Restraining orders have been granted after the organization physically attacked AIDS charities that help HIV-positive patients,&lt;ref name="ChronOrder"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/11/11/MN113803.DTL|title=S.F.'s ACT UP Ordered to Back Off|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Christopher | last=Heredia | date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and activists have been found guilty in misdemeanor charges laid after threatening phone calls to journalists and public health officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gay.com/news/article.html?2003/08/06/1 |title=Activists sentenced for misdemeanors |publisher=Gay.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308204209/http://gay.com/news/article.html?2003%2F08%2F06%2F1 |archivedate=2005-03-08 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
