Since the early 2020s, [[conservatives]] and members of the [[far-right]], mostly in the United States, have falsely accused [[LGBT people]], as well as their [[Straight ally|allies]] and [[Progressivism|progressives]] in general, of systematically using [[LGBT sex education|LGBT-positive education]] and campaigns for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] as a method of [[child grooming]]. These accusations and [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] are characterized by experts as baseless, [[homophobic]] and [[transphobic]], and as examples of [[moral panic]].

==Overview==
The term ''groomer'' is derived from the practice of [[child grooming]], but [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] are using it to "imply that the LGBTQ community, their allies, and liberals more generally are [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]] or pedophile-enablers".&lt;ref name= Vox&gt;{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Aja |title=The right's moral panic over "grooming" invokes age-old homophobia |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/23025505/leftist-groomers-homophobia-satanic-panic-explained |website=vox.com |date=April 21, 2022 |publisher=Vox |access-date=July 28, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that LGBT people do not molest children at higher rates than non-LGBT people.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Czopek |first=Madison |date=May 11, 2022 |title=Why it's not 'grooming': What research says about gender and sexuality in schools |url=https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/may/11/why-its-not-grooming-what-research-says-about-gend/ |access-date=August 26, 2022 |website=[[Politifact]] |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Facts About Homosexuality and Child Molestation |url=https://lgbpsychology.org/html/facts_molestation.html |access-date=August 26, 2022 |website=lgbpsychology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=August 2, 2017 |title=Sexual Orientation, Parents, &amp; Children |url=http://www.apa.org/about/policy/parenting.aspx |access-date=August 26, 2022 |website= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802023216/http://www.apa.org/about/policy/parenting.aspx |archive-date=2 August 2017 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Jenny |first1=C. |last2=Roesler |first2=T.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1977, [[Anita Bryant]] and the [[Save Our Children]] coalition often described homosexuality as allegedly being harmful to children, while they were attempting to repeal an ordinance that partly banned discrimination based on sexuality. Bryant claimed "homosexuals cannot reproduce, so they must recruit{{nbsp}}... the youth of America".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=How 1970s Christian crusader Anita Bryant helped spawn Florida's LGBTQ culture war |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/1970s-christian-crusader-anita-bryant-helped-spawn-floridas-lgbtq-cult-rcna24215 |access-date=2022-10-05 |website=[[NBC News]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "OK groomer" originated in 2020 as a play on the "[[OK boomer]]" [[meme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Dodds |first1=Io |last2=Woodward |first2=Alex |date=14 April 2022 |title=GOP 'groomer' smears are sparking a new wave of anti-LGBT+ violence: 'This is going to lead to tragedy' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/republicans-disney-groomer-harassment-lgbt-people-b2058272.html |access-date=27 May 2022 |website=[[The Independent]] |quote=...{{nbsp}} trolls called on Twitter users to disrupt conversations among LGBT+ people with the phrase “OK groomer”, a play on the Generation Z meme “OK boomer”{{nbsp}}...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom, the conspiracy theory began to be popularized within the [[gender-critical]] movement around 2020. That year, anti-transgender activist [[Graham Linehan]] was banned from Twitter after he began to use "OK groomer" as a term of abuse against those who criticized his activism. The term was also borrowed by the pressure group [[Transgender Trend]], which used it in material that it sent to schools in order to oppose the advice which was given to them by LGBT+ charities such as [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 13, 2022|title=How 'groomer', the dangerous new anti-LGBT slur from America, is taking hold in Britain|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/groomer-new-lgbt-slur-incite-hatred-spark-violence-1585179|author-last=Strudwick|author-first=Patrick|access-date=July 29, 2022|work=[[i (newspaper)|i]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2020, ''[[The Times]]'' columnist [[Janice Turner]] accused the charity [[Mermaids (charity)|Mermaids]], which offers support for trans youth, of grooming for introducing an exit button on their website in response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] lockdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/03/26/mermaids-transgender-charity-exit-button-website-twitter-janice-turner-shon-faye/ | title=The anti-trans brigade is attacking children's charity Mermaids for helping its users protect their identity.

===Popularisation===
[[File:Libs of TikTok logo.jpg|thumb|upright|Far-right anti-LGBT disinformation Twitter account [[Libs of TikTok]] slurs LGBT people as "groomers"]]
In the United States, the popularization of the term has been linked to [[Christopher Rufo]], who tweeted about "winning the language war", and [[James A. Lindsay]] in August 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/05/qanon-groomer-hawley-desantis-jackson/ |title=The QAnon catchphrases that took over the Jackson hearings |date=April 7, 2022 |orig-date=2022-04-05 |author1=Donald Moynihan |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |place=Washington, D.C. |issn=0190-8286 |oclc=1330888409}}{{WaPoCheckDates}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date= April 27, 2022 |title=How the Intellectual Dark Web Spawned 'Groomer' Panic |work=The Daily Beast |url= https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-intellectual-dark-web-spawned-anti-lgbtq-groomer-panic |access-date= May 16, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Wi Spa controversy]] in July 2021, [[Julia Serano]] noted a rise in false accusations of grooming directed towards transgender people, saying that it appeared as if there was a movement to "lay the foundation for just smearing all trans people as child sexual predators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/28/anti-trans-video-los-angeles-protest-wi-spa | title='A nightmare scenario': How an anti-trans Instagram post led to violence in the streets | website=[[TheGuardian.com]] | date=July 28, 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libs of TikTok]] (LoTT) also slurs LGBT people, supporters of LGBT youth,&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stahl |first1=Jeremy |title=The Hate-Fueled and Hugely Influential World of Libs of TikTok |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/chaya-raichik-libs-tiktok-groomer-tweets.html |website=Slate Magazine |access-date=July 27, 2022 |language=en |date=April 27, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Persaud |first1=Chris |title=Babylon Bee CEO of Juno Beach backs Twitter firebrand who calls LGBTQ people pedophiles |url=https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/2022/05/10/babylon-bee-ceo-juno-beach-backs-libs-tiktok-creator/7385009001/ |website=The Palm Beach Post |access-date=July 27, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those who teach about sexuality as "groomers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Twitter activist behind the far-right 'Libs of TikTok' is an Orthodox Jew.

The conspiracy theory then moved into the American conservative mainstream, with a number of high-profile cases of its use in Spring 2022, including its use by members of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name= "Vox" /&gt; On February 24, the right-wing [[The Heritage Foundation]] issued a tweet stating that the Florida Don't Say Gay bill "protects young children from [[sexual grooming]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/christina-pushaw-ron-desantis-libsoftiktok-groomer.html |title=How One Florida Woman With Twitter Problems Plunged Us Into a Nightmarish National Conversation About "Grooming" |last1=Mathis-Lilley |first1=Ben|date=April 21, 2022 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the debate over Florida's [[Parental Rights in Education Act]], [[Christina Pushaw]], press secretary to the state's governor [[Ron DeSantis]], tweeted that anyone who opposes the act was "probably a groomer". In April 2022, [[Marjorie Taylor Greene]] referred to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as "the party of killing babies, grooming and transitioning children, and pro-pedophile politics". Also that month, a group of [[Radical right (United States)|far-right]] extremists and conspiracy theorists held a demonstration at [[Disney World]] in which they accused Disney of grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Alfonseca |first1=Kiara |title=Some Republicans use false 'pedophilia' claims to attack Democrats, LGBTQ people |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/republicans-false-pedophilia-claims-attack-democrats-lgbtq-people/story?id=84344687 |website=abcnews.go.com |publisher=ABC News |access-date=July 28, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney has been the focus of several other uses of the conspiracy – [[Jim Banks]] and 19 other members of the [[Republican Study Committee]] published a letter to Disney accusing the corporation of "purposefully influencing small children with its political and sexual agenda".&lt;ref name="Brooks April2022"/&gt;

Since then, numerous right wing pundits have described the behavior of parents and teachers who support minors in their transgender identities as grooming, and the term "groomer" has widely been used by conservative media and politicians who want to denounce the LGBTQ community and its allies by implying that they are pedophiles or pedophile-enablers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/culture/23025505/leftist-groomers-homophobia-satanic-panic-explained |title=The right's moral panic over 'grooming' invokes age-old homophobia |last1=Romano |first1=Aja|date=April 21, 2022 |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/g5q9vx/child-grooming-lgbtq-smear |title=Conservatives Are Smearing 'Don't Say Gay' Opponents as Pedophile 'Groomers' |last1=Cameron |first1=Joseph |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate Magazine]]'' later described the word "grooming" as "the buzzword of the season".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/christina-pushaw-ron-desantis-libsoftiktok-groomer.html |title=How One Florida Woman With Twitter Problems Plunged Us Into a Nightmarish National Conversation About "Grooming" |last1=Mathis-Lilley |first1=Ben|date=April 21, 2022 |work=[[Slate Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2022, Fox News host [[Laura Ingraham]] claimed that schools were becoming "grooming centers for gender identity radicals", dedicating an entire segment of her show to the topic a couple of weeks later.&lt;ref name="Brooks April2022"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3262988-groomer-debate-inflames-gop-fight-over-florida-law/ | title='Groomer' debate inflames GOP fight over Florida law | date=April 8, 2022 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2022, the left-leaning media watchdog [[Media Matters]] published a study stating that within a three week period spanning from March 17 to April 6, [[Fox News]] ran 170 segments on trans people, throughout which the network "repeatedly invoked the long-debunked myth that trans people pose a threat to minors and seek to groom them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/doom-groom-fox-news-has-aired-170-segments-discussing-trans-people-past-three-weeks |title="Doom &amp; Groom": Fox News has aired 170 segments discussing trans people in the past three weeks |last1=Paterson |first1=Alex|website=[[Media Matters for America]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2019, protesters have targeted [[Drag Queen Story Hour]] events at public facilities and private venues. Appearing on Fox News, Chris Rufo characterized child-friendly drag as an attempt to "sexualize children," "subvert the middle-class family," and "eliminate what they call the sexual hierarchy in favor of creating a sexual connection between adult and child."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Drag Queen Story Hour's radical origins and the subversive sexualization of our kids |url=https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/drag-queen-story-hours-radical-origins-subversive-sexualization-kids |access-date=October 22, 2022 |website=Fox News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2022, Twitter mentions of Drag Queen Story Hour increased by over 700 percent, according to media intelligence company [[Zignal Labs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Anti-LGBTQ threats, fueled by internet’s far right ‘machine,’ shut down trans rights and drag events |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/anti-lgbtq-threats-orchestrated-on-internet-shut-down-events-rcna33955 |access-date=June 17, 2022 |website=NBC News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in June, members of the far-right [[Proud Boys]] stormed and disrupted multiple events at local libraries and bookstores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Proud Boys crashed Drag Queen Story Hour at a local library.

In August 2022, a joint report which was published by the American [[Human Rights Campaign]]  and the British [[Center for Countering Digital Hate]] revealed that the 500 most influential hateful "grooming" tweets were seen 72 million times, and it also stated that "grooming" tweets from just ten influential sources were seen 48 million times. It also revealed that [[Meta Platforms|Meta]], formerly known as Facebook, had accepted up to $24,987 for advertisements which pushed the grooming conspiracy theory, the advertisements had been served to users over 2.1 million times, and [[Twitter]], despite saying that groomer slurs were violations of its hate speech policy, failed to act on 99% of tweets which were reported as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://counterhate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CCDH-HRC-Digital-Hate-Report-2022-single-pages.pdf |title=Digital Hate: Social Media's Role in Amplifying Dangerous Lies About LGBTQ+ people |publisher=[[Center for Countering Digital Hate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also recorded a 406% increase in the use of tweets associating members of the LGBTQ community with being "groomers", "pedophiles", and "predators" following the passage of Florida's [[Florida Parental Rights in Education Act|Parental Rights in Education Act]], called the "Don't Say Gay Law" by its critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=After ' Don't Say Gay' bill passed, LGBTQ online hate surged 400% |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/-dont-say-gay-bill-passed-lgbtq-online-hate-surged-400-rcna42617 |access-date=August 22, 2022 |website=NBC News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses and criticism==
[[Twitter]], [[Reddit]], [[TikTok]] and [[Meta Platforms|Meta]] (parent company of [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]]) have said that using "groomer" as a slur against LGBT people violates their policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Drennen |first=Ari |date=July 23, 2022 |title=Twitter says slandering LGBTQ+ people as "groomers" violates its rules |url=https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/07/22/twitter-says-slandering-lgbtq-people-as-groomers-violates-its-rules/ |access-date=August 6, 2022 |website=Los Angeles Blade |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vox'' argued that the rhetoric which is used by proponents of the grooming conspiracy theory is similar to the rhetoric which was used by proponents of older conspiracy theories like the [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory]] and [[QAnon]]: "grooming accusations aren't concerned with making sense; they're about stirring up fear, anger, and hysteria — which is why they sound exactly like the kinds of fringe conspiracy theories that have been around for centuries. The new pedophile conspiracy rhetoric is essentially the same as all the old pedophile conspiracy rhetoric."&lt;ref name="Vox" /&gt; Writing in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', James Kirchick argues that the grooming conspiracy theory grew out of more generalized homophobic conspiracy theories which originated in Germany in the early 20th century and that, in particular, it grew out of the [[Eulenburg affair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirchick |first1=James |date=May 31, 2022 |title=The Long, Sordid History of the Gay Conspiracy Theory |url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/the-long-sordid-history-of-the-gay-conspiracy-theory.html |access-date=July 28, 2022 |website=[[Intelligencer (website)|Intelligencer]] |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] described the conspiracy theory as "another volley in the [United States'] ongoing [[culture war]]s, during which conservative lawmakers have also opposed the teaching of '[[critical race theory]]' and proposed bills requiring schools to post all course materials online so parents can review them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=March 29, 2022 |title='Grooming': The ubiquitous buzzword in LGBTQ school debate |url=https://apnews.com/article/education-gender-identity-adf10ff5f169fae9c9af4d08a7b0c2bc |access-date=August 19, 2022 |website=AP NEWS |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[AP Stylebook]], "Some people use the word ''groom'' or variants of it to falsely liken LGBTQ people's interactions with children, or education about LGBTQ issues, to the actions of [[Child sexual abuse|child molesters]].
