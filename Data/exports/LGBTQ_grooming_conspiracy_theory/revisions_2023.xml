The '''LGBT grooming conspiracy theory''' is a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[conspiracy theory]] pushed by a growing number of mainstream [[conservatives]] that falsely accuses [[LGBT people]] and their [[Straight ally|allies]] of [[child grooming]] and enabling [[pedophilia]]. Gaining prominence in the early 2020s, the theory purports that LGBT people are systematically using [[LGBT sex education]] and campaigns for [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] as a method of normalizing pedophilia and indoctrinating children. [[Transgender people]] in particular have received targeted attacks. These accusations and conspiracy theories are characterized by experts as baseless, relying on [[homophobic]] and [[transphobic]] notions, and also as examples of a [[moral panic]]. The origins of the "[[Child grooming|groomer]]" conspiracy theory can be traced to American singer [[Anita Bryant]] and her "[[Save Our Children]]" coalition founded in 1977.

While the belief that LGBT individuals are more likely to molest children or otherwise abuse minors than others has no basis in fact, this assertion has existed for multiple decades in the U.S. going back to the times before [[World War II]]. At the beginning of the [[Cold War]], the U.S. government sought to remove homosexuals from positions of importance during the [[Lavender scare]].&lt;ref name="IntelligencerKirchick2022"/&gt; As a matter of [[ideological]] faith, these talking points became more widespread for the use of [[Partisanship|partisan political campaigning]] when the 2020s began. Advocates for [[children's rights]] have protested that the conspiracy theories frustrate proper support for abuse survivors, and LGBT rights organizations have condemned the use of such notions as encouraging [[discrimination in the United States]].

One survey by a left-leaning [[think tank]] found that around 29 percent of likely American voters believe the conspiracy theory. Results were divided greatly on the basis of political party.

==Overview==
The term ''groomer'' is derived from the practice of [[child grooming]].&lt;ref name="ReasonWalker2023"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://reason.com/2023/01/14/a-modern-history-of-groomer-politics/|title=A Modern History of 'Groomer' Politics|last=Walker|first=Jesse|date=Feb 2023|work=Reason.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described by U.S. public interest publication ''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'' in an April 2022 report, "Conservatives use it to imply that the LGBTQ community, their allies, and liberals more generally are pedophiles or pedophile-enablers".&lt;ref name="VoxRomano2022"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Aja |date=April 21, 2022 |title=The right's moral panic over "grooming" invokes age-old homophobia |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/23025505/leftist-groomers-homophobia-satanic-panic-explained |access-date=October 30, 2023 |website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology around ''groomer'' first came about in the 1980s and became popularized through abuse survivor advocacy, initially applying to actual criminal behavior without reference to [[Politics of the United States|U.S. politics]].&lt;ref name="Keveney"/&gt;

The allegation that having a [[LGBT community|LGBT identity]] causes or otherwise contributes to [[pedophilia]] has continued as a matter of [[Ideology|ideological faith]] into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Keveney"/&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
{{Globalize section|date=October 2023}}
Writing in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', [[James Kirchick]] argues that the grooming conspiracy theory grew out of more generalized homophobic conspiracy theories which originated in Germany in the early 20th century and that, in particular, it grew out of the [[Eulenburg affair]].&lt;ref name="IntelligencerKirchick2022"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirchick |first1=James |date=May 31, 2022 |title=The Long, Sordid History of the Gay Conspiracy Theory |url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/the-long-sordid-history-of-the-gay-conspiracy-theory.html |access-date=July 28, 2022 |website=[[Intelligencer (website)|Intelligencer]] |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, [[Anita Bryant]] and the [[Save Our Children]] coalition often described homosexuality as allegedly being harmful to children, while they were attempting to repeal an ordinance that partly banned discrimination based on sexuality. Bryant claimed "homosexuals cannot reproduce, so they must recruit{{nbsp}}... the youth of America".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=How 1970s Christian crusader Anita Bryant helped spawn Florida's LGBTQ culture war |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/1970s-christian-crusader-anita-bryant-helped-spawn-floridas-lgbtq-cult-rcna24215 |access-date=October 5, 2022 |website=[[NBC News]] |date=April 14, 2022 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "OK groomer" originated in 2020 as a play on the "[[OK boomer]]" [[meme]].&lt;ref name="DoddsIndependent"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Dodds |first1=Io |last2=Woodward |first2=Alex |date=April 14, 2022 |title=GOP 'groomer' smears are sparking a new wave of anti-LGBT+ violence: 'This is going to lead to tragedy' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/republicans-disney-groomer-harassment-lgbt-people-b2058272.html |access-date=May 27, 2022 |website=[[The Independent]] |quote=...{{nbsp}} trolls called on Twitter users to disrupt conversations among LGBT+ people with the phrase "OK groomer", a play on the Generation Z meme "OK boomer"{{nbsp}}...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom, the conspiracy theory began to be popularized within the [[gender-critical]] movement around 2020. That year, anti-transgender activist [[Graham Linehan]] was banned from Twitter after he began to use "OK groomer" as a term of abuse against those who criticized his activism.&lt;ref name="DoddsIndependent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="inews" /&gt; The term was also borrowed by the pressure group [[Transgender Trend]], which used it in material that it sent to schools in order to oppose the advice which was given to them by LGBT+ charities such as [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]].&lt;ref name="inews"&gt;{{cite web|date=April 13, 2022|title=How 'groomer', the dangerous new anti-LGBT slur from America, is taking hold in Britain|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/groomer-new-lgbt-slur-incite-hatred-spark-violence-1585179|author-last=Strudwick|author-first=Patrick|access-date=July 29, 2022|work=[[i (newspaper)|i]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2020, ''[[The Times]]'' columnist [[Janice Turner]] accused the charity [[Mermaids (charity)|Mermaids]], which offers support for trans youth, of grooming for introducing an exit button on their website in response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] lockdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/03/26/mermaids-transgender-charity-exit-button-website-twitter-janice-turner-shon-faye/ | title=The anti-trans brigade is attacking children's charity Mermaids for helping its users protect their identity. Yes, really |work=[[PinkNews]] | date=March 26, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conspiracy has also been used by the far-right in the UK, including [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]] according to [[Hope not Hate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://hopenothate.org.uk/2022/03/16/transphobia-and-the-far-right/ | title=Transphobia and the Far Right | date=March 16, 2022 |publisher=[[Hope not Hate]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularization===

[[File:Libs of TikTok logo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Far-right anti-LGBT Twitter account [[Libs of TikTok]] slurs LGBT people as "groomers".]]

In the United States, the popularization of the term has been linked to [[Christopher Rufo]], who tweeted about "winning the language war", and [[James A.

The conspiracy theory then moved into the American conservative mainstream, with a number of high-profile cases of its use in Spring 2022, including its use by members of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="VoxRomano2022" /&gt; On February 24, the right-wing [[The Heritage Foundation]] issued a tweet stating that the [[Florida Parental Rights in Education Act]] "protects young children from sexual grooming".&lt;ref name="SlateMathisLilly2022"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/christina-pushaw-ron-desantis-libsoftiktok-groomer.html |title=How One Florida Woman With Twitter Problems Plunged Us Into a Nightmarish National Conversation About "Grooming" |last1=Mathis-Lilley |first1=Ben|date=April 21, 2022 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the debate over the act, [[Christina Pushaw]], press secretary to the state's governor [[Ron DeSantis]], tweeted that anyone who opposes the act was "probably a groomer". In April 2022, [[Marjorie Taylor Greene]] referred to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as "the party of killing babies, grooming and transitioning children, and pro-pedophile politics". Also that month, a group of [[Radical right (United States)|far-right]] extremists and conspiracy theorists held a demonstration at [[Disney World]] in which they accused Disney of grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Alfonseca |first1=Kiara |title=Some Republicans use false 'pedophilia' claims to attack Democrats, LGBTQ people |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/republicans-false-pedophilia-claims-attack-democrats-lgbtq-people/story?id=84344687 |website=abcnews.go.com |publisher=ABC News |access-date=July 28, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney has been the focus of several other uses of the conspiracy – [[Jim Banks]] and 19 other members of the [[Republican Study Committee]] published a letter to Disney accusing the corporation of "purposefully influencing small children with its political and sexual agenda".&lt;ref name="Brooks April2022" /&gt; [[Gays Against Groomers]] (GAG) formed in June 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Hansford |first=Amelia |date=2023-07-31 |title=Armed neo-Nazi group joins Gays Against Groomers at Wisconsin Pride protest |url=https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/07/31/pride-protest-gays-against-groomers-neo-nazis/ |access-date=2023-09-06 |website=[[PinkNews]] |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an American [[anti-LGBT]] organization with a large presence on social media platforms and frequent promotion on right-wing media networks.

Since then, numerous right wing pundits have described the behavior of parents and teachers who support minors in their transgender identities as grooming, and the term "groomer" has widely been used by conservative media and politicians who want to denounce the LGBT community and its allies by implying that they are pedophiles or pedophile-enablers.&lt;ref name=VoxRomano2022/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/g5q9vx/child-grooming-lgbtq-smear |title=Conservatives Are Smearing 'Don't Say Gay' Opponents as Pedophile 'Groomers' |last1=Cameron |first1=Joseph |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=April 5, 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate Magazine]]'' later described the word "grooming" as "the buzzword of the season".&lt;ref name="SlateMathisLilly2022" /&gt; In March 2022, Fox News host [[Laura Ingraham]] claimed that schools were becoming "grooming centers for gender identity radicals", dedicating an entire segment of her show to the topic a couple of weeks later.&lt;ref name="Brooks April2022"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3262988-groomer-debate-inflames-gop-fight-over-florida-law/ | title='Groomer' debate inflames GOP fight over Florida law | date=April 8, 2022 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2022, the left-leaning media watchdog [[Media Matters]] published a study stating that within a three-week period spanning from March 17 to April 6, [[Fox News]] ran 170 segments on trans people, throughout which the network "repeatedly invoked the long-debunked myth that trans people pose a threat to minors and seek to groom them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/doom-groom-fox-news-has-aired-170-segments-discussing-trans-people-past-three-weeks |title="Doom &amp; Groom": Fox News has aired 170 segments discussing trans people in the past three weeks |last1=Paterson |first1=Alex|website=[[Media Matters for America]] |date=April 8, 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2019, protesters have targeted [[Drag Queen Story Hour]] events at public facilities and private venues. Also in June, members of the far-right group [[Proud Boys]] disrupted a Drag Queen Story Hour at San Lorenzo Library in California, shouting insults like "groomer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Proud Boys crashed Drag Queen Story Hour at a local library.

In August 2022, a joint report which was published by the American [[Human Rights Campaign]]  and the British [[Center for Countering Digital Hate]] revealed that the 500 most influential hateful "grooming" tweets were seen 72 million times, and it also stated that "grooming" tweets from just ten influential sources were seen 48 million times. It also revealed that [[Meta Platforms|Meta]], formerly known as Facebook, had accepted up to $24,987 for advertisements which pushed the grooming conspiracy theory, the advertisements had been served to users over 2.1 million times, and [[Twitter]], despite saying that groomer slurs were violations of its hate speech policy, failed to act on 99% of tweets which were reported as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://counterhate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CCDH-HRC-Digital-Hate-Report-2022-single-pages.pdf |title=Digital Hate: Social Media's Role in Amplifying Dangerous Lies About LGBTQ+ people |publisher=[[Center for Countering Digital Hate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also recorded a 406% increase in the use of tweets associating members of the LGBT community with being "groomers", "pedophiles", and "predators" following the passage of Florida's [[Florida Parental Rights in Education Act|Parental Rights in Education Act]], called the "Don't Say Gay Law" by its critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=After ' Don't Say Gay' bill passed, LGBTQ online hate surged 400% |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/-dont-say-gay-bill-passed-lgbtq-online-hate-surged-400-rcna42617 |access-date=August 22, 2022 |website=NBC News |date=August 12, 2022 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in March, a show called CabaBabaRave for mothers and infants was forced to be canceled after footage of performers was shared on social media by conservative pages. CabaBabaRave's website, Instagram, and Facebook pages were also forced to be made private.

A March 2023 report by the [[Center for Countering Digital Hate]] (CCDH) found that tweets on Twitter linking LGBT people to "grooming" have increased by 119 percent since Elon Musk purchased the social media platform in October 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Muldowney |first=Decca |date=March 28, 2023 |title=Elon Musk's Twitter Makes Millions Off Anti-LGBT 'Groomer' Tweets: Report |language=en |work=The Daily Beast |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musks-twitter-makes-millions-off-anti-lgbt-groomer-tweets-report |access-date=July 16, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 2023 poll by Gallup found that only 41 percent of Republicans think that same-sex relations are morally acceptable, a 15 percent drop from 2022, while Democratic approval of same-sex relations also fell from 85 percent in 2022 to 79 percent in 2023. Independent voters, on the other hand, have remained steady in their approval of same-sex relations. [[Business Insider]] noted that "The sharp drop in support among some Americans follows an especially aggressive year of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and politics.", including false allegations of "grooming".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Davis |first=Charles R. |date=June 21, 2023 |title=A majority of Republicans now say same-sex relations are immoral after a year of 'groomer' attacks on LGBTQ people, poll finds |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/majority-of-republicans-now-call-same-sex-relations-immoral-gallup-2023-6 |access-date=July 16, 2023 |website=Business Insider |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reddit]], [[TikTok]], [[Meta Platforms|Meta]] (parent company of [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]]) and formerly [[Twitter, Inc.|Twitter]] (prior to [[Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk|Elon Musk's buyout]] of the company) have said that using "groomer" as a slur against LGBT people violates their policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Drennen |first=Ari |date=July 23, 2022 |title=Twitter says slandering LGBTQ+ people as "groomers" violates its rules |url=https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/07/22/twitter-says-slandering-lgbtq-people-as-groomers-violates-its-rules/ |access-date=August 6, 2022 |website=Los Angeles Blade |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vox'' argued that the rhetoric which is used by proponents of the grooming conspiracy theory is similar to the rhetoric which was used by proponents of older conspiracy theories like the [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory]] and [[QAnon]]: "grooming accusations aren't concerned with making sense; they're about stirring up fear, anger, and hysteria — which is why they sound exactly like the kinds of fringe conspiracy theories that have been around for centuries. The new pedophile conspiracy rhetoric is essentially the same as all the old pedophile conspiracy rhetoric."&lt;ref name="VoxRomano2022" /&gt; 

Kristen Mark of the [[University of Minnesota Medical School]] has described the conspiracy as "a tool to create hysteria and to create a social panic", calling it "frankly inaccurate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 22, 2022|title=Republicans Went From Pushing a 'Groomer' Panic to Forcing Kids to Give Birth|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/republicans-went-from-pushing-a-groomer-panic-to-forcing-kids-to-give-birth|author-last=Clift|author-first=Eleanor|access-date=July 29, 2022|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Johnson of [[Ball State University]] has also described it as a moral panic, saying that there is "no better moral panic than a moral panic centered on potential harm to children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 13, 2022|title=Why So Many Conservatives Are Talking About 'Grooming' All Of A Sudden|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-so-many-conservatives-are-talking-about-grooming-all-of-a-sudden/|author-last=Rodgers|author-first=Kaleigh|access-date=July 29, 2022|work=[[FiveThirtyEight]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alejandra Caraballo of the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]] has described it as "an attempt at the [[dehumanization]] and [[delegitimization]] of queer people's identities by associating them with pedophilia", adding that "when you start labeling groups with that, the calls for [[violence]] are inevitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 12, 2022|title='Groomer,' 'pro-pedophile': Old tropes find new life in anti-LGBTQ movement|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/groomer-pedophile-old-tropes-find-new-life-anti-lgbtq-movement-rcna23931|author-last=Lavieties|author-first=Matt|access-date=July 29, 2022|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenifer McGuire, a professor in the department of family social science at the [[University of Minnesota]], said that the grooming conspiracy theory comes "from an underlying desire to separate people who are different and to characterize them as less than or as [[evil]].

The [[Canadian Anti-Hate Network]] has stated that trans people are "slandered the same way homosexual men were slandered in the 70s, and for the same reason: to deny them safety and equal rights", adding that "the far-right and their fellow travellers in the so-called Gender Critical or Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist movements use the exact same tropes in a bid to deny equal rights to trans persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 7, 2022|title=Trans People Are Being Slandered As Groomers And Pedophiles By The Far-Right|url=https://www.antihate.ca/trans_people_slandered_groomers_pedophiles_far_right|author-last=|author-first=|access-date=July 29, 2022|work=[[Canadian Anti-Hate Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florence Ashley]], a professor at the [[University of Toronto]], has stated that the conspiracy theory's focus on LGBT people in general and its focus on trans people in particular is being used to radicalize public opinion towards the far-right, comparing it to the [[Great Replacement|great replacement conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Logan |first=Nick |date=July 2, 2022 |title=Transphobia is gaining ground in the U.S. Gender-diverse people in Canada worry it could happen here |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-us-transgender-hate-1.6503087 |access-date=August 27, 2022 |website=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] described the conspiracy theory as "another volley in the [United States'] ongoing [[culture war]]s, during which conservative lawmakers have also opposed the teaching of '[[critical race theory]]' and proposed bills requiring schools to post all course materials online so parents can review them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=March 29, 2022 |title='Grooming': The ubiquitous buzzword in LGBTQ school debate |url=https://apnews.com/article/education-gender-identity-adf10ff5f169fae9c9af4d08a7b0c2bc |access-date=August 19, 2022 |website=AP NEWS |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2022, [[AP Stylebook|its stylebook]] stated: "Some people use the word ''groom'' or variants of it to falsely liken LGBTQ people's interactions with children, or education about LGBTQ issues, to the actions of [[Child sexual abuse|child molesters]].

Charles T. Moran, President of the [[Log Cabin Republicans]], called the conspiracy theory a "subtle subterfuge that gays are pedophiles", adding that "I will take flak from people that this is reinforcing a trope that is not beneficial for anybody who's gay in public life.

===Public opinion===
An April 2022 survey by left-wing think tank [[Data for Progress]] discovered that 45 percent of likely [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] voters believe that "teachers and parents that support discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity in school are groomers". American Jewish community related publication ''[[The Forward]]'' criticized the implications of this finding, noting the interconnected histories between [[hatred]] against Jews and against LGBT people due to the groups' shared labeling as supposedly corrupting children.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Berman |first=Nora |date=August 29, 2022 |title=Libs of Tiktok is fueling a pogrom against trans youth |url=https://forward.com/opinion/515868/libs-of-tiktok-is-fueling-a-pogrom-against-trans-youth/ |access-date=August 30, 2022 |journal=[[The Forward]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, 15 percent of likely Democratic Party voters think the same about the aforementioned assertion, which means that in overall terms approximately 29% of likely voters support the conspiracy theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2022-04-19 |title=EXCLUSIVE POLL: Americans Oppose the GOP's Anti-LGBTQ Rhetoric and Policies - UpNorthNews {{!}} Wisconsin News For You |url=https://upnorthnewswi.com/2022/04/19/exclusive-poll-americans-oppose-the-gops-anti-lgbtq-rhetoric-and-policies%ef%bf%bc/ |access-date=2023-08-27 |website=upnorthnewswi.com |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harm done to children through conspiracy theories==
[[Civil society]] organizations fighting on behalf of children's rights in the U.S. have expressed alarm over how right-wing efforts to use the physical and psychological abuse of minors as a partisan political matter damages efforts against [[child maltreatment]], particularly regarding victims of [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse as minors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blackford |first1=Linda |title=Child Sex Abuse is a Problem in KY, Nation.

In an interview with [[Phys.org]], Laura Palumbo, communications director for the [[National Sexual Violence Resource Center]] (NSVRC), commented "[m]any survivors may not even have disclosed (their experience) to their own friends, family and loved ones because of the shame and stigma that they face. And then to see that their stories are being tossed around by others to make a point about an unrelated issue does have a harmful impact".&lt;ref name="Keveney"/&gt; Jenny Coleman, director of Stop It Now!, remarked "It feels like child sex abuse prevention is being hijacked by people to fit an agenda that has absolutely nothing to do with preventing child sexual abuse."&lt;ref name="Keveney"/&gt;
