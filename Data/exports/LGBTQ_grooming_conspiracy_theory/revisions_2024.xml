The '''LGBTQ grooming [[conspiracy theory]]''' is a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] conspiracy theory and [[Anti-LGBTQ rhetoric|anti-LGBTQ trope]] alleging that [[LGBTQ people]], and those supportive of [[LGBTQ rights]], are engaging in [[child grooming]] and enabling [[child sexual abuse]]. Although the belief that LGBTQ individuals are more likely to molest children has no basis in fact, this [[stereotype]] has existed for decades in the United States and Europe, going back to before [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="IntelligencerKirchick2022" /&gt;

One survey by Courier Newsroom, a left-leaning [[think tank]], found that 55 percent of likely American voters oppose the conspiracy theory, while 29 percent believe it. Results were divided greatly on the basis of political party.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
Writing at ''[[Intelligencer (website)|Intelligencer]]'', columnist [[James Kirchick]] argues that the grooming conspiracy theory grew out of more generalized homophobic conspiracy theories which originated in Germany in the early 20th century, in particular the [[Eulenburg affair]].&lt;ref name="IntelligencerKirchick2022"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirchick |first1=James |date=May 31, 2022 |title=The Long, Sordid History of the Gay Conspiracy Theory |url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/the-long-sordid-history-of-the-gay-conspiracy-theory.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240921133817/https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/05/the-long-sordid-history-of-the-gay-conspiracy-theory.html |archive-date=September 21, 2024 |access-date=July 28, 2022 |website=[[Intelligencer (website)|Intelligencer]] |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affair received wide publicity and is often considered the biggest domestic scandal of [[Imperial Germany]]. It led to one of the first major public discussions of homosexuality in Germany, comparable to the trial of [[Oscar Wilde]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Steakley |first=James D. |title=Hidden From History: Reclaiming The Gay And Lesbian Past |publisher=New American Library |year=1989 |editor-last=Dubermann |editor-first=Martin |pages=325–326 |chapter=Iconography of a Scandal: Political Cartoons and the Eulenburg Affair in Wilhelmine Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 19th century ====
Scientific research began to explore the causes of homosexuality in the second half of the nineteenth century. Around 1850, French psychiatrist [[Claude-François Michéa]] and German physician [[Johann Ludwig Casper]] independently suggested that homosexuality [[Biology and sexual orientation|was caused by a physical difference]] from heterosexuals; the exact nature of this purported physical difference became a sought-after target of medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sedgwick |first=Eve Kosofsky |url= |title=Epistemology of the Closet |publisher=University of California Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-1-912453-27-6 |pages=47 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schwartz |first=Michael |date=2021-07-01 |title=Homosexuelle im modernen Deutschland: Eine Langzeitperspektive auf historische Transformationen |url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/vfzg-2021-0028/html |journal=Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte |language=en |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=377–414 |doi=10.1515/vfzg-2021-0028 |s2cid=235689714 |issn=2196-7121}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, many psychiatrists believed that homosexuality was [[Environment and sexual orientation|a product of environmental factors]] such as bad habits or [[Acquired homosexuality|seduction by older men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Samper Vendrell |first=Javier |title=The seduction of youth: print culture and homosexual rights in the Weimar Republic |date=2020 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-1-4875-2503-3 |series=German and European studies |location=Toronto |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 20th century ====

===== Interwar period: 1920s to 1930s =====
After World War I, a rise in the visibility of LGBT+ people in Germany led to an increase in the belief that there was an increase in the incidence of homosexuality among young men due to [[Gay recruitment|recruitment by adult gay and bisexual men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vendrell |first=Javier Samper |title=Seduction of Youth: Print Culture and Homosexual Rights in the Weimar Republic |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2020 |isbn=9781487525033 |pages=16–17 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s, backlash from psychologists and psychiatrists against [[Weimar culture|tolerance of LGBT+ people in Berlin]] suggested that homosexuality was a [[social contagion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Giles |first=Geoffrey J. |title=The Routledge history of the Holocaust |publisher=Routledge |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-203-83744-3 |editor-last=Friedman |editor-first=Jonathan C. |series=The Routledge Histories |location=London |pages=390–391 |chapter=The Persecution of Gay Men and Lesbians During the Third Reich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Whisnant |first=Clayton John |title=Queer identities and politics in Germany: a history, 1880-1945 |date=2016 |publisher=Harrington Park Press |isbn=978-1-939594-09-9 |location=New York (N. Y.) |pages=20–21, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SS newspaper ''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'' argued that 40,000 homosexuals were capable of "poisoning" two million men if left to roam free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zinn |first=Alexander |date=2020 |title=»Das sind Staatsfeinde«: Die NS-Homosexuellenverfolgung 1933–1945 ["They are enemies of the state": The Nazi persecution of homosexuals 1933–1945] |url=https://www.fritz-bauer-institut.de/fileadmin/editorial/publikationen/einsicht/Einsicht-2020_Einzelseiten.pdf |access-date=December 5, 2023 |website=Fritz Bauer Instituts |page=12 |issn=1868-4211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susanna Cassisa argues that this panic led to efforts, in 1929, to legalize same sex activities for men, but only for those over 21, thus "enshrining in the nation's penal code the unfounded belief that gay men were seducers of youths".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Susanna|last=Cassisa |date=2023-07-23 |title=Perspective {{!}} The 'groomer' anti-LGBTQ+ panic is not new — and has caused immense harm |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/made-by-history/2023/07/24/groomer-lgbtq-germany-children/ |access-date=2023-12-02 |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Weimar Republic, the Nazis promoted the idea that homosexuals seduced young men, permanently infecting them with homosexuality and preventing the youth from becoming fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Snyder |first=David Raub |title=Sex Crimes Under the Wehrmacht |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8032-0742-4 |pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USSR in 1933, Article 121 was added to the entire Soviet Union criminal code, making male homosexuality a crime punishable by up to five years in prison with [[Penal labour|hard labor]]. Though the precise reason for Article 121 is in some dispute among historians, government statements made about the law tended to confuse homosexuality with [[pedophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Healey |first=Dan |url=http://www.bibliovault.org/BV.landing.epl?ISBN=9780226322346 |title=Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: The Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent |date=2001 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-32234-6 |language=en |doi=10.7208/chicago/9780226922546.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law remained intact until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union when it was repealed in 1993 by the [[Russia|Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada |date=29 February 2000 |title=Russia: Update to RUS13194 of 16 February 1993 on the treatment of homosexuals |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6ad788c.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304115232/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6ad788c.html|archive-date=March 4, 2012|url-status=dead |access-date=2 December 2023 |website=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2015-09-24 |title=Homosexuality in the Soviet Union and in today's Russia|author=Buetikofer, Anne |translator=Kessi, Alain |url=http://www.savanne.ch/tusovka/en/pilot/homosexuality-russia.html |access-date=2023-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094522/http://www.savanne.ch/tusovka/en/pilot/homosexuality-russia.html |archive-date=September 24, 2015|website= Tusovka}} – Source: the Swiss lesbian magazine ''Die'', Number 9, Fall 1998, pp. 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Post-war period: 1945–1957 =====
In the post-war period, similar sentiments emerged in the USA; 21 states and the District of Columbia enacted laws between 1947 and 1955 which targeted gay and bisexual men as "sexual psychopaths". Many of these statutes conflated homosexuality with pedophilia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As part of the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] "[[Lavender Scare]]", the 1950 Hoey committee wrote to and interviewed medical personnel to ascertain, among other things, whether homosexual people would seduce younger men and women.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite magazine |first=Judith |last=Adkins |date=2016-08-15 |title=These People Are Frightened to Death |url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2016/summer/lavender.html |access-date=2023-12-02 |magazine=[[Prologue (magazine)|Prologue Magazine]]|volume=48|issue=2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee's final report, ''Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government'', included the accusation that homosexuals were a risk to younger people and that, "One homosexual can pollute a Government office."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

By 1952, the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association, officially classified homosexuality as a "sociopathic personality disturbance." In her investigation into the Lavender Scare in ''Prologue Magazine'', Judith Adkins claimed this framing contributed to increased persecution and prejudice in the following decades.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== 1958–1965 =====
In 1958 to 1965, the [[Florida Legislative Investigation Committee]], which had previously fought desegregation and attempted to investigate suspected communists, targeted LGBT+ people in Florida schools, arguing they were converting children to a homosexual lifestyle.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|first= Jillian |last=Eugenios |date=2022-04-14 |title=How 1970s Christian crusader Anita Bryant helped spawn Florida's LGBTQ culture war |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/1970s-christian-crusader-anita-bryant-helped-spawn-floridas-lgbtq-cult-rcna24215 |access-date=2023-12-02 |website=NBC News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Ryan has argued that it was common for racist groups to move onto LGBT+ people, under the guise of protecting children, when their campaigns against black people failed, saying, "They realize that this works, that this is the issue that will create a 'political moral majority.{{' "}}&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1961, the dramatic short social guidance propaganda film ''[[Boys Beware]]'' was released in the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[Inglewood, California]] through Sid Davis Productions with the cooperation of the city's police department and the Inglewood Unified School District. The film was narrated by a police detective on his way to a school meeting to discuss the issue of sexual predators who attempt to lure adolescent males. It attempted to educate about an alleged danger to young boys from predatory homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Garrison |first=J.

In 1977, [[Anita Bryant]] and the [[Save Our Children]] coalition also alleged that homosexuality was harmful to children, while they were attempting to repeal an ordinance that partly banned discrimination based on sexuality. Bryant claimed "homosexuals cannot reproduce, so they must recruit{{nbsp}}... the youth of America".&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Shortly afterward, the failed [[1978 California Proposition 6|Briggs Initiative]] sought to ban gay and lesbian teachers from working in California's public schools on the premise that their sexuality would "adversely affect students".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Secretary of State of California |title=California Voters' Pamphlet. pp. 29, 41. |url=http://library.uchastings.edu/ballot_pdf/1978g.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818145437/http://library.uchastings.edu/ballot_pdf/1978g.pdf |archive-date=August 18, 2006 |access-date=2023-12-02 |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Bryant, Hugh Ryan said, "they've already realized that they can harness this political conservatism and attach it to religion by talking about the family."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The co-executive directors of the [[National LGBTQ Task Force|National Gay Task Force]] later wrote an ironic thank you to Bryant; claiming her "Christian crusade" had drawn attention to the plight of LGBT+ people, they said Save Our Children were "doing the 20 million lesbians and gay men in America an enormous favor: They are focusing for the public the nature of the prejudice and discrimination we face."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===== 1980s =====
By 1981, Lou Sheldon, who described homosexuality as a "deathstyle," founded the Traditional Values Coalition (TVC) in the US. He suggested that grooming children was the real "[[homosexual agenda]]," saying, "They want our preschool children. [...] They want our kindergarten children. [...] They want our middle school and high school children." Sheldon later reportedly told columnist Jimmy Breslin in 1992, "Homosexuals are dangerous. [[Acquired homosexuality|They proselytize.]] They come to the door, and if your son answers and nobody is there to stop it, they grab the son and run off with him. They steal him. They take him away and turn him into a homosexual."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=A Dozen Major Groups Help Drive The Religious Right's Anti-Gay Crusade |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2005/dozen-major-groups-help-drive-religious-right%E2%80%99s-anti-gay-crusade |access-date=December 1, 2023 |website=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]|type=Intelligence report |date=April 28, 2005 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar sentiments were also espoused in the UK, with sex and relationships education seen as a route for LGBT+ people to groom children. In 1986, ''The Sun'' described the children's book ''[[Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin]]'' as a "vile" and "perverted" threat to British children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lovelock |first=Michael |date=2017-07-25 |title=Fifty years of gay rights but some in the British media are peddling the same homophobia |url=http://theconversation.com/fifty-years-of-gay-rights-but-some-in-the-british-media-are-peddling-the-same-homophobia-81465 |access-date=2023-12-02 |website=The Conversation |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the incident, Colin Clew wrote, "To the British media, it was nothing more than a homosexual recruiting manual that [[Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory|sought to undermine Western civilisation as we know it]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Clews |first=Colin |date=2012-06-28 |title=1983.

In the run-up to the 1987 UK election, both the right-wing media and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had begun increasingly criticizing the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] for supporting minorities such as LGBT+ people over the white, heterosexual majority. They referred to the pro-LGBT+ policies of Labour politicians and Labour-run local councils as proof they were part of a "[[loony left]]" intent on destroying British values.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Conservative election campaign featured a row of men wearing badges with slogans such as [[LGBT pride|"gay pride"]] and [https://lgbthistoryuk.org/wiki/Gay_Sports_Day "gay sports day"]; underneath, the advert said, "This is Labour's [[Camp (style)|camp]]. Do you want to live in it?" Recounting the period, writer [[Matthew Todd (writer)|Matthew Todd]] argued that, "[[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] presided over and took advantage of the most devastatingly homophobic time in recent British history" with the help of ''The Sun'' editor [[Kelvin MacKenzie]], amounting to [[Moral panic|"a campaign of deeply unpleasant propaganda"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Todd |first=Matthew |date=2013-04-10 |title=Margaret Thatcher was no poster girl for gay rights |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/10/margaret-thatcher-poster-girl-gay-rights |access-date=2023-12-02 |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 1987 debate for [[Section 28]], [[Dame Jill Knight]] of [[Collingtree]] said in Parliament, "Millions outside Parliament object to little children being perverted, diverted or converted from normal family life to a lifestyle which is desperately dangerous for society and extremely dangerous for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Amendment Of Local Government Act 1986, Volume 115: debated on Friday 8 May 1987 |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1987-05-08/debates/56966cfe-2ec6-450d-845e-95943f98c7d3/AmendmentOfLocalGovernmentAct1986 |access-date=December 1, 2023 |website=[[Hansard|Hansard, UK Parliament]] |date=May 8, 1987 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first= Colin |last=Clews |title=The Road to Section 28 |url=https://notchesblog.com/2017/09/26/the-road-to-section-28/ |access-date=December 1, 2023 |website=Notches |date=September 8, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Section 28]] proposed a ban on local authorities "[promoting] the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship", and came into effect the year after Knight's speech, in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Government Act 1988 Chapter 9|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/9/pdfs/ukpga_19880009_en.pdf|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|access-date=29 May 2015|date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Deirdrie Wood, Labour candidate in the 1987 Greenwich by-election, came to be known in the press as "Dreadful Deirdrie". Labour presented her as "a hard-working local woman with sensible policies", but the press portrayed her as a radical extremist by association, as an [[Irish Republican Army]] sympathiser living with a militant [[shop steward]] who was not the father of her children, and as a "hard left [[Feminism|feminist]], [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] and [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay-rights]] supporter" (as one ''[[News of the World]]'' report put it) who wanted to twin London schools with [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Thomas |first=James |title=Popular newspapers, the Labour Party and British politics |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |isbn=9780714653372 |location=London |pages=91–94 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 21st century ====

===== 2000s =====
In 2009, Timothy Matthews suggested that the [[Frankfurt School]] had as one of its aims the teaching of "sex and [[homosexuality]] to children". In the article (written from an explicitly [[Christian right]] perspective) in the [[Catholic]] weekly newspaper ''[[The Wanderer (Catholic newspaper)|The Wanderer]]'', he claimed the Frankfurt School was working under the influence of [[Satan]], to destroy the traditional Christian family using [[critical theory]] and Marcuse's concept of "[[polymorphous perversity]]", thereby [[Homosexual recruitment|encouraging homosexuality]] and "merging or reversing the sexes or sex roles" in order to break down the patriarchal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Timothy|last=Matthews|date=March 2009 |title=The Frankfurt School: Conspiracy to Corrupt |url=https://archive.org/details/the-frankfurt-school-timothy-matthews/page/10/mode/2up|page=10 |access-date=December 1, 2023 |work=Catholic Insight|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Andrew Woods wrote that the plot Matthews describes does not resemble the Frankfurt School so much as the alleged aims of communists in ''[[The Naked Communist]]'' by [[W.

#Continual change to create confusion
#The teaching of sex and [[homosexuality]] to children
#The undermining of schools' and teachers' authority
#Huge [[immigration]] to destroy identity
#The promotion of [[Alcohol abuse|excessive drinking]]

#An unreliable legal system with bias against victims of crime
#Dependency on the state or state benefits
#Control and dumbing down of media
#Encouraging the breakdown of the family&lt;/ref&gt;

===== 2010s =====
In 2010, after analyzing [[2008 California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]] voting patterns, David Fleischer (author of "The Prop. 8 Report") cited anti-LGBT+ advertising that depicted children acquiring homosexuality at school. The advert depicted a young girl encouraged by her school to marry a same-sex partner; Fleisher felt adverts such as this were instrumental in persuading parents to vote to ban same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michael|last=Martin |date=August 5, 2010 |title=Proposition Eight Had Broad Range Of Support, Opposition (transcript) |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129002763 |access-date=December 2, 2023|department=[[Tell Me More]] |work=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2013, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] signed into law a bill banning the [[Russian gay propaganda law|"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations"]] among minors, which prohibits the equation of same-sex and straight marital relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Elder |first1=Miriam |title=Russia passes law banning gay propaganda |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/russia-law-banning-gay-propaganda |website=The Guardian |date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vice News]]'' claims that many LGBT rights groups have been transformed "from being a stigmatized fringe group to full-blown [[Enemy of the people#Soviet Union|enemies of the state]]" in Russia following the introduction of this law, and that openly [[homophobic]] and [[neo-Nazi]] groups such as [[Occupy Paedophilia]] have been described by Russian authorities as "civil movements fighting the sins of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Larsson |first1=Milene |last2=Staff |first2=VICE |date=2014-01-13 |title=Young and Gay in Putin's Russia |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/vdpdqj/young-and-gay-in-putins-russia-part-1 |access-date=2023-12-22 |website=Vice |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2019, protesters have targeted [[Drag Queen Story Hour|drag queen story hour]] events at public facilities and private venues, often accusing performers and organizers of trying expose children to sexualized content. This included a petition by almost 100,000 Christians to the American Library Association, calling for the cancellation of drag queen story hour events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Flood |first=Alison |date=2019-08-07 |title=Protest seeks to stop US libraries supporting Drag Queen Story Hour |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/07/protest-seeks-to-stop-us-libraries-supporting-drag-queen-story-hour |access-date=2024-04-26 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== 2020 =====
In the United Kingdom, the conspiracy theory began to be popularized within the [[gender-critical]] movement around 2020. That year, anti-transgender activist [[Graham Linehan]] was banned from Twitter after he began to use ''OK groomer'' as a term of abuse against those who criticized his activism.&lt;ref name="DoddsIndependent"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Dodds |first1=Io |last2=Woodward |first2=Alex |date=April 14, 2022 |title=GOP 'groomer' smears are sparking a new wave of anti-LGBT+ violence: 'This is going to lead to tragedy' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/republicans-disney-groomer-harassment-lgbt-people-b2058272.html |access-date=May 27, 2022 |website=[[The Independent]] |quote=...{{nbsp}} trolls called on Twitter users to disrupt conversations among LGBT+ people with the phrase "OK groomer", a play on the Generation Z meme "OK boomer"{{nbsp}}...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inews" /&gt; The term ''OK groomer'' originated in 2020 as a play on ''[[OK boomer]]''.&lt;ref name="DoddsIndependent" /&gt;

In 2022, the ''groomer'' slur, and ''OK groomer'' in particular, became popular among Americans who also supported Florida Governor [[Ron DeSantis]]' controversial curriculum law, commonly called the "[[Florida House Bill 1557|Don't Say Gay]]" law by its critics.&lt;ref name="Dodds"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Dodds |first1=Io |last2=Woodward |first2=Alex |date=14 April 2022 |title=GOP 'groomer' smears are sparking a new wave of anti-LGBT+ violence: 'This is going to lead to tragedy' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/republicans-disney-groomer-harassment-lgbt-people-b2058272.html |access-date=27 May 2022 |website=The Independent |quote=...trolls called on Twitter users to disrupt conversations among LGBT+ people with the phrase "OK groomer", a play on the Generation Z meme "OK boomer"...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the Florida law and others like it, which seek to curtail or diminish [[LGBTQ-inclusive curricula in the United States|LGBT-inclusive content]] in classrooms, have described those opposed to the law as "groomers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Quay |first=Grayson |date=7 March 2022 |title=OK, groomer: Anyone who opposes Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' bill is 'probably a groomer,' DeSantis press secretary says |url=https://theweek.com/ron-desantis/1011011/anyone-who-opposes-floridas-dont-say-gay-bill-is-probably-a-groomer-desantis |access-date=27 March 2022 |website=The Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|first=Melissa Gira |last=Grant|date=March 17, 2022 |title="Grooming" Is Republicans' Cruel New Buzzword for Targeting Trans Kids |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/165761/republican-governors-grooming-crt-trans-rights |access-date=2024-04-26 |magazine=The New Republic |issn=0028-6583}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[The American Conservative]]''{{'}}s senior editor [[Rod Dreher]] labeled the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]]'s opposition to the Florida law as "pervy" in his article "Disney Goes Groomer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Dreher |first=Rod |date=28 March 2022 |title=Disney Goes Groomer |url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/walt-disney-groomer-children-lgbt-florida-law/ |access-date=27 May 2022 |website=The American Conservative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research from the [[Harvard Law School]]'s Cyber Law Clinic, tracking use of the phrase ''OK groomer'' on Twitter, noted that its use began to surge in early 2022, reaching a peak of 7,959 mentions on 29 March of that year, one day after the Florida bill became law.&lt;ref name="Dodds" /&gt;

Following the [[Wi Spa controversy]]&amp;nbsp;in July 2021, [[Julia Serano]] noted a rise in false accusations of grooming directed towards transgender people, saying that it appeared as if there was a movement to "lay the foundation for just smearing all trans people as child sexual predators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Sam |last1=Levin |first2=Lois |last2=Beckett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/28/anti-trans-video-los-angeles-protest-wi-spa |title='A nightmare scenario': How an anti-trans Instagram post led to violence in the streets |website=The Guardian |date=July 28, 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, numerous right wing pundits have described the behavior of parents and teachers who support minors in their transgender identities as grooming, and the term ''groomer'' has widely been used by conservative media and politicians who want to denounce the LGBT community and its allies by implying that they are pedophiles or pedophile-enablers.&lt;ref name="VoxRomano2022" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/g5q9vx/child-grooming-lgbtq-smear |title=Conservatives Are Smearing 'Don't Say Gay' Opponents as Pedophile 'Groomers' |last1=Cameron |first1=Joseph |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=April 5, 2022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate Magazine]]'' later described the word ''grooming'' as "the buzzword of the season".&lt;ref name="SlateMathisLilly2022" /&gt;

In June 2022, members of the far-right group [[Proud Boys]] disrupted a Drag Queen Story Hour at San Lorenzo Library in California, shouting insults like "groomer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first= Brandon |last=Tensley |title=Proud Boys crashed Drag Queen Story Hour at a local library.

In August 2022, a joint report published by the American [[Human Rights Campaign]] and the British [[Center for Countering Digital Hate]] revealed that the 500 most influential hateful "grooming" tweets were seen 72 million times, and it also stated that "grooming" tweets from just ten influential sources were seen 48 million times. It also revealed that [[Meta Platforms|Meta]], formerly known as Facebook, had accepted up to $24,987 for advertisements which pushed the grooming conspiracy theory. The advertisements had been served to users over 2.1 million times, and [[Twitter]], despite saying that groomer slurs were violations of its hate speech policy, failed to act on 99% of tweets which were reported as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Imran |last=Ahmed|date=August 2022 |url=https://counterhate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CCDH-HRC-Digital-Hate-Report-2022-single-pages.pdf |title=Digital Hate: Social Media's Role in Amplifying Dangerous Lies About LGBTQ+ people |publisher=[[Center for Countering Digital Hate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also recorded a 406% increase in the use of tweets associating members of the LGBT community with being "groomers", "pedophiles", and "predators" following the passage of Florida's [[Florida Parental Rights in Education Act|Parental Rights in Education Act]], called the "Don't Say Gay Law" by its critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Jo |last=Yurcaba |title=After ' Don't Say Gay' bill passed, LGBTQ online hate surged 400% |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/-dont-say-gay-bill-passed-lgbtq-online-hate-surged-400-rcna42617 |access-date=August 22, 2022 |website=NBC News |date=August 12, 2022 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2023, [[Emma Nicholson, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne]] wrote to Tate Britain to complain about a proposed Drag Queen Story Hour event, saying drag was "adult sexualised entertainment" and that the event was propaganda for "queer ideology". When the event took place, in February, white nationalist hate group [[Patriotic Alternative]] led 30 people in demonstrating outside Tate Britain. The protesters held signs saying "groom dogs not children"; they were opposed by [[Stand Up to Racism]]. The protest turned violent with one protestor arrested for making racially aggravated comments to a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Geraldine Kendall |last=Adams |date=2023-02-14 |title=Protesters clash outside Tate Britain over Drag Queen Story Hour |url=https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/2023/02/protesters-clash-outside-tate-britain-over-drag-queen-story-hour/ |access-date=2024-04-26 |website=Museums Association |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2023, three protesters disrupted drag performer Medulla Oblongata's storytime reading session at the [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] Library in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. The reading session was part of "Pride Fest Out West", which involved dancing, songs, and stories told by a drag performer.

Also in March, a show called CabaBabaRave for mothers and infants was forced to be canceled after footage of performers was shared on social media by conservative pages. CabaBabaRave's website, Instagram, and Facebook pages were also forced to be made private.

A March 2023 report by the [[Center for Countering Digital Hate]] (CCDH) found that tweets on Twitter linking LGBT people to "grooming" have increased by 119 percent since Elon Musk purchased the social media platform in October 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Muldowney |first=Decca |date=March 28, 2023 |title=Elon Musk's Twitter Makes Millions Off Anti-LGBT 'Groomer' Tweets: Report |language=en |work=The Daily Beast |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musks-twitter-makes-millions-off-anti-lgbt-groomer-tweets-report |access-date=July 16, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 2023 poll by Gallup found that only 41 percent of Republicans think that same-sex relations are morally acceptable, a 15 percent drop from 2022, while Democratic approval of same-sex relations also fell from 85 percent in 2022 to 79 percent in 2023. Independent voters, on the other hand, have remained steady in their approval of same-sex relations. ''[[Business Insider]]'' noted that "The sharp drop in support among some Americans follows an especially aggressive year of anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and politics", including false allegations of "grooming".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Davis |first=Charles R. |date=June 21, 2023 |title=A majority of Republicans now say same-sex relations are immoral after a year of 'groomer' attacks on LGBTQ people, poll finds |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/majority-of-republicans-now-call-same-sex-relations-immoral-gallup-2023-6 |access-date=July 16, 2023 |website=Business Insider |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "groomer" conspiracy theory has also been noted as instrumental in motivating Uganda's [[Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2023|"kill the gays" bill]], after American evangelists including [[Scott Lively]], Don Schmierer and Caleb Lee Brundidge allegedly held a three-day seminar called "Exposing the Truth Behind Homosexuality and the [[Gay agenda|Homosexual Agenda]]" in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Okereke |first=Caleb |date=2023-11-27 |title=How U.S. Evangelicals Helped Homophobia Flourish in Africa |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/03/19/africa-uganda-evangelicals-homophobia-antigay-bill/ |access-date=2023-12-02 |website=Foreign Policy |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Sonia |last=Scherr|date=March 2, 2010|title=U.S. Anti-Gay Activists Under Fire for Role in Uganda |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2010/us-anti-gay-activists-under-fire-role-uganda |access-date=2023-12-22 |website=Southern Poverty Law Center |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Reddit]], [[TikTok]], [[Meta Platforms|Meta]] (parent company of [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]]) and formerly [[Twitter, Inc.|Twitter]] (prior to [[Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk|Elon Musk's buyout]] of the company) have said that using ''groomer'' as a slur against LGBT people violates their policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Drennen |first=Ari |date=July 23, 2022 |title=Twitter says slandering LGBTQ+ people as "groomers" violates its rules |url=https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/07/22/twitter-says-slandering-lgbtq-people-as-groomers-violates-its-rules/ |access-date=August 6, 2022 |website=Los Angeles Blade |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; R.G. Cravens of [[California Polytechnic State University]] has described the conspiracy as "completely, patently false".&lt;ref name="Keveney" /&gt;

According to Bryn Nelson in ''Scientific American'', conspiracy theories based on pedophilia use disgust as a form of "stochastic terrorism", that incites audiences already primed for violence to target the subjects of those conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Nelson |first=Bryn |date=2023-05-01 |title=How Stochastic Terrorism Uses Disgust to Incite Violence |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-stochastic-terrorism-uses-disgust-to-incite-violence/ |access-date=2023-12-22 |website=Scientific American |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vox'' argued that the rhetoric which is used by proponents of the grooming conspiracy theory is similar to the rhetoric which was used by proponents of older conspiracy theories like the [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory]] and [[QAnon]]: "grooming accusations aren't concerned with making sense; they're about stirring up fear, anger, and hysteria — which is why they sound exactly like the kinds of fringe conspiracy theories that have been around for centuries. The new pedophile conspiracy rhetoric is essentially the same as all the old pedophile conspiracy rhetoric."&lt;ref name="VoxRomano2022" /&gt;

Kristen Mark of the [[University of Minnesota Medical School]] has described the conspiracy as "a tool to create hysteria and to create a social panic", calling it "frankly inaccurate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 22, 2022|title=Republicans Went From Pushing a 'Groomer' Panic to Forcing Kids to Give Birth|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/republicans-went-from-pushing-a-groomer-panic-to-forcing-kids-to-give-birth|author-last=Clift|author-first=Eleanor|access-date=July 29, 2022|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Johnson of [[Ball State University]] has also described it as a [[moral panic]], saying that there is "no better moral panic than a moral panic centered on potential harm to children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 13, 2022|title=Why So Many Conservatives Are Talking About 'Grooming' All Of A Sudden|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-so-many-conservatives-are-talking-about-grooming-all-of-a-sudden/|author-last=Rodgers|author-first=Kaleigh|access-date=July 29, 2022|work=[[FiveThirtyEight]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alejandra Caraballo of the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society]] has described it as "an attempt at the [[dehumanization]] and [[delegitimization]] of queer people's identities by associating them with pedophilia", adding that "when you start labeling groups with that, the calls for [[violence]] are inevitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 12, 2022|title='Groomer,' 'pro-pedophile': Old tropes find new life in anti-LGBTQ movement|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/groomer-pedophile-old-tropes-find-new-life-anti-lgbtq-movement-rcna23931|author-last=Lavieties|author-first=Matt|access-date=July 29, 2022|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenifer McGuire, a professor in the department of family social science at the [[University of Minnesota]], said that the grooming conspiracy theory comes "from an underlying desire to separate people who are different and to characterize them as less than or as [[evil]]. So it's a new form of homophobia and transphobia — or it's maybe the same old form but with new language."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Canadian Anti-Hate Network]] has stated that trans people are "slandered the same way homosexual men were slandered in the 70s, and for the same reason: to deny them safety and equal rights", adding that "the far-right and their fellow travellers in the so-called Gender Critical or Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist movements use the exact same tropes in a bid to deny equal rights to trans persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 7, 2022|title=Trans People Are Being Slandered As Groomers And Pedophiles By The Far-Right|url=https://www.antihate.ca/trans_people_slandered_groomers_pedophiles_far_right|author-last=|author-first=|access-date=July 29, 2022|work=[[Canadian Anti-Hate Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florence Ashley]], a professor at the [[University of Toronto]], has stated that the conspiracy theory's focus on LGBT people in general and its focus on trans people in particular is being used to radicalize public opinion towards the far-right, comparing it to the [[Great Replacement|great replacement conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Logan |first=Nick |date=July 2, 2022 |title=Transphobia is gaining ground in the U.S. Gender-diverse people in Canada worry it could happen here |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-us-transgender-hate-1.6503087 |access-date=August 27, 2022 |website=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] described the conspiracy theory as "another volley in the [United States'] ongoing [[culture war]]s, during which conservative lawmakers have also opposed the teaching of '[[critical race theory]]' and proposed bills requiring schools to post all course materials online so parents can review them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first1=Kimberlee |last1=Kruesi |first2=Karena|last2=Phan |date=March 29, 2022 |title='Grooming': The ubiquitous buzzword in LGBTQ school debate |url=https://apnews.com/article/education-gender-identity-adf10ff5f169fae9c9af4d08a7b0c2bc |access-date=August 19, 2022 |website=Associated Press |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2022, [[AP Stylebook|its stylebook]] stated: "Some people use the word ''groom'' or variants of it to falsely liken LGBTQ people's interactions with children, or education about LGBTQ issues, to the actions of [[Child sexual abuse|child molesters]].

Charles T. Moran, President of the [[Log Cabin Republicans]], called the conspiracy theory a "subtle subterfuge that gays are pedophiles", adding that "I will take flak from people that this is reinforcing a trope that is not beneficial for anybody who's gay in public life. Pedophiles exist at a much higher proportion in the straight community than the gay community, but it is always a shtick our critics will go back to."&lt;ref name=:7/&gt;

In 2023, the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] ruled that the word "groomer" is a slur when used to attack LGBT people and drag performers, and is therefore not protected speech under [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|anti-SLAPP laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Nofil |last=Nadeem|date=February 7, 2024 |title=Rainbow Alliance Dryden et Al. v Webster: Court Rules "Groomer" a Slur Against the 2SLGBTQ+ Community |url=https://www.oba.org/Sections/Sexual-Orientation-and-Gender-Identity-Law/Articles/Articles-2024/February-2024/Rainbow-Alliance-Dryden-et-Al-v-Webster-Court-Ru |access-date=2024-04-26 |website=[[Ontario Bar Association]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Public opinion===
In a 1970 poll, 70% of Americans surveyed believed that homosexuals posed a risk to children because of molestation.

By 1999, the belief that homosexuals were most likely to abuse children was only endorsed by a minority of 19% of heterosexual men and 10% of heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="herek"/&gt;

An April 2022 survey by the think tank [[Data for Progress]] found that a majority of 55% of likely voters rejected the label that "teachers and parents that support discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity in school are groomers" and only 29% of likely voters supported it.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|first=Keya|last=Vakil |date=2022-04-19 |title=Exclusive Poll: Americans Oppose the GOP's Anti-LGBTQ Rhetoric and Policies |url=https://upnorthnewswi.com/2022/04/19/exclusive-poll-americans-oppose-the-gops-anti-lgbtq-rhetoric-and-policies/ |access-date=2023-08-27 |website=Up North News |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broken down by party support, the survey found that 45% of likely [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] voters believe the label, contrasted to 29% of Independent voters and 15% of Democratic voters.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; American Jewish community related publication ''[[The Forward]]'' criticized the implications of this finding, noting the interconnected histories between [[hatred]] against Jews and against LGBT people, due to both groups being accused of corrupting children.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Berman |first=Nora |date=August 29, 2022 |title=Libs of Tiktok is fueling a pogrom against trans youth |url=https://forward.com/opinion/515868/libs-of-tiktok-is-fueling-a-pogrom-against-trans-youth/ |access-date=August 30, 2022 |journal=[[The Forward]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harm done to children through conspiracy theories==
[[Civil society]] organizations fighting on behalf of children's rights in the U.S. have expressed alarm over how right-wing efforts to use the physical and psychological abuse of minors as a partisan political matter damages efforts against [[child maltreatment]], particularly regarding victims of [[Child sexual abuse|sexual abuse as minors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blackford |first1=Linda |title=Child Sex Abuse is a Problem in KY, Nation.

In an interview with [[Phys.org]], Laura Palumbo, the communications director for the [[National Sexual Violence Resource Center]] (NSVRC), commented that "[m]any survivors may not even have disclosed (their experience) to their own friends, family and loved ones because of the shame and stigma that they face." She added, "And then to see that their stories are being tossed around by others to make a point about an unrelated issue does have a harmful impact". Jenny Coleman, the director of [[Stop It Now!]], also expressed frustration. She remarked, "It feels like child sex abuse prevention is being hijacked by people to fit an agenda that has absolutely nothing to do with preventing child sexual abuse."&lt;ref name="Keveney"/&gt;
