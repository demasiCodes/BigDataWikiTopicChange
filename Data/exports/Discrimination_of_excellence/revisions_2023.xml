==Foundation==
[[Discrimination]] is [[Injustice|unjust]] or [[Prejudice|prejudicial treatment]] of different categories of people or things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=97&amp;page=transcript "Transcript of Civil Rights Act (1964)"]. Retrieved July 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts exist to legally abolish, economically counter-weight and societally alleviate the negative consequences of discrimination around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ec.europa.eu/info/aid-development-cooperation-fundamental-rights/your-rights-eu/know-your-rights/equality/non-discrimination_en | title = Non-discrimination | date = August 19, 2020 | publisher = European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]s to the [[United States Constitution]] ban the federal and state governments from discriminating. The [[Employment discrimination law in the United States|United States Employment Discrimination]] laws seek to prevent discrimination based on race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, physical disability, and age by employers.  The [[United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] lists as especially sensitive areas of discrimination attention age, disability, equal pay and compensation, genetic information, harassment, national origin, pregnancy, race and color, religion, retaliation, sex and sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.eeoc.gov/ | title = Equal Employment Opportunity Commission | publisher = Equal Employment Opportunity Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[European Union]] introduced an Anti-Discrimination Directive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=166&amp;langId=en | title = European Union Anti-Discrimination Directive | publisher = European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ban discrimination on the grounds of age, disability, religion or belief and sexual orientation.  The [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] serves as legal protection against discrimination acknowledging equal rights for all human to be treated unbiased and with equal fairness and dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/5/the-treaty-of-lisbon | title = Treaty of Lisbon | publisher = European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Higher education discrimination==
Discrimination of excellence includes the [[2019 college admissions bribery scandal|2019 college admission fraud scandals]], standardized admission test outperformers [[Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College|suing a U.S. higher education institution]] and the [[United States Department of Justice]] scrutinizing higher education over potential systemic biases in college admission standards that would underweight transparent standardized testing criteria.&lt;ref name="Hartocollis"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/yale-discrimination.html | title = Justice Dept. Accuses Yale of Discrimination in Application Process | last = Hartocollis | first = Anemona | date = August 13, 2020 | work = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University and college admission]] and promotion criteria are critical career gatekeeping events, in which unexpectedly overweighting intransparent, non-merit based criteria can result in merit-based outperformers underperforming in admissions. [[Discrimination]] [[bias]] can occur in merit-based up-or-out placement and promotion criteria in hierarchical rank orders, when performance is partially measured on intangible or intransparent performance criteria implying potential economic inefficiency.&lt;ref name="Puaschunder1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puaschunder, Julia | title = Discrimination of Excellence: A Research Agenda| journal = Proceedings of the 14th International Research Association for Interdisciplinary Studies (RAIS) Conference at the Erdman Center of Princeton University | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–58 | date = August 2019 | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.3459603 | s2cid = 219357207| url = http://rais.education/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/009JP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic foundations&lt;!-- Did this section defined, economic growth, social enhancement and cultural achievement, by only luxury consumption?    --&gt;==
Outperformance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/outperformance | title = Outperformance | publisher = Cambridge Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the foundation of excellence. [[Overachievement]] is related to [[investment]]s.  Outperformance and overachievement are bases of the intellectual [[elites]]{{Clarify|date=January 2022}} and related to [[Luxury goods|luxury]] [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].&lt;ref name = Thomai&gt;{{cite book | first = Thomaï | last = Serdari | editor-last = Armitage | editor-first = J. | editor2-last = Roberts | editor2-first = J. | chapter = Experiments in Suchness: Hiroshi Sugimoto’s Silk Shiki for Hermès | title = Critical Luxury Studies: Art, Design, Media| year = 2016 | pages = 130–50 | location = Edinburgh | publisher = Edinburgh University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Overachievement]] may instigate economic growth. [[John Maynard Keynes]]' [[multiplier effect]] attributes investments of overachievers as some of the drivers of economic growth.  Investments of the striving elite multiply in economic spending in the overall economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money | title = The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money | publisher = John Maynard Keynes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=November 2020}} 

Consumption of the elite is an economic growth factor. [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s [[Trickle-down economics|trickling down]] of excellence emphasizes that [[Luxury goods|luxury]] [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] is a driver of [[economic growth]] and accelerator of social enhancement and cultural advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_the_Leisure_Class | title = The Theory of Leisure Class | publisher = Thorstein Veblen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=November 2020}} 

The [[The American Dream|American Dream]] ideals of striving to outperform are foundations of economic productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061815/how-does-notion-american-dream-influence-us-economy.asp | title = How Does the American Dream Influence the US Economy? | publisher = Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical foundations==
Slowing down overachievers and abolishing intellectual outperformance has occurred throughout history.  Various regimes attempted to eradicate, cut down or slow performance and discourage individual striving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/08/25/priority-people-killed-academics-1970s-cambodia/ | title = People were killed for being academics during the 1970's in Cambodia  | last = Radeska| first = Tijana | date = August 25, 2016 | publisher = The Vintage News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
