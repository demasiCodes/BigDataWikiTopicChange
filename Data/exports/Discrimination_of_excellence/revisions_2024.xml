[[Gifted education]] has been criticized on [[substantive equality]] grounds.&lt;ref name="Yoon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yoon |first1=So Yoon | last2=Gentry | first2=Marcia | title=Racial and Ethnic Representation in Gifted Programs | journal=Gifted Child Quarterly | publisher=SAGE Publications | volume=53 | issue=2 | year=2009 | issn=0016-9862 | doi=10.1177/0016986208330564 | pages=121–136|s2cid=143657431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College admissions==
[[Legacy preferences]] for college admissions have been criticized.&lt;ref name="m026"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hurwitz | first=Michael | title=The impact of legacy status on undergraduate admissions at elite colleges and universities | journal=Economics of Education Review | volume=30 | issue=3 | date=2011 | doi=10.1016/j.econedurev.2010.12.002 | pages=480–492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination against excellent students during admissions to [[Ivy League]] has been debated during [[2019 college admissions bribery scandal]].

==Severe discrimination of excellence==
Academics, teacher and students were intentionally targeted during [[Cambodian genocide]].&lt;ref name="q648"/&gt;
[[Khmer Rouge]] chose new teachers by [[ideology]], [[affirmative action]], and not by teaching excellence, which resulted in high [[literacy|illiteracy]].&lt;ref name="q648"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Clayton | first=Thomas | title=Building the New Cambodia: Educational Destruction and Construction under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-1979 | journal=History of Education Quarterly | volume=38 | issue=1 | date=1998 | doi=10.2307/369662 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
