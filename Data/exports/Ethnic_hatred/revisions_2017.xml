'''Ethnic hatred''', '''inter-ethnic hatred''', '''racial hatred''', or '''ethnic tension''' refers to feelings  and acts of [[prejudice]] and hostility towards an [[ethnic group]] in various degrees. See [[list of anti-ethnic and anti-national terms]] for specific cases. 

There are multiple origins for ethnic hatred and the resulting [[ethnic conflict]]s. In some societies it is rooted in [[tribalism]], while in others it originates from a history of non-peaceful co-existence and the resulting actual disputed issues. 

Often ethnic conflict is enhanced by [[nationalism]] and feeling of national superiority. For which reason inter-ethnic hatred borders with [[racism]], and often the two terms are conflated.

Ethnic hatred has often been exploited and even fueled by some political leaders to serve their agenda of seeking to consolidate the nation or gain electorate by calling for a united struggle against a common enemy (real or imaginary).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/ind-pak/2002/0707ethnic.htm Using Ethnic Hatred to Meet Political Ends] (about ethnic problems in Indian subcontinent)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In many countries [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred]] is a [[criminal offense]].
