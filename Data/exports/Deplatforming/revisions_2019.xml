{{Wiktionary|deplatform}}
'''Deplatforming''', also known as '''no-platforming''', is a form of [[political activism]] or [[prior restraint]] by an individual, group, or organization with the goal of shutting down controversial speakers or speech, or denying them access to a venue in which to express their opinion. Tactics used to achieve this goal among community groups include [[direct action]], and [[Internet activism]]. It is also a method used by [[social media]] and other [[technology companies]] to selectively suspend, ban, or otherwise restrict access to their [[computing platform|platform]] by users who have allegedly violated the platform's [[terms of service]], particularly terms regarding [[hate speech]].

Banking and financial service providers, among other companies, have also denied services to controversial activists or organizations, a practice known as '''financial deplatforming'''. The term ''deplatforming'' also refers generally to tactics, often organized using social media, for preventing controversial speakers or speech from being heard. Deplatforming tactics have included disruption of speeches, attempts to have speakers disinvited to a venue or event, and various forms of personal harassment including efforts to have an individual fired or [[blacklist (employment)|blacklist]]ed.

== Invited speakers ==

In the United States, banning of speakers on University campuses dates to the 1940s.  This was carried out by policies of the universities themselves.  The [[University of California]], for example, had a policy known as the Speaker Ban codified in university regulations under President [[Robert Gordon Sproul]], mostly, but not exclusively, targeting [[Communism in America|Communists]]. One rule stated that "the University assumed the right to prevent exploitation of its prestige by unqualified persons or by those who would use it as a platform for propaganda."  This rule was used in 1951 to block [[Max Schachtman]], a [[socialist]], from speaking at the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. But it was not always used against Communists (or socialists): in 1961, [[Malcolm X]] was banned from speaking at Berkeley as a religious leader, whereas the white Protestant evangelist [[Billy Graham]] spoke the next year.  In 1947, former U.S. Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] was banned from speaking at [[UCLA]] because of his views on U.S. cold war policy.&lt;ref name=Freeman-2000&gt;{{cite web |title=A Short History of the University of California Speaker Ban |last1=Freeman |first1=Jo |authorlink=Jo Freeman |url=https://www.jofreeman.com/sixtiesprotest/speakerban.htm |date=2000 |website=JoFreeman.com |publisher= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=23 May 2019 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversial speakers invited to appear on college campuses have faced deplatforming in the form of attempts to disinvite them or to prevent them from speaking.&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; The British [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] established its [[No Platform]] policy as early as 1973.&lt;ref name=Socialist/&gt;

In the United States, recent examples include [[Charles Murray (political scientist)#Public Speech and Protest at Middlebury College|the March 2017 disruption]] of a public speech by political scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]] at [[Middlebury College]] by violent protesters.&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; In February 2018, students at the [[University of Central Oklahoma]] rescinded a speaking invitation to creationist [[Ken Ham]], after pressure from an [[LGBT]] student group.&lt;ref name=Hinton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Causey/&gt; In March 2018, a "small group of protesters" at [[Lewis &amp; Clark Law School]] attempted to stop a speech by visiting lecturer [[Christina Hoff Sommers]].&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; {{As of|April 2019}}, the [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]], a speech advocacy group, documented 390 disinvitation or disruption attempts at American campuses since 2000.&lt;ref name=FIRE-DB/&gt;&lt;ref name=FIRE-Guide/&gt;

Graduation speakers, in particular, have often been disinvited or forced to withdraw in the face of protests and other efforts to deny the opportunity to speak.&lt;ref name=Lederman/&gt;&lt;ref name=New/&gt; According to ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', "Planned commencement speakers have been disinvited from or backed out of various talks in recent years amid pressure from campus groups – usually students", as with [[Haverford College|Haverford]]'s cancellation of a planned address by former [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] [[Robert J. Birgeneau|Robert Birgeneau]].&lt;ref name=Flaherty/&gt; Birgeneau's replacement as speaker, former [[Princeton University|Princeton]] president [[William G. Bowen|William Bowen]], responded in his own address by calling the suppression of speech "a defeat, pure and simple, for Haverford – no victory for anyone who believes, as I think most of us do, in both openness to many points of view and mutual respect."&lt;ref name=Lederman/&gt;

Other notably deplatformed commencement speakers in 2014 included [[International Monetary Fund]] head [[Christine Lagarde]], who withdrew after students circulated a petition at [[Smith College]],&lt;ref name=Lederman/&gt; and former [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] at [[Rutgers University]]. After Rice was announced as commencement speaker, a student group staged a [[sit-in]] and Rutgers' [[Academic senate#United States|faculty council]] passed a resolution that labeled Rice a "[[war criminal]]", causing Rice to withdraw from the ceremony.&lt;ref name=New/&gt; In some cases, opposition to a commencement speaker arises primarily from faculty members, as with [[Ursinus College]]'s 2017 disinvitation of journalist [[Juan Williams]], a political analyst for [[Fox News]].&lt;ref name=Flaherty/&gt;

Deplatforming efforts have also extended to corporate invitations. On March 26, 2019, Google announced an external [[advisory board]] to consider ethical issues around its [[artificial intelligence]] projects.&lt;ref name=ReutersMishra/&gt; The board's eight appointed members included [[Kay Coles James]], president of [[the Heritage Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt; Within days, 1,600 Google employees had signed an open petition seeking to remove James from the board.&lt;ref name=Lecher/&gt; Employees had stated on Google's internal message boards that a person with James' [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] views about [[Climate change policy of the United States|climate change policy]], [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], and [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]] "doesn't deserve a Google-legitimized platform."&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lecher/&gt; On April 4, Google dissolved the advisory board, stating, "It's become clear that in the current environment, [the board] can't function as we wanted."&lt;ref name=ReutersMishra/&gt;

== Social media ==
As early as 2015, platforms such as [[Reddit]] began to enforce selective bans based, for example, on [[terms of service]] prohibiting "[[hate speech]]".&lt;ref name=ACM/&gt; According to technology journalist [[Declan McCullagh]], "[[Silicon Valley]]'s efforts to pull the plug on dissenting opinions" began around 2018 with [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[YouTube]] denying service to selected users of their platforms, "devising excuses to suspend ideologically disfavored accounts."&lt;ref name=McCullagh/&gt;

Law professor [[Glenn Reynolds]] dubbed 2018 the "Year of Deplatforming", in an August 2018 article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; According to Reynolds, in 2018 "the internet giants decided to slam the gates on a number of people and ideas they don't like. If you rely on someone else's platform to express unpopular ideas, especially ideas on the right, you're now at risk."&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; Reynolds cited [[Alex Jones]], [[Gavin McInnes]], and [[Dennis Prager]] as prominent 2018 victims of deplatforming based on their political views, noting, "Extremists and controversialists on the left have been relatively safe from deplatforming."&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt;

Deplatforming has typically targeted individuals or organizations who use free accounts on social media platforms. In February 2019, McCullagh predicted that paying customers would become targets for deplatforming as well, citing protests and open letters by employees of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Microsoft]], [[Salesforce.com|Salesforce]], and [[Google]] who opposed policies of [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), and who reportedly sought to influence their employers to deplatform the agency and its contractors.&lt;ref name=McCullagh/&gt;

Supporters of deplatforming have justified the action on the grounds that it produces the desired effect of reducing what they characterize as "hate speech".&lt;ref name=ACM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Koebler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wong/&gt; Angelo Carusone, president of the  [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] organization [[Media Matters for America]] and who had run deplatforming campaigns against conservative talk hosts [[Rush Limbaugh]] [[Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy|in 2012]] and [[Glenn Beck]] [[Glenn Beck Program#Boycotts|in 2010]], pointed to Twitter's 2016 ban of [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], stating that "the result was that he lost a lot.... He lost his ability to be influential or at least to project a veneer of influence."&lt;ref name=Koebler/&gt;

=== Twitter ===
{{Main|Twitter suspensions}}
Twitter has been described as vulnerable to manipulation by users who may coordinate in large numbers to flag politically controversial tweets as allegedly violating the platform's policies.&lt;ref name=Holt/&gt; The platform has long been criticized for its failure to provide details of underlying alleged policy violations to the subjects of [[Twitter suspensions]] and bans.&lt;ref name=Ohlheiser/&gt;

In July 2018, Twitter was accused of "[[shadow banning]]" prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians and conservative users, as a result of its implementation of a "quality filter" to hide content and users deemed "low quality" from search results and to limit the visibility of their tweets.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stack/&gt; Twitter later acknowledged the existence of the problem and characterized it as a [[software bug]] that it was working to correct, stating that its "behavioral ranking doesn't make judgements based on political views or the substance of tweets".&lt;ref name=Krishna/&gt;

In February 2019, Canadian journalist [[Meghan Murphy]] filed a lawsuit against Twitter for permanently banning her in 2018 based on its policy against [[misgendering]], which Murphy called "viewpoint-based censorship".&lt;ref name=Naham/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wells2/&gt;

=== Facebook and Instagram ===
{{See also|Criticism of Facebook#Censorship}}
On May 2, 2019, [[Facebook]] and the Facebook-owned platform [[Instagram]] announced a ban of "dangerous individuals and organizations" that included [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Louis Farrakhan]], along with Milo Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones and his organization [[InfoWars]], [[Paul Joseph Watson]], [[Laura Loomer]], and [[Paul Nehlen]].&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lorenz/&gt; Unlike the personal bans that removed the accounts of the named individuals, the ban on InfoWars as an organization extends to all users by prohibiting any content that contains or quotes material from InfoWars.&lt;ref name=Lorenz/&gt; Facebook and Instagram stated that such content would be removed, regardless of who posts it, unless the post is made to explicitly condemn the content.&lt;ref name=Lorenz/&gt; [[Cybersecurity]] columnist Joseph Steinberg wrote that such actions threaten to "undermine one of America’s most basic and valued principles," and called on the federal government to extend civil rights protections to social media users.&lt;ref name=Steinberg1/&gt;

Financial service providers have deplatformed controversial speakers and organizations by denying them business services such as credit card [[payment processor|payment processing]], effectively limiting their ability to raise funds, accept payments, or sell items online.

Retailers associated with the [[Seneca Nation of Indians]] and other native tribes in the state of [[New York State|New York]] were financially deplatformed during [[Eliot Spitzer]]'s time as [[Attorney General of New York]] in 2006, as the state successfully ordered credit card companies and delivery services to refuse service to tobacco retailers on the Seneca Nation's reservations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2006/jan/jan26a_06.html "Attorneys General And Philip Morris USA Reach Landmark Agreement To Reduce Illegal Internet Cigarette Sales"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}, Office of the NY Attorney General&lt;/ref&gt; The deplatforming was part of a broader attempt to eliminate a price disparity between native tribes, which do not charge [[excise tax]]es on tobacco or gasoline sold by their members and have blocked state efforts to collect the taxes on their reservations (but have prosecuted non-native persons on the reservations for attempting to secure the same price protections), and the rest of the state, which charges high excise taxes, particularly on tobacco.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In 2018, [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]] stopped processing donations to the [[David Horowitz Freedom Center]] at the request of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC),&lt;ref name=Bois/&gt; an advocacy group which had [[List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as hate groups|listed the organization]] as a [[hate group]].&lt;ref name=Montgomery/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thiessen/&gt; [[Robert B. Spencer|Robert Spencer]], editor-in-chief of the publication ''[[Jihad Watch]]'', had previously been deplatformed from [[Patreon]] under pressure from MasterCard.&lt;ref name=Bois/&gt;

[[PayPal]], an online payment and funding platform, has terminated accounts of organizations that were accused of advocating racist views or promoting "hate, violence and intolerance."&lt;ref name=Jan/&gt; According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', PayPal banned at least 34 alleged hate groups in August 2017, after more than two years of "lobbying" by the SPLC.&lt;ref name=Jan/&gt; In February 2019, PayPal terminated the account of activist [[Laura Loomer]], who stated that she had also been banned from using [[GoFundMe]] and [[Venmo]] to raise funds, and from using [[Uber]] and [[Lyft]].&lt;ref name=Anapol/&gt;

In February 2018, [[First National Bank of Omaha]] became the first of several companies to cut ties with the [[National Rifle Association]].&lt;ref name=Hsu/&gt; A month later, on March 22, 2018, [[Citigroup]] announced that it would turn away business customers and commercial partners based on a new Citigroup policy restricting sales of [[firearm]]s, applying the policy to clients seeking to "borrow money, use banking services or raise capital through the company".&lt;ref name=Hsu/&gt;

[[Chase Bank]] closed the accounts of [[alt-right]] activist [[Proud Boys|Enrique Tarrio]] in February 2019, after which Tarrio was also deplatformed by credit card [[payment processor]]s [[First Data]], [[Square, Inc.|Square]], [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]], and PayPal, in addition to being banned from social media platforms.&lt;ref name=Glaser/&gt;&lt;ref name=Malkin/&gt;

== Harassment and threats to employment ==
Deplatforming tactics have also included attempts to silence controversial speakers through various forms of personal [[harassment]], such as [[doxing]],&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; the making of false emergency reports for purposes of [[swatting]],&lt;ref name=Shirek/&gt; and complaints or petitions to third parties. In some cases, protesters have attempted to have speakers [[Blacklist (employment)|blacklist]]ed from projects or fired from their jobs.&lt;ref name=ReutersMishra/&gt;

In 2019, for example, students at the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]] in Philadelphia circulated an online petition in an effort to remove [[Camille Paglia]] from the faculty.&lt;ref name=Friedersdorf/&gt; Paglia, a tenured professor for over 30 years who identifies as [[transgender]], had long been unapologetically outspoken on controversial "matters of sex, gender identity, and sexual assault".&lt;ref name=Friedersdorf/&gt; According to [[Conor Friedersdorf]], writing in ''[[The Atlantic]]'': {{quote |It is rare for student activists to argue that a tenured faculty member {{em|at their own institution}} should be denied a platform. Otherwise, the protest tactics on display at UArts fit with standard practice: Activists begin with social-media callouts; they urge authority figures to impose outcomes that they favor, without regard for overall student opinion; they try to marshal [[Anti-discrimination law|antidiscrimination law]] to limit [[freedom of expression]].&lt;ref name=Friedersdorf/&gt;}}

Friedersdorf pointed to evidence of a [[chilling effect]] on free speech and [[academic freedom]]. Of the faculty members he had contacted for interviews, a large majority "on both sides of the controversy insisted that their comments be kept off the record or anonymous. They feared openly participating in a debate about a major event at their institution—even after their university president put out an uncompromising statement in support of free speech".&lt;ref name=Friedersdorf/&gt;

== Other examples ==
=== Ravelry ===
[[Ravelry]], a site that describes itself as a "place for knitters, crocheters, designers, spinners, weavers and dyers to keep track of their yarn, tools, project and pattern information, and look to others for ideas and inspiration", announced a ban on "support of [[Donald Trump]] and his administration" on June 23, 2019.&lt;ref name=Bufkin/&gt; As its stated rationale for the ban, which extends to forum posts, projects, patterns, profiles, and all other content, Ravelry took the position that "Support of the Trump administration is undeniably support for [[white supremacy]]", and stated, "We cannot provide a space that is inclusive of all and also allow support for open white supremacy."&lt;ref name=Beck/&gt;

=== In print media ===
In December 2017, after learning that a French artist it had previously reviewed was a [[neo-Nazi]], the [[San Francisco]] punk magazine ''[[Maximumrocknroll|Maximum Rocknroll]]'' apologized and announced that it has "a strict no-platform policy towards any bands and artists with a Nazi ideology".&lt;ref name=MaxRock/&gt;
