'''Deplatforming''', also called '''no-platforming''', is a form of Internet censorship of an individual or group by preventing them from posting on the platforms they use to share their information/ideas. This typically involves suspension, outright bans, or reducing spread (shadow banning).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Good, The Bad, &amp; The Semantically Imprecise |date=August 10, 2018 |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/the-good-the-bad-the-semantically-imprecise-08102018 |access-date=2024-03-11 |website=www.merriam-webster.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Glenn Harlan |date=August 18, 2018 |title=When Digital Platforms Become Censors |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-digital-platforms-become-censors-1534514122?mod=rsswn |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330045941/https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-digital-platforms-become-censors-1534514122?mod=rsswn |archive-date=2019-03-30 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As early as 2015, platforms such as [[Reddit]] began to enforce selective bans based, for example, on [[terms of service]] that prohibit "[[hate speech]]".&lt;ref name="ACM2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chandrasekharan |first1=Eshwar |last2=Pavalanathan |first2=Umashanti |last3=Srinivasan |first3=Anirudh |last4=Glynn |first4=Adam |last5=Eisenstein |first5=Jacob |last6=Gilber |first6=Eric |date=November 2017 |title=You Can't Stay Here: The Efficacy of Reddit's 2015 Ban Examined Through Hate Speech |url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3134666 |journal=Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction |volume=1 |issue=CSCW |page=Article 31 |doi=10.1145/3134666 |s2cid=22713682}}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous example of deplatforming was [[Twitter|Twitter's]] ban of then-US President [[Donald Trump]] shortly after the [[January 6 United States Capitol attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Allyn |first1=Bobby |last2=Keith |first2=Tamara |date=January 8, 2021 |title=Twitter Permanently Suspends Trump, Citing 'Risk Of Further Incitement Of Violence' |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/954760928/twitter-bans-president-trump-citing-risk-of-further-incitement-of-violence |website=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Deplatforming of invited speakers ===
In the United States, the banning of speakers on university campuses dates back to the 1940s. This was carried out by the policies of the universities themselves. The [[University of California]] had a policy known as the Speaker Ban, codified in university regulations under President [[Robert Gordon Sproul]], that mostly, but not exclusively, targeted [[Communism in America|communists]]. One rule stated that "the University assumed the right to prevent exploitation of its prestige by unqualified persons or by those who would use it as a platform for propaganda."  This rule was used in 1951 to block [[Max Shachtman]], a [[socialist]], from speaking at the [[University of California at Berkeley]]. In 1947, former U.S. Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] was banned from speaking at [[UCLA]] because of his views on U.S. [[Cold War]] policy,&lt;ref name="Freeman-2000"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freeman|first1=Jo|author-link=Jo Freeman|year=2000|title=A Short History of the University of California Speaker Ban|url=https://www.jofreeman.com/sixtiesprotest/speakerban.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191208070157/https://www.jofreeman.com/sixtiesprotest/speakerban.htm|archive-date=2019-12-08|website=JoFreeman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1961, [[Malcolm X]] was prohibited from speaking at Berkeley as a religious leader.

Controversial speakers invited to appear on college campuses have faced deplatforming attempts to disinvite them or to otherwise prevent them from speaking.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; The British [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] established its [[No Platform]] policy as early as 1973.&lt;ref name="Socialist" /&gt; In the mid-1980s, visits by [[South Africa]]n ambassador [[Glenn Babb]] to Canadian college campuses faced opposition from students opposed to [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bueckert |first1=Michael |title=No platform for Apartheid |url=https://africasacountry.com/2018/04/no-platform-for-apartheid |access-date=2020-11-17 |work=africasacountry.com |date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, recent examples include [[Charles Murray (political scientist)#Public speech and protest at Middlebury College|the March 2017 disruption]] by protestors of a public speech at [[Middlebury College]] by political scientist [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]].&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; In February 2018, students at the [[University of Central Oklahoma]] rescinded a speaking invitation to creationist [[Ken Ham]], after pressure from an [[LGBT]] student group.&lt;ref name=Hinton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Causey/&gt; In March 2018, a "small group of protesters" at [[Lewis &amp; Clark Law School]] attempted to stop a speech by visiting lecturer [[Christina Hoff Sommers]].&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;  In the 2019 film ''[[No Safe Spaces]]'', [[Adam Carolla]] and [[Dennis Prager]] documented their own disinvitation along with others.&lt;ref name=NR-nss&gt;{{cite journal |title=In ''No Safe Spaces'', an Odd Couple Teams Up to Fight Free-Speech Bans |last=Fund |first=John |date=November 3, 2019  |journal=[[National Review]] |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/11/documentary-no-safe-spaces-adam-carolla-dennis-prager-fight-free-speech-bans/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218052250/https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/11/documentary-no-safe-spaces-adam-carolla-dennis-prager-fight-free-speech-bans/ |archive-date=2019-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|February 2020}}, the [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]], a speech advocacy group, documented 469 disinvitation or disruption attempts at American campuses since 2000,&lt;ref name=FIRE-DB/&gt; including both "unsuccessful disinvitation attempts" and "successful disinvitations"; the group defines the latter category as including three subcategories: formal disinvitation by the sponsor of the speaking engagement; the speaker's withdrawal "in the face of disinvitation demands"; and "[[heckler's veto]]es" (situations when "students or faculty persistently disrupt or entirely prevent the speakers' ability to speak").&lt;ref name=FIRE-Guide/&gt;

=== Deplatforming in social media ===
Beginning in 2015, [[Reddit]] banned several communities on the site ("[[subreddit]]s") for violating the site's anti-harassment policy.&lt;ref name=ACM/&gt; A 2017 study published in the journal ''Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction'', examining "the causal effects of the ban on both participating users and affected communities," found that "the ban served a number of useful purposes for Reddit" and that "Users participating in the banned subreddits either left the site or (for those who remained) dramatically reduced their hate speech usage. Communities that inherited the displaced activity of these users did not suffer from an increase in hate speech."&lt;ref name=ACM/&gt; In June 2020 and January 2021, Reddit also issued bans to two prominent online pro-Trump communities over violations of the website's content and harassment policies.

On May 2, 2019, [[Facebook]] and the Facebook-owned platform [[Instagram]] announced a ban of "[[Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy|dangerous individuals and organizations]]" including [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Louis Farrakhan]], [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], [[Alex Jones]] and his organization [[InfoWars]], [[Paul Joseph Watson]], [[Laura Loomer]], and [[Paul Nehlen]].&lt;ref name=Wells/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lorenz/&gt; In the wake of the [[2021 storming of the United States Capitol|2021 storming of the US Capitol]], Twitter banned then-president Donald Trump, as well as 70,000 other accounts linked to the event and the far-right movement [[QAnon]].

Some studies have found that the deplatforming of extremists reduced their audience, although other research has found that some content creators became more toxic following deplatforming and migration to [[alt-tech]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dehghan |first1=Ehsan |last2=Nagappa |first2=Ashwin |title=Politicization and Radicalization of Discourses in the Alt-Tech Ecosystem: A Case Study on Gab Social |journal=Social Media + Society |date=2022 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=205630512211130 |doi=10.1177/20563051221113075|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Twitter ====
On November 18, 2022, [[Elon Musk]], as newly appointed CEO of Twitter, reopened previously banned Twitter accounts of high-profile users, including Kathy Griffin, [[Jordan Peterson]], and The Babylon Bee as part of the new Twitter policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Elon Musk begins unbanning some high-profile Twitter accounts, starting with Jordan Peterson and Kathy Griffin |url=https://www.engadget.com/twitter-unbans-jordan-peterson-babylon-bee-kathy-griffin-204407440.html |access-date=2022-12-11 |website=Engadget |date=November 18, 2022 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2022-11-18 |title=Elon Musk begins reinstating banned Twitter accounts |url=https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/11/18/elon-musk-begins-reinstating-banned-twitter-accounts-no-decision-on-donald-trump-yet |access-date=2022-12-11 |website=euronews |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Musk exclaimed, "New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach".

==== Alex Jones ====

==== Donald Trump ====
{{Main|Donald Trump on social media}}
On January 6, 2021, in a [[joint session of Congress|joint session of the United States Congress]], the counting of the votes of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] was interrupted by a [[2021 storming of the United States Capitol|breach of the United States Capitol chambers]]. The rioters were supporters of President [[Donald Trump]] who hoped to delay and overturn the President's loss in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. The event resulted in five deaths and at least 400 people being charged with crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Capitol Siege: The Arrested And Their Stories|url=https://www.npr.org/2021/02/09/965472049/the-capitol-siege-the-arrested-and-their-stories|access-date=2021-04-18|website=NPR.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification of the electoral votes was only completed in the early morning hours of January 7, 2021. In the wake of several [[Donald Trump on social media|Tweets by President Trump]] on January 7, 2021 [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Reddit]], and [[Twitter]] all deplatformed Trump to some extent.&lt;ref name="Healey8jan2021"&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/opinion-took-mob-riot-twitter-005826415.html John Healy (January 8, 2021) Opinion: It took a mob riot for Twitter to finally ban Trump]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crichton9jan2021"&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/ Danny Crichton (January 9, 2021) The deplatforming of President Trump]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton6jan2021"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Newton |first=Casey |author-link=Casey Newton |date=2021-01-07 |title=It's time to deplatform Trump |url=https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217894/deplatform-trump-twitter-ban-facebook-youtube-congress-capitol-riots |website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= youtubeOneStrike &gt;[https://www.npr.org/2021/01/13/956317191/youtube-joins-twitter-facebook-in-taking-down-trumps-account-after-capitol-siege Jaclyn Diaz (January 13, 2021) YouTube Joins Twitter, Facebook In Taking Down Trump's Account After Capitol Siege]&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter deactivated his personal account, which the company said could possibly be used to promote further violence. Trump subsequently tweeted similar messages from the President's official US Government account @POTUS, which resulted in him being permanently banned on January 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=January 10, 2021|title=The expulsion of Donald Trump marks a watershed for Facebook and Twitter|newspaper=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/international/2021/01/10/the-expulsion-of-donald-trump-marks-a-watershed-for-facebook-and-twitter|access-date=2021-01-10|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter then announced that Trump's ban from their platform would be permanent.

Trump planned to rejoin on social media through the use of a new platform by May or June 2021, according to [[Jason Miller (communications strategist)|Jason Miller]] on a [[Fox News]] broadcast.&lt;ref name= pengelly &gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/21/trump-twitter-ban-social-media-own-platform Martin Pengelly (March 21, 2021) Trump will use 'his own platform’ to return to social media after Twitter ban]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= blogShutdown&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/trump-blog-page-shuts-down-for-good.html |title=Trump blog page shuts down for good |date=June 2, 2021 |work=CNBC |first=Kevin |last=Breuninger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same week Musk announced Twitter's new freedom of speech policy, he tweeted a poll to ask whether to bring back Trump into the platform.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |date=2022-11-20 |title=Musk lifts Donald Trump's Twitter ban |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63692369 |access-date=2022-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poll ended with 51.8% in favor of unbanning Trump's account.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Twitter has since reinstated Trump's Twitter account @realDonaldTrump (as of 19 Nov 2022 — but by then Trump's platform was [[Truth Social]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Hauck |first=Jessica Guynn and Grace |title=Will Donald Trump tweet again?

==== Andrew Tate ====
In 2017, [[Andrew Tate]] was banned from Twitter for tweeting that women should "bare some responsibility" in response to the #MeToo movement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Andrew Tate banned from YouTube, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/viral/andrew-tate-facebook-instagram-ban-meta-rcna43998 |access-date=2022-12-11 |website=NBC News |date=August 22, 2022 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in August 2022, Tate was banned on four more major social media platforms: Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These platforms indicated that Tate's misogynistic comments violated their hate speech policies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Boom |first=Daniel Van |title=Andrew Tate Is Back on Twitter.

Tate has since been unbanned from Twitter as part of the new freedom of speech policy on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{anchor|Financial services}}

====Demonetization====
Social media platforms such as YouTube and Instagram allow their content producers or influencers to earn money based on the content (videos, images, etc.), most typically based around some sort of payment per a set number of new "likes" or clicks etc. When the content is deemed inappropriate for compensation, but still left on the platform, this is called "demonetization" because the content producer is left with no compensation for their content that they created, while at the same time the content is still left up and available for viewing or listening by the general public.&lt;ref name="Vox on demonetization"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kafka |first1=Peter |title=YouTube 'demonetization,' explained for normals |url=https://www.vox.com/2016/9/4/12795214/youtube-demonetization-explainer |website=www.vox.com |date=September 4, 2016 |publisher=Vox |access-date=14 September 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2016, ''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'' reported that demonetization—as it pertained to YouTube specifically—involved the following key points:
* "Since 2012, YouTube has been automatically 'demonetizing' some videos because its software thought the content was unfriendly for advertisers."&lt;ref name="Vox on demonetization" /&gt;
* "Many YouTube video makers didn't realize this until last week, when YouTube began actively telling them about it."&lt;ref name="Vox on demonetization" /&gt;
* "This has freaked YouTubers out, even though YouTube has been behaving rationally by trying to connect advertisers to advertiser-friendly content. It's not censorship, since YouTube video makers can still post (just about) anything they want."&lt;ref name="Vox on demonetization" /&gt;
* "YouTube's software will screw things up, which means videos that should have ads don't, which means YouTube video makers have been missing out on ad revenue."&lt;ref name="Vox on demonetization" /&gt;

=== Other examples ===
Deplatforming tactics have also included attempts to silence controversial speakers through various forms of personal [[harassment]], such as [[doxing]],&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; the making of false emergency reports for purposes of [[swatting]],&lt;ref name=Shirek/&gt; and complaints or petitions to third parties. In some cases, protesters have attempted to have speakers [[Blacklist (employment)|blacklist]]ed from projects or fired from their jobs.&lt;ref name=ReutersMishra/&gt;

In 2019, students at the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]] in Philadelphia circulated an online petition demanding that [[Camille Paglia]] "should be removed from UArts faculty and replaced by a queer person of color." According to ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s [[Conor Friedersdorf]], "It is rare for student activists to argue that a tenured faculty member {{em|at their own institution}} should be denied a platform." Paglia, a tenured professor for over 30 years who identifies as [[transgender]], had long been unapologetically outspoken on controversial "matters of sex, gender identity, and sexual assault".&lt;ref name=Friedersdorf/&gt;

In December 2017, after learning that a French artist it had previously reviewed was a [[neo-Nazi]], the [[San Francisco]] punk magazine ''[[Maximumrocknroll|Maximum Rocknroll]]'' apologized and announced that it has "a strict no-platform policy towards any bands and artists with a Nazi ideology".&lt;ref name=MaxRock/&gt;

== Legislative responses ==
=== United Kingdom ===
In May 2021, the [[government of the United Kingdom|UK government]] under [[Boris Johnson]] announced a [[Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill]] that would allow speakers at universities to seek compensation for no-platforming, impose fines on universities and student unions that promote the practice, and establish a new [[ombudsman]] charged with monitoring cases of no-platforming and academic dismissals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-57076093|title=Universities could face fines over free speech breaches|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=May 12, 2021|accessdate=2021-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the government published an [[Online Safety Act 2023|Online Safety Bill]] that would prohibit social media networks from discriminating against particular political views or removing "democratically important" content, such as comments opposing or supporting political parties and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/may/12/uk-to-require-social-media-to-protect-democratically-important-content|title=Online safety bill 'a recipe for censorship', say campaigners|last=Hern|first=Alex|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=May 12, 2021|accessdate=2021-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Some critics of deplatforming have proposed that governments should treat [[social media as a public utility]] to ensure that [[constitutional right]]s of the users are protected, citing their belief that an [[Internet]] presence using social media websites is imperative in order to adequately take part in the 21st century as an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Thierer |first=Adam |title=The Perils of Classifying Social Media Platforms as Public Utilities |date=March 2012 |work=Mercatus Center |type=working paper |publisher=George Mason University |url=https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/PerilsClassifyingSocialMediaPublicUtilities.pdf|accessdate=2021-09-15 |language=English |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302164009/https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/PerilsClassifyingSocialMediaPublicUtilities.pdf |archive-date=March 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican politicians have sought to weaken the protections established by [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]]—which provides immunity from liability for providers and users of an "interactive computer service" who publish information provided by third-party users—under allegations that the moderation policies of major social networks are not politically neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Robertson |first=Adi |date=June 21, 2019 |title=Why the internet's most important law exists and how people are still getting it wrong |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700605/section-230-internet-law-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-jeff-kosseff-interview |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210226163950/https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700605/section-230-internet-law-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-jeff-kosseff-interview |archive-date=February 26, 2021 |access-date=July 17, 2019 |website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lecher |first=Colin |date=June 20, 2019 |title=Both parties are mad about a proposal for federal anti-bias certification |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18692829/section-230-hawley-bill-response-anti-bias-certification |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224205023/https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18692829/section-230-hawley-bill-response-anti-bias-certification |archive-date=February 24, 2021 |access-date=July 17, 2019 |website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brandom |first=Russell |date=June 17, 2020 |title=Senate Republicans want to make it easier to sue tech companies for bias |url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294032/section-230-hawley-rubio-conservative-bias-lawsuit-good-faith |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220163637/https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294032/section-230-hawley-rubio-conservative-bias-lawsuit-good-faith |archive-date=February 20, 2021 |access-date=June 17, 2020 |work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Makena |date=September 8, 2020 |title=Republicans pressure platforms with new 230 bill |url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21428079/republicans-pressure-platforms-230-bill-liability-protection-blackburn-lindsey-graham-wicker |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210228082730/https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21428079/republicans-pressure-platforms-230-bill-liability-protection-blackburn-lindsey-graham-wicker |archive-date=February 28, 2021 |access-date=September 8, 2020 |work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

=== Support for deplatforming ===
{{anchor|Defense}}{{See also|Paradox of tolerance|Defensive democracy}}
According to its defenders, deplatforming has been used as a tactic to prevent the spread of [[hate speech]] and [[disinformation]].&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; Social media has evolved into a significant source of news reporting for its users, and support for content moderation and banning of inflammatory posters has been defended as an editorial responsibility required by news outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yaraghi|first=Niam|date=January 10, 2021|title=How should social media platforms combat misinformation and hate speech?|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/04/09/how-should-social-media-platforms-combat-misinformation-and-hate-speech/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409120641/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/04/09/how-should-social-media-platforms-combat-misinformation-and-hate-speech/ |archive-date=April 9, 2019 |access-date=|website=Brookings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of deplatforming have justified the action on the grounds that it produces the desired effect of reducing what they characterize as hate speech.&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koebler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt; Angelo Carusone, president of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] organization [[Media Matters for America]] and who had run deplatforming campaigns against conservative talk hosts [[Rush Limbaugh]] [[Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy|in 2012]] and [[Glenn Beck]] [[Glenn Beck Program#Boycotts|in 2010]], pointed to Twitter's 2016 ban of [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], stating that "the result was that he lost a lot.... He lost his ability to be influential or at least to project a veneer of influence."&lt;ref name="Koebler" /&gt;

In the United States, the argument that deplatforming violates rights protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] is sometimes raised as a criticism. Proponents say that deplatforming is a legal way of dealing with controversial users online or in other digital spaces, so long as the government is not involved with causing the deplatforming. According to Audie Cornish, host of the [[NPR]] show ''Consider This'', "the government can't silence your ability to say almost anything you want on a public street corner. But a private company can silence your ability to say whatever you want on a platform they created."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Deplatforming: Not A First Amendment Issue, But Still A Tough Call For Big Tech : Consider This from NPR|language=en|website=NPR.org|url=https://www.npr.org/2021/01/22/959667930/deplatforming-not-a-first-amendment-issue-but-still-a-tough-call-for-big-tech|access-date=2021-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical responses ===
In the words of technology journalist [[Declan McCullagh]], "[[Silicon Valley]]'s efforts to pull the plug on dissenting opinions" began around 2018 with [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[YouTube]] denying service to selected users of their platforms; he said they devised "excuses to suspend ideologically disfavored accounts".&lt;ref name="McCullagh" /&gt; In 2019, McCullagh predicted that paying customers would become targets for deplatforming as well, citing protests and open letters by employees of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Microsoft]], [[Salesforce.com|Salesforce]], and [[Google]] who opposed policies of [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), and who reportedly sought to influence their employers to deplatform the agency and its contractors.&lt;ref name="McCullagh" /&gt;

Law professor [[Glenn Reynolds]] dubbed 2018 the "Year of Deplatforming" in an August 2018 article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Reynolds criticized the decision of "internet giants" to "slam the gates on a number of people and ideas they don't like", naming [[Alex Jones]] and [[Gavin McInnes]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt; Reynolds cited further restrictions on "even mainstream conservative figures" such as [[Dennis Prager]], as well as [[Facebook]]'s blocking of a campaign advertisement by a Republican candidate "ostensibly because her video mentioned the [[Cambodian genocide]], which her family survived."&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt;

In a 2019 ''[[The Atlantic]]'' article, [[Conor Friedersdorf]] described what he called "standard practice" among student activists. He wrote: "Activists begin with social-media callouts; they urge authority figures to impose outcomes that they favor, without regard for overall student opinion; they try to marshal [[Anti-discrimination law|antidiscrimination law]] to limit [[freedom of expression]]."&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf" /&gt; Friedersdorf pointed to evidence of a [[chilling effect]] on free speech and [[academic freedom]]. Of the faculty members he had contacted for interviews, he said a large majority "on both sides of the controversy insisted that their comments be kept off the record or anonymous. They feared openly participating in a debate about a major event at their institution—even after their university president put out an uncompromising statement in support of free speech."&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf" /&gt;
