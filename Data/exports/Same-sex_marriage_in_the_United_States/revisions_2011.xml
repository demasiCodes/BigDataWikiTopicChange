The federal government does not recognize '''same-sex marriage in the United States''', but such marriages are recognized by some individual states. The lack of federal recognition was codified in 1996 by the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], before Massachusetts became the first state to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2004. Such licenses are granted by six states: [[Same-sex marriage in Connecticut|Connecticut]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iowa|Iowa]], [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Same-sex marriage in New York|New York]], [[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]], plus [[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia|Washington, D.C.]] and [[Same-sex marriage under United States tribal jurisdictions|Oregon's Coquille and Washington state's Suquamish Indian tribes]]. Same-sex marriages could be legally performed in [[Same-sex marriage in California|California]] between June 16, 2008, and November 4, 2008, after which voters passed [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] prohibiting same-sex marriages.

==Legal issues==
{{See also|Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States}}

===Federal law===
The legal issues surrounding same-sex marriage in the United States are complicated by the nation's [[federalism|federal]] system of government. Prior to 1996, the federal government did not define marriage; any marriage recognized by a [[U.S. state|state]] was recognized by the federal government, even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more other states (as was the case with [[Anti-miscegenation laws|interracial marriage]] before 1967 due to [[anti-miscegenation laws]]). With the passage of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) in 1996, however, a marriage was explicitly defined in federal law as a union of one man and one woman. (See {{usc|1|7}}.)

DOMA has been under challenge in the federal courts, and on July 8, 2010, Judge [[Joseph Louis Tauro|Joseph Tauro]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|District Court of Massachusetts]] held that the denial of federal rights and benefits to lawfully married Massachusetts same-sex couples under the [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]] is unconstitutional, under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]].&lt;ref name="hrc.org"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/us/09marriage.html|title=Judge Topples U.S. Rejection of Gay Unions | work = [[The New York Times]] |date=July 8, 2010|accessdate=June 2, 2011|first1=Abby|last1=Goodnough|first2=John|last2=Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/09/judge-rules-federal-same-sex-marriage-ban-unconstitutional/?iref=allsearch&amp;fbid=2-HnSdp2S6g|title=Judge rules federal same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional|work=CNN|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling is currently under a [[Stay of proceedings|stay]], but would affect residents residing within the federal district that covers Massachusetts if the stay is lifted. If this decision is appealed and affirmed, the ruling could apply elsewhere in the U.S. For now, no act or agency of the federal government—except within the state of Massachusetts if the stay is lifted—may recognize same-sex marriage.

According to the federal government's [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|more than 1,138 rights and protections]] are conferred to U.S. citizens upon marriage by the federal government; areas affected include Social Security benefits, veterans' benefits, health insurance, Medicaid, hospital visitation, estate taxes, retirement savings, pensions, family leave, and immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf 2004 updated report of the GAO [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many aspects of marriage law affecting the day to day lives of inhabitants of the United States are determined by the states, not the federal government, and the Defense of Marriage Act does not prevent individual states from defining marriage as they see fit.

The United States Supreme Court in 1972 dismissed ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', a case originating in Minnesota, "for want of a substantial federal question". The [[Defense of Marriage Act]], as well as marriage laws in 45 states, could be affected by the outcome of ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'', a case challenging the validity of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California's Proposition 8]] under the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="protectmarriage.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectmarriage.com/trial |title=Yes on 8 » Perry v. Schwarzenegger |publisher=Protect Marriage |date=June 16, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State law===
{{See|Same-sex marriage law in the United States by state}}
{{Samesex marriage in USA map|align=left}}

Same-sex marriage is recognized only at the state level, as the federal [[Defense of Marriage Act]] explicitly bars federal recognition of such marriages.

Six state governments (along with the [[District of Columbia]], the [[Jeni and Kitzen Branting|Coquille Indian Tribe]], and the [[Suquamish tribe]]) have passed laws offering same-sex marriage: [[New York]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[Iowa]], [[Vermont]], and [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="Adams &amp; Crary 11-03-2009"&gt;Glenn Adams and David Crary, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8789627 "Maine voters reject gay-marriage law"], November 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In all six states, same-sex marriage has been legalized through legislation or court ruling.&lt;ref name="Adams &amp; Crary 11-03-2009"/&gt; Same-sex marriage has been legal in [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] since May 17, 2004; in [[Same-sex marriage in Connecticut|Connecticut]] since November 12, 2008;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-gaymarriage1011.artoct11,0,5399554.story State Supreme Court Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage]", ''[[Hartford Courant]]''&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Same-sex marriage in Iowa|Iowa]] since April 27, 2009;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/news/iowa-supreme-court-strikes-down-gay-marriage-ban/ |title=Iowa Supreme Court strikes down gay marriage ban &amp;#124; News Story on |publisher=365gay.com |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="365gay.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/news/iowa-gay-marriages-delayed/ |title=Iowa gay marriages delayed &amp;#124; News Story on |publisher=365gay.com |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]] since September 1, 2009; [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] since January 1, 2010; and [[Same-sex marriage in New York|New York]] since July 24, 2011.&lt;ref name="NYT_approval"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/25/nyregion/gay-marriage-approved-by-new-york-senate.html?pagewanted=all | title = New York Allows Same-Sex Marriage, Becoming Largest State to Pass Law | first1 = Nicholas | last1 = Confessore | first2 = Michael | last2 = Barbaro | work = The New York Times | date = June 24, 2011 | accessdate = June 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[New England]] became the center of an organized push to legalize [[same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Washington Times]]'': [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan/04/gay-marriage-backers-target-new-england/ Valerie Richardson, "Gay marriage backers target New England," January 4, 2009], Retrieved March 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; with four of the six states in that region granting same-sex couples the legal right to marry.

Out of 28 states where constitutional amendments or initiatives that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman were put on the ballot in a [[referendum|voter referendum]], voters in all 28 states voted to approve such amendments.&lt;ref&gt;Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin.

{{As of|2010|January}}, 29 states had constitutional provisions restricting marriage to one man and one woman, while 12 others had laws "restricting marriage to one man and one woman."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/documents/marriage_prohibitions_2009.pdf "Statewide Marriage Prohibitions"]&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteen states ban any legal recognition of same-sex unions that would be equivalent to civil marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/documents/marriage_prohibitions_2009.pdf Statewide Marriage Prohibitions] plus Kansas http://www.kslib.info/constitution/art15.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of same-sex marriage have worked to prevent individual states from recognizing same-sex unions by attempting to amend the [[United States Constitution]] to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In 2006, the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], which would prohibit states from recognizing same-sex marriages, was approved by the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] on a party-line vote and was debated by the full United States Senate, but was ultimately defeated in both houses of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/07/same.sex.marriage/index.html Senate blocks same-sex marriage ban]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}", [[CNN]], June 7, 2006, . Retrieved July 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to marry was first extended to same-sex couples by a United States jurisdiction on November 18, 2003, by a state Supreme Judicial Court ruling in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/11/18/sjc_gay_marriage_legal_in_mass/ |title=SJC: Gay marriage legal in Mass. |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=November 18, 2003 |accessdate=June 27, 2010 | first1=Kathleen | last1=Burge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2008, the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued a decision in which it effectively legalized same-sex marriage in [[California]], holding that California's existing opposite-sex definition of marriage violated the constitutional rights of same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/15/same.sex.marriage/index.html |title=California same-sex marriage ban struck down |publisher=CNN |date= May 16, 2008|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mercury_mintz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_9269719|title=California Supreme Court legalizes same-sex marriage|last=Mintz|first=Howard|date=May 15, 2008|publisher=Mercury News|accessdate=May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage opponents in California placed a state constitutional amendment known as [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] on the November 2008 ballot for the purpose of restoring an opposite-sex definition of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/us/15cnd-scene.html "Gay Couples Rejoice at Ruling"].

''[[The New York Times]]''. November 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, 2010, a decision by the U.S. District Court in ''[[Perry v.

On October 10, 2008, the Connecticut Supreme Court overturned the state's civil-unions statute (2005), as unconstitutionally discriminating against same-sex couples, and required the state to recognize same-sex marriages.

Same-sex marriage was legalized in [[Iowa]] following the unanimous ruling of the [[Iowa Supreme Court]] in ''[[Varnum v. Brien]]'' on April 3, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090403/NEWS/90403010 Unanimous ruling: Iowa marriage no longer limited to one man, one woman]'', ''[[Des Moines Register]]'', April 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was initially scheduled to take effect on April 24, but the date was changed to April 27 for administrative reasons.&lt;ref name="365gay.com"/&gt;

On April 7, 2009, [[Vermont]] legalized same-sex marriage through legislation. The Governor of Vermont had previously vetoed the measure, but the veto was overridden by the Legislature. Vermont became the first state in the United States to legalize same-sex marriage through legislative means rather than litigation.

On May 6, 2009, Maine Governor [[John Baldacci]] signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage, becoming the first state governor to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/index.php?topic=Gov+News&amp;id=72146&amp;v=Article-2006 |title=Office of the Governor: News &amp; Events: News Releases |publisher=Maine.gov |date=May 6, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legislation was stayed pending a vote and never went into effect. It was repealed by referendum in November 2009.&lt;ref name="Adams &amp; Crary 11-03-2009"/&gt;

On December 18, 2009, a same-sex marriage bill was signed into law by the Mayor of the District of Columbia;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrcbackstory.org/2009/12/mayor-adrian-fenty-signs-dc-marriage-bill/ Mayor Adrian Fenty Signs DC Marriage Bill]&lt;/ref&gt; same-sex marriage licenses became available in Washington, D.C. on March 3, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/gallery/2010/03/03/GA2010030301385.html |title=D.C. same-sex marriage law takes effect |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date= March 3, 2010 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maryland recognizes same-sex marriages formed in other jurisdictions, but does not allow forming such marriages within their own borders.&lt;ref name="freedomtomarry1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=riex /&gt; New York had been in a similar situation as its courts had held that same-sex marriages conducted in states where they are legal must be recognized by those states, but that the state statutes did not allow the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/ad4/Clerk/Decisions/2008/02-01-08/PDF/1562.pdf Martinez, Patricia v County Of Monroe] Decision Appellate Division Fourth Judicial Department&lt;/ref&gt; a situation which changed when its legislature legalized granting licenses to same-sex couples in 2011.

The laws of [[New Mexico]] are largely silent on the subject of same-sex marriage, as they do not specifically allow nor prohibit same-sex marriages or other types of same-sex unions.

[[Rachel Maddow]], an openly gay commentator on MSNBC, expressed her frustration with the Obama Administration position on same-sex marriage in August 2010. In response to Senior White House Advisor David Axelrod's statement on President Obama's position: "The president does oppose same-sex marriage but he supports equality for gay and lesbian couples in benefits and other issues", Maddow said, "Got that? So the line from the administration is that Barack Obama does not want gay people to be allowed to be married, but when gay people can be married and other people are trying to take away that right like in California, he doesn't want the right to be taken away. But, he's not in favor of that right in the first place. You got it? The president is against gay marriage but he is also against constitutional amendments to ban gay marriage, which means that he'd apparently prefer that gay marriage be banned through flimsier tactical means?

Opponents of same-sex marriage in the United States ground their arguments on parenting concerns, religious concerns, and concerns about a "slippery slope" leading toward other changes to the definition of marriage. The Southern Baptist Convention says that extending marriage rights to same-sex couples would undercut the conventional purpose of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Baptist Convention, ''On Same-Sex Marriage'' (adopted 2003) http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=1128 (visited January 20, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], and [[National Organization for Marriage]] argue that children do best when raised by a mother and father, and that legalizing same-sex marriage is, therefore, contrary to the best interests of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/article/the-divine-institution-of-marriage |title=The Divine Institution of Marriage - LDS Newsroom |publisher=Beta-newsroom.lds.org |date=August 13, 2008 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/laity/manandwoman.shtml |title=(FLWY) |publisher=USCCB |date=November 12, 2003 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gofbw.com/News.asp?id=11943 |title=Obama celebrates gay dads on Father's Day - Florida Baptist Witness |publisher=Gofbw.com |date=July 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationformarriage.org/atf/cf/%7B39D8B5C1-F9FE-48C0-ABE6-1029BA77854C%7D/ProtestantEnglish.pdf "Why Marriage Matters"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maggie Gallagher]] of the National Organization for Marriage has raised concerns about the impact of same-sex marriage upon religious liberty and upon faith-based charities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/191kgwgh.asp |title=Banned in Boston |work=[[The Weekly Standard]] |date=May 15, 2006 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other arguments against same-sex marriage are based upon concerns about a "slippery slope" toward other redefinitions of the institution.

==Effects of same-sex marriage==
===Economic impact on same-sex couples===
Dr. M. V. Lee Badgett, an economist and associate professor at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], has studied the impact of same-sex legal marriage on same-sex couples. According to a 1997 [[General Accounting Office]] study requested by Rep. [[Henry Hyde]] (R), at least 1,049 U.S. Federal laws and regulations include reference to marital status.&lt;ref&gt;Dang, Alain, and M. Somjen Frazer.. "Black Same-Sex Couple Households in the 2000 U.S. Census: Implications in the Debate Over Same-Sex Marriage." Western Journal of Black Studies 29.1 (Spring2005 2005): 521–530. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Sep. 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A later 2004 study by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] finds 1,138 statutory provisions "in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving 'benefits, rights, and privileges.'"&lt;ref name=cbo1&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5559|title=The Potential Budgetary Impact of Recognizing Same-Sex Marriages|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=March 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these laws govern property rights, benefits, and taxation. Same-sex couples, whose marriages are not recognized by the state, are ineligible for spousal and survivor [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt; Badgett's research finds the resulting difference in Social Security income for same-sex couples compared to opposite-sex married couples is US$5,588 per year. The federal ban on same-sex marriage and benefits through the 1996 [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) extends to federal government employee benefits.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt; According to Badgett's work, same-sex couples face other financial challenges against which legal marriage at least partially shields opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref name="Badgett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Badgett|first=M.V. Lee|title=Money, Myths, and Change: The Economic Lives of Lesbians and Gay Men|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=2003|isbn=0226034011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* potential loss of couple's home from medical expenses of one partner caring for another gravely ill one&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* costs of supporting two households, travel, or emigration out of the U.S. for an American citizen unable to legally marry a non-U.S. citizen&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* higher cost of purchasing private insurance for partner and children if company is not one of 18% that offer domestic partner benefits&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* higher taxes: unlike a company's contribution to an employee's spouse's health insurance, domestic partner benefits are taxed as additional compensation&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;
* legal costs associated with obtaining domestic partner documents to gain some of the power of attorney, health care decision-making, and inheritance rights granted through legal marriage&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* higher health costs associated with lack of insurance and preventative care: 20% of same-sex couples have a member who is uninsured compared to 10% of married opposite-sex couples&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* current tax law allows a spouse to inherit an unlimited amount from the deceased without incurring an estate tax but an unmarried partner would have to pay the estate tax on the inheritance from her/his partner&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;
* same-sex couples are not eligible to file jointly or separately as a married couple and thus cannot take the advantages of lower tax rates when the individual income of the partners differs significantly&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;

While state laws grant full marriage rights ([[Connecticut]], [[Iowa]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New York]] and [[Vermont]]) or some or all of the benefits under another name ([[New Jersey]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[California]], etc.), these state laws do not extend the benefits of marriage on the Federal level, and most states do not currently recognize same-sex marriages, domestic partnerships, or civil unions from other states.

One often overlooked aspect of same-sex marriage are the potential ''negative'' effects on same-sex couples. While the legal benefits of marriage are numerous, same-sex couples would face the same financial constraints of legal marriage as opposite-sex married couples. Such potential effects include the [[marriage penalty]] in taxation.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt; Similarly, while social service providers usually do not count one partner's assets toward the income means test for welfare and disability assistance for the other partner, a legally married couple's joint assets are normally used in calculating whether a married individual qualifies for assistance.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;

===Economic impact on the federal government===
The 2004 Congressional Budget Office study, working from an assumption "that about 0.6 percent of adults would enter into same-sex marriages if they had the opportunity" (an assumption in which they admitted "significant uncertainty") estimated that legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the United States "would improve the budget's bottom line to a small extent: by less than $1&amp;nbsp;billion in each of the next 10 years". This result reflects an increase in net government revenues (increased income taxes due to marriage penalties more than offsetting decreased tax revenues arising from postponed estate taxes). Marriage recognition would increase the government expenses for Social Security and Federal Employee Health Benefits but that increase would be more than made up for by decreased expenses for Medicaid, Medicare, and Supplemental Security Income.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;

===Mental health===

Based in part on empirical research that has been conducted on the adverse effects of stigmatization, numerous prominent social science organizations have issued position statements supporting same-sex marriage and opposing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; these organizations include the American Psychoanalytic Association and the American Psychological Association.&lt;ref name="amici2"/&gt;

Several psychological studies&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Price, M. "UPFRONT&amp;nbsp;— Research uncovers the stress created by same-sex marriage bans" in ''Monitor on Psychology'', Volume 40, No. 1, page 10, January 2009. Washington DC: American Psychological Association. [http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/marriage-bans.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potoczniak, Daniel J.; Aldea, Mirela A.; DeBlaere, Cirleen "Ego identity, social anxiety, social support, and self-concealment in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(4), Oct 2007, 447–457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Balsam, Kimberly F.; Mohr, Jonathan J. "Adaptation to sexual orientation stigma: A comparison of bisexual and lesbian/gay adults." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(3), Jul 2007, 306–319.
&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for the LGBT population that may affect their health and well-being.

One study surveyed more than 1,500 lesbian, gay and bisexual adults across the nation and found that respondents from the 25 states that have outlawed same-sex marriage had the highest reports of "[[minority stress]]"&amp;nbsp;— the chronic social stress that results from minority-group stigmatization&amp;nbsp;— as well as general psychological distress. According to the study, the negative campaigning that comes with a ban is directly responsible for the increased stress. Past research has shown that [[minority stress]] is linked to health risks such as risky sexual behavior and substance abuse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Rostosky, Sharon Scales; Riggle, Ellen D. B.; Gray, Barry E.; Hatton, Roxanna L. "Minority stress experiences in committed same-sex couple relationships." ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice,'' Vol 38(4), Aug 2007, 392–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other studies examined personal reports from LGBT adults and their families living in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], immediately after a successful 2006 ballot campaign banned same-sex marriage. Most respondents reported feeling alienated from their communities, afraid that they would lose custody of their children and that they might become victims of violence. The studies also found that families experienced a kind of secondary [[minority stress]], says Jennifer Arm, a counseling graduate student at the [[University of Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski, Dawn M.; Carr, Erika R.
