==Legal issues==
{{See also|Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States}}

===Federal law===
The legal issues surrounding same-sex marriage in the United States are complicated by the nation's [[federalism|federal]] system of government. Prior to 1996, the federal government did not define marriage; any marriage recognized by a [[U.S. state|state]] was recognized by the federal government, even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more other states (as was the case with interracial marriage before 1967 due to [[anti-miscegenation laws]]). With the passage of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) in 1996, a marriage was explicitly defined in federal law as a union of one man and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|1|7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

DOMA was challenged in the [[United States federal courts|federal court system]]. On July 8, 2010, Judge [[Joseph Louis Tauro|Joseph Tauro]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|District Court of Massachusetts]] held that the denial of federal rights and benefits to lawfully married Massachusetts same-sex couples is unconstitutional under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name="hrc.org"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/us/09marriage.html|title=Judge Topples U.S. Rejection of Gay Unions | work = [[The New York Times]] |date=July 8, 2010|accessdate=June 2, 2011|first1=Abby|last1=Goodnough|first2=John|last2=Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/09/judge-rules-federal-same-sex-marriage-ban-unconstitutional/?iref=allsearch&amp;fbid=2-HnSdp2S6g|title=Judge rules federal same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional|work=CNN|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, eight federal courts have found DOMA to be unconstitutional on issues including bankruptcy, public employee benefits, [[estate tax]]es, and immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/entry/c/doma|title=The Defense of Marriage Act|work=Freedom to Marry|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/31/doma-unconstitutional-ruling-appeals-court-boston_n_1559031.html|title=DOMA Ruled Unconstitutional By Federal Appeals Court  |last=Lavoie |first=Denise |date=May 31, 2012 |work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/defense-of-marriage-act-discriminates-against-gays-federal-court-rules-85899424320|title=Defense of Marriage Act Discriminates Against Gays, Federal Court Rules|last=Malewitz|first=Jim|date=October 18, 2012|work=Pewstates.org|accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit |U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals]] became the first court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tiven|first=Rachel|title=Edie Wins!

According to the federal government's [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) in 2004, [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|more than 1,138 rights and protections]] are conferred to U.S. citizens upon marriage by the federal government; areas affected include [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, veterans' benefits, health insurance, [[Medicaid]], hospital visitation, estate taxes, retirement savings, [[pension]]s, [[family leave]], and immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf |title=2004 updated report of the GAO |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aspects of marriage law are determined by the states, rather than the federal government. The Defense of Marriage Act does not prevent individual states from defining marriage as they see fit. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', a same-sex marriage case filed in Minnesota, "for want of a substantial federal question."&lt;ref&gt;''Baker v. Nelson'', {{ussc|409|810|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, the court upheld the state of Minnesota's right to restrict marriage to different-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Denniston|first=Lyle|title=Gay marriage and Baker v.

Marriage laws in states that do not permit or recognize same-sex marriage are being challenged in court, including ''[[Perry v.

Same-sex marriage is recognized only at the state level, as the federal [[Defense of Marriage Act]] explicitly bars federal recognition of such marriages.

Nine state governments (along with the [[District of Columbia]], the [[Jeni and Kitzen Branting|Coquille Indian Tribe]], and the [[Same-sex marriage under United States tribal jurisdictions#Suquamish tribe|Suquamish tribe]]) have legalized same-sex marriage and offer same-sex marriages: [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[Iowa]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New York]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

Commenting on the same court decision, former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] [[Newt Gingrich]] issued a statement in opposition to same-sex marriage, which read, in part, as follows: "Judge Walker's ruling overturning Prop 8 is an outrageous disrespect for our Constitution and for the majority of people of the United States who believe marriage is the union of husband and wife... Congress now has the responsibility to act immediately to reaffirm marriage as a union of one man and one woman as our national policy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20100817022402/http://www.newt.org/newt-direct/newt-statement-ca-marriage-ruling Newt Gingrich's Website].

NOM lists strategies on its website for supporters to use, including the following statement: "Strong majorities of Americans oppose gay marriage. Supporters of SSM therefore seek to change the subject to just about anything: discrimination, benefits, homosexuality, gay rights, federalism, our sacred constitution. Our goal is simple: Shift the conversation rapidly back to marriage. Don't get sidetracked. Marriage is the issue. Marriage is what we care about. Marriage really matters. It's just common sense."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationformarriage.org/site/c.omL2KeN0LzH/b.4475595/k.566A/Marriage_Talking_Points.htm National Organization for Marriage Website].

According to its website, the FRC opposes "the vigorous efforts of homosexual activists to demand that homosexuality be accepted as equivalent to heterosexuality in law, in the media, and in schools. Attempts to join two men or two women in 'marriage' constitute a radical redefinition and falsification of the institution, and FRC supports state and federal constitutional amendments to prevent such redefinition by courts or legislatures."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frc.org/human-sexuality#homosexuality Family Research Council website].

The leading associations of psychological, psychiatric, medical, and social work professionals in the United States have said that claims that the legal recognition of marriage for same–sex couples undermines the institution of marriage and harms children is inconsistent with the scientific evidence which supports the conclusions: that [[homosexuality]] is a normal expression of human sexuality that is not chosen; that gay and lesbian people form stable, committed relationships essentially equivalent to heterosexual relationships; that same-sex parents are no less capable than opposite-sex parents to raise children; and that the children of same-sex parents are no less psychologically healthy and well-adjusted than children of opposite-sex parents. The body of research strongly supports the conclusion that discrimination by the federal government between married same-sex couples and married opposite-sex couples in granting benefits unfairly stigmatizes same-sex couples. The research also contradicts the stereotype-based rationales advanced to support passage of DOMA that the [[Equal Protection Clause]] was designed to prohibit.&lt;ref name="amici2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/about/offices/ogc/amicus/gill.pdf |title=Brief of the American Psychological Association, the Massachusetts Psychological Association, The National Association of Social Workers and its Massachusetts Chapter, the American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics as Amici Curiae in Support of Plaintiffs-Appellees and in Support of Affirmance - Appeals from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts Civil Action Nos. 1:09-cv-11156-JLT, 1:09-cv-10309-JLT (Honorable Joseph L.

Other arguments against same-sex marriage are based upon concerns that the process of redefining the institution would be a [[Pandora's box]].

==Effects of same-sex marriage==

===Economic impact on same-sex couples===
Dr. M. V. Lee Badgett, an economist and associate professor at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], has studied the impact of same-sex legal marriage on same-sex couples. According to a 1997 [[General Accounting Office]] study requested by Rep. [[Henry Hyde]] (R), at least 1,049 U.S. federal laws and regulations include reference to marital status.&lt;ref&gt;Dang, Alain, and M. Somjen Frazer.. "Black Same-Sex Couple Households in the 2000 U.S. Census: Implications in the Debate Over Same-Sex Marriage." Western Journal of Black Studies 29.1 (Spring2005 2005): 521–530. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. September 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A later 2004 study by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] finds 1,138 statutory provisions "in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving 'benefits, rights, and privileges.'"&lt;ref name=cbo1&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5559|title=The Potential Budgetary Impact of Recognizing Same-Sex Marriages|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=March 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these laws govern property rights, benefits, and taxation. Same-sex couples, whose marriages are not recognized by the state, are ineligible for spousal and survivor [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt; Badgett's research finds the resulting difference in Social Security income for same-sex couples compared to opposite-sex married couples is US$5,588 per year. The federal ban on same-sex marriage and benefits through the 1996 [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) extends to federal government employee benefits.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt; According to Badgett's work, same-sex couples face the following other financial challenges against which legal marriage at least partially shields opposite-sex couples:&lt;ref name="Badgett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Badgett|first=M.V. Lee|title=Money, Myths, and Change: The Economic Lives of Lesbians and Gay Men|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=2003|isbn=0-226-03401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Legal costs associated with obtaining domestic partner documents to gain legal abilities granted automatically by legal marriage, including power of attorney, health care decision-making, and inheritance&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* A legal spouse can inherit an unlimited amount from the deceased without incurring an estate tax but a same-sex partner would have to pay the estate tax on the inheritance from her/his partner&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;
* Same-sex couples are not eligible to file jointly as a married couple and thus cannot take the advantages of lower tax rates when the individual income of the partners differs significantly&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;
* Only 18% of companies offer domestic partner health care benefits&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Taxation of same-sex spouse health insurance benefits when provided by an employer, unlike like benefits provided to a heterosexual couple&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;
* Higher health costs associated with lack of insurance and preventative care: 20% of same-sex couples have a member who is uninsured compared to 10% of married opposite-sex couples&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Inability to protect jointly-owned home from loss due to costs of potential medical catastrophe&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Inability for a U.S. citizen to extend citizenship to same-sex partner&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;

While state laws grant full marriage rights ([[Connecticut]], [[Iowa]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New York]] and [[Vermont]]) or some or all of the benefits under another name ([[New Jersey]], [[California]], [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], etc.), these state laws do not extend the benefits of marriage on the Federal level, and most states do not recognize same-sex marriages, domestic partnerships, or civil unions from other states.

====Potential economic disadvantages====
While the legal benefits of marriage are numerous, same-sex couples could face the same financial constraints of legal marriage as opposite-sex married couples. Such potential effects include the [[marriage penalty]] in taxation (if the federal government were to recognize same-sex marriage).&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt; Similarly, while social service providers usually do not count one partner's assets toward the income means test for welfare and disability assistance for the other partner, a legally married couple's joint assets are normally used in calculating whether a married individual qualifies for assistance.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;

===Economic impact on the federal government===
The 2004 [[Congressional Budget Office]] study, working from an assumption "that about 0.6 percent of adults would enter into same-sex marriages if they had the opportunity" (an assumption in which they admitted "significant uncertainty") estimated that legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the United States "would improve the budget's bottom line to a small extent: by less than $1&amp;nbsp;billion in each of the next 10 years". This result reflects an increase in net government revenues (increased income taxes due to marriage penalties more than offsetting decreased tax revenues arising from postponed estate taxes). Marriage recognition would increase the government expenses for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program|Federal Employee Health Benefits]] but that increase would be more than made up for by decreased expenses for [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and [[Supplemental Security Income]].&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;

===Mental health===

Based in part on empirical research that has been conducted on the adverse effects of stigmatization, numerous prominent social science organizations have issued position statements supporting same-sex marriage and opposing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; these organizations include the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;ref name="amici2011"/&gt;

Several psychological studies&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Price, M. [http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/marriage-bans.html "Upfront&amp;nbsp;— Research uncovers the stress created by same-sex marriage bans"] in ''Monitor on Psychology'', Volume 40, No. 1, page 10, January 2009. Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potoczniak, Daniel J.; Aldea, Mirela A.; DeBlaere, Cirleen "Ego identity, social anxiety, social support, and self-concealment in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(4), October 2007, 447–457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Balsam, Kimberly F.; Mohr, Jonathan J. "Adaptation to sexual orientation stigma: A comparison of bisexual and lesbian/gay adults." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(3), July 2007, 306–319.
&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for the LGBT population that may affect their health and well-being.

One study surveyed more than 1,500 lesbian, gay and bisexual adults across the nation and found that respondents from the 25 states that have outlawed same-sex marriage had the highest reports of "[[minority stress]]"&amp;nbsp;— the chronic social stress that results from minority-group stigmatization&amp;nbsp;— as well as general psychological distress. According to the study, the negative campaigning that comes with a ban is directly responsible for the increased stress. Past research has shown that [[minority stress]] is linked to health risks such as risky sexual behavior and substance abuse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Rostosky, Sharon Scales; Riggle, Ellen D. B.; Gray, Barry E.; Hatton, Roxanna L. "Minority stress experiences in committed same-sex couple relationships." ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice,'' Vol 38(4), August 2007, 392–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other studies examined personal reports from LGBT adults and their families living in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], immediately after a successful 2006 ballot campaign banned same-sex marriage. Most respondents reported feeling alienated from their communities, afraid that they would lose custody of their children and that they might become victims of violence. The studies also found that families experienced a kind of secondary minority stress, says Jennifer Arm, a counseling graduate student at the [[University of Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski, Dawn M.; Carr, Erika R.

''Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity,'' Vol 9(1), January 2008, 40–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Ilan Meyer|Ilan H. Meyer]], Williams Senior Scholar of Public Policy at the [[UCLA School of Law]] and expert on [[minority stress]], has found through several empirical studies that gays and lesbians encounter a disproportionate level of stress and mental health difficulties because of discrimination and oppressive laws, and that these stresses amplify the social stigma that makes them more susceptible to depression, suicide and substance abuse.&lt;ref name=testimony&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Stephanie|title=Ilan H.

''columbia.edu''|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' trial, he testified that the mental health outcomes for gays and lesbians would improve if laws such as Proposition 8 did not exist because "when people are exposed to more stress...they are more likely to get sick..." and that particular situation is consistent with laws that say to gay people "you are not welcome here, your relationships are not valued." Such laws have "significant power", he said.&lt;ref name=testimony /&gt;&lt;ref name=testimony2&gt;{{cite web|first=Court Reporters|title=''Perry v.

===Physical health===

In 2009, a pair of economists at [[Emory University]] tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of [[HIV]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kNicjEc2 |title=Emory researchers: Gay marriage bans increase HIV infections |publisher=Webcitation.org |date= |accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elaine Justice|url=http://shared.web.emory.edu/emory/news/releases/2009/06/study-links-gay-marriage-bans-to-rise-in-hiv-rate.html |title=Study Links Gay Marriage Bans to Rise in HIV infections |publisher=Emory.edu |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study linked the passage of same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.

A study by the [[Columbia Mailman School of Public Health]] found that gay men in Massachusetts visited health clinics significantly less often following the legalization of same-sex marriage in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16203621 |title=BBC News - Gay marriage 'improves health' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=December 16, 2011 |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Singer v. Hara'', 522 P.2d 1187 (Wash. App. 1974) (ban on same-sex marriage was constitutional on the basis of ''gender discrimination''; because the historical definition of marriage is between one man and one woman, same-sex couples are inherently ineligible to marry)
*''[[Adams v. Howerton]]'', 673 F.2d 1036 (9th Cir. 1982), ''cert. denied'', 458 U.S. 1111 (affirming that same-sex marriage does not make one a "spouse" under the Immigration and Nationality Act)

Lewin]]'', 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993) (holding that statute limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violates the Hawaii constitution's equal-protection clause unless the state can show that the statute is (1) justified by compelling state interests and (2) narrowly tailored, prompting a [[Hawaii Constitutional Amendment 2 (1998)|state constitutional amendment]] and the federal [[Defense of Marriage Act]])
*''[[Same-sex_marriage_in_the_District_of_Columbia#Dean_v._District_of_Columbia|Dean v. District of Columbia]]'', 653 A.2d 307 (D.C. 1995)

Harris]]'', 908 A.2d 196 (N.J. 2006) (New Jersey is required to extend all rights and responsibilities of marriage to same-sex couples, but prohibiting same-sex marriage does not violate the state constitution; legislature given 180 days from October 25, 2006 to amend the marriage laws or create a "parallel structure")

*''[[Martinez v. County of Monroe]]'', 850 N.Y.S.2d 740 (N.Y. App. Div. 2008). (The court ruled unanimously that because New York legally recognizes out-of-state marriages of opposite-sex couples, it must do the same for same-sex couples. The county was refused leave to appeal on a technicality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Louis |first=Tim |url=http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/news/articles/2008/05/GAY-MARRIAGE-Technicality-delays |title=GAY MARRIAGE: Technicality delays county's appeal |publisher=Rochestercitynewspaper.com |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'', 183 P.3d 384 (Cal. 2008). (The court ruled that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples is invalid under the equal protection clause of the California Constitution, and that full marriage rights, not merely domestic partnership, must be offered to same-sex couples.);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/S147999.pdf 'In re Marriage Cases''], 183 P.3d 384 (Cal. 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Horton]]'',] 207 P.3d 48 (Cal. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Varnum v. Brien]]'', 763 N.W.2d 862, (Ia. 2009). (Barring same-sex couples from marriage, the court unanimously ruled, violates the equal protection provisions of the [[Iowa Constitution]]. Equal protection requires full marriage, rather than civil unions or some other substitute, for same-sex couples)
*''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'', 704 F. Supp. 2d 921 (N.D. Cal. 2010). (California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] (2008) violates fundamental right to marry under ''Loving v. Virginia'', violates Due Process and Equal Protection Causes of the Fourteenth Amendment, and illegally discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation. Proposition 8 is driven only by animus against same-sex couples; therefore, does not survive [[rational basis review]]. Permanently enjoins CA from enforcing Prop 8; order was stayed pending appeal to the U.S. [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], where it was affirmed, now stayed pending possible appeal to the Supreme Court)
*''[[Perry v. Brown]]'', Slip Op. (9th Cir. 2012), ''Perry v. Schwarzenegger'' affirmed on the grounds that under ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', Proposition 8's withdrawal of the designation of "marriage" from same-sex couples violates the Equal Protection Clause as there is no legitimate government interest to sustain a [[rational basis review]]; therefore, it is driven only by animus against gays and lesbians. Order stayed 90 days pending possible appeal to the Supreme Court.
*''[[Gill v. Office of Personnel Management]]'' 699 F.Supp.2d 374 and ''[[Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services]]'' 698 F.Supp.2d 234 (D.Mass. 2010) challenged Section 3 of DOMA on equal protection, due process, Tenth Amendment, and [[Spending Clause]] grounds. Upheld at the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit Court of Appeals]]. Implementation stayed pending filed appeal to the Supreme Court.
*''[[Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management]]'', Slip Op. (N.D. Cal. 2012), Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which defines marriage for the purposes of federal statutes, regulations, etc. as being between one man and one woman, was held to violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court ruled that homosexuality is a [[suspect classification|quasi-suspect classification]], meaning DOMA must substantially relate to an important government interest ("[[intermediate scrutiny]]"). The court found it could not meet that burden, and also failed rational basis review.
*''[[Port v. Cowan]]'', 426 Md. 435, 44 A.3d 970 (2012).

Windsor was awarded approximately $350,000 plus interest and court costs.
