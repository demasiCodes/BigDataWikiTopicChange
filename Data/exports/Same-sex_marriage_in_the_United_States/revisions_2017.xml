In the United States, [[same-sex marriage]] is legal in all states, [[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia|Washington, D.C.]], U.S. territories except [[LGBT rights in American Samoa|American Samoa]], but not on all [[Same-sex marriage under United States tribal jurisdictions|Native American tribal lands]]. Same-sex marriage has been legal since June 26, 2015, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2015/06/26/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-ruling-brown-dnt-tsr.cnn|title=U.S. 21st country to allow same-sex marriage nationwide|date=June 26, 2015|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Same-Sex Marriage Is a Right, Supreme Court Rules, 5-4|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html |newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obergefell et al. v.

The ruling overturned a 1972 precedent, ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]''. Just prior to the Supreme Court's ruling in 2015, same-sex marriage was legal in many but not all U.S. jurisdictions.

While [[civil rights]] campaigning took place from the 1970s,&lt;ref name="Gumbel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gumbel|first=Andrew|title=The Great Undoing?|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/2009/06/20/great-undoing|work=[[The Advocate]]|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the issue became prominent from around 1993, when the [[Hawaii Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Baehr v. Miike|Baehr v. Lewin]]'' that the prohibition was [[unconstitutional]]. The ruling led to federal actions and actions by several states, to restrict marriage to male-female couples, in particular the ''[[Defense of Marriage Act]]'' (DOMA). During the period of 2003 to 2015, various lower court decisions, state legislation, and popular referendums already legalized same-sex marriage to some degree in thirty-eight out of fifty [[U.S. states]], in the [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territory]] of [[Guam]], and in the [[District of Columbia]]. In 2013, the Supreme Court overturned a key provision of DOMA, declaring part of it unconstitutional and in breach of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' because it "single[d] out a class of persons" for discrimination, by refusing to treat their marriages equally under federal law when state law had created them equally valid. The ruling led to the Federal Government's recognition of same-sex marriage, with federal benefits for married couples connected to either the state of residence or the state in which the marriage was solemnized. However, the ruling focused on the provision of DOMA responsible for the Federal Government refusing to acknowledge state sanctioned same-sex marriages, leaving the question of state marriage laws itself to the individual states. The Supreme Court addressed that question two years later in 2015, ruling, in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges|Obergefell]]'', that same-sex married couples were to be constitutionally accorded the same recognition as opposite-sex couples at state/territory levels, as well as at federal level.

By the time that same-sex marriage became legal nationally, [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|public opinion on the subject]] reached almost 60% approval levels according to polls by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/03/09/support-for-gay-marriage-hits-all-time-high-wsjnbc-news-poll/|title=Support for Gay Marriage Hits All-Time High — WSJ/NBC News Poll|author=Janet Hook|work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Human Rights Campaign]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/gay-marriage-voters-poll-115171.html|title=Poll: 60 percent of likely voters back gay marriage|work=Politico |accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/02/cnn-poll-63-percent-of-americans-say-same-sex-couples-have-a-right-to-marry/|title=CNN poll: 63 percent of Americans say same-sex couples have a right to marry|work=LGBTQ Nation|accessdate=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; having crossed the 50% in 2011 and not going below that mark since.&lt;ref&gt;["Same-Sex Marriage Support Solidifies Above 50% in U.S." http://www.gallup.com/poll/162398/sex-marriage-support-solidifies-above.aspx] (see graph.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of same-sex marriage in the United States}}
{{See also|Timeline of same-sex marriage in the United States}}

The movement to obtain [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|civil marriage rights]] and benefits for same-sex couples in the United States began in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Gumbel"/&gt; In the 1971 case ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that denying marriage licenses to same-sex couples did not violate the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. On appeal, the United States Supreme Court denied to hear the case, establishing it as a federal [[precedent]] as it came from mandatory appellate review. The issue did not become prominent in U.S. politics until the 1993 [[Hawaii Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Baehr v. Miike|Baehr v. Lewin]]'' that declared that state's prohibition to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same Sex Marriage Laws – History|url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/human-services/same-sex-marriage-laws.aspx|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 21st century, while [[Timeline of same-sex marriage|several countries]] elsewhere in the world were opening marriage for same-sex couples, public support in the U.S. for same-sex marriage has grown considerably,&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jrl2124/Lax_Phillips_Gay_Policy_Responsiveness_2009.pdf|title=Gay Rights in the States: Public Opinion and Policy Responsiveness|format=PDF|pages=67–86| doi=10.1017/S0003055409990050| date=August 2009| journal=American Political Science Review|volume=103|issue=3| accessdate=December 20, 2011|first=JEFFREY R.|last=LAX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silver|first=Nate|title=Support for Gay Marriage Outweighs Opposition in Polls |url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/support-for-gay-marriage-outweighs-opposition-in-polls/ |accessdate=October 28, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national polls conducted since 2011 show that a majority of Americans support legalizing it. However at the same time, many states also passed bans against same-sex marriage, either legislatively or by [[referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://gaymarriage.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004857 State-by-State History of Banning and Legalizing Gay Marriage, 1994-2015]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 17, 2004, [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] became the first U.S. state and the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage following the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Judicial Court]]'s decision in ''[[Goodridge v.

In June 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' that federal law could not treat as unequal, marriages that individual states had created as equally valid, when it overturned a key provision of the ''[[Defense of Marriage Act]]'' (DOMA), thus forcing federal recognition of same-sex marriage and marriage-related benefits when related to a same-sex marriage performed by a state that sanctioned such marriages.

On January 16, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear four cases, on appeal from the Sixth Circuit, on whether states may constitutionally ban same-sex marriages or refuse to recognize such marriages legally performed in another state. The cases were: ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' (Ohio), ''[[Tanco v. Haslam]]'' (Tennessee), ''[[DeBoer v. Snyder]]'' (Michigan), and ''[[Bourke v. Beshear]]'' (Kentucky). Decided by the court under the heading of ''Obergefell'' on June 26, 2015, a 5–4 majority of justices led by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] reversed the Sixth Circuit's upholding of state bans and declared that the Court's rulings must evolve in the light of better understanding of discrimination and the constitutional protections available to protect minorities, and that same-sex couples have the constitutional rights to marry and to have their marriages recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/same-sex-marraige-legal-nationwide-supreme-court-rules-n375551|title=Landmark: Supreme Court Rules Same-Sex Marriage Legal Nationwide|first=Pete|last=Williams|date=June 26, 2015|accessdate=June 26, 2015|agency=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Obergefell'' therefore overturned the Court's own prior ruling in ''Baker''.

==Before ''Obergefell''==
{{Map of same-sex marriage in the United States prior to Obergefell|align=right|size=400px}}
Prior to ''Obergefell'', [[same-sex marriage]] was legal to at least some degree in thirty-eight states, one territory ([[Same-sex marriage in Guam|Guam]]) and the [[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]]; of the states, [[Same-sex marriage in Missouri|Missouri]], [[Same-sex marriage in Kansas|Kansas]], and [[Same-sex marriage in Alabama|Alabama]] had restrictions. Until ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', it was only legal in 12 states and [[Washington D.C.]]. Beginning in July 2013, over forty federal and state courts cited ''Windsor'' to strike down state bans on the licensing or recognition of same-sex marriage. [[Same-sex marriage in Missouri|Missouri]] recognized same-sex marriages from out of state and same-sex marriages licensed by the [[St. Louis|City of St. Louis]] under two separate [[Same-sex marriage in Missouri|state court orders]]; two other jurisdictions issued such licenses as well. In [[Kansas]], marriage licenses were available to same-sex couples in most counties, but the state did not recognize their validity. Some counties in [[Alabama]] issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples for three weeks until the [[Supreme Court of Alabama|state Supreme Court]] ordered probate judges to stop doing so. That court's ruling did not address the recognition of same-sex marriages already licensed in Alabama, but referred to them as "purported 'marriage licenses{{' "}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petition Granted|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/257589071/1140460-Petition-Granted|website=Scribd.com|publisher=Supreme Court of Alabama|accessdate=March 24, 2015|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two additional states, same-sex marriages were previously legal between the time their bans were struck down and then [[Stay of proceedings#United States|stayed]]. [[Same-sex marriage in Michigan|Michigan]] recognized the validity of more than 300 marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples and those marriages.

==Legal issues==
{{See also|Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States}}

The legal issues surrounding same-sex marriage in the United States are determined by the nation's [[federalism|federal]] system of government, in which the [[Status (law)|status]] of a person, including marital status, is determined in large measure by the individual states. Prior to 1996, the Federal Government did not define marriage; any marriage recognized by a [[U.S. state|state]] was recognized by the Federal Government, even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more states, as was the case until 1967 with interracial marriage, which some states [[anti-miscegenation laws|banned by statute]].

Prior to 2004, same-sex marriage was not performed in any U.S. jurisdiction.

The Supreme Court's ruling in ''Obergefell'' renders moot any remaining legal challenges, as it specifically orders states to both issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and to recognize as valid marriages performed in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/gay-marriage-supreme-court-decision-119463.html|title=Supreme Court gay marriage decision: Full text of Obergefell ruling|newspaper=Politico|date=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal law===
According to the Federal Government's [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) in 2004, [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|more than 1,138 rights and protections]] are conferred to U.S. citizens upon marriage by the Federal Government; areas affected include [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, veterans' benefits, health insurance, [[Medicaid]], hospital visitation, estate taxes, retirement savings, pensions, [[family leave]], and immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf|title=2004 updated report of the GAO|format=PDF |date=January 23, 2004|publisher=GAO|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Defense of Marriage Act]]'' (DOMA) was enacted in 1996. DOMA's Section 2 says that no state needs to recognize the legal validity of a same-sex relationship even if recognized as marriage by another state. It purports to relieve a state of its reciprocal obligation to honor the laws of other states as required by the Constitution's [[full faith and credit clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wermiel|first1=Stephen|title=SCOTUS for law students: The Defense of Marriage Act and the Constitution|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/03/scotus-for-law-students-the-defense-of-marriage-act-and-the-constitution-sponsored-by-bloomberg-law/|accessdate=September 23, 2014|publisher=SCOTUSblog |date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before DOMA, however, states sometimes refused to recognize a marriage from another jurisdiction if it was counter to its "strongly held public policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wolff|first1=Tobias Barrington|title=DOMA Repeal and the Truth About Full Faith &amp; Credit |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tobias-barrington-wolff/doma-repeal-and-the-truth_b_905484.html |accessdate=September 23, 2014|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most lawsuits that seek to require a state to recognize a marriage established in another jurisdiction argue on the basis of [[equal protection clause|equal protection]] and [[due process clause|due process]], not the full faith and credit clause.{{efn|Among many examples: (1) the U.S. District Court ruling in ''[[Bourke v. Beshear]]'', which required Kentucky to recognize same-sex marriages from Canada and several U.S. states, was decided on equal protection grounds alone.

Caldwell]]'', who sought Louisiana's recognition of their out-of-state marriages, argued only on the basis of equal protection and due process. One of the Louisiana statutes they challenged made clear the state's assertion of its right to deny recognition to the legal act of another state: "A purported marriage between persons of the same sex violates a ''strong public policy'' of the state of Louisiana".

However, some counties may require at least one person to be a resident of the county in order to receive a marriage license.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://altoday.com/archives/17555-two-years-later-7-alabama-counties-still-not-issuing-marriage-licences-sex-couples|title=2yrs later, 7co. still not issuing same-sex marriage licenses|date=2017-06-29|work=Alabama Today|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Officials of one [[Same-sex marriage in Texas|Texas]] county, [[Irion County, Texas|Irion]], issue marriage licenses but claim they will refuse same-sex couples. None have applied and no legal action has been taken.&lt;ref name="Ballotpedia"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Officials in eight [[Same-sex marriage in Alabama|Alabama]] counties no longer issue any marriage licenses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is being done in accordance with a state law, which in 1961 was created to preserve racial segregation and made it optional for county clerks to issue marriage licenses. Several have chosen to exercise this option since the ''Obergefell'' ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/10/alabama_judges_use_segregation.html#incart_river_home|title=Alabama judges use segregation-era law to avoid gay marriage|newspaper=AL.com|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Several [[Same-sex marriage in Kentucky|Kentucky]] counties initially refused to marry same-sex couples. In response, Kentucky reformed its marriage license forms and removed the name of the county clerk from the licenses. As of June 2016, Chris Hartmann, director of the Kentucky-based Fairness Campaign, said to his knowledge "there are no counties where marriage licenses are being denied" in his state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/06/22/one-year-after-supreme-court-ruling-pockets-of-marriage-inequality-remain/|title=One year after marriage ruling, pockets of defiance remain|date=2016-06-22|website=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parental rights====
{{main|LGBT adoption in the United States}}
Post-''Obergefell'', six states have, on occasion, attempted to deny same-sex couples full adoption rights to varying degrees. In [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], and [[Wisconsin]], same-sex couples have been met with rejection when trying to get both parents' names listed on the birth certificate. Alabama's highest court attempted to void an adoption decree obtained by a same-sex couple in Georgia, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed, restoring joint custody to the adoptive mother on March 7, 2016. [[Mississippi]] had once banned same-sex couples from adopting, but the law requiring this was ruled unconstitutional by the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi]] on March 31, 2016. The ruling was described as having the effect of making same-sex adoption essentially legal in all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/mississippi-same-sex-adoption_us_56fdb1a3e4b083f5c607567f?section=australia|title=Same-Sex Couples Can Now Adopt Children In All 50 States|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/04/01/mississippi_same_sex_adoption_ban_overturned_spelling_trouble_for_hb_1523.html|title=Judge Invalidates Mississippi's Same-Sex Adoption Ban, the Last of Its Kind in America|publisher=Slate|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court ruled by a 6-3 vote in the case of ''Pavan v. Smith'' that under their decision in ''Obergefell'', same-sex couples must be treated equally to opposite-sex couples in the issuance of birth certificates. In December 2016, the Supreme Court of Arkansas upheld a state law only allowing opposite-sex couples to be automatically listed as parents on their children's birth certificates, while prohibiting same-sex couples from being allowed the same on an equal basis. The Supreme Court summarily reversed the Arkansas Supreme Court, finding that the disparity in treatment was a violation of their decision in ''Obergefell''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/us/politics/gay-couples-entitled-to-equal-treatment-on-birth-certificates-justices-rule.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tribal law===
{{main|Same-sex marriage under United States tribal jurisdictions}}
The Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage in the states and territories did not legalize same-sex marriage on Indian lands. In the United States, Congress (not the federal courts) has legal authority over Indian country. Thus, unless Congress passes a law regarding same-sex marriage on Indian tribes, federally recognized American Indian tribes have the legal right to form their own marriage laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julian Brave Noisecat |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/02/navajo-marriage-equality_n_7709016.html |title=Fight For Marriage Equality Not Over On Navajo Nation |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=July 2, 2015 |accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the time of the ''Obergefell'' ruling, [[Same-sex marriage under United States tribal jurisdictions|24 tribal jurisdictions]] legally recognize same-sex marriage. Some tribes have passed legislation specifically addressing same-sex relationships and some specify that state law and jurisdiction govern tribal marriages. As of November 2017, same-sex marriage is legally recognized in 40 tribal jurisdictions.

The [[Human Rights Campaign]] (HRC) is one of the leading advocacy groups in support of same-sex marriage. According to the HRC's website, "Many same-sex couples want the right to legally marry because they are in love—many, in fact, have spent the last 10, 20 or 50 years with that person—and they want to honor their relationship in the greatest way our society has to offer, by making a public commitment to stand together in good times and bad, through all the joys and challenges family life brings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/answers-to-questions-about-marriage-equality Human Rights Campaign website].

==Effects of same-sex marriage==

===Economic impact on same-sex couples===
Until the Supreme Court's June 2013 ruling in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' required the Federal Government to treat legally married same-sex couples on an equal basis with heterosexual married couples, same-sex married couples faced severe disadvantages. The Federal Government did not recognize those marriages for any purpose. According to a 1997 [[General Accounting Office]] study, at least 1,049 U.S. federal laws and regulations include references to marital status.&lt;ref&gt;Dang, Alain, and M. Somjen Frazer. "Black Same-Sex Couple Households in the 2000 U.S. Census: Implications in the Debate Over Same-Sex Marriage." Western Journal of Black Studies 29.1 (Spring2005 2005): 521–530. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. September 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found 1,138 statutory provisions "in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving 'benefits, rights, and privileges.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="cbo1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5559 |title=The Potential Budgetary Impact of Recognizing Same-Sex Marriages|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=March 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these laws govern property rights, benefits, and taxation. Same-sex couples whose marriages are not recognized by the federal government are ineligible for spousal and survivor [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits and are ineligible for the benefits due the spouse of a federal government employee.&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt; One study found that the difference in Social Security income for same-sex couples compared to opposite-sex married couples was per year.&lt;ref name="Badgett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Badgett |first=M.V. Lee|title=Money, Myths, and Change: The Economic Lives of Lesbians and Gay Men|publisher=University Of Chicago Press |location=Chicago|year=2003|isbn=0-226-03401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to similarly situated opposite-sex married couples, same-sex couples faced the following financial and legal disadvantages:
* Legal costs associated with obtaining domestic partner documents to gain legal abilities granted automatically by legal marriage, including power of attorney, health care decision-making, and inheritance&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* A person can inherit an unlimited amount from a deceased spouse without incurring an estate tax, but is subject to taxes if inheriting from a same-sex partner&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;
* Same-sex couples were not eligible to file jointly as a married couple and thus could not take the advantages of lower tax rates when the individual income of the partners differs significantly&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;{{efn|In early 2013 the IRS recognized the community property and income of same-sex partners in community property states.&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;{{cite web|title=IRS Provides Answers to Community Property Filers|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Provides-Answers-to-Community-Property-Filers|publisher=United States Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Employer-provided health insurance coverage for a same-sex partner incurred federal income tax&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;
* Higher health costs associated with lack of insurance and preventative care: 20% of same-sex couples had a member who was uninsured compared to 10% of married opposite-sex couples&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Inability to protect jointly owned home from loss due to costs of potential medical catastrophe&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Inability of a U.S. citizen to [[Same-sex immigration policy in the United States|sponsor a same-sex spouse for citizenship]]&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;

Some 7,400 companies were offering spousal benefits to same-sex couples {{as of|2008|lc=y}}. In states that recognized same-sex marriages, same-sex couples could continue to receive those same benefits only if they married.&lt;ref&gt;Barkacs, L. L. (2008). "Same sex marriage, civil unions, and employee benefits: Unequal protection under the law – when will society catch up with the business community?", ''Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues, 11(2)'', 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 18% of private employers offered domestic partner health care benefits.&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;

Same-sex couples face the same financial constraints of legal marriage as opposite-sex married couples, including the [[marriage penalty]] in taxation.&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt; While social service providers usually do not count one partner's assets toward the income means test for welfare and disability assistance for the other partner, a legally married couple's joint assets are normally used in calculating whether a married individual qualifies for assistance.&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;

===Economic impact on the federal government===
The 2004 [[Congressional Budget Office]] study, working from an assumption "that about 0.6 percent of adults would enter into same-sex marriages if they had the opportunity" (an assumption in which they admitted "significant uncertainty") estimated that legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the United States "would improve the budget's bottom line to a small extent: by less than $1 billion in each of the next 10 years". This result reflects an increase in net government revenues (increased income taxes due to marriage penalties more than offsetting decreased tax revenues arising from postponed estate taxes). Marriage recognition would increase the government expenses for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program|Federal Employee Health Benefits]] but that increase would be more than made up for by decreased expenses for [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and [[Supplemental Security Income]].&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;

===Mental health===
Based in part on research that has been conducted on the adverse effects of stigmatization of gays and lesbians, numerous prominent social science organizations have issued position statements supporting same-sex marriage and opposing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; these organizations include the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;ref name="amici2011" /&gt;

Several psychological studies&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Price, M. [http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/marriage-bans.html "Upfront—Research uncovers the stress created by same-sex marriage bans"] in ''Monitor on Psychology'', Volume 40, No. 1, page 10, January 2009. Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potoczniak, Daniel J.; Aldea, Mirela A.; DeBlaere, Cirleen "Ego identity, social anxiety, social support, and self-concealment in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(4), October 2007, 447–457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balsam, Kimberly F.; Mohr, Jonathan J. "Adaptation to sexual orientation stigma: A comparison of bisexual and lesbian/gay adults." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(3), July 2007, 306–319.
&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for the LGBT population that may affect their health and well-being.

One study surveyed more than 1,500 lesbian, gay and bisexual adults across the nation and found that respondents from the 25 states that have outlawed same-sex marriage had the highest reports of "[[minority stress]]"—the chronic social stress that results from minority-group stigmatization—as well as general psychological distress. According to the study, the negative campaigning that comes with a ban is directly responsible for the increased stress. Past research has shown that [[minority stress]] is linked to health risks such as [[risky sexual behavior]] and substance abuse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Rostosky, Sharon Scales; Riggle, Ellen D. B.; Gray, Barry E.; Hatton, Roxanna L. "Minority stress experiences in committed same-sex couple relationships." ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice,'' Vol 38(4), August 2007, 392–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other studies examined personal reports from LGBT adults and their families living in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], immediately after a successful 2006 ballot campaign banned same-sex marriage. Most respondents reported feeling alienated from their communities. The studies also found that families experienced a kind of secondary minority stress, says Jennifer Arm, a counseling graduate student at the [[University of Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski, Dawn M.; Carr, Erika R.

''Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity,'' Vol 9(1), January 2008, 40–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' trial, expert witness [[Ilan Meyer]] testified that the mental health outcomes for gays and lesbians would improve if laws such as Proposition 8 did not exist because "when people are exposed to more stress...they are more likely to get sick..." and that particular situation is consistent with laws that say to gay people "you are not welcome here, your relationships are not valued." Such laws have "significant power", he said.&lt;ref name="testimony2"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Perry v.

In 2009, a pair of economists at [[Emory University]] tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of [[HIV]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sovo.com/2009/6-12/news/localnews/10213.cfm |title=Emory researchers: Gay marriage bans increase HIV infections |publisher=Webcitation.org |date= |accessdate=February 8, 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kNicjEc2?url=http://www.sovo.com/2009/6-12/news/localnews/10213.cfm |archivedate=October 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elaine Justice|url=http://shared.web.emory.edu/emory/news/releases/2009/06/study-links-gay-marriage-bans-to-rise-in-hiv-rate.html|title=Study Links Gay Marriage Bans to Rise in HIV infections|publisher=Emory.edu|date=|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study linked the passage of same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.

A study by the [[Columbia Mailman School of Public Health]] found that gay men in Massachusetts visited health clinics significantly less often following the legalization of same-sex marriage in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16203621|title=Gay marriage 'improves health'|publisher=BBC News |date=December 16, 2011|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage statistics==
There is no complete data on the number of same-sex marriages conducted in the United States. Some states and counties record the number of marriages, but the Federal Government does not. Nevertheless, in August 2016, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] published a research paper, in which it had linked the tax returns of same-sex couples who had filed jointly in 2014 with their Social Security records. This way, it was able to determine the number of same-sex marriages in the United States. Additionally, the Treasury estimated that about 97.5% of all married couples file their taxes jointly. The statistics showed that in 2014 there was an estimated 183,280 married same-sex couples.

According to the statistics, female couples were four times more likely to have adopted children, than male couples. Additionally, male couples earned a pretax average of $176,000 per year, while lesbian couples earned $124,000 and straight couples earned $113,000. Most female same-sex marriages were celebrated in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Seattle]], [[San Francisco]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield (MA)]] and [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], compared to San Francisco, [[New York City]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] and Seattle for gay male marriages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/upshot/the-most-detailed-map-of-gay-marriage-in-america.html The Most Detailed Map of Gay Marriage in America] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, one year after the Supreme Court handed down its decision in ''Obergefell v. Hodges'', [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] reported that nearly 1 million U.S. adults were in same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/06/22/same-sex-marriage-gay-lesbian-supreme-court/86228246/ Gay marriages up 33% in year since Supreme Court ruling]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case law==
{{see also|Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States#Lawsuits seeking to overturn statutory bans}}
United States [[case law]] regarding same-sex marriage:

===1970s===
* ''Anonymous v. Anonymous'', 67 Misc.2d 982 (N.Y. 1971). The law makes no provision for a "marriage" between persons of the same sex. 
* ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', 191 N.W.2d 185 (Minn. 1971). Upholds a Minnesota law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman.  ('''Overruled''' by ''Obergefell v. Hodges'' in 2015; see below)
* ''[[Jones v. Hallahan]]'', 501 S.W.2d 588 (Ky. 1973). Upholds the denial of a marriage license to two women in Kentucky based on dictionary definitions of marriage, despite the fact that state statutes do not specify the gender of marriage partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cantor, et.al|first=Donald J.|title=Same-Sex Marriage: The Legal and Psychological Evolution in America|year=2006|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|pages=117–8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lydHmmrHB8QC&amp;pg=PA117|isbn=9780819568120}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Frances B. v. Mark B.'', 78 Misc.2d 112 (1974). Marriage is and always has been a contract between a man and a woman.
* ''[[Singer v. Hara]]'', 522 P.2d 1187 (Wash. Ct. App. 1974). The historical definition of marriage is between one man and one woman, and same-sex couples are inherently ineligible to marry. This ban does not constitute sex discrimination.

===1980s===
* ''[[Adams v. Howerton]]'', 673 F.2d 1036 (9th Cir. 1982), ''cert. denied'', 458 U.S. 1111. A same-sex marriage does not make one a "spouse" under the ''Immigration and Nationality Act''.
* ''De Santo v. Barnsley'', 476 A.2d 952 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984). Same-sex couples can not divorce because they cannot form a common law marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12528764226087213713&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr De Santo v. Barnsley, May 11, 1984], retrieved January 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
* ''In re Estate of Cooper'', 149 Misc.2d 282 (Sur. Ct. Kings Co. 1990). The state has a compelling interest in fostering the traditional institution of marriage and prohibiting same-sex marriage.
* ''[[Baehr v. Lewin]]'', 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993). A statute limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violates the Hawaii constitution's equal-protection clause unless the state can show that the statute is both justified by compelling state interests and also narrowly tailored. This ruling prompted the adoption of Hawaii's [[Hawaii Constitutional Amendment 2 (1998)|constitutional amendment]] allowing the Legislature to restrict marriage to different-sex couples and the federal ''[[Defense of Marriage Act]]''.
* ''[[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia#Dean v. District of Columbia|Dean v. District of Columbia]]'', 653 A.2d 307 (D.C. 1995). DC does not authorise same-sex marriage; denial of a marriage license does not violate the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].
* ''Storrs v. Holcomb'', 645 N.Y.S.2d 286 (App. Div. 1996). New York does not recognize or authorize same-sex marriage. Overturned in part by ''Martinez v. County of Monroe'' in 2008.
* ''In re Estate of Hall'', 707 N.E.2d 201, 206 (Ill. App. Ct. 1998). Illinois does not recognize a same-sex marriage. The petitioner's claim to be in a same-sex marriage was not in a marriage recognized by law.
* ''[[Baker v. Vermont]]'', 170 Vt. 194; 744 A.2d 864 (Vt. 1999). The Common Benefits Clause of the state constitution requires that same-sex couples be granted the same legal rights as married persons, though it need not be called ''marriage''.

===2000s===
* ''Frandsen v. County of Brevard'', 828 So. 2d 757 (Fla. 2001). The Florida Constitution will not be construed to recognize same-sex marriage; sex classifications not subject to strict scrutiny under the Florida constitution.
* ''Burns v. Burns'', 560 S.E.2d 47 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002). Marriage is the union of one man and one woman.
* ''[[In re Estate of Gardiner]]'', 42 P.3d 120 (Kan. 2002). A post-operative male-to-female transsexual is not a woman within the meaning of the statutes and cannot validly marry another man.
* ''Rosengarten v. Downes'', 806 A.2d 1066 (Conn. Ct. App. 2002). Connecticut will not dissolve a Vermont civil union.
* ''Standhardt v. Superior Court ex rel. County of Maricopa'', 77 P.3d 451 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2003) The Constitution of Arizona does not provide the right to same-sex marriage.
* ''[[Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health]]'', 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003). The denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples violated provisions of the Massachusetts State Constitution guaranteeing individual liberty and equality, and it was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
* ''[[Same-sex marriage in Indiana#Lawsuits|Morrison v. Sadler]]'', 821 N.E.2d 15 (Ind. Super. Ct. 2005). Indiana's ''Defense of Marriage Act'' is valid.
* ''[[Langan v. St. Vincent's Hospital]]'', 802 N.Y.S.2d 476 (App. Div. 2005). For the purposes of New York's wrongful death statute, the survivor partner from a Vermont civil union lacks standing as a "spouse".
* ''[[Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning]]'', 455 F.3d 859 (8th Cir. 2006). Nebraska's [[Nebraska Initiative Measure 416 (2000)|Initiative Measure 416]] does not violate Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, was not a bill of attainder, and does not violate the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/06/07/052604P.pdf |title=Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning, 455 F.3d 859 (8th Cir. 2006) opinion |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Lewis v. Harris]]'', 908 A.2d 196 (N.J. 2006). Prohibiting same-sex ''marriage'' does not violate the New Jersey Constitution, but the state must extend all the rights and responsibilities of marriage to same-sex couples. The Legislature had 180 days to amend the marriage laws or create a "parallel structure".
* ''[[Andersen v. King County]]'', 138 P.3d 963 (Wash. 2006). Washington's ''Defense of Marriage Act'' does not violate the State Constitution.
* ''Hernandez v. Robles'', 855 N.E.2d 1 (N.Y. 2006). The New York State Constitution does not require that marriage rights be extended to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2006/2006_05239.htm Opinion of the Court, ''Hernandez v Robles''], accessed September 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Same-sex marriage in Maryland#Conaway v. Deane &amp; Polyak|Conaway v. Deane]]'', 932 A.2d 571 (Md. 2007). Upholds a Maryland law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman.
* ''[[Martinez v. County of Monroe]]'', 850 N.Y.S.2d 740 (App. Div. 2008). Because New York recognizes the marriages of opposite-sex couples from other jurisdictions, it must do the same for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Louis| first=Tim |url=http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/news/articles/2008/05/GAY-MARRIAGE-Technicality-delays|title=Gay Marriage: Technicality delays county's appeal|location=Rochester, N.Y. |newspaper=City Newspaper|date=|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'', 183 P.3d 384 (Cal. 2008). Limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples is invalid under the equal protection clause of the California Constitution. Full marriage rights, not merely domestic partnership, must be offered to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/S147999.pdf 'In re Marriage Cases], 183 P.3d 384 (Cal. 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health]]'' 957 A.2d 407 (Conn. 2008). The availability of civil unions but not marriage to same-sex partners is a violation of the equality and liberty provisions of the Connecticut Constitution.
* ''[[Strauss v. Horton]]'', 207 P.3d 48 (Cal. 2009). [[Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] was validly adopted, and marriages contracted before its adoption remain valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/S168047.pdf ''Strauss v. Horton''], 207 P.3d 48 (Cal. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Varnum v. Brien]]'', 763 N.W.2d 862 (Iowa 2009). Barring same-sex couples from marriage violates the equal protection provisions of the [[Iowa Constitution]]. Equal protection requires full marriage, rather than civil unions or some other substitute, for same-sex couples.

===2010s===
;Challenges to DOMA Section 3
* ''[[Gill v. Office of Personnel Management]]'' (2009–2013). Section 3 of the federal ''Defense of Marriage Act'' is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirms that ruling and stays implementation pending appeal. ''Windsor'' finds Section 3 unconstitutional and appeal of ''Gill'' is denied by the Supreme Court.
* ''[[Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services]]'' (2009–2013). Decided alongside ''Gill'' with the same outcome.
* ''[[Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management]]'' (2010–2013). Section 3 of the federal ''Defense of Marriage Act'' is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court, which determines that sexual orientation is a [[suspect classification|quasi-suspect classification]] requiring the court to apply [[intermediate scrutiny]], that is, to determine whether Section 3 relates to an important government interest. On appeal the case is held in abeyance pending the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Windsor'', which settles the issues raised in ''Golinski'', the appeal of which to the Supreme Court is then denied.
* ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' (2010–2013). Section 3 of the federal ''Defense of Marriage Act'' is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirms that ruling, as does the U.S. Supreme Court.

;California Proposition 8
* ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'' (2009–2013). California's Proposition 8, a voter-endorsed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court in ''Perry v. Schwarzenegger''. The proposition's backers appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upholds the district court's finding of unconstitutionality in ''Perry v. Brown''. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the proposition's backers lacked standing to appeal and left the district court ruling intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dolan|first=Maura|title=Prop 8: Gay marriages can resume in California, court rules |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-prop-8-gay-marriage-20130628,0,1889039.story|accessdate=June 28, 2013 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
