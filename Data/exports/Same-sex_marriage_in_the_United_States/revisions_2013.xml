===Federal law===
The legal issues surrounding same-sex marriage in the United States are determined by the nation's [[federalism|federal]] system of government, in which the [[Status (law)|status]] of a person (including marriage) in general is determined by the individual states. Prior to 1996, the federal government did not define marriage; any marriage recognized by a [[U.S. state|state]] was recognized by the federal government, even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more other states (as was the case with interracial marriage before 1967 due to [[anti-miscegenation laws]]). With the passage of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) in 1996, a marriage was explicitly defined in federal law as a union of one man and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|1|7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

DOMA was challenged in the [[United States federal courts|federal court system]]. On July 8, 2010, Judge [[Joseph Louis Tauro|Joseph Tauro]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|District Court of Massachusetts]] held that the denial of federal rights and benefits to lawfully married Massachusetts same-sex couples is unconstitutional under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name="hrc.org"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/us/09marriage.html|title=Judge Topples U.S. Rejection of Gay Unions|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 8, 2010|accessdate=June 2, 2011|first1=Abby|last1=Goodnough|first2=John|last2=Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/09/judge-rules-federal-same-sex-marriage-ban-unconstitutional/?iref=allsearch&amp;fbid=2-HnSdp2S6g|title=Judge rules federal same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional|publisher=CNN|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, eight federal courts have found DOMA to be unconstitutional on issues including bankruptcy, public employee benefits, [[estate tax]]es, and immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/entry/c/doma|title=The Defense of Marriage Act|publisher=Freedom to Marry|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/31/doma-unconstitutional-ruling-appeals-court-boston_n_1559031.html|title=DOMA Ruled Unconstitutional By Federal Appeals Court|last=Lavoie|first=Denise|date=May 31, 2012|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/defense-of-marriage-act-discriminates-against-gays-federal-court-rules-85899424320|title=Defense of Marriage Act Discriminates Against Gays, Federal Court Rules|last=Malewitz|first=Jim|date=October 18, 2012|publisher=Pewstates.org|accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals]] became the first court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tiven|first=Rachel|title=Edie Wins!

According to the federal government's [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) in 2004, [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|more than 1,138 rights and protections]] are conferred to U.S. citizens upon marriage by the federal government; areas affected include [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, veterans' benefits, health insurance, [[Medicaid]], hospital visitation, estate taxes, retirement savings, [[pension]]s, [[family leave]], and immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf|title=2004 updated report of the GAO|format=PDF|date=January 23, 2004|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many aspects of marriage law are determined by the states, rather than the federal government. The Defense of Marriage Act does not prevent individual states from defining marriage as they see fit. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', a same-sex marriage case filed in Minnesota, "for want of a substantial federal question."&lt;ref&gt;''Baker v. Nelson'', {{ussc|409|810|1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, the court upheld the state of Minnesota's right to restrict marriage to different-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Denniston|first=Lyle|title=Gay marriage and Baker v.

Marriage laws in states that do not permit or recognize same-sex marriage have led to court challenges, including ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'', which challenged the validity of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California's Proposition 8]] under the [[United States Constitution]],&lt;ref name="protectmarriage.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectmarriage.com/trial|title=Yes on 8 » Perry v.

Opponents of same-sex marriage have worked to prevent individual states from recognizing same-sex unions by attempting to amend the United States Constitution to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In 2006, the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], which would prohibit states from recognizing same-sex marriages, was approved by the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] on a party-line vote and was debated by the full United States Senate, but was ultimately defeated in both Houses of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/07/same.sex.marriage/index.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080511145406/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/07/same.sex.marriage/index.html|title=Senate blocks same-sex marriage ban|publisher=CNN|date=June 7, 2006|archivedate=May 11, 2008|accessdate=July 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2013, fourteen state governments (those of [[Massachusetts]], [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Iowa]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New York]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Delaware]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Minnesota]], and [[New Jersey]]) along with the [[District of Columbia]], the [[Jeni and Kitzen Branting|Coquille Indian Tribe]], the [[Same-sex marriage under United States tribal jurisdictions#Suquamish tribe|Suquamish tribe]], the [[Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians]], the [[Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians]], the [[Iipay Nation of Santa Ysabel]], the [[Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation]], the [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes]], and the [[Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe]] issue same-sex marriage licenses. On November 13, 2013, Gov. [[Neil Abercrombie]] of [[Hawaii]] signed a same-sex marriage bill that will go into effect on December 2, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-hawaii-gay-marriage-20131113,0,4215077.story#axzz2kZThK5wi&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Gov.

All jurisdictions in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast Corridor]], except for Pennsylvania, have legalized same-sex marriage. Prior to 2004, same-sex civil marriage was not recognized in any U.S. jurisdiction. It has since been legalized in different jurisdictions through legislation, court ruling,&lt;ref name="Adams &amp; Crary March 11, 2009"&gt;Glenn Adams and David Crary, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8789627 "Maine voters reject gay-marriage law"], November 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; tribal council rulings,&lt;ref name=LittleTraverseBayBand&gt;{{cite news|last=Houston|first=Sonya|title=Tribe marries same-sex couple but state won't recognize it|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/17/politics/michigan-same-sex-marriage/index.html?hpt=hp_c5|accessdate=March 18, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upheld by popular vote in a statewide referendum in three of these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/07/14978747-for-first-time-voters-back-gay-marriage-in-statewide-votes?lite|title=For first time, voters back gay marriage in statewide votes|publisher=NBC News|date=|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/01/10294578-washington-state-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill|title=Washington State Senate approves same-sex marriage|publisher=MSNBC|date=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Recognition of same-sex unions in Colorado|Colorado]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Nevada|Nevada]], [[Domestic partnership in Oregon|Oregon]], and [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Wisconsin|Wisconsin]] have created legal unions for same-sex couples that offer varying subsets of the rights and responsibilities of marriage under the laws of those jurisdictions. [[New Mexico]] law does not specifically allow nor prohibit same-sex marriage within the state, leaving the recognition or prohibition of same-sex marriage to the discretion of local authorities. As a result, the recognition or prohibition on same-sex marriage in New Mexico varies from county to county.

====History====
In 1998, in response to [[Baehr v. Miike|a Hawaii Supreme Court ruling]], Hawaii voters approved a state constitutional amendment [[Hawaii Constitutional Amendment 2 (1998)|allowing their legislature]] to ban same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Hawaii Office of Elections|title=General Election 1998|url=http://hawaii.gov/elections/results/1998/general/98swgen.htm|date=November 3, 1998|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the US Supreme Court struck down Texas' "Homosexual Conduct" law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Penal Code 2011, Title 5, Chapter 21. Sexual Offenses|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/docs/pe/htm/pe.21.htm|quote=Sec. 21.06. HOMOSEXUAL CONDUCT.

The other nine ban consensual sodomy for everyone: Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia. Thursday's ruling apparently invalidates those laws as well.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Same-sex marriage was first recognized by a United States jurisdiction on November 18, 2003, by a state Supreme Judicial Court ruling in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/11/18/sjc_gay_marriage_legal_in_mass/|title=SJC: Gay marriage legal in Mass.|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=November 18, 2003|accessdate=June 27, 2010|first1=Kathleen|last1=Burge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2008, the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued a decision in which it effectively legalized same-sex marriage in [[California]], holding that California's existing opposite-sex definition of marriage violated the constitutional rights of same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/05/15/same.sex.marriage/index.html|title=California same-sex marriage ban struck down|publisher=CNN|date=May 16, 2008|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mercury_mintz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_9269719|title=California Supreme Court legalizes same-sex marriage|last=Mintz|first=Howard|date=May 15, 2008|publisher=Mercury News|accessdate=May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage opponents in California placed a state constitutional amendment known as [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] on the November 2008 ballot for the purpose of restoring an opposite-sex definition of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/us/15cnd-scene.html "Gay Couples Rejoice at Ruling"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (Proposition 8 was somewhat unusual compared to other initiatives connected to same-sex marriage, since California had ratified same-sex marriages and Proposition 8 was a response intended to subsequently ''re-remove'' the right of marriage.) Proposition 8 was passed on Election Day 2008, as were proposed marriage-limiting amendments in Florida and Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/us/politics/06marriage.html "Bans in 3 States on Gay Marriage"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. November 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2010, a decision by the U.S. District Court in ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Perry v. Schwarzenegger|court=US District Court, Northern California|date=August 4, 2010|url=http://www.scribd.com/goodasyou/d/35374462-California-Prop-8-Ruling-August-2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision in that case was upheld at appeal and – as the State of California decided not to appeal or defend Proposition 8 – the voters who initially instigated the initiative appealed to the Supreme Court, which asked to be briefed for arguments concerning the appellants' [[standing]], and heard oral arguments on March 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm|title=''Hollingsworth v.

Same-sex marriage supporters make several arguments in support of their position.

The [[Human Rights Campaign]] (HRC) is one of the leading advocacy groups in support of same-sex marriage. According to the HRC's website, "Many same-sex couples want the right to legally marry because they are in love—many, in fact, have spent the last 10, 20 or 50 years with that person—and they want to honor their relationship in the greatest way our society has to offer, by making a public commitment to stand together in good times and bad, through all the joys and challenges family life brings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/answers-to-questions-about-marriage-equality Human Rights Campaign website].

The leading associations of psychological, psychiatric, medical, and social work professionals in the United States such as [[American Psychiatric Association]], [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Medical Association]], [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], [[American Academy of Nursing]] and [[National Association of Social Workers]] have said that claims that the legal recognition of marriage for same–sex couples undermines the institution of marriage and harms children is inconsistent with the scientific evidence which supports the conclusions: that [[homosexuality]] is a normal expression of human sexuality that is not chosen; that gay and lesbian people form stable, committed relationships essentially equivalent to heterosexual relationships; that same-sex parents are no less capable than opposite-sex parents to raise children; and that the children of same-sex parents are no less psychologically healthy and well-adjusted than children of opposite-sex parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdgln.com/news/2010/08/11/apa-reaffirms-support-same-sex-marriage|title=The APA reaffirms support for same-sex marriage|publisher=[[San Diego Gay and Lesbian News]]|date=|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2005_SameSexMarriage.pdf|title=Position Statement on Support of Legal Recognition of Same-Sex Civil Marriage|publisher=|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2002_Adoption.pdf|title=|publisher=|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org//ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.page|title=AMA Policy Regarding Sexual Orientation|publisher=Ama-assn.org|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/1/349.full|title=The Effects of Marriage, Civil Union, and Domestic Partnership Laws on the Health and Well-being of Children|publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialworkers.org/diversity/lgb/062005.asp|title=Overview of Same Sex Marriage in the U.S.: The Struggle for Civil Rights and Equality|publisher=Socialworkers.org|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aannet.org/assets/docs/marriage%20equality_7-26%2012f.pdf|title=|publisher=|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body of research strongly supports the conclusion that discrimination by the federal government between married same-sex couples and married opposite-sex couples in granting benefits unfairly stigmatizes same-sex couples.

A significant number of supporters prefer the term "marriage equality" to "same-sex marriage".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} [[Garden State Equality]] states that the latter implies a separate, and therefore unequal, category of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/issues/marriageequality/|title=Marriage Equality|publisher=Garden State Equality|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 Democratic Party Platform used the term "marriage equality" in its support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democrats.org/democratic-national-platform|title=The Democratic Party Platform|publisher=Democrats.org|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the legalization of same-sex marriage have successfully used social media websites such as Facebook to help achieve that goal.&lt;ref&gt;Switzer, Cody.

One of the largest scale uses of social media to mobilize support for same-sex marriage preceded and coincided with the arrival at the US Supreme Court of high-profile legal cases for Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act in March 2013. The 'red equals sign' project started by the Human Rights Campaign was an electronic campaign primarily based on Facebook which encouraged users to change their profile images to a red equal sign to express support for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/slideshow-hrc-logo-memes HRC Logo Memes] Retrieved April 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the court hearings it was estimated that approximately 2.5 million Facebook users changed their profile images to a red equals sign.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinman, Alexis [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/red-equal-sign-facebook_n_2980489.html How The Red Equal Sign Took Over Facebook, According To Facebook's Own Data] ''Huffington Post''.

{{See also|List of opponents of same-sex marriage in the United States}}

Opponents of same-sex marriage in the United States ground their arguments on parenting concerns, religious concerns, concerns that changes to the definition of marriage would lead to the inclusion of polygamy or incest, and in natural law-based reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homosexuality|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/#NatLaw|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=stanford.edu|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Baptist Convention adopted a statement in June 2003 that legalizing same-sex relationships would "convey a societal approval of a homosexual lifestyle, which the Bible calls sinful and dangerous both to the individuals involved and to society at large".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Same-Sex Marriage, June 2003|url=http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=1128|work=August 19, 2013|publisher=Southern Baptist Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], and [[National Organization for Marriage]] argue that children do best when raised by a mother and father, and that legalizing same-sex marriage is, therefore, contrary to the best interests of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/the-divine-institution-of-marriage|title=The Divine Institution of Marriage - LDS Newsroom|publisher=Beta-newsroom.lds.org|date=August 13, 2008|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/about/laity-marriage-family-life-and-youth/manandwoman.shtml|title=(FLWY)|publisher=USCCB|date=November 12, 2003|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gofbw.com/News.asp?id=11943|title=Obama celebrates gay dads on Father's Day - Florida Baptist Witness|publisher=Gofbw.com|date=July 2, 2010|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationformarriage.org/atf/cf/%7B39D8B5C1-F9FE-48C0-ABE6-1029BA77854C%7D/ProtestantEnglish.pdf|title=Why Marriage Matters|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maggie Gallagher]] of the National Organization for Marriage has raised concerns about the impact of same-sex marriage upon religious liberty and upon faith-based charities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/191kgwgh.asp|title=Banned in Boston|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]|date=May 15, 2006|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other arguments against same-sex marriage are based upon concerns that the process of redefining the institution would be a "[[Pandora's box]]". Stanley Kurtz of the ''Weekly Standard'' has written that same-sex marriage would eventually lead to the legalization of [[polygamy]] and [[polyamory]], or [[group marriage]], in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/938xpsxy.asp|title=Beyond Gay Marriage|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]|date=August 4, 2003|accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2012, President Obama announced in an interview with [[ABC News]] that after wrestling with the subject for many years, he had come to believe [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] should be allowed to marry. In the same interview, he stated his belief that individual states should have the final say as to whether same-sex marriage is recognized. The announcement made Obama the first United States president to publicly declare his support of same-sex marriage while in office, and marked a departure from his previous stance on the issue.&lt;ref name="obamasupport-ABCNews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18014102|title=Obama says same-sex couples should be able to marry|date=May 9, 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-09/news/sns-rt-us-usa-campaign-obama-gaymarriagebre84818y-20120509_1_gay-marriage-civil-unions-lesbian-couples|title=Same-sex couples should be able to marry: Obama|first=Jeff|last=Mason|work=Chicago Tribune|date=May 9, 2012|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ElectionCenter2008|publisher=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/issues/issues.samesexmarriage.html|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama had stated, "I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.

In the run-up to the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], the campaign of the Democratic presidential ticket (Obama-Biden) continually emphasized the administration's support for marriage equality, making it a key part of the campaign. President Obama was reelected and mentioned [[LGBT rights]] and marriage equality both explicitly and implicitly in both his victory speech on November 7, 2012, and in his [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration speech on January 21, 2013]].

==Effects of same-sex marriage==

===Economic impact on same-sex couples===
In June 2013, the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' struck down section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] and required the federal government to treat legally married same-sex couples on an equal basis with heterosexual married couples. Before that ruling, however, same-sex married couples faced a number of severe disadvantages. While some states extended full marriage rights to same-sex couples within their borders, until section 3 of DOMA was struck down none of those legally married couples were recognized by the federal government for any purpose, financial or otherwise.

According to a 1997 [[General Accounting Office]] study requested by Rep. [[Henry Hyde]] (R), at least 1,049 U.S. federal laws and regulations include reference to marital status.&lt;ref&gt;Dang, Alain, and M. Somjen Frazer.. "Black Same-Sex Couple Households in the 2000 U.S. Census: Implications in the Debate Over Same-Sex Marriage." Western Journal of Black Studies 29.1 (Spring2005 2005): 521–530. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. September 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A later 2004 study by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found 1,138 statutory provisions "in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving 'benefits, rights, and privileges.'"&lt;ref name=cbo1&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5559|title=The Potential Budgetary Impact of Recognizing Same-Sex Marriages|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=March 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these laws govern property rights, benefits, and taxation. Same-sex couples whose marriages are not recognized by the federal government were ineligible for spousal and survivor [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt; Badgett's research found that the resulting difference in Social Security income for same-sex couples compared to opposite-sex married couples was US$5,588 per year.

The federal ban on same-sex marriage and benefits through the 1996 [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) also extended to federal government employee benefits.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt; According to Badgett's work, same-sex couples faced the following other financial disadvantages against which legal marriage at least partially shielded opposite-sex couples:&lt;ref name="Badgett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Badgett|first=M.V. Lee|title=Money, Myths, and Change: The Economic Lives of Lesbians and Gay Men|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|year=2003|isbn=0-226-03401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Legal costs associated with obtaining domestic partner documents to gain legal abilities granted automatically by legal marriage, including power of attorney, health care decision-making, and inheritance&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* A legal spouse could inherit an unlimited amount from the deceased without incurring an estate tax but a same-sex partner would have to pay the estate tax on the inheritance from her/his partner&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;
* Same-sex couples were not eligible to file jointly as a married couple and thus could not take the advantages of lower tax rates when the individual income of the partners differs significantly&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt; (however, in early 2013 the IRS did recognize the community property and income of same-sex partners in community property states&lt;ref name=IRS&gt;{{cite web|title=IRS Provides Answers to Community Property Filers|url=http://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Provides-Answers-to-Community-Property-Filers|publisher=United States Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Only 18% of companies offered domestic partner health care benefits&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Employer-provided health insurance coverage for a same-sex partner incurred federal income tax, unlike like coverage provided to a heterosexual couple&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;
* Higher health costs associated with lack of insurance and preventative care: 20% of same-sex couples had a member who was uninsured compared to 10% of married opposite-sex couples&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Inability to protect jointly-owned home from loss due to costs of potential medical catastrophe&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Inability of a U.S. citizen to [[Same-sex immigration policy in the United States|sponsor a same-sex spouse for citizenship]], as married heterosexuals automatically could&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;

Some 7,400 companies were offering spousal benefits to same-sex couples as of 2008. In states that recognize same-sex marriages, same-sex couples can continue to receive those same benefits only if they marry.&lt;ref&gt;Barkacs, L. L. (2008). Same sex marriage, civil unions, and employee benefits: Unequal protection under the law – when will society catch up with the business community? ''Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues, 11(2)'', 33-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Potential economic disadvantages====
While the legal benefits of marriage are numerous, same-sex couples could face the same financial constraints of legal marriage as opposite-sex married couples. Such potential effects include the [[marriage penalty]] in taxation.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt; Similarly, while social service providers usually do not count one partner's assets toward the income means test for welfare and disability assistance for the other partner, a legally married couple's joint assets are normally used in calculating whether a married individual qualifies for assistance.&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;

===Economic impact on the federal government===
The 2004 [[Congressional Budget Office]] study, working from an assumption "that about 0.6 percent of adults would enter into same-sex marriages if they had the opportunity" (an assumption in which they admitted "significant uncertainty") estimated that legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the United States "would improve the budget's bottom line to a small extent: by less than $1&amp;nbsp;billion in each of the next 10 years". This result reflects an increase in net government revenues (increased income taxes due to marriage penalties more than offsetting decreased tax revenues arising from postponed estate taxes). Marriage recognition would increase the government expenses for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program|Federal Employee Health Benefits]] but that increase would be more than made up for by decreased expenses for [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and [[Supplemental Security Income]].&lt;ref name=cbo1 /&gt;

===Mental health===
Based in part on research that has been conducted on the adverse effects of stigmatization of gays and lesbians, numerous prominent social science organizations have issued position statements supporting same-sex marriage and opposing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; these organizations include the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;ref name="amici2011"/&gt;

Several psychological studies&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Price, M. [http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/marriage-bans.html "Upfront—Research uncovers the stress created by same-sex marriage bans"] in ''Monitor on Psychology'', Volume 40, No. 1, page 10, January 2009. Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potoczniak, Daniel J.; Aldea, Mirela A.; DeBlaere, Cirleen "Ego identity, social anxiety, social support, and self-concealment in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(4), October 2007, 447–457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Balsam, Kimberly F.; Mohr, Jonathan J. "Adaptation to sexual orientation stigma: A comparison of bisexual and lesbian/gay adults." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(3), July 2007, 306–319.
&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for the LGBT population that may affect their health and well-being.

One study surveyed more than 1,500 lesbian, gay and bisexual adults across the nation and found that respondents from the 25 states that have outlawed same-sex marriage had the highest reports of "[[minority stress]]"—the chronic social stress that results from minority-group stigmatization—as well as general psychological distress. According to the study, the negative campaigning that comes with a ban is directly responsible for the increased stress. Past research has shown that [[minority stress]] is linked to health risks such as risky sexual behavior and substance abuse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Rostosky, Sharon Scales; Riggle, Ellen D. B.; Gray, Barry E.; Hatton, Roxanna L. "Minority stress experiences in committed same-sex couple relationships." ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice,'' Vol 38(4), August 2007, 392–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other studies examined personal reports from LGBT adults and their families living in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], immediately after a successful 2006 ballot campaign banned same-sex marriage. Most respondents reported feeling alienated from their communities. The studies also found that families experienced a kind of secondary minority stress, says Jennifer Arm, a counseling graduate student at the [[University of Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski, Dawn M.; Carr, Erika R.

''Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity,'' Vol 9(1), January 2008, 40–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Ilan Meyer|Ilan H. Meyer]], Williams Senior Scholar of Public Policy at the [[UCLA School of Law]] and expert on [[minority stress]], has found through several studies that gays and lesbians encounter a disproportionate level of stress and mental health difficulties because of discrimination and oppressive laws, and that these stresses amplify the social stigma that makes them more susceptible to depression, suicide and substance abuse.&lt;ref name=testimony&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Stephanie|title=Ilan H.

Schwarzenegger]]'' trial, he testified that the mental health outcomes for gays and lesbians would improve if laws such as Proposition 8 did not exist because "when people are exposed to more stress...they are more likely to get sick..." and that particular situation is consistent with laws that say to gay people "you are not welcome here, your relationships are not valued." Such laws have "significant power", he said.&lt;ref name=testimony /&gt;&lt;ref name=testimony2&gt;{{cite web|first=Court Reporters|title=''Perry v.

===Physical health===
In 2009, a pair of economists at [[Emory University]] tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of [[HIV]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kNicjEc2|title=Emory researchers: Gay marriage bans increase HIV infections|publisher=Webcitation.org|date=|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elaine Justice|url=http://shared.web.emory.edu/emory/news/releases/2009/06/study-links-gay-marriage-bans-to-rise-in-hiv-rate.html|title=Study Links Gay Marriage Bans to Rise in HIV infections|publisher=Emory.edu|date=|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study linked the passage of same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.

A study by the [[Columbia Mailman School of Public Health]] found that gay men in Massachusetts visited health clinics significantly less often following the legalization of same-sex marriage in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16203621|title=Gay marriage 'improves health'|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|date=December 16, 2011|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polling===
Polling in states that have legalized same-sex marriage has shown that a majority of respondents generally agree the legalization of same sex marriage has had no effect on them.

A survey done by [[Public Policy Polling]] of 1,539 registered Massachusetts voters in May 2013 found that 60% of respondents claimed the legalization of same-sex marriage had "no impact" on their personal lives, with an additional 25% citing a "positive impact". Only 15% of respondents claimed the legalization of same-sex marriage had a "negative impact" on their personal lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/05/hillary-leads-dem-2016-field-among-massachusetts-voters.html#more|title=Hillary leads Dem 2016 field among Massachusetts voters|publisher=Public Policy Polling|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey done by [[Public Policy Polling]] of 668 registered Iowa voters in July 2013 found that 63% of respondents claimed the legalization of same-sex marriage had "no impact" on their personal lives, with an additional 11% citing a "positive impact". The 26% citing a "negative impact" was driven by "very conservative" voters, of whom 70% said the legalization of same-sex marriage had a "negative impact". All other political ideologies agreed the legalization of same-sex marriage has had no impact on their personal lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_Iowa_710.pdf|title=Iowans divided, but power unlikely to change hands|publisher=Public Policy Polling|date=July 10, 2013|format=PDF|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey done by [[Public Policy Polling]] of 953 registered Maine voters in August 2013 found that 62% of respondents claimed the legalization of same-sex marriage had "no impact" on their personal lives, with an additional 18% citing a "positive impact".

===2010s===
* ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'', 704 F. Supp. 2d 921 (N.D. Cal. 2010). California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] (2008) violates fundamental right to marry under ''Loving v. Virginia'', violates Due Process and Equal Protection Causes of the Fourteenth Amendment, and illegally discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation. Proposition 8 is driven only by animus against same-sex couples; therefore, does not survive [[rational basis review]]. Permanently enjoins CA from enforcing Prop 8; order was stayed pending appeal to the U.S. [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], where it was affirmed. After the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'', the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal and vacated the stay.
* ''[[Perry v. Brown]]'', Slip Op. (9th Cir. 2012), ''Perry v. Schwarzenegger'' affirmed on the grounds that under ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', Proposition 8's withdrawal of the designation of "marriage" from same-sex couples violates the Equal Protection Clause as there is no legitimate government interest to sustain a [[rational basis review]]; therefore, it is driven only by animus against gays and lesbians. The case was appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court as ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'', and the Court heard oral arguments on March 26, 2013. On June 26, 2013, the Court ordered the dismissal of the appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for lack of legal standing by the Prop 8 proponents. As a result, on June 28, the Ninth Circuit lifted its stay in the case, and the first same-sex marriages after the Supreme Court's ruling occurred that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dolan|first=Maura|title=Prop 8: Gay marriages can resume in California, court rules|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-prop-8-gay-marriage-20130628,0,1889039.story|accessdate=June 28, 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver|Griego v. Oliver]]''.
* In ''[[Recognition of same-sex unions in New Jersey#Garden State Equality v. Dow|Garden State Equality v. Dow]]'', New Jersey Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson ruled on September 27, 2013, that in the wake of the ''Windsor'' ruling by the U. S. Supreme Court, [[Recognition of same-sex unions in New Jersey|New Jersey's civil unions law]] violates equal protection guarantees to its citizens, and ordered that the state allow same-sex couples to marry beginning on October 21. The New Jersey Supreme Court subsequently accepted the state's appeal, scheduling oral arguments for January 6–7, 2014, but denying the state's request for a stay of the lower court's ruling, meaning that same-sex marriages would begin on the date ordered by Judge Jacobson. Following the denial of its request for a stay, the state dropped its appeal, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in New Jersey.
