'''Same-sex marriage''', also referred to as '''gay marriage''' is a [[marriage]] between two persons of the same sex.  The [[federal government of the United States]] does not recognize the marriages of same sex couples and is prohibited from doing so by the [[Defense of Marriage Act]].  Nationwide, four states have legalized same-sex marriage as a result of a court ruling, while three others have done so through a vote in their respective state legislatures. New York and the District of Columbia do not grant but recognize legal out-of-state same-sex marriages. In California, same-sex marriage was legal from June to November 2008, after the California Supreme Court held the statutes limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the state constitution; but the California electorate then approved a voter initiative that reinstated the ban on same-sex marriage as part of the constitution.  Marriages performed during the period remain legally valid.

Same-sex marriage is permitted in five of the 50 [[U.S. states|states]]:
* In [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[Same-sex marriage in Connecticut|Connecticut]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iowa|Iowa]], and [[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]], marriages for same sex couples are legal and currently performed.
* In [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], same-sex marriages will begin on January 1, 2010.

States which previously allowed same-sex marriage:
* In [[Same-sex marriage in California|California]], same-sex marriages were performed between June 16, 2008 and November 4, 2008. The marriages that were performed during this period are still recognized. On October 12, 2009, Governor Schwarzenegger signed SB 54 allowing same-sex marriages from other states or foreign countries performed on or before November 4, 2008, to be recognized as well.
 
States which recognize same-sex marriage but do not grant same-sex marriage certificates:
* In [[Same-sex marriage in New York|New York]] and [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the District of Columbia|Washington, 
D.C.]], same-sex marriages from other states or foreign countries are recognized but they are not performed. 
* In [[Same-sex marriage in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]], two opinions of the attorney general suggest that same-sex marriages should be recognized, but a state Supreme Court opinion appears to contradict this position; same-sex marriages are not performed in [[Rhode Island]].

The movement to obtain [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|marriage rights]] and benefits for same-sex couples in the [[United States]] began in the early [[1970s]]. The issue became even more prominent in [[U.S. politics]] in the mid-[[1990s]] with a public backlash toward the idea evidenced by [[United States Congress|Congress]]' passage of the [[1996]] [[Defense of Marriage Act]]. In the late [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], [[New England]] became the center of an organized push to legalize [[same-sex marriage]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] with half of the six states comprising that region passing laws granting same-sex couples the legal right to marry. The issue remains politically divisive in the [[United States]].

==Legal issues==
{{See also|Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States}}

===Federal law===
The legal issues surrounding same-sex marriage in the United States are complicated by the nation's [[federalism|federal]] system of government. Traditionally, the federal government did not attempt to establish its own definition of marriage; any marriage recognized by a [[U.S. state|state]] was recognized by the federal government, even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more other states (as was the case with [[Anti-miscegenation laws|interracial marriage]] before 1967 due to [[anti-miscegenation laws]]). With the passage of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] in 1996, however, a marriage was explicitly defined as a union of one man and one woman for the purposes of federal law. (See {{usc|1|7}}.) Thus, no act or agency of the federal government currently recognizes same-sex marriage.

According to the federal government's [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|more than 1,138 rights and protections]] are conferred to U.S. citizens upon marriage by the federal government; areas affected include Social Security benefits, veterans' benefits, health insurance, Medicaid, hospital visitation, estate taxes, retirement savings, pensions, family leave, and immigration law.

However, many aspects of marriage law affecting the day to day lives of inhabitants of the United States are determined by the states, not the federal government, and the Defense of Marriage Act does not prevent individual states from defining marriage as they see fit.

The United States Supreme Court in 1972 dismissed ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', a case originating in Minnesota, "for want of a substantial federal question".

Five states have legalized same-sex marriage: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, and New Hampshire.&lt;ref name="Adams &amp; Crary 11-03-2009"&gt;Glenn Adams and David Crary, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/03/AR2009110302576.html?hpid=topnews "Maine voters reject gay-marriage law,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In all five cases this has been through legislation or court ruling.&lt;ref name="Adams &amp; Crary 11-03-2009"/&gt; As of November 2009, when legislation legalizing same-sex marriage in Maine was defeated by referendum, same-sex marriage had been defeated in all 31 states in which it had been directly put to a popular vote.&lt;ref name="Adams &amp; Crary 11-03-2009"/&gt;  Thirty states have passed constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="Adams &amp; Crary 11-03-2009"/&gt;

Same-sex marriage has been legal in [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] since November 18, 2003; in [[Same-sex marriage in Connecticut|Connecticut]] since October 10, 2008 (having previously legalized civil unions in October 2005);&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-gaymarriage1011.artoct11,0,5399554.story State Supreme Court Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage]", ''[[Hartford Courant]]''&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Same-sex marriage in Iowa|Iowa]] since April 27, 2009;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.365gay.com/news/iowa-supreme-court-strikes-down-gay-marriage-ban/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.365gay.com/news/iowa-gay-marriages-delayed/&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]] since September 1, 2009. Same-sex marriages will be performed in [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] starting January 1, 2010.

Same-sex marriage is recognized only at the state level, as the federal [[Defense of Marriage Act]] explicitly bars federal recognition of such marriages.

Opponents of same-sex marriage have attempted to prevent individual states from recognizing same-sex unions by attempting to amend the [[United States Constitution]] to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In 2006, the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], which would prohibit states from recognizing same-sex marriages, was approved by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-controlled [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], on a party-line vote, and was debated by the full United States Senate, but was ultimately defeated in both houses of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/07/same.sex.marriage/index.html Senate blocks same-sex marriage ban]", [[CNN]], June 7, 2006, (Accessed July 5, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to marry was first extended to same-sex couples by a United States jurisdiction on November 18, 2003, in Massachusetts by a state Supreme Judicial Court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/11/18/sjc_gay_marriage_legal_in_mass/&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2008, the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued a decision in which it effectively legalized same-sex marriage in [[California]], holding that California's existing opposite-sex definition of marriage violated the constitutional rights of same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/15/same.sex.marriage/index.html California same-sex marriage ban struck down]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mercury_mintz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_9269719|title=California Supreme Court legalizes same-sex marriage|last=Mintz|first=Howard|date=May 15, 2008|publisher=Mercury News|language=en|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage opponents in California placed a state constitutional amendment known as [[Proposition 8]] on the November ballot for the purpose of restoring an opposite-sex definition of marriage;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/us/15cnd-scene.html?bl&amp;ex=1210996800&amp;en=184fe9e64c13a342&amp;ei=5087%0A nytimes.com, Gay Couples Rejoice at Ruling]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Proposition 8]] was passed on Election Day 2008, as were proposed marriage-limiting amendments in Florida and Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/us/politics/06marriage.html Bans in 3 States on Gay Marriage]"&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[California Proposition 8 (2008)#Legal_challenges|California amendment was challenged]] in a court proceeding, but was upheld by the state supreme court, in a 6-1 vote, on May 26, 2009.  The court ruled, however, that the approximately 18,000 same-sex marriages that took place in 2008 would remain valid.

On October 10, 2008, the Connecticut Supreme Court overturned the state's civil-unions statute (2005), as unconstitutionally discriminating against same-sex couples, and required the state to recognize same-sex marriages.

Same-sex marriage was legalized in [[Iowa]] following the unanimous ruling of the [[Iowa Supreme Court]] in ''[[Varnum v. Brien]]'' on April 3, 2009.  &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090403/NEWS/90403010 Unanimous ruling: Iowa marriage no longer limited to one man, one woman]'', ''[[Des Moines Register]]'', April 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was initially to take effect on April 24, but the date was changed to April 27 for administrative reasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.365gay.com/news/iowa-gay-marriages-delayed/&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, 2009, [[Vermont]] legalized same-sex marriage through legislation. The Governor had previously vetoed the measure, but the veto was overridden by the Legislature. Vermont became the first state in the United States to legalize same-sex marriage through legislation, as opposed to litigation, albeit without the governor's signature. On the same day, the City Council of the federal District of Columbia passed a bill by a 12–1 vote that recognizes same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, although the bill is subject to Congressional approval.&lt;ref&gt;http://voices.washingtonpost.com/dc/2009/05/dc_council_votes_to_recognize.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

On May 6, 2009, Maine became the fifth state to legalize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maine.gov/tools/whatsnew/index.php?topic=Gov+News&amp;id=72146&amp;v=Article-2006&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was overturned by referendum in November of 2009.&lt;ref name="Adams &amp; Crary 11-03-2009"/&gt;

On June 3, 2009, New Hampshire became the sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2009/HB0436.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 1, 2009, [[New Jersey]] has created legal unions that, while not called marriages, are explicitly defined as offering all the rights and responsibilities of marriage under state (though not federal) law to same-sex couples. [[Colorado]], [[Hawaii]], [[Maryland]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Washington]] and the [[District of Columbia]] have created legal unions for same-sex couples that offer varying subsets of the rights and responsibilities of marriage under the laws of those jurisdictions.  

As of January 1, 2009, thirty states have constitutional amendments explicitly barring the recognition of same-sex marriage, defining civil marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/us/politics/06marriage.html Number of states]", [[NYTimes.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;  More than forty states explicitly restrict marriage to two persons of the opposite sex, including some of those that have created legal recognition for same-sex unions under a name other than "marriage", e.g., civil unions and domestic partnerships.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  Nineteen states ban any legal recognition of same-sex unions that would be equivalent to civil marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/documents/marriage_prohibitions_2009.pdf Statewide Marriage Prohibitions] plus Kansas http://www.kslib.info/constitution/art15.html&lt;/ref&gt;  New York courts have ruled that same-sex marriages conducted in states where they are legal must be recognized by those states, but that the state statutes do not allow the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses — as a result New York now has same-sex divorces without allowing same-sex weddings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nycourts.gov/ad4/court/Decisions/2008/02-01-08/PDF/1562.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey only recognized same-sex marriages for the purpose of divorce, otherwise they are converted to Civil Unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aclu-nj.org/news/aclunjwinscaseallowingsame.htm|title=ACLU-NJ Wins Case Allowing Same-Sex Couple To Divorce in NJ|date=2009-02-06|accessdate=2009-08-03|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennsylvania state senator [[John Eichelberger]] plans to introduce a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage in Pennsylvania. However, Senator [[Daylin Leach]] has introduced a bill that would legalize same sex marriage.&lt;ref name="advocate-pa-ban"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid84636.asp|title=Pa.

===Impact of foreign laws===
The nationwide legalization of [[same-sex marriage in Canada]] has raised questions about U.S. law, because of Canada's proximity to the U.S. and the fact that Canada has no citizenship or residency requirement to receive a marriage certificate (unlike [[same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] and the [[same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]]). Canada and the U.S. have a history of respecting marriages contracted in either country.

Immediately after the June 2003 ruling legalizing [[same-sex marriage in Ontario]], a number of American couples went or planned to go to the province in order to get married. A coalition of American national [[gay rights]] groups issued a statement asking couples to contact them before attempting legal challenges, so that they might be coordinated as part of the same-sex marriage movement in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Same-sex marriages are recognized nationwide in the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]], [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]], [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]]. [[Nepal]] is waiting to introduce legislation to legalize same-sex marriage, after a Supreme Court decision. Same-sex marriage conducted abroad is recognized in [[Same-sex marriage in Israel|Israel]], the U.S. State of [[Same-sex marriage in New York|New York]], and the U.S. federal [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]]. Only Dutch same-sex marriages are recognized in [[Same-sex marriage in Aruba|Aruba]] and the [[Same-sex marriage in Netherlands Antilles|Netherlands Antilles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.365gay.com/news/081108-gay-marriage-antilles/ Dutch island fights marriage ruling]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:If your marriage needs protecting.jpg|thumb|250px|T-shirt reading "If your marriage needs protecting you need a therapist not an amendment" (May 2009, Fresno, California)]]
Same-sex marriage supporters make several arguments in support of their position.  Advocates of same-sex marriage sometimes liken prohibitions on same-sex marriage to past prohibitions on interracial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2004-01-25-couples_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Some same-sex marriage supporters argue that same-sex marriage should be allowed because same-sex marriage extends a civil right to a minority group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/06/espuelas.prop.eight/&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Ott argues against the position that same-sex marriage would devalue marriage as a whole by referencing other historical events such as [[suffrage|allowing women to vote]] and describes the prohibition of same-sex marriage as devaluing the American principle of [[equal treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.progressive.org/media_324 |title=Banning same-sex marriage would protect no one |publisher=[[The Progressive]] |author=Christopher Ott |date=2005-02-08 |accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of same-sex marriage==

===Economic impact on same-sex couples===
{{Refimprovesect|date=December 2008}}
Dr. M. V. Lee Badgett, an economist and associate professor at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], has studied the impact of same-sex legal marriage on same-sex couples.  According to a 1997 [[General Accounting Office]] study requested by Rep. [[Henry Hyde]] (R), at least 1,049 U.S. Federal laws and regulations include reference to marital status.&lt;ref&gt;Dang, Alain, and M. Somjen Frazer.. "Black Same-Sex Couple Households in the 2000 U.S. Census: Implications in the Debate Over Same-Sex Marriage." Western Journal of Black Studies 29.1 (Spring2005 2005): 521-530. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 30 Sep. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A later 2004 study by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] finds 1,138 statutory provisions "in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving 'benefits, rights, and privileges.'"&lt;ref name=cbo1&gt;{{cite paper
|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5559
|title=The Potential Budgetary Impact of Recognizing Same-Sex Marriages
|publisher=Congressional Budget Office

|accessdate=8 March 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these laws govern property rights, benefits, and taxation. Same-sex couples are ineligible for spousal and survivor [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits. Badgett's research finds the resulting difference in Social Security income for same-sex couples compared to opposite-sex married couples is US$5,588 per year. The federal ban on same-sex marriage and benefits through the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) extends to federal government employee benefits. According to Badgett's work, same-sex couples face other financial challenges against which legal marriage at least partially shields opposite-sex couples:

* potential loss of couple's home from medical expenses of one partner caring for another gravely ill one
* costs of supporting two households, travel, or emigration out of the U.S. for an American citizen unable to legally marry a non-U.S. citizen
* higher cost of purchasing private insurance for partner and children if company is not one of 18% that offer domestic partner benefits
* higher taxes: unlike a company's contribution to an employee's spouse's health insurance, domestic partner benefits are taxed as additional compensation
* legal costs associated with obtaining domestic partner documents to gain some of the power of attorney, health care decision-making, and inheritance rights granted through legal marriage
* higher health costs associated with lack of insurance and preventative care: 20% of same-sex couples have a member who is uninsured compared to 10% of married opposite-sex couples
* current tax law allows a spouse to inherit an unlimited amount from the deceased without incurring an estate tax but an unmarried partner would have to pay the estate tax on the inheritance from her/his partner
* same-sex couples are not eligible to file jointly or separately as a married couple and thus cannot take the advantages of lower tax rates when the individual income of the partners differs significantly

While state laws grant full marriage rights ([[Connecticut]], [[Iowa]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Vermont]]) or some or all of the benefits under another name ([[New Jersey]], California, etc.), these state laws do not extend the benefits of marriage on the Federal level, and most states do not currently recognize same-sex marriages or civil unions from other states.

One often overlooked aspect of same-sex marriage are the potential ''negative'' effects on same-sex couples. While the legal benefits of marriage are numerous, same-sex couples would face the same financial constraints of legal marriage as opposite-sex married couples. Such potential effects include the [[marriage penalty]] in taxation. Similarly, while social service providers usually do not count one partner's assets toward the income means test for welfare and disability assistance for the other partner, a legally married couple's joint assets are normally used in calculating whether a married individual qualifies for assistance.

===Mental health===
Recently, several psychological studies&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Price, M. "UPFRONT - Research uncovers the stress created by same-sex marriage bans" in ''Monitor on Psychology'', Volume 40, No. 1, page 10, January 2009. Washington DC: American Psychological Association. [http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/marriage-bans.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potoczniak, Daniel J.; Aldea, Mirela A.; DeBlaere, Cirleen"Ego identity, social anxiety, social support, and self​-​concealment in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(4), Oct 2007, 447-457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Balsam, Kimberly F.; Mohr, Jonathan J. "Adaptation to sexual orientation stigma: A comparison of bisexual and lesbian/gay adults." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(3), Jul 2007, 306-319.
&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for the LGBT population that may affect their health and well-being.

One study surveyed more than 1,500 lesbian, gay and bisexual adults across the nation and found that respondents from the 25 states that have outlawed same-sex marriage had the highest reports of "minority stress" — the chronic social stress that results from minority-group stigmatization — as well as general psychological distress. According to the study, the negative campaigning that comes with a ban is directly responsible for the increased stress. Past research has shown that minority stress is linked to health risks such as risky sexual behavior and substance abuse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Rostosky, Sharon Scales; Riggle, Ellen D. B.; Gray, Barry E.; Hatton, Roxanna L. "Minority stress experiences in committed same​-​sex couple relationships." ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice,'' Vol 38(4), Aug 2007, 392-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other studies examined personal reports from LGBT adults and their families living in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], immediately after a successful 2006 ballot campaign banned same-sex marriage. Most respondents reported feeling alienated from their communities, afraid that they would lose custody of their children and that they might become victims of violence. The studies also found that families experienced a kind of secondary minority stress, says Jennifer Arm, a counseling graduate student at the [[University of Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski, Dawn M.; Carr, Erika R.

In 2009, a pair of economists at [[Emory University]] tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of [[HIV]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sovo.com/2009/6-12/news/localnews/10213.cfm Emory researchers: Gay marriage bans increase HIV infections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emory.edu/home/news/releases/2009/06/study-links-gay-marriage-bans-to-rise-in-hiv-rate.html Study Links Gay Marriage Bans to Rise in HIV infections]&lt;/ref&gt; The study linked the passage of same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.
