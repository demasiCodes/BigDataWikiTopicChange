'''Same-sex marriage in the United States''' expanded from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015 through various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes, and federal court rulings. [[Same-sex marriage]] is also referred to as '''gay marriage''', while the political status in which the marriages of same-sex couples and the marriages of opposite-sex couples are recognized as equal by the law is referred to as '''marriage equality'''.

Civil rights campaigning in support of marriage without distinction as to sex or sexual orientation began in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Same-Sex Couple Who Got a Marriage License in 1971|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/us/the-same-sex-couple-who-got-a-marriage-license-in-1971.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 16, 2015|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the now overturned ''[[Baker v.

Miike|Baehr v. Lewin]]'' that it was unconstitutional under the [[Constitution of Hawaii|state constitution]] for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. That ruling led to federal and state actions to explicitly abridge marriage on the basis of sex in order to prevent the marriages of same-sex couples from being recognized by law, the most prominent of which was [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]]. In 2003, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled in ''[[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health]]'' that it was unconstitutional under the [[Constitution of Massachusetts|state constitution]] for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. From 2004 through to 2015, as [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|the tide of public opinion]] continued to move towards support of same-sex marriage, various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes ([[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s), and federal court rulings established same-sex marriage in 36 states.

Windsor]]'', leading to federal recognition of same-sex marriage, with federal benefits for married couples connected to either the state of residence or the state in which the marriage was solemnized. In 2015, [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|national public support for same-sex marriage]] rose to 60% for the first time.&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite web|title=Record-High 60% of Americans Support Same-Sex Marriage|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/183272/record-high-americans-support-sex-marriage.aspx|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the Supreme Court ruled in the [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] [[civil rights]] case of ''[[Obergefell v.

The most prominent supporters of same-sex marriage are human rights and civil rights organizations as well as the medical and scientific communities, while the most prominent opponents are religious groups. The ruling of the Supreme Court in ''Obergefell'' occurred following decades of consistently rising [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|national public support for same-sex marriage in the United States]], with support continuing to rise thereafter.

A [[#Child suicide|study of nationwide data from January 1999 to December 2015]] revealed that the establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation, resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States.

The [[United States of America]] is the most populous country in the world to have established same-sex marriage nationwide.

[[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States]] has shifted rapidly since polling of the American people regarding the issue first began on an occasional basis in the 1980s and a regular basis in the 1990s, with support having consistently risen while opposition has continually fallen. National support rose above 50% for the first time in 2011 and has not gone below that mark since then. National support rose to 60% for the first time in 2015 and has not gone below that mark since then. Support continues to rise while opposition continues to fall each year, driven in large part by a significant generational gap in support.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/234866/two-three-americans-support-sex-marriage.aspx|title=Two in Three Americans Support Same-Sex Marriage|work=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|date=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Rights Campaign]], the largest [[LGBT rights]] organization in the United States, states that "many same-sex couples want the right to legally marry because they are in love — many, in fact, have spent the last 10, 20 or 50 years with that person — and they want to honor their relationship in the greatest way our society has to offer, by making a public commitment to stand together in good times and bad, through all the joys and challenges family life brings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/answers-to-questions-about-marriage-equality Human Rights Campaign website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206134235/http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/answers-to-questions-about-marriage-equality |date=February 6, 2012 }}.

One of the largest scale uses of social media to mobilize support for same-sex marriage preceded and coincided with the arrival at the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] of high-profile legal cases for [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] and [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]] in March 2013. The "red equal sign" project started by the [[Human Rights Campaign]] was an electronic campaign primarily based on Facebook that encouraged users to change their profile images to a red equal sign to express support for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/slideshow-hrc-logo-memes HRC Logo Memes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408223009/http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/slideshow-hrc-logo-memes |date=April 8, 2013 }} Retrieved April 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the court hearings, an estimated 2.5 million Facebook users changed their profile images to a red equal sign.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinman, Alexis [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/red-equal-sign-facebook_n_2980489.html How The Red Equal Sign Took Over Facebook, According To Facebook's Own Data] ''[[HuffPost]]''.

===Opposition===
Opposition to same-sex marriage is based on the beliefs that homosexuality is unnatural and abnormal, that the recognition of same-sex unions will promote homosexuality in society, and that children are better off when raised by opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref name="thoughtco"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thoughtco.com/moral-and-religious-arguments-250095 | title=Common Arguments Against Gay

Miike|Baehr v. Lewin]]'' that it was unconstitutional under the [[Constitution of Hawaii|state constitution]] for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. That ruling led to federal and state actions to explicitly abridge marriage on the basis of sex in order to prevent the marriages of same-sex couples from being recognized by law, the most prominent of which was [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]]. In 2003, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled in ''[[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health]]'' that it was unconstitutional under the [[Constitution of Massachusetts|state constitution]] for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. From 2004 through to 2015, as [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|the tide of public opinion]] continued to move towards support of same-sex marriage, various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes ([[referenda]] and [[initiative]]s), and federal court rulings established same-sex marriage in 36 states.

In 2004, [[Coretta Scott King]], a leader of the [[African-American civil rights movement]] and the widow of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], expressed her support for same-sex marriage and publicly denounced attempts to define marriage as the "union of a man and a woman" as a form of "gay bashing".&lt;ref name="Michael Long"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeanne Theoharis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; In 2007, [[Mildred Loving]], the joint plaintiff alongside her husband [[Richard Loving]] in the 1967 landmark civil rights case of ''[[Loving v.

{{See also|Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States}}

The legal issues surrounding [[same-sex marriage]] in the United States are determined by the nation's [[federalism|federal]] system of government, in which the [[Status (law)|status]] of a person, including marital status, is determined in large measure by the individual states. Prior to 1996, the federal government did not define marriage; any marriage recognized by a [[U.S. state|state]] was recognized by the federal government, even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more states, as was the case until 1967 with [[Interracial marriage in the United States|interracial marriage]], which some states [[anti-miscegenation laws|banned by statute]].

Prior to 2004, [[same-sex marriage]] was not performed or recognized in any [[List of states and territories of the United States|U.S. jurisdiction]], but subsequently began to be performed and recognized by law in different jurisdictions through legislation, court rulings,&lt;ref name="Adams &amp; Crary March 11, 2009"&gt;Glenn Adams and David Crary, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8789627 "Maine voters reject gay-marriage law"], November 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; tribal council rulings,&lt;ref name="LittleTraverseBayBand"&gt;{{cite news|last=Houston|first=Sonya|title=Tribe marries same-sex couple but state won't recognize it|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/17/politics/michigan-same-sex-marriage/index.html?hpt=hp_c5|accessdate=March 18, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and popular referenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/07/14978747-for-first-time-voters-back-gay-marriage-in-statewide-votes?lite|title=For first time, voters back gay marriage in statewide votes|publisher=NBC News|date=|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/01/10294578-washington-state-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill|title=Washington State Senate approves same-sex marriage|publisher=MSNBC|date=February 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202041745/http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/01/10294578-washington-state-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill|archivedate=February 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Keweenaw Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keweenawreport.com/news/kbic-council-shake-up-casino-plan-rejected/|title=KBIC Council Shake-Up; Casino Plan Rejected |publisher=The Keweenaw Report |date=December 14, 2014 |accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' ended all inter-state legal complications surrounding same-sex marriage, as it orders states to both perform the marriages of same-sex couples and to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples performed in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/gay-marriage-supreme-court-decision-119463.html|title=Supreme Court gay marriage decision: Full text of Obergefell ruling|newspaper=Politico|date=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal law===
According to the federal government's [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) in 2004, [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|more than 1,138 rights and protections]] are conferred to U.S. citizens upon marriage by the federal government; areas affected include [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, veterans' benefits, health insurance, [[Medicaid]], hospital visitation, estate taxes, retirement savings, pensions, [[family leave]], and immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf|title=2004 updated report of the GAO|format=PDF |date=January 23, 2004|publisher=GAO|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since July 9, 2015, married same-sex couples throughout the United States have equal access to all the federal benefits that married opposite-sex couples have.&lt;ref name="lynch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-lynch-announces-federal-marriage-benefits-available-same-sex-couples|title=Attorney General Lynch Announces Federal Marriage Benefits Available to Same-Sex Couples Nationwide|date=July 9, 2015|publisher=Department of Justice|author=Loretta Lynch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110003040/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-lynch-announces-federal-marriage-benefits-available-same-sex-couples|archivedate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Defense of Marriage Act]]'' (DOMA) was enacted in 1996. DOMA's Section 2 says that no state needs to recognize the legal validity of a same-sex relationship even if recognized as marriage by another state. It purports to relieve a state of its reciprocal obligation to honor the laws of other states as required by the Constitution's [[full faith and credit clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wermiel|first1=Stephen|title=SCOTUS for law students: The Defense of Marriage Act and the Constitution|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/03/scotus-for-law-students-the-defense-of-marriage-act-and-the-constitution-sponsored-by-bloomberg-law/|accessdate=September 23, 2014|publisher=SCOTUSblog |date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before DOMA, however, states sometimes refused to recognize a marriage from another jurisdiction if it was counter to its "strongly held public policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wolff|first1=Tobias Barrington|title=DOMA Repeal and the Truth About Full Faith &amp; Credit |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tobias-barrington-wolff/doma-repeal-and-the-truth_b_905484.html |accessdate=September 23, 2014|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most lawsuits that seek to require a state to recognize a marriage established in another jurisdiction argue on the basis of [[equal protection clause|equal protection]] and [[due process clause|due process]], not the full faith and credit clause.{{efn|Among many examples: (1) the U.S. District Court ruling in ''[[Bourke v. Beshear]]'', which required Kentucky to recognize same-sex marriages from Canada and several U.S. states, was decided on equal protection grounds alone. The plaintiffs claimed that Kentucky's ban violated the full faith and credit clause, but the court found it unnecessary to address that argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/206724639/GREGORY-BOURKE-et-al-V-STEVE-BESHEAR-et-al |title=Memorandum Opinion, ''Bouke v.

Caldwell]]'', who sought Louisiana's recognition of their out-of-state marriages, argued only on the basis of equal protection and due process. One of the Louisiana statutes they challenged made clear the state's assertion of its right to deny recognition to the legal act of another state: "A purported marriage between persons of the same sex violates a ''strong public policy'' of the state of Louisiana".

DOMA's Section 3 defined marriage for the purposes of federal law as a union of one man and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|1|7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was challenged in the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. On July 8, 2010, Judge [[Joseph Louis Tauro|Joseph Tauro]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|District Court of Massachusetts]] held that the denial of federal rights and benefits to lawfully married Massachusetts same-sex couples is unconstitutional under the [[equal protection clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name="hrc.org"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/us/09marriage.html|title=Judge Topples U.S. Rejection of Gay Unions|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 8, 2010|accessdate=June 2, 2011|first1=Abby |last1=Goodnough |first2=John|last2=Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2010, eight federal courts found DOMA Section 3 unconstitutional in cases involving bankruptcy, public employee benefits, estate taxes, and immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/states/entry/c/doma|title=The Defense of Marriage Act|publisher=Freedom to Marry |accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/31/doma-unconstitutional-ruling-appeals-court-boston_n_1559031.html|title=DOMA Ruled Unconstitutional By Federal Appeals Court |last=Lavoie |first=Denise |date=May 31, 2012|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewstates.org/projects/stateline/headlines/defense-of-marriage-act-discriminates-against-gays-federal-court-rules-85899424320|title=Defense of Marriage Act Discriminates Against Gays, Federal Court Rules|last=Malewitz|first=Jim|date=October 18, 2012 |publisher=Pewstates.org|accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 18, 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] became the first court to hold sexual orientation to be a [[suspect classification|quasi-suspect classification]] and applied [[intermediate scrutiny]] to strike down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional in ''[[Windsor v.

The federal government recognizes the marriages of same-sex couples who married in certain states in which same-sex marriage was legal for brief periods between the time a court order allowed such couples to marry and that court order was stayed, including [[Michigan]].

Opponents of same-sex marriage have worked to prevent individual states from recognizing same-sex unions by attempting to amend the United States Constitution to restrict marriage to heterosexual unions. In 2006, the ''[[Federal Marriage Amendment]]'', which would have prohibited states from recognizing same-sex marriages, was approved by the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] on a party-line vote and was debated by the full Senate, but was ultimately defeated in both houses of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/07/same.sex.marriage/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511145406/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/07/same.sex.marriage/index.html|title=Senate blocks same-sex marriage ban|publisher=CNN|date=June 7, 2006|archivedate=May 11, 2008|accessdate=July 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2014, the [[Alabama House of Representatives]] adopted a resolution calling for a [[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional convention]] to propose an amendment to ban same-sex marriage nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20140402/NEWS/304020079/Alabama-House-approves-call-put-same-sex-marriage-ban-U-S-Constitution |title=Alabama House approves call to put same-sex marriage ban in U.S. Constitution |work=Montgomery Advertiser |date=April 2, 2014 |accessdate=April 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412171146/http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20140402/NEWS/304020079/Alabama-House-approves-call-put-same-sex-marriage-ban-U-S-Constitution |archivedate=April 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Officials of one [[Same-sex marriage in Texas|Texas]] county, [[Irion County, Texas|Irion]], issue marriage licenses but claim they will refuse same-sex couples. None have applied and no legal action has been taken.&lt;ref name="Ballotpedia"/&gt;
* Officials in eight [[Same-sex marriage in Alabama|Alabama]] counties no longer issue any marriage licenses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is being done in accordance with a state law, which in 1961 was created to preserve racial segregation and made it optional for county clerks to issue marriage licenses. Several have chosen to exercise this option since the ''Obergefell'' ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/10/alabama_judges_use_segregation.html#incart_river_home|title=Alabama judges use segregation-era law to avoid gay marriage|newspaper=AL.com|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Several [[Same-sex marriage in Kentucky|Kentucky]] counties initially refused to marry same-sex couples. In response, Kentucky reformed its marriage license forms and removed the name of the county clerk from the licenses. As of June 2016, Chris Hartmann, director of the Kentucky-based Fairness Campaign, said to his knowledge "there are no counties where marriage licenses are being denied" in his state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/06/22/one-year-after-supreme-court-ruling-pockets-of-marriage-inequality-remain/|title=One year after marriage ruling, pockets of defiance remain|date=2016-06-22|website=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parental rights====
{{main|LGBT adoption in the United States}}
Post-''Obergefell'', six states have, on occasion, attempted to deny same-sex couples full adoption rights to varying degrees. In [[Arkansas]], [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], and [[Wisconsin]], same-sex couples have been met with rejection when trying to get both parents' names listed on the birth certificate. In ''[[V.L. v. E.L.]]'', Alabama's highest court attempted to void an adoption decree obtained by a same-sex couple in Georgia, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed, restoring joint custody to the adoptive mother on March 7, 2016. [[Mississippi]] had once banned same-sex couples from adopting, but the law requiring this was ruled unconstitutional by the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi]] on March 31, 2016. With that ruling, adoption by same-sex couples became legal in all fifty states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/mississippi-same-sex-adoption_us_56fdb1a3e4b083f5c607567f?section=australia|title=Same-Sex Couples Can Now Adopt Children In All 50 States|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2016/04/01/mississippi_same_sex_adoption_ban_overturned_spelling_trouble_for_hb_1523.html|title=Judge Invalidates Mississippi's Same-Sex Adoption Ban, the Last of Its Kind in America|publisher=Slate|date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court ruled by a 6-3 vote in the case of ''[[Pavan v. Smith]]'' that under their decision in ''Obergefell'', same-sex couples must be treated equally to opposite-sex couples in the issuance of birth certificates. In December 2016, the Supreme Court of Arkansas upheld a state law only allowing opposite-sex couples to be automatically listed as parents on their children's birth certificates, while prohibiting same-sex couples from being allowed the same on an equal basis. The Supreme Court summarily reversed the Arkansas Supreme Court, finding that the disparity in treatment violated their decision in ''Obergefell''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/us/politics/gay-couples-entitled-to-equal-treatment-on-birth-certificates-justices-rule.html Gay Couples Entitled to Equal Treatment on Birth Certificates, Justice Rule] ''The New York Times'', June 26, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tribal law===
{{main|Same-sex marriage under United States tribal jurisdictions}}
The Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage in the states and territories did not legalize same-sex marriage on Indian lands. In the United States, Congress (not the federal courts) has legal authority over Indian country. Thus, unless Congress passes a law regarding same-sex marriage on Indian tribes, federally recognized American Indian tribes have the legal right to form their own marriage laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julian Brave Noisecat |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/07/02/navajo-marriage-equality_n_7709016.html |title=Fight For Marriage Equality Not Over On Navajo Nation |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=July 2, 2015 |accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the time of the ''Obergefell'' ruling, [[Same-sex marriage under United States tribal jurisdictions|24 tribal jurisdictions]] legally recognize same-sex marriage. Some tribes have passed legislation specifically addressing same-sex relationships and some specify that state law and jurisdiction govern tribal marriages. As of November 2017, same-sex marriage is legally recognized in 40 tribal jurisdictions.

===Local laws prior to ''Obergefell v. Hodges''===
{{Map of same-sex marriage in the United States prior to Obergefell|align=center|size=600px}}
Prior to ''Obergefell'', [[same-sex marriage]] was legal to at least some degree in thirty-eight states, one territory ([[Same-sex marriage in Guam|Guam]]) and the [[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]]; of the states, [[Same-sex marriage in Missouri|Missouri]], [[Same-sex marriage in Kansas|Kansas]], and [[Same-sex marriage in Alabama|Alabama]] had restrictions. Until ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', it was only legal in 12 states and [[Washington D.C.]]. Beginning in July 2013, over forty federal and state courts cited ''Windsor'' to strike down state bans on the licensing or recognition of same-sex marriage. [[Same-sex marriage in Missouri|Missouri]] recognized same-sex marriages from out of state and same-sex marriages licensed by the [[St. Louis|City of St. Louis]] under two separate [[Same-sex marriage in Missouri|state court orders]]; two other jurisdictions issued such licenses as well. In [[Kansas]], marriage licenses were available to same-sex couples in most counties, but the state did not recognize their validity. Some counties in [[Alabama]] issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples for three weeks until the [[Supreme Court of Alabama|state Supreme Court]] ordered probate judges to stop doing so. That court's ruling did not address the recognition of same-sex marriages already licensed in Alabama, but referred to them as "purported 'marriage licenses{{' "}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petition Granted|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/257589071/1140460-Petition-Granted|website=Scribd.com|publisher=Supreme Court of Alabama|accessdate=March 24, 2015|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two additional states, same-sex marriages were previously legal between the time their bans were struck down and then [[Stay of proceedings#United States|stayed]]. [[Same-sex marriage in Michigan|Michigan]] recognized the validity of more than 300 marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples and those marriages. [[Same-sex marriage in Arkansas|Arkansas]] recognized the more than 500 marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DeMillo|first1=Andrew|title=Judge: Arkansas Must Recognize in-State Same-Sex Marriages|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/judge-arkansas-recognize-state-sex-marriages-31648493|accessdate=June 9, 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ABC News|date=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the federal government had not taken a position on Arkansas's marriage licenses.

==Studies==
===Child suicide===
The establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation. A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9–12 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9–12 declined by 14% in states which established same-sex marriage, resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among children in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage. The lead researcher of the study observed that "laws that have the greatest impact on gay adults may make gay kids feel more hopeful for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference-in-Differences Analysis of the Association Between State Same-Sex Marriage Policies and Adolescent Suicide Attempts|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2604258|website=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|Journal of the American Medical Association: Pediatrics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-Sex Marriage Legalization Linked to Reduction in Suicide Attempts Among High School Students|url=https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2017/same-sex-marriage-legalization-linked-to-reduction-in-suicide-attempts-among-high-school-students.html|website=[[Johns Hopkins University]]|date=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: Teen suicide attempts fell as same-sex marriage was legalized|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/02/20/teen-suicide-down-as-same-sex-marriage-legalized-study/98179684/|website=[[USA Today]]|date=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-sex marriage laws linked to fewer youth suicide attempts, new study says|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/same-sex-marriage-fewer-youth-suicide|website=[[PBS]]|date=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-sex marriage laws tied to fewer teen suicide attempts|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-pediatrics-suicide-lgbt/same-sex-marriage-laws-tied-to-fewer-teen-suicide-attempts-idUSKBN1612SP|website=[[Reuters]]|date=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic impact on same-sex couples===
Until the Supreme Court's June 2013 ruling in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' required the federal government to treat lawfully married same-sex couples on an equal basis with lawfully married opposite-sex couples, same-sex married couples faced severe disadvantages. The federal government did not recognize those marriages for any purpose. According to a 1997 [[General Accounting Office]] study, at least 1,049 U.S. federal laws and regulations include references to marital status.&lt;ref&gt;Dang, Alain, and M. Somjen Frazer. "Black Same-Sex Couple Households in the 2000 U.S. Census: Implications in the Debate Over Same-Sex Marriage." Western Journal of Black Studies 29.1 (Spring2005 2005): 521–530. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. September 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found 1,138 statutory provisions "in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving 'benefits, rights, and privileges.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="cbo1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5559 |title=The Potential Budgetary Impact of Recognizing Same-Sex Marriages|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=March 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these laws govern property rights, benefits, and taxation. Same-sex couples whose marriages are not recognized by the federal government are ineligible for spousal and survivor [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits and are ineligible for the benefits due the spouse of a federal government employee.&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt; One study found that the difference in Social Security income for same-sex couples compared to opposite-sex married couples was per year.&lt;ref name="Badgett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Badgett |first=M.V. Lee|title=Money, Myths, and Change: The Economic Lives of Lesbians and Gay Men|publisher=University Of Chicago Press |location=Chicago|year=2003|isbn=0-226-03401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to similarly situated opposite-sex married couples, same-sex couples faced the following financial and legal disadvantages:
* Legal costs associated with obtaining domestic partner documents to gain legal abilities granted automatically by legal marriage, including power of attorney, health care decision-making, and inheritance&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* A person can inherit an unlimited amount from a deceased spouse without incurring an estate tax, but is subject to taxes if inheriting from a same-sex partner&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;
* Same-sex couples were not eligible to file jointly as a married couple and thus could not take the advantages of lower tax rates when the individual income of the partners differs significantly&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;{{efn|In early 2013 the IRS recognized the community property and income of same-sex partners in community property states.&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;{{cite web|title=IRS Provides Answers to Community Property Filers|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Provides-Answers-to-Community-Property-Filers|publisher=United States Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Employer-provided health insurance coverage for a same-sex partner incurred federal income tax&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;
* Higher health costs associated with lack of insurance and preventative care: 20% of same-sex couples had a member who was uninsured compared to 10% of married opposite-sex couples&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Inability to protect jointly owned home from loss due to costs of potential medical catastrophe&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Inability of a U.S. citizen to [[Same-sex immigration policy in the United States|sponsor a same-sex spouse for citizenship]]&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;

Some 7,400 companies were offering spousal benefits to same-sex couples {{as of|2008|lc=y}}. In states that recognized same-sex marriages, same-sex couples could continue to receive those same benefits only if they married.&lt;ref&gt;Barkacs, L. L. (2008). "Same sex marriage, civil unions, and employee benefits: Unequal protection under the law – when will society catch up with the business community?", ''Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues, 11(2)'', 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 18% of private employers offered domestic partner health care benefits.&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;

Same-sex couples face the same financial constraints of legal marriage as opposite-sex married couples, including the [[marriage penalty]] in taxation.&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt; While social service providers usually do not count one partner's assets toward the income means test for welfare and disability assistance for the other partner, a legally married couple's joint assets are normally used in calculating whether a married individual qualifies for assistance.&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;

===Economic impact on the federal government===
The 2004 [[Congressional Budget Office]] study, working from an assumption "that about 0.6 percent of adults would enter into same-sex marriages if they had the opportunity" (an assumption in which they admitted "significant uncertainty") estimated that legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the United States "would improve the budget's bottom line to a small extent: by less than $1 billion in each of the next 10 years". This result reflects an increase in net government revenues (increased income taxes due to marriage penalties more than offsetting decreased tax revenues arising from postponed estate taxes). Marriage recognition would increase the government expenses for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program|Federal Employee Health Benefits]] but that increase would be more than made up for by decreased expenses for [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and [[Supplemental Security Income]].&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;

===Mental health===
Based in part on research that has been conducted on the adverse effects of stigmatization of gays and lesbians, numerous prominent social science organizations have issued position statements supporting same-sex marriage and opposing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; these organizations include the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;ref name="amici2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/about/offices/ogc/amicus/gill.pdf|title=Brief of the American Psychological Association, the Massachusetts Psychological Association, The National Association of Social Workers and its Massachusetts Chapter, the American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics as Amici Curiae in Support of Plaintiffs-Appellees and in Support of Affirmance – Appeals from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts Civil Action Nos. 1:09-cv-11156-JLT, 1:09-cv-10309-JLT (Honorable Joseph L. Tauro)|format=PDF|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several psychological studies&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Price, M. [http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/marriage-bans.html "Upfront—Research uncovers the stress created by same-sex marriage bans"] in ''Monitor on Psychology'', Volume 40, No. 1, page 10, January 2009. Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potoczniak, Daniel J.; Aldea, Mirela A.; DeBlaere, Cirleen "Ego identity, social anxiety, social support, and self-concealment in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(4), October 2007, 447–457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balsam, Kimberly F.; Mohr, Jonathan J. "Adaptation to sexual orientation stigma: A comparison of bisexual and lesbian/gay adults." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(3), July 2007, 306–319.
&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations, media messages, and negative reactions among peers about same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for LGBT people that may affect their health and well-being, especially among its younger members.

One study surveyed more than 1,500 lesbian, gay and bisexual adults across the nation and found that respondents from the 25 states that have outlawed same-sex marriage had the highest reports of "[[minority stress]]"—the chronic social stress that results from minority-group stigmatization—as well as general psychological distress. According to the study, the negative campaigning that comes with a ban is directly responsible for the increased stress. Past research has shown that [[minority stress]] is linked to health risks such as [[risky sexual behavior]] and substance abuse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Rostosky, Sharon Scales; Riggle, Ellen D. B.; Gray, Barry E.; Hatton, Roxanna L. "Minority stress experiences in committed same-sex couple relationships." ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice,'' Vol 38(4), August 2007, 392–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other studies examined personal reports from LGBT adults and their families living in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], immediately after a successful 2006 ballot campaign banned same-sex marriage. Most respondents reported feeling alienated from their communities. The studies also found that families experienced a kind of secondary minority stress, says Jennifer Arm, a counseling graduate student at the [[University of Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski, Dawn M.; Carr, Erika R. "The roles of gender role conflict and internalized heterosexism in gay and bisexual men's psychological distress: Testing two mediation models." ''Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity,'' Vol 9(1), January 2008, 40–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' trial, expert witness [[Ilan Meyer]] testified that the mental health outcomes for gays and lesbians would improve if laws such as Proposition 8 did not exist because "when people are exposed to more stress...they are more likely to get sick..." and that particular situation is consistent with laws that say to gay people "you are not welcome here, your relationships are not valued." Such laws have "significant power", he said.&lt;ref name="testimony2"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Perry v.

===Physical health===
In 2009, a pair of economists at [[Emory University]] tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of [[HIV]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sovo.com/2009/6-12/news/localnews/10213.cfm |title=Emory researchers: Gay marriage bans increase HIV infections |publisher=Webcitation.org |date= |accessdate=February 8, 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kNicjEc2?url=http://www.sovo.com/2009/6-12/news/localnews/10213.cfm |archivedate=October 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elaine Justice|url=http://shared.web.emory.edu/emory/news/releases/2009/06/study-links-gay-marriage-bans-to-rise-in-hiv-rate.html|title=Study Links Gay Marriage Bans to Rise in HIV infections|publisher=Emory.edu|date=|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study linked the passage of same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.

A study by the [[Columbia Mailman School of Public Health]] found that gay men in Massachusetts visited health clinics significantly less often following the legalization of same-sex marriage in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16203621|title=Gay marriage 'improves health'|publisher=BBC News |date=December 16, 2011|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage statistics==
There is no complete data on the number of same-sex marriages conducted in the United States. Marriages and divorces are recorded by states, counties, and territories, plus New York City and the District of Columbia, but not by the federal government. States such as Oregon do not distinguish between opposite-sex and same-sex marriages in their official records. The legal records on marriage and divorce belong to the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=National Academy of Sciences |title=The U.S. Vital Statistics System: A National Perspective |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK219884/ |accessdate=30 May 2018 |agency=National Center for Health Statistics |issue=Bookshelf ID: NBK219884 |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] estimated the number of same-sex marriages by linking the tax returns of same-sex couples who had filed jointly in 2014 with their Social Security records. (Although this method excluded couples who file singly, these are small in number; of all married couples who file taxes, 97.5% file jointly.) This research showed that in 2014 there were about 183,280 married same-sex couples in the country, or "roughly a third of 1 percent of all marriages" according to the ''New York Times.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bui |first1=Quoctrung |title=The Most Detailed Map of Gay Marriage in America |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/upshot/the-most-detailed-map-of-gay-marriage-in-america.html |accessdate=30 May 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the statistics, female couples were four times more likely to have children than male couples. Additionally, male couples earned a pretax average of $165,960 per year, while lesbian couples earned $118,415 and straight couples earned $115,210. Most female same-sex marriages were celebrated in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Seattle]], [[San Francisco]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield (MA)]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland (OR)]], whereas most gay male marriages were performed in San Francisco, [[Washington D.C.]], [[New York City]], Seattle and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]].&lt;ref name="newyorktimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/upshot/the-most-detailed-map-of-gay-marriage-in-america.html The Most Detailed Map of Gay Marriage in America] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Population Reference Bureau]] reported that by October 2015, approximately 486,000 same-sex marriages had taken place in the United States. It estimated that 45% of all same-sex couples in the country were married at that point in time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prb.org/increase-in-married-same-sex-us-couples/ Existing Data Show Increase in Married Same-Sex U.S. Couples]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case law==
{{see also|Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States#Lawsuits seeking to overturn statutory bans}}
United States federal and state [[case law]] regarding same-sex marriage:

===1970s===
* ''Anonymous v. Anonymous'', 67 Misc.2d 982 (N.Y. 1971). The law makes no provision for a "marriage" between persons of the same sex. 
* ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', 191 N.W.2d 185 (Minn. 1971). Upholds a Minnesota law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman.  ('''Overruled''' by ''Obergefell v. Hodges'' in 2015; see below)
* ''[[Jones v. Hallahan]]'', 501 S.W.2d 588 (Ky. 1973). Upholds the denial of a marriage license to two women in Kentucky based on dictionary definitions of marriage, despite the fact that state statutes do not specify the gender of marriage partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cantor, et.al|first=Donald J.|title=Same-Sex Marriage: The Legal and Psychological Evolution in America|year=2006|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|pages=117–8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lydHmmrHB8QC&amp;pg=PA117|isbn=9780819568120}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Frances B. v. Mark B.'', 78 Misc.2d 112 (1974). Marriage is and always has been a contract between a man and a woman.
* ''[[Singer v. Hara]]'', 522 P.2d 1187 (Wash. Ct. App. 1974). The historical definition of marriage is between one man and one woman, and same-sex couples are inherently ineligible to marry. This ban does not constitute sex discrimination.

===1980s===
* ''[[Adams v. Howerton]]'', 673 F.2d 1036 (9th Cir. 1982), ''cert. denied'', 458 U.S. 1111. A same-sex marriage does not make one a "spouse" under the ''Immigration and Nationality Act''.
* ''De Santo v. Barnsley'', 476 A.2d 952 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984). Same-sex couples can not divorce because they cannot form a common law marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12528764226087213713&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr De Santo v. Barnsley, May 11, 1984], retrieved January 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
* ''In re Estate of Cooper'', 149 Misc.2d 282 (Sur. Ct. Kings Co. 1990). The state has a compelling interest in fostering the traditional institution of marriage and prohibiting same-sex marriage.
* ''[[Baehr v. Lewin]]'', 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993). A statute limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violates the Hawaii constitution's equal-protection clause unless the state can show that the statute is both justified by compelling state interests and also narrowly tailored. This ruling prompted the adoption of Hawaii's [[Hawaii Constitutional Amendment 2 (1998)|constitutional amendment]] allowing the Legislature to restrict marriage to different-sex couples and the federal ''[[Defense of Marriage Act]]''.
* ''[[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia#Dean v. District of Columbia|Dean v. District of Columbia]]'', 653 A.2d 307 (D.C. 1995). DC does not authorise same-sex marriage; denial of a marriage license does not violate the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].
* ''Storrs v. Holcomb'', 645 N.Y.S.2d 286 (App. Div. 1996). New York does not recognize or authorize same-sex marriage. Overturned in part by ''Martinez v. County of Monroe'' in 2008.
* ''In re Estate of Hall'', 707 N.E.2d 201, 206 (Ill. App. Ct. 1998). Illinois does not recognize a same-sex marriage. The petitioner's claim to be in a same-sex marriage was not in a marriage recognized by law.
* ''[[Baker v. Vermont]]'', 170 Vt. 194; 744 A.2d 864 (Vt. 1999). The Common Benefits Clause of the state constitution requires that same-sex couples be granted the same legal rights as married persons, though it need not be called ''marriage''.

===2000s===
* ''Frandsen v. County of Brevard'', 828 So. 2d 757 (Fla. 2001). The Florida Constitution will not be construed to recognize same-sex marriage; sex classifications not subject to strict scrutiny under the Florida constitution.
* ''Burns v. Burns'', 560 S.E.2d 47 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002). Marriage is the union of one man and one woman.
* ''[[In re Estate of Gardiner]]'', 42 P.3d 120 (Kan. 2002). A post-operative male-to-female transsexual is not a woman within the meaning of the statutes and cannot validly marry another man.
* ''Rosengarten v. Downes'', 806 A.2d 1066 (Conn. Ct. App. 2002). Connecticut will not dissolve a Vermont civil union.
* ''Standhardt v. Superior Court ex rel. County of Maricopa'', 77 P.3d 451 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2003) The Constitution of Arizona does not provide the right to same-sex marriage.
* ''[[Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health]]'', 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003). The denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples violated provisions of the Massachusetts State Constitution guaranteeing individual liberty and equality, and it was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
* ''[[Same-sex marriage in Indiana#Lawsuits|Morrison v. Sadler]]'', 821 N.E.2d 15 (Ind. Super. Ct. 2005). Indiana's ''Defense of Marriage Act'' is valid.
* ''[[Langan v. St. Vincent's Hospital]]'', 802 N.Y.S.2d 476 (App. Div. 2005). For the purposes of New York's wrongful death statute, the survivor partner from a Vermont civil union lacks standing as a "spouse".
* ''[[Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning]]'', 455 F.3d 859 (8th Cir. 2006). Nebraska's [[Nebraska Initiative Measure 416 (2000)|Initiative Measure 416]] does not violate Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, was not a bill of attainder, and does not violate the First Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/06/07/052604P.pdf |title=Citizens for Equal Protection v.

* ''[[Lewis v. Harris]]'', 908 A.2d 196 (N.J. 2006). Prohibiting same-sex ''marriage'' does not violate the New Jersey Constitution, but the state must extend all the rights and responsibilities of marriage to same-sex couples. The Legislature had 180 days to amend the marriage laws or create a "parallel structure".
* ''[[Andersen v. King County]]'', 138 P.3d 963 (Wash. 2006). Washington's ''Defense of Marriage Act'' does not violate the State Constitution.
* ''Hernandez v. Robles'', 855 N.E.2d 1 (N.Y. 2006). The New York State Constitution does not require that marriage rights be extended to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2006/2006_05239.htm Opinion of the Court, ''Hernandez v Robles''], accessed September 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Same-sex marriage in Maryland#Conaway v. Deane &amp; Polyak|Conaway v. Deane]]'', 932 A.2d 571 (Md. 2007). Upholds a Maryland law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman.
* ''[[Martinez v. County of Monroe]]'', 850 N.Y.S.2d 740 (App. Div. 2008). Because New York recognizes the marriages of opposite-sex couples from other jurisdictions, it must do the same for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Louis| first=Tim |url=http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/news/articles/2008/05/GAY-MARRIAGE-Technicality-delays|title=Gay Marriage: Technicality delays county's appeal|location=Rochester, N.Y. |newspaper=City Newspaper|date=|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'', 183 P.3d 384 (Cal. 2008). Limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples is invalid under the equal protection clause of the California Constitution. Full marriage rights, not merely domestic partnership, must be offered to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/S147999.pdf 'In re Marriage Cases], 183 P.3d 384 (Cal. 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health]]'' 957 A.2d 407 (Conn. 2008). The availability of civil unions but not marriage to same-sex partners is a violation of the equality and liberty provisions of the Connecticut Constitution.
* ''[[Strauss v. Horton]]'', 207 P.3d 48 (Cal. 2009). [[Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] was validly adopted, and marriages contracted before its adoption remain valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/S168047.pdf ''Strauss v. Horton''], 207 P.3d 48 (Cal. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Varnum v. Brien]]'', 763 N.W.2d 862 (Iowa 2009). Barring same-sex couples from marriage violates the equal protection provisions of the [[Iowa Constitution]]. Equal protection requires full marriage, rather than civil unions or some other substitute, for same-sex couples.

===2010s===
;Challenges to DOMA Section 3
* ''[[Gill v. Office of Personnel Management]]'' (2009–2013). Section 3 of the federal ''Defense of Marriage Act'' is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirms that ruling and stays implementation pending appeal. ''Windsor'' finds Section 3 unconstitutional and appeal of ''Gill'' is denied by the Supreme Court.
* ''[[Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services]]'' (2009–2013). Decided alongside ''Gill'' with the same outcome.
* ''[[Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management]]'' (2010–2013). Section 3 of the federal ''Defense of Marriage Act'' is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court, which determines that sexual orientation is a [[suspect classification|quasi-suspect classification]] requiring the court to apply [[intermediate scrutiny]], that is, to determine whether Section 3 relates to an important government interest. On appeal the case is held in abeyance pending the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Windsor'', which settles the issues raised in ''Golinski'', the appeal of which to the Supreme Court is then denied.
* ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' (2010–2013). Section 3 of the federal ''Defense of Marriage Act'' is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirms that ruling, as does the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Government began implementing the decision the same week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaplan|first=Elaine|title=Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies: Guidance on the Extension of Benefits to Married Gay and Lesbian Federal Employees, Annuitants, and Their Families – (OPM Benefits memo)|agency=United States Office of Personnel Management|publisher=Scribd.com|accessdate=March 31, 2014|date=June 28, 2013|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/150591306/OPM-Benefits-Memo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;California Proposition 8
* ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'' (2009–2013). California's Proposition 8, a voter-endorsed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court in ''Perry v. Schwarzenegger''. The proposition's backers appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upholds the district court's finding of unconstitutionality in ''Perry v. Brown''.
