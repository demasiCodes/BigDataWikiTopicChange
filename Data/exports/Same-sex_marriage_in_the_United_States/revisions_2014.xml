The legal issues surrounding same-sex marriage in the United States are determined by the nation's [[federalism|federal]] system of government, in which the [[Status (law)|status]] of a person, including marital status, is determined in large measure by the individual states. Prior to 1996, the federal government did not define marriage; any marriage recognized by a [[U.S. state|state]] was recognized by the federal government, even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more states, as was the case until 1967 with interracial marriage which some states [[anti-miscegenation laws|banned by statute]].

===Federal law===
The [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) was enacted in 1996. DOMA's Section 2 says that no state need recognize the legal validity of a same-sex relationship even if recognized as marriage by another state. It purports to relieve a state of its reciprocal obligation to honor the laws of other states as required by the Constitution's [[full faith and credit clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wermiel|first1=Stephen|title=SCOTUS for law students: The Defense of Marriage Act and the Constitution|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/03/scotus-for-law-students-the-defense-of-marriage-act-and-the-constitution-sponsored-by-bloomberg-law/|accessdate=September 23, 2014|work=SCOTUSblog |date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before DOMA, however, states sometimes refused to recognize a marriage from another jurisdiction if it was counter to its "strongly held public policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wolff|first1=Tobias Barrington|title=DOMA Repeal and the Truth About Full Faith &amp; Credit |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tobias-barrington-wolff/doma-repeal-and-the-truth_b_905484.html |accessdate=September 23, 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most lawsuits that seek to require a state to recognize a marriage established in another jurisdiction argue on the basis of [[equal protection clause|equal protection]] and [[due process clause|due process]], not the full faith and credit clause.{{efn|Among many examples: (1) the U.S. District Court ruling in ''[[Bourke v. Beshear]]'', which required Kentucky to recognize same-sex marriages from Canada and several U.S. states, was decided on equal protection grounds alone. The plaintiffs had claimed that Kentucky's ban violated the full faith and credit clause, but the court found it unnecessary to address that argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/206724639/GREGORY-BOURKE-et-al-V-STEVE-BESHEAR-et-al |title=Memorandum Opinion, ''Bouke v.

Caldwell]]'', who sought Louisiana's recognition of their out-of-state marriages, argued only on the basis of equal protection and due process. One of the Louisiana statutes they challenged made clear the state's assertion of its right to deny recognition to the legal act of another state: "A purported marriage between persons of the same sex violates a ''strong public policy'' of the state of Louisiana".

The federal government has announced that it recognizes the marriages of same-sex couples who married in certain states in which same-sex marriage was legal for brief periods between the time a court order allowed such couples to marry and that court order was stayed, including Michigan and Utah.

According to the federal government's [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) in 2004, [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|more than 1,138 rights and protections]] are conferred to U.S. citizens upon marriage by the federal government; areas affected include [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, veterans' benefits, health insurance, [[Medicaid]], hospital visitation, estate taxes, retirement savings, [[pension]]s, [[family leave]], and immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04353r.pdf|title=2004 updated report of the GAO|format=PDF|date=January 23, 2004|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of same-sex marriage in the United States}}

===Early history===
The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled in 1971 that Minnesota's laws prohibiting marriages between same-sex partners did not violate the federal constitution. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider the case, ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', "for want of a substantial federal question."

In April 1993, as part of the demonstrations surrounding the [[March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation|gay rights march]] in Washington, D.C., about 1,500 same-sex couples staged a mass wedding ceremony with "a dozen ministers, organ music, photographers and rice" at the [[National Museum of Natural History]] to call for marriage rights for gays and lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wheeler|first1=Linda|title=Mass Wedding Marries Tradition and Protest|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-943527.html|accessdate=October 14, 2014|work=Washington Post|publisher=Highbeam Research|date=April 25, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, in response to the [[Hawaii Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Baehr v. Miike]]'', Hawaii voters approved a [[Hawaii Constitutional Amendment 2|state constitutional amendment]] allowing their legislature to ban same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Hawaii Office of Elections|title=General Election 1998|url=http://hawaii.gov/elections/results/1998/general/98swgen.htm|date=November 3, 1998|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next decade saw lasting change. In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Texas' "Homosexual Conduct" law in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Lawrence v. Texas|vol=539 |reporter=U.S.|opinion=558|date=2003|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling rendered unenforceable same-sex sodomy laws in Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri and broader [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]] in nine other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Court Rejects Sodomy Law |last=Schlesinger|first=Richard|date=June 26, 2003|publisher=CBS News|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/06/26/supremecourt/main560508.shtml|quote=Of the 13 states with sodomy laws, four—Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri—prohibit oral and anal sex between same-sex couples. The other nine ban consensual sodomy for everyone: Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia. Thursday's ruling apparently invalidates those laws as well.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2003, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled in ''[[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health]]'' that denying marriage rights to same-sex couples violated the state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/11/18/sjc_gay_marriage_legal_in_mass/|title=SJC: Gay marriage legal in Mass. |work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=November 18, 2003|accessdate=June 27, 2010|first1=Kathleen|last1=Burge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massachusetts became the first United States jurisdiction to license and recognize same-sex marriages beginning May 17, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kathleen|last=Burge| accessdate=September 30, 2014| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/11/18/sjc_gay_marriage_legal_in_mass/ |title=SJC: Gay marriage legal in Mass.|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=November 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February and March 2004, city officials in San Francisco issued marriage licenses to about 4000 same-sex couples before being ordered to stop by the [[California Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dean E.|last=Murphy|title=San Francisco Forced to Halt Gay Marriages|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/12/us/san-francisco-forced-to-halt-gay-marriages.html |accessdate=September 30, 2014|work=New York Times|date=March 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 20, 2004, the clerk in [[Same-sex marriage in New Mexico#2004|Sandoval County]], New Mexico, issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples for a day until the state attorney general issued an opinion that they were "invalid under state law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinello |first=Daniel R.|title=America's Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage |year=226 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521848565 |pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar actions occurred in [[Same-sex marriage in New York#New Paltz marriages|New Paltz]], New York (February 27); [[Same-sex marriage in Oregon#Marriage licenses issued|Multnomah County]], Oregon (March 3); and [[Recognition of same-sex unions in New Jersey#Same-sex marriage|Asbury Park]], New Jersey (March 8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinello |first=Daniel R. |title=America's Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage|year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521848565|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, voters in eleven states–[[Arkansas Constitutional Amendment 3 (2004)|Arkansas]], [[Georgia Constitutional Amendment 1 (2004)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky Constitutional Amendment 1 (2004)|Kentucky]], [[Michigan State Proposal – 04-2 (2004)|Michigan]], [[Mississippi Amendment 1 (2004)|Mississippi]], [[Montana Initiative 96 (2004)|Montana]], [[North Dakota Constitutional Measure 1 (2004)|North Dakota]], [[Ohio State Issue 1 (2004)|Ohio]], [[Oklahoma State Question 711 (2004)|Oklahoma]], [[Oregon Ballot Measure 36 (2004)|Oregon]], and [[Utah Constitutional Amendment 3|Utah]]–approved state constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Joel|last=Roberts |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/30/politics/main646662.shtml |agency=Associated Press|title=11 States Ban Same-Sex Marriage |publisher=CBS News |date=November 2, 2004 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 2008, the [[Supreme Court of California]] issued a decision that legalized same-sex marriage in California, holding that California's existing opposite-sex definition of marriage violated the constitutional rights of same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="mercury_mintz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_9269719|title=California Supreme Court legalizes same-sex marriage |last=Mintz|first=Howard|date=May 15, 2008|publisher=Mercury News|accessdate=May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To overturn the decision, opponents of same-sex marriage placed a state constitutional amendment on the November ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKinley|first1=Jesse|title=Gay Couples Rejoice at Ruling|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/us/15cnd-scene.html |accessdate=September 30, 2014|work=New York Times|date=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], it passed in November 2008, as did similar marriage-restriction amendments in Florida and Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McKinley|first1=Jesse|first2=Laurie|last2=Goodstein|title=Bans in 3 States on Gay Marriage |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/us/politics/06marriage.html|accessdate=September 30, 2014|work=New York Times|date=November 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus gay marriage started and stopped in California in 2008.

On August 4, 2010, a decision by the U.S. District Court in ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Perry v.

The [[Human Rights Campaign]] (HRC) is one of the leading advocacy groups in support of same-sex marriage. According to the HRC's website, "Many same-sex couples want the right to legally marry because they are in love—many, in fact, have spent the last 10, 20 or 50 years with that person—and they want to honor their relationship in the greatest way our society has to offer, by making a public commitment to stand together in good times and bad, through all the joys and challenges family life brings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/answers-to-questions-about-marriage-equality Human Rights Campaign website].

==Effects of same-sex marriage==

===Economic impact on same-sex couples===
Until the Supreme Court's June 2013 ruling in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' required the federal government to treat legally married same-sex couples on an equal basis with heterosexual married couples, same-sex married couples faced severe disadvantages. The federal government did not recognize those marriages for any purpose. According to a 1997 [[General Accounting Office]] study, at least 1,049 U.S. federal laws and regulations include references to marital status.&lt;ref&gt;Dang, Alain, and M. Somjen Frazer. "Black Same-Sex Couple Households in the 2000 U.S. Census: Implications in the Debate Over Same-Sex Marriage." Western Journal of Black Studies 29.1 (Spring2005 2005): 521–530. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. September 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found 1,138 statutory provisions "in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving 'benefits, rights, and privileges.'"&lt;ref name="cbo1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=5559 |title=The Potential Budgetary Impact of Recognizing Same-Sex Marriages|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=March 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these laws govern property rights, benefits, and taxation. Same-sex couples whose marriages are not recognized by the federal government are ineligible for spousal and survivor [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits and are ineligible for the benefits due the spouse of a federal government employee.&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt; One study found that the difference in Social Security income for same-sex couples compared to opposite-sex married couples was US$5,588 per year.&lt;ref name="Badgett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Badgett |first=M.V. Lee|title=Money, Myths, and Change: The Economic Lives of Lesbians and Gay Men|publisher=University Of Chicago Press |location=Chicago|year=2003|isbn=0-226-03401-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to similarly situated opposite-sex married couples, same-sex couples faced the following financial and legal disadvantages:
* Legal costs associated with obtaining domestic partner documents to gain legal abilities granted automatically by legal marriage, including power of attorney, health care decision-making, and inheritance&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* A person can inherit an unlimited amount from a deceased spouse without incurring an estate tax, but is subject to taxes if inheriting from a same-sex partner&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;
* Same-sex couples were not eligible to file jointly as a married couple and thus could not take the advantages of lower tax rates when the individual income of the partners differs significantly&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;{{efn|In early 2013 the IRS recognized the community property and income of same-sex partners in community property states.&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;{{cite web|title=IRS Provides Answers to Community Property Filers|url=http://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Provides-Answers-to-Community-Property-Filers|publisher=United States Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* Employer-provided health insurance coverage for a same-sex partner incurred federal income tax&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;
* Higher health costs associated with lack of insurance and preventative care: 20% of same-sex couples had a member who was uninsured compared to 10% of married opposite-sex couples&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Inability to protect jointly owned home from loss due to costs of potential medical catastrophe&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;
* Inability of a U.S. citizen to [[Same-sex immigration policy in the United States|sponsor a same-sex spouse for citizenship]]&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;

Some 7,400 companies were offering spousal benefits to same-sex couples as of 2008. In states that recognized same-sex marriages, same-sex couples could continue to receive those same benefits only if they married.&lt;ref&gt;Barkacs, L. L. (2008). "Same sex marriage, civil unions, and employee benefits: Unequal protection under the law – when will society catch up with the business community?", ''Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues, 11(2)'', 33–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 18% of private employers offered domestic partner health care benefits.&lt;ref name="Badgett" /&gt;

Same-sex couples face the same financial constraints of legal marriage as opposite-sex married couples, including the [[marriage penalty]] in taxation.&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt; While social service providers usually do not count one partner's assets toward the income means test for welfare and disability assistance for the other partner, a legally married couple's joint assets are normally used in calculating whether a married individual qualifies for assistance.&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;

===Economic impact on the federal government===
The 2004 [[Congressional Budget Office]] study, working from an assumption "that about 0.6 percent of adults would enter into same-sex marriages if they had the opportunity" (an assumption in which they admitted "significant uncertainty") estimated that legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the United States "would improve the budget's bottom line to a small extent: by less than $1&amp;nbsp;billion in each of the next 10 years". This result reflects an increase in net government revenues (increased income taxes due to marriage penalties more than offsetting decreased tax revenues arising from postponed estate taxes). Marriage recognition would increase the government expenses for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program|Federal Employee Health Benefits]] but that increase would be more than made up for by decreased expenses for [[Medicaid]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and [[Supplemental Security Income]].&lt;ref name="cbo1" /&gt;

===Mental health===
Based in part on research that has been conducted on the adverse effects of stigmatization of gays and lesbians, numerous prominent social science organizations have issued position statements supporting same-sex marriage and opposing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; these organizations include the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]].&lt;ref name="amici2011" /&gt;

Several psychological studies&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Price, M. [http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/marriage-bans.html "Upfront—Research uncovers the stress created by same-sex marriage bans"] in ''Monitor on Psychology'', Volume 40, No. 1, page 10, January 2009. Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potoczniak, Daniel J.; Aldea, Mirela A.; DeBlaere, Cirleen "Ego identity, social anxiety, social support, and self-concealment in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(4), October 2007, 447–457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balsam, Kimberly F.; Mohr, Jonathan J. "Adaptation to sexual orientation stigma: A comparison of bisexual and lesbian/gay adults." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(3), July 2007, 306–319.
&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for the LGBT population that may affect their health and well-being.

One study surveyed more than 1,500 lesbian, gay and bisexual adults across the nation and found that respondents from the 25 states that have outlawed same-sex marriage had the highest reports of "[[minority stress]]"—the chronic social stress that results from minority-group stigmatization—as well as general psychological distress. According to the study, the negative campaigning that comes with a ban is directly responsible for the increased stress. Past research has shown that [[minority stress]] is linked to health risks such as risky sexual behavior and substance abuse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Rostosky, Sharon Scales; Riggle, Ellen D. B.; Gray, Barry E.; Hatton, Roxanna L. "Minority stress experiences in committed same-sex couple relationships." ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice,'' Vol 38(4), August 2007, 392–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other studies examined personal reports from LGBT adults and their families living in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], immediately after a successful 2006 ballot campaign banned same-sex marriage. Most respondents reported feeling alienated from their communities. The studies also found that families experienced a kind of secondary minority stress, says Jennifer Arm, a counseling graduate student at the [[University of Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;Szymanski, Dawn M.; Carr, Erika R. "The roles of gender role conflict and internalized heterosexism in gay and bisexual men's psychological distress: Testing two mediation models." ''Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity,'' Vol 9(1), January 2008, 40–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' trial, expert witness [[Ilan Meyer]] testified that the mental health outcomes for gays and lesbians would improve if laws such as Proposition 8 did not exist because "when people are exposed to more stress...they are more likely to get sick..." and that particular situation is consistent with laws that say to gay people "you are not welcome here, your relationships are not valued." Such laws have "significant power", he said.&lt;ref name="testimony2"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Perry v. Schwarzenegger'' Transcript of Proceedings: pp.670–990 (Meyer testimony begins on p.806) |url=http://www.afer.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Perry-Vol-4-1-14-10.pdf|publisher=U.S. District Court of Northern California |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical health===
In 2009, a pair of economists at [[Emory University]] tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of [[HIV]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kNicjEc2|title=Emory researchers: Gay marriage bans increase HIV infections|publisher=Webcitation.org|date=|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elaine Justice|url=http://shared.web.emory.edu/emory/news/releases/2009/06/study-links-gay-marriage-bans-to-rise-in-hiv-rate.html|title=Study Links Gay Marriage Bans to Rise in HIV infections|publisher=Emory.edu|date=|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study linked the passage of same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.

A study by the [[Columbia Mailman School of Public Health]] found that gay men in Massachusetts visited health clinics significantly less often following the legalization of same-sex marriage in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16203621|title=Gay marriage 'improves health'|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|date=December 16, 2011|accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case law==
{{see also|Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States#Lawsuits seeking to overturn statutory bans}}
United States [[case law]] regarding same-sex marriage:

===1970s===
* ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', 191 N.W.2d 185 (Minn. 1971). Upholds a Minnesota law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman.
* ''[[Jones v. Hallahan]]'', 501 S.W.2d 588 (Ky. 1973). Upholds the denial of a marriage license to two women in Kentucky based on dictionary definitions of marriage, despite the fact that state statutes do not specify the gender of marriage partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cantor, et.al|first=Donald J.|title=Same-Sex Marriage: The Legal and Psychological Evolution in America|year=2006|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|pages=117–8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lydHmmrHB8QC&amp;pg=PA117|isbn=9780819568120}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Singer v. Hara]]'', 522 P.2d 1187 (Wash. Ct. App. 1974). A ban on same-sex marriage is a constitutional form of "gender discrimination"; the historical definition of marriage is between one man and one woman, and same-sex couples are inherently ineligible to marry.

===1980s===
* ''[[Adams v. Howerton]]'', 673 F.2d 1036 (9th Cir. 1982), ''cert. denied'', 458 U.S. 1111. A same-sex marriage does not make one a "spouse" under the Immigration and Nationality Act.
* ''De Santo v. Barnsley'', 476 A.2d 952 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984). Same-sex couples can not divorce because they cannot form a common law marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12528764226087213713&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr De Santo v. Barnsley, May 11, 1984], retrieved January 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
* ''In re Estate of Cooper'', 564 N.Y.S.2d 684 (Fam. Ct. 1990). The state has a compelling interest in fostering the traditional institution of marriage and prohibiting same-sex marriage.
* ''[[Baehr v. Lewin]]'', 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993). A statute limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violates the Hawaii constitution's equal-protection clause unless the state can show that the statute is both justified by compelling state interests and also narrowly tailored. This ruling prompted the adoption of Hawaii's [[Hawaii Constitutional Amendment 2 (1998)|constitutional amendment]] allowing the legislature to restrict marriage to different-sex couples and the federal [[Defense of Marriage Act]].
* ''[[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia#Dean v. District of Columbia|Dean v. District of Columbia]]'', 653 A.2d 307 (D.C. 1995). DC does not authorise same-sex marriage; denial of a marriage license does not violate the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]].
* ''Storrs v. Holcomb'', 645 N.Y.S.2d 286 (App. Div. 1996). New York does not recognize or authorize same-sex marriage. Overturned in part by ''Martinez v. County of Monroe'' in 2008. 
* ''In re Estate of Hall'', 707 N.E.2d 201, 206 (Ill. App. Ct. 1998). Illinois does not recognize a same-sex marriage. The petitioner's claim to be in a same-sex marriage was not in a marriage recognized by law.
