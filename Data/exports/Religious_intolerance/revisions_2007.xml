{{Religious persecution}}
{{Discrimination}}
'''Religious intolerance'''  is either [[intolerance]] motivated by one's own [[Religion|religious]] beliefs or intolerance against another's religious beliefs or practices. It manifests both at a cultural level, but may also be a formal part of the [[dogma]] of particular religious groups. 

The mere statement on the part of a religion that its own beliefs and practices are correct and any contrary beliefs incorrect does not in itself constitute intolerance. There are many cases throughout history of established religions tolerating other practices.  Religious intolerance, rather, is when a group (a society, a religious group) specifically refuses to tolerate practices, persons or beliefs  on religious grounds.

Religious intolerance may be purely religious, but can be a "cover story" for an underlying political or cultural motive.

==Contemporary attitude and practice==
A number of countries worldwide contain provisions within their [[constitution]]s expressly forbidding the state from engaging in certain acts of religious intolerance or preference within its own borders. Examples include The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States]] [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], Article 4 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of [[Germany]], Article 44.2.1 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] of [[The Republic of Ireland]], Article 40 of the [[Estonia]]n Constitution&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oefre.unibe.ch/law/icl/en00000_.html ''"Estonia - Constitution"'', ICL Document 28 June 1992, retrieved 25 may 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;, Article 24 of the [[Constitution of Turkey|Constitution]] of [[Turkey]] and Article 36 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. Many other states, whilst not containing constitutional provisions directly related to religion, nonetheless contain provisions forbidding discrimination on religious grounds (see, for example, Article 1 of the [[France|French]] [[Constitution of France|Constitution]], article 15 of the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and article 40 of the [[Constitution of Egypt|Constitution]] of [[Egypt]]). It should be noted that these constitutional provisions do not necessarily guarantee that all elements of the state remain free from religious intolerance at all times, and practice can vary widely from country to country.

Other countries, meanwhile, may allow for religious preference, for instance through the establishment of one or more [[state religion]]s, but not for religious intolerance. [[Finland]], for example, has the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] and [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] as its official state religions, yet upholds the right of free expression of religion in article 11 of its [[Constitution of Finland|constitution]]. 

Some countries retain [[blasphemy]] laws, forbidding [[defamation]] of religious belief, which are sometimes seen as a way of condoning religious intolerance. Whilst some countries retain laws forbidding all forms of blasphemy (such as [[Germany]] where in [[2006]] [[Manfred van H.]] was convicted of blasphemy against [[Islam]]), the connection between intolerance and blasphemy laws  is most closely connected if the laws apply to only one religion. In the [[United Kingdom]], for instance, it is illegal to make blasphemous remarks only if the remarks are directed against the beliefs of the [[Church of England]], though there have been no convictions since [[1922]] (see [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom]]). In [[Pakistan]] blasphemy directed against either the tenets of the [[Qur'an]] or the Prophet [[Mohammed]] is punishable by either life imprisonment or death. [[Apostasy]], the rejection of one's old religion, is also criminalized in a number of countries, notably [[Afghanistan]] with [[Abdul Rahman (convert)|Abdul Rahman]] being the first to face the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for converting to [[Christianity]].

The [[United Nations]] upholds the right to free expression of religious belief in article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] while article 2 forbids [[discrimination]] on the basis of religion. Article 18 also allows for the freedom to change religion. The Declaration is not legally binding, however the [[United States]] chose in [[1998]] to pass the International Religious Freedom Act, creating the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|Commission on International Religious Freedom]], and mandating that the United States government take action against any country found to violate the religious freedoms outlined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/laws/majorlaw/intlrel.htm "International Religious Freedom Act of 1998", 27 January 1998, retrieved 25 May 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which is legally binding on all [[European Union]] states (following the passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] in the [[United Kingdom]]), makes restricting the rights of an individual to practice or change their religion illegal in article 9, and discrimination on the basis of religion illegal in article 14. 

In its 2000 annual report on international religious freedom, the U.S. [[State Department]] cited [[China]], [[Myanmar]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]] and [[Sudan]] for persecuting people for their religious faith and practices.  The report, which covers July 1999 through June 2000, details U.S. policy toward countries where religious freedom is violated in the view of the U.S. State Department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscirf.gov/mediaroom/press/2000.html "United States Commission on International Freedom of Religion", Press Releases 2000, retrieved 25 May 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[advocacy group]] [[Freedom House]] produced a report entitled "Religious Freedom in the World" in 2000 which ranked countries according to their religious freedom. The countries receiving a score of 7, indicating those where religious freedom was least respected, were [[Turkmenistan]], [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sudan]], [[Myanmar]] and [[North Korea]]. [[China]] was given a score of 6 overall, however [[Tibet]] was listed separately in the 7 category. Those countries receiving a score of 1, indicating the highest level of religious freedom, were [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[The Netherlands]], [[Norway]] and the [[United States]].
Within those countries that openly advocate religious tolerance there remain debates as to the limits of tolerance. Some individuals and religious groups, for example, retain beliefs or practices which involve acts contrary to established law, such as the use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] by members of the [[Rastafari movement]], the religious use of [[eagle]] [[feathers]] by non-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (contrary to the [[eagle feather law]], 50 CFR 22), or the practice of [[polygamy]] amongst [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/od/1 "Official Declaration", Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6 October 1890, retrieved 25 May 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; The precise definition of "religion", and to which groups it applies, can also cause controversy, for example the case of [[Scientologists]] who have all rights of religious freedom but complain that the highest court decided not to grant the status of a [[Non-profit organization]] in several states. Attempts to legislate against acts of religious intolerance amongst citizens frequently come up against issues regarding the [[freedom of speech]]; whilst in [[France]] being convicted of incitement to religious hatred can carry a maximum of 18 months in prison. An attempt to pass a similar law by [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government in the [[United Kingdom]] had to be dropped in April, [[2006]] after criticism that it restricted free speech. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] the [[Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001]] makes illegal "conduct that incites hatred against, serious contempt for, or revulsion or severe ridicule of, that other person or class of persons" on the grounds of religious belief.
