'''Religious intolerance''' is [[Toleration|intolerance]] of another's religious beliefs or practices or lack thereof.

Mere statements which are contrary to one's beliefs do not constitute intolerance. Religious intolerance, rather, occurs when a group (e.g., a society, a religious group, a non-religious group) specifically refuses to tolerate one's practices, persons or beliefs  on religious grounds.

==Historical perspectives==
The intolerance, and even the active persecution of religious minorities (sometimes religious majorities as in modern [[Bahrain]] or the Pre-Dutch Indonesian kingdoms), has a long history. Not one region of Earth has been spared from having a past which was filled with religious intolerance. Almost all religions have historically faced persecution at some point as well as enacted persecution of other viewpoints. 

The modern concept of religious tolerance developed out of the [[European wars of religion]], more specifically out of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] which ended the [[30 Years War]] (1618 - 1648), during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the ensuing conflicts between [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The doctrine of 'religious toleration' was established as a result of the [[30 Years War]] between the Catholic [[Hapsburgs]] and newly Protestant nations like [[Sweden]] under [[Gustavus Adolphus]]. At this time, rulers sought to eradicate religious sentiments and dogmas from their political [[demesne]]s. The 1648 Treaty gave nations the right of sovereignty and it also allowed minority Christian denominations to exist within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hobolt|first1=Sara B.|author-link=Sara Hobolt|last2=Brug|first2=Wouter Van der|last3=Vreese|first3=Claes H.

According to the early 20th century British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Arnold Toynbee]], for a religious establishment to persecute another religion for being "wrong" ironically puts the persecuting religion in the wrong, undermining its own legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Toynbee|first=Arnold|title=A Study of History: Abridgment of Volumes I–VI|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/studyofhistory00toyn|chapter-url-access=registration|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-19-505081-9|editor=Dorothea Grace Somervell|page=[https://archive.org/details/studyofhistory00toyn/page/300 300]|chapter=Failure of Self-Determination}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary attitude and practice==

The [[constitution]]s of some countries contain provisions which expressly forbid the state from engaging in certain acts of religious intolerance and these same provisions also forbid the state from showing a preference for a particular religion within its own borders, examples of such provisions include the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the Article 4 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], Article 44.2.1 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]], Article 40 of the [[Estonia]]n Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/en00000_.html ''"Estonia – Constitution"''], ICL Document 28 June 1992, retrieved 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 24 of the [[Constitution of Turkey]], Article 36 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/constitution/constitution.html|title=Constitution of the People's Republic of China|website=en.people.cn|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Article 3 Section 5 of the [[1987 Constitution|Constitution of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/8-philippineconstitutions/70-1987-constitution.html 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917010411/http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/8-philippineconstitutions/70-1987-constitution.html |date=2009-09-17 }}, [http://thecorpusjuris.com CorpusJuris], retrieved 24 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states, whilst not containing constitutional provisions which are directly related to religion, nonetheless contain provisions which forbid discrimination on religious grounds (see, for example, Article 1 of the [[Constitution of France]], article 15 of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and article 40 of the [[Constitution of Egypt]]). These constitutional provisions do not necessarily guarantee that all elements of the state remain free from religious intolerance at all times, and practice can vary widely from country to country.

Other countries, meanwhile, may allow for religious preference, for instance through the establishment of one or more [[state religion]]s, but not for religious intolerance. [[Finland]], for example, has the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] and [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] as its official state religions, yet upholds the right of free expression of religion in article 11 of its [[Constitution of Finland|constitution]].

Some countries retain laws which forbid the [[defamation]] of religious beliefs. Some constitutions retain laws which forbid all forms of [[blasphemy]] (e.g., [[Germany]] where, in 2006, [[Manfred van H.]] was convicted of blasphemy against [[Islam]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/de/news/Suspended-prison-for-German-who-insulted-Koran_135903.html|title=Suspended prison for German who insulted Koran|website=www.expatica.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen by some as official endorsement of religious intolerance, amounting to the criminalization of religious views. The connection between intolerance and blasphemy laws is closest when the laws apply to only one religion. In [[Pakistan]] blasphemy directed against either the tenets of the [[Qur'an]] or the Prophet [[Mohammed]] is punishable by either life imprisonment or death. [[Apostasy]], the rejection of one's old religion, is also criminalized in a number of countries, notably [[Afghanistan]] with [[Abdul Rahman (convert)|Abdul Rahman]] being the first to face the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for converting to [[Christianity]].

The [[United Nations]] upholds the right to freely express one's religious beliefs, as listed in the UN's charter, and additionally in articles 2 and 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Article 2 forbids [[discrimination]] based on religious grounds. Article 18 protects the freedom to change one's religion. 
As a [[treaty]], not a [[wikt:declaration|declaration]], is legally binding, the signing of the human rights declaration is a public pledge of commitment.{{clarify|date=December 2019}}&lt;!--So, is or is not the UDHR legally binding?--&gt; Out of a desire to avoid subservience to an international court, the United States chose in 1998 to pass the International Religious Freedom Act, creating the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|Commission on International Religious Freedom]], and mandating that the United States government take action against any country found to violate the religious freedoms outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/laws/majorlaw/intlrel.htm "International Religious Freedom Act of 1998"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608190937/http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/laws/majorlaw/intlrel.htm |date=2007-06-08 }}, 27 January 1998, retrieved 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Council in 2011 adopted Resolution 16/18 on "Combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence and violence against, persons based on religion or belief"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A.HRC.RES.16.18_en.pdf|title=Combating intolerance, negative stereotyping and stigmatization of, and discrimination, incitement to violence and violence against, persons based on religion or belief|access-date=2019-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was hailed by stakeholders from all regions and faiths as a turning point in international efforts to confront religious intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = URG Policy Report: Combatting global religious intolerance|url = http://www.universal-rights.org/urg-policy-reports/combatting-global-religious-intolerance-the-implementation-of-human-rights-council-resolution-1618/|website = Universal Rights Group|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which is legally binding on all [[European Union]] states (following the passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] in the [[United Kingdom]]), makes restricting the rights of an individual to practice or change their religion illegal in article 9, and discrimination on the basis of religion illegal in article 14.

In its 2000 annual report on international religious freedom, the U.S. [[State Department]] cited China, [[Myanmar]], Iran, Iraq and [[Sudan]] for persecuting people for their religious faith and practices.  The report, which covers July 1999 through June 2000, details U.S. policy toward countries where religious freedom is violated in the view of the U.S. State Department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscirf.gov/mediaroom/press/2000.html "United States Commission on International Freedom of Religion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103150009/http://uscirf.gov/mediaroom/press/2000.html |date=2005-11-03 }}, Press Releases 2000, retrieved 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[advocacy group]] [[Freedom House]] produced a report entitled "Religious Freedom in the World" in 2000 which ranked countries according to their religious freedom. The countries receiving a score of 7, indicating those where religious freedom was least respected, were [[Turkmenistan]], Iran, Saudi Arabia, [[Sudan]], [[Myanmar]] and [[North Korea]]. China was given a score of 6 overall, however [[Tibet]] was listed separately in the 7 category. Those countries receiving a score of 1, indicating the highest level of religious freedom, were [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]] and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2000|title=Freedom in the World 2000 {{!}} Freedom House|website=freedomhouse.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within those countries that openly advocate religious tolerance there remain debates as to the limits of tolerance. Some individuals and religious groups, for example, retain beliefs or practices which involve acts contrary to established law, such as the use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] by members of the [[Rastafari movement]], the religious use of eagle feathers by non-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (contrary to the [[eagle feather law]], 50 CFR 22), or the practice of [[polygamy]] amongst the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng "Official Declaration"], Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6 October 1890, retrieved 25 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Australia ==
Religious freedom has developed partly due to the agreeable relationship between religious groups in its society. Several non-governmental organizations promoted tolerance and better understanding among religions in the country, both indigenous and non-indigenous. These groups included the Columbian Centre for Christian-Muslim Relations, the [[National Council of Churches in Australia]] and its affiliated Aboriginal and Islander Commission, and the [[Australian Council of Christians and Jews]]. In Victoria, Australia the Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001 makes illegal "conduct that incites hatred against, serious contempt for, or revulsion or severe ridicule of, that other person or class of persons" on the grounds of religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/rarta2001265/|title=Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, in response to an increase in [[Islamophobia in Australia|anti-Islamic sentiment]], the HREOC undertook a project involving national consultations on eliminating prejudice against Arab and Muslim citizens. As part of the consultations, the commission considered whether Muslim citizens shared an ethnic origin or race, as well as a religion, which would entitle them to comprehensive protection under the Federal Race Discrimination Act. The commission's report, made public in June 2004, contained no findings on the racial status of Arab and Muslim citizens. In January 2005 the leader of the neo-Nazi Australian Nationalist Movement was connected to incidents in 2004 in which several Asian-owned businesses and a synagogue in Perth were firebombed or sprayed with racist graffiti. On December 11, 2005, there was a riot in the Sydney suburb of Cronulla, that erupted because a group of Lebanese-Australian youths had assaulted two lifeguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib101068/2gb%2520-%2520report%25201485.pdf|title=Error {{!}} ACMA|website=www.acma.gov.au|access-date=2016-05-17|archive-date=2016-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702141545/http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/_assets/main/lib101068/2gb%20-%20report%201485.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrators against the assault displayed anti-Arab and anti-Muslim slogans. When the gathering turned violent, bystanders perceived to be of Middle Eastern origin or Muslim were attacked. The following day, retaliatory vandalism and other assaults were reported around Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71333.htm|title=Australia|website=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
