'''Female education''' is a catch-all term for a complex set of issues and debates surrounding education ([[primary education]], [[secondary education]], [[tertiary education]], and [[health education]] in particular) for girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Усамов |first=И.Р. |title=Digital Transformation of Education: Challenges and Prospects |date=2019-12-18 |journal=Вестник ГГНТУ.

Because of the wide-reaching effects of female education on society, alleviating inequalities in education for women is highlighted in [[Sustainable Development Goal 4]] "Quality Education for All", and deeply connected to [[Sustainable Development Goal 5|Sustainable Development Goal 5 "Gender Equality]]". Education of girls (and empowerment of women in general) in developing countries leads to faster development and a faster decrease of [[Human population growth|population growth]], thus playing a significant role in addressing environmental issues such as [[climate change mitigation]].&lt;ref name="Grimm 771–779"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2005-12-01 |title=Taking action: achieving gender equality and empowering women |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5860/choice.43-2525 |journal=Choice Reviews Online |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=43–2525–43-2525 |doi=10.5860/choice.43-2525 |issn=0009-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drawdown (climate)|Project Drawdown]] estimates that educating girls is the sixth most efficient action against climate change (ahead of [[solar farms]] and [[nuclear power]]).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Violence against women===

[[Violence against women]] teachers became a political issue in Sweden during the period from 1900 to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vaughan |first=Mary Kay |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv1d6q40z |title=Cultural Politics in Revolution |date=1997-03-01 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |doi=10.2307/j.ctv1d6q40z |isbn=978-0-8165-4310-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203839683 |title=Global Pathways to Abolishing Physical Punishment |date=2010-12-20 |publisher=Routledge |doi=10.4324/9780203839683 |isbn=978-1-136-88635-5 |editor-last=Durrant |editor-first=Joan E. |editor-last2=Smith |editor-first2=Anne B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Pratt |first1=John |last2=Eriksson |first2=Anna |date=2014-06-03 |title=Contrasts in Punishment |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203096116 |doi=10.4324/9780203096116|isbn=9780203096116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, 66 percent of Sweden's teachers were women, many of whom worked in isolated rural areas, where they faced loneliness and the threat of male violence. Politicians, teachers, and female authors debated a number of solutions to reduce these threats, such as providing the teachers with guard dogs, weapons, and telephones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Backman Prytz |first1=Sara |last2=Westberg |first2=Johannes |title="Arm the Schoolmistress!"

In Pakistan, a negative relationship was found between the formal level of education a woman attains and the likelihood of violence against that woman (After, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mumtaz |first1=Sarwat |last2=Bahk |first2=Jinwook |last3=Khang |first3=Young-Ho |date=2017-10-17 |title=Rising trends and inequalities in cesarean section rates in Pakistan: Evidence from Pakistan Demographic and Health Surveys, 1990-2013 |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=e0186563 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0186563 |pmid=29040316 |pmc=5645133 |bibcode=2017PLoSO..1286563M |issn=1932-6203|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Blair |first1=Graeme |last2=Christine Fair |first2=C. |last3=Malhotra |first3=Neil |last4=Shapiro |first4=Jacob N. |date=2012-07-16 |title=Poverty and Support for Militant Politics: Evidence from Pakistan |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00604.x |journal=American Journal of Political Science |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=30–48 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2012.00604.x |issn=0092-5853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researcher used snowball convenient sampling, a sampling method where participants are referred. Ethical and privacy issues made this the most convenient method.  An informant played a major role in gathering information that was then cross-checked. The sample of victims of violence was made up of married women from ages 18–60 both from rural and urban communities. The study described different forms of physical violence that are already present and provided an idea of what women go through, even across communities (rural and urban). Education in this study was stressed to be the solution and a necessity in eliminating violence. A discussion of political and social barriers is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=Hafiz Muhammad Ather |last2=Sindher |first2=Riaz Hussain Khan |last3=Hussain |first3=Irshad |title=Studying the role of education in eliminating violence against women |journal=Pakistan Journal of Commerce and Social Sciences |date=2013 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=405–416 |id={{ProQuest|1517529927}} |hdl=10419/188100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship is a lot more complicated than it seems, women can be illiterate but still become empowered (Marrs Fuchsel, 2014). Immigrant Latina Women (ILW) were part of a qualitative study of 8 to 10 participant groups, at a time, and completed an 11-week program centered on self-esteem, domestic violence awareness, and healthy relationships. Immigrant Latina Women (ILW) is a highly affected group by domestic violence. Though this program took place outside of a traditional classroom, dialogue, critical thinking, and emotional well-being were stressed, areas that should be acquired while in school. Lastly, though many of the women were illiterates they were still able to come away with a stronger sense of control over their own lives, an important life skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |id={{ERIC|EJ1064075}} |last1=Marrs Fuchsel |first1=L.

Different countries experience various forms of violence against women and girls, which in Nigeria, UNICEF noted 16 facts about such incidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=UNICEF |url=https://www.unicef.org/ |access-date=2023-03-20 |website=www.unicef.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those facts include: physical effects, psychological effects, short-term and long-term effect; effects on the victims, the children, the society among others  There are factors that promote violence against women, which should be made open to the public. There is need for proper women and girl education to save them from the tragedy called violence. Development can be possible if individuals are able to learn positive habits that will shied them away from violence. World Health indicated that around the globe about 30% of women experience violence either by intimate sex mate or relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=BMC Women's Health |url=https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/ |access-date=2023-03-20 |website=BioMed Central |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's empowerment===

Education systems vary in administration, curriculum and personnel, but all have an influence on the students that they serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bray |first1=Mark |title=Educational and social impact |date=2022-08-08 |work=Shadow Education in the Middle East |pages=54–61 |place=London |publisher=Routledge |last2=Hajar |first2=Anas|doi=10.4324/9781003317593-5 |isbn=9781003317593 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Alkhaldi |first1=Amal Hatem |last2=Burgess |first2=John |last3=Connell |first3=Julia |date=2014-12-01 |title=The Transfer of HRM Policies and Practices in American Multinational Hotels in Saudi Arabia |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.21632/irjbs.7.3.155-164 |journal=International Research Journal of Business Studies |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=155–164 |doi=10.21632/irjbs.7.3.155-164 |issn=2089-6271|hdl=20.500.11937/33 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; As women have gained rights, formal education has become a symbol of progress and a step toward gender equity. In order for true gender equity to exist, a holistic approach needs to be taken. The discussion of girl power and women's education as solutions for eliminating violence against women and economic dependence on men can sometimes take dominance and result in the suppression of understanding how context, history and other factors affect women (Shenila [[Shenila Khoja-Moolji|Khoja-Moolji]], 2015). For example, when past secretary of State, [[Hillary Clinton]], referenced the tragedies of [[Malala Yousafzai]] in Pakistan and the girls kidnapping in [[Chibok]], [[Nigeria]], as comparable, using girls' education as the focus, history and context were ignored. What led to the shooting of Malala was reduced to being solely about her educating herself as a girl.

Education systems and schools play a central role in determining girls' interest in various subjects, including STEM subjects, which can contribute to women's [[empowerment]] by providing equal opportunities to access and benefit from quality STEM education.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To enhance female literacy in Bangladesh, the government has implemented a range of programs.

====Impact on socio-economic development====
{{Excerpt|Socioeconomic impact of female education}}
A [[systematic review]] on vocational and business training for women in low- and middle-income countries summarized the evidence from thirty-five studies regarding the impacts of such training programs. The authors found that these types of programs have small positive effects on employment and income with variability across studies. They found that the effects of training may increase with a stronger gender focus of the program.&lt;ref name="ChinenHoop2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chinen |first1=Marjorie |last2=Hoop |first2=Thomas |last3=Alcázar |first3=Lorena |last4=Balarin |first4=María |last5=Sennett |first5=Josh |title=Vocational and business training to improve women's labour market outcomes in low‐ and middle‐income countries: a systematic review |journal=Campbell Systematic Reviews |date=January 2017 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–195 |doi=10.4073/csr.2017.16 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impact===
Education of girls (and empowerment of women in general) in developing countries leads to faster development and a faster decrease of [[Human population growth|population growth]]. It therefore has a significant impact on environmental issues such as [[climate change]]. The research network [[Drawdown (climate)|Drawdown]] estimates that educating girls is the sixth most efficient action against climate change (ahead of [[solar farms]], [[nuclear power]], [[afforestation]] and many other actions).&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/women-and-girls/educating-girls|title=EDUCATING GIRLS|publisher=Drawdown|access-date=4 July 2019|archive-date=14 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014145620/https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/women-and-girls/educating-girls|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific types of education ==

=== Technology education ===
The proliferation of digital [[technology]] and digital services has made digital skills a prerequisite for full participation in [[society]]. Today, an inability to navigate the [[internet]] poses disadvantages. While these disadvantages were once somewhat contained to wealthy countries, they are now relevant globally, due to the rapid and continuing proliferation of internet-connected technology.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|last=UNESCO, EQUALS Skills Coalition|date=2019|title=I'd blush if I could: closing gender divides in digital skills through education|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367416.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equipping women and girls with digital skills helps put them on equal footing with digitally savvy men, and opens up countless opportunities for increased agency and choice. [[Website]]s and mobile applications on [[health]] and [[Natural rights and legal rights|legal rights]], for example, can help women make informed decisions to safeguard and care for themselves and their families, while online social networks and [[digital communications]] allow women to disseminate information and share knowledge beyond their immediate community.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

[[M-learning|Mobile learning]] opportunities, from [[literacy]] apps to open online courses ([[MOOCs]]) about subjects as diverse as [[astronomy]] and caring for older relatives with dementia, can open up new educational pathways, especially for out-of-school girls and adult women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Hempel |first1=Jessi |title=Siri and Cortana Sound Like Ladies Because of Sexism |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/10/why-siri-cortana-voice-interfaces-sound-female-sexism/ |magazine=Wired |date=28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Job search engines and professional networking sites enable women to compete in the [[Labour Market|labour market]], while [[e-commerce]] platforms and digital banking services can help increase their [[income]] and independence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==History==

===Africa===
Christian missionaries in the 19th century opened modern educational methods, but they usually focused on boys. After early experiments they settled on promoting ideology of domestic femininity imparted through girls' schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leach |first1=Fiona |title=Resisting conformity: Anglican mission women and the schooling of girls in early nineteenth-century West Africa |journal=History of Education |date=March 2012 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=133–153 |doi=10.1080/0046760X.2011.582048 |s2cid=144485341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]] after 1820, male Scottish missionaries decided that only the most basic education was necessary to prepare native women for the propagation of Christianity within the home. They prevented female teachers from operating in the Scottish mission's territory. They delayed the establishment of a Girls' Department at [[Lovedale Institution]]. Finally new leadership arrived who had a broader vision of uplifting native women so they could promote Christianity and Western gender codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erlank |first1=Natasha |title='Raising Up the Degraded Daughters of Africa': The Provision of Education for Xhosa Women in the Mid-Nineteenth Century |journal=South African Historical Journal |date=November 2000 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=24–38 |doi=10.1080/02582470008671906 |s2cid=143832577 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== West Africa ====
===== Pre-colonial =====
{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}
Women's education in West Africa manifested in both formal and informal structures, with one of the more notable structures that had influence on women's education being preparatory schools labeled "Bush Schools".&lt;ref name=Day1998&gt;{{cite book |last=Day |first=Lynda |chapter=Rites and Reason: Precolonial Education and Its Relevance to the Current Production and Transmission of Knowledge |pages=49–72 |editor1-last=Bloch |editor1-first=Marianne N. |editor2-last=Beoku-Betts |editor2-first=Josephine A. |editor3-last=Tabachnick |editor3-first=B. Robert |title=Women and Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Power, Opportunities, and Constraints |date=1998 |publisher=L. Rienner Publishers |isbn=978-1-55587-704-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These bush schools were institutions that would oftentimes boast near 100% graduation rates and completed courses. They were organized by women and had a planned, structured curriculum, which included learning how to do skills such as learning how to "fish, cook, weave, spin cotton, dress hair, and make baskets, musical instruments, pots, and fishing nets."&lt;ref name=Day1998/&gt;  Much of the scholarship and research on these schools arises from the Bundu schools of Sierra Leone. In addition to these skills, girls would often be given reproductive education, such as birth control techniques or child rearing skills. In particular to the Bundu schools, women would be given an intense education in medicinal herbs and home medicinal skills.&lt;ref name=Day1998/&gt;  These schools did not just teach educational curriculum (such as history passed on through songs and dances), but enabled the transmission of cultural values and were centers of female power. Despite the colonial and post-colonial ideal that women ought to be educated just to serve decorative or child-bearing maternal roles, these institutions taught women to play central economic, corporate and familial roles in their communities.&lt;ref name=Day1998/&gt;
 
In the 19th century, [[Nana Asmaʼu]] (1793–1864) founded the [[Yan Taru]] movement for the education of [[Sokoto Caliphate|Sokoto]] women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akyeampong|first1=Emmanuel Kwaku|author-link1=Emmanuel K.

===== Colonial =====

Early colonial forms of education on the West African coasts, particularly among the [[Dahomey]], [[Ashanti people|Asante]] and [[Yoruba people|Yorùbá]] people, were pioneered by missionaries and institutions that were trying to educate religious thought in addition to teaching more traditional western educational topics such as reading and writing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Education in Ghana: From the Earliest Times to the Declaration of Independence|last=Graham|first=C.K.|publisher=Routeledge|year=1971}}{{page needed|date=March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1529, King John III of Portugal had given instruction to open schools and provide education in "religious thought, reading and writing" and for the instructors to be paid by the pupil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For women in particular however, these colonial forms of education brought with them European ideals of women's roles in the family, society and economy. These Western ideas of womanhood oftentimes contrasted with women's roles in the economy, society, or in the home.&lt;ref name=pmid11639388&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allman |first1=Jean |title=Making Mothers: Missionaries, Medical Officers and Women's Work in Colonial Asante, 1924–1945 |journal=History Workshop Journal |date=1 October 1994 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=23–47 |doi=10.1093/hwj/38.1.23 |pmid=11639388 |s2cid=12012354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Igbo people|Igbo]] women had associations known as [[Sitting on a man|Mikiri]], which were economic and social forums for women in which they discussed direct action to enforce their interests, which were largely misunderstood and disregarded by various British colonial administrations. Hence, as the colonial administrations introduced schools to the region, they ignored educating women to fill economic roles in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Allen |first1=Judith |title='Sitting on a Man': Colonialism and the Lost Political Institutions of Igbo Women |journal=Canadian Journal of African Studies |date=January 1972 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=165–181 |doi=10.1080/00083968.1972.10803664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the educational ideal of men as "[[Breadwinner model|breadwinners]]", i.e. the primary financial support of a nuclear family structure, was introduced by successive British colonial governments in West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Africa After Gender?|last=Lindsay|first=Lisa|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2007|location=Bloomington|pages=Chapter: Working with Gender: The Emergence of the "Male Breadwinner" in Colonial Southwestern Nigeria}}{{page needed|date=March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the groups of people that the colonial governments in West Africa put heavy import on educating were the mixed children of white people, typically men, and indigenous people, typically women. In pre-British era of Ghanaian history, when much of the interaction between indigenous people and Europeans was through Dutch traders, mixed race children of traders and indigenous people were removed from their indigenous communities and placed in Dutch educational institutions in Ghana.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crossing the Color Line: Race, Sex, and the Contested Politics of Colonialism in Ghana|last=Ray|first=Carina|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2016|location=Athens}}{{page needed|date=March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these early colonial schools the education was also gendered by Western standards: the boys were educated from a young age to be military officers in the Dutch army and the girls were educated to be married to Dutch military officers in the region.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

One of the other ways through which colonizing countries were able to exert influence and indirect rule over the indigenous people was through maternal education. In colonial Ghana, [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist]] missionaries led classes teaching western methods of hygiene and child birth to the indigenous mothers or mothers-to-be.&lt;ref name=pmid11639388/&gt; The missionaries tried to construct an ideal of motherhood that matched white European middle-class standards, irrespective of the social context of the ideals of motherhood in place in the [[Ashanti Empire|Asante]] societies they were located in.&lt;ref name=pmid11639388/&gt;

===== Contemporary =====
In post-colonial West Africa, many of the ideals of Western education have remained while much of the infrastructure and funding left with the colonial presence.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hollos |first1=Marida |chapter=The Status of Women in Southern Nigeria: Is Education a Help or a Hindrance? |pages=247–276 |editor1-last=Bloch |editor1-first=Marianne N. |editor2-last=Beoku-Betts |editor2-first=Josephine A. |editor3-last=Tabachnick |editor3-first=B. Robert |title=Women and Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Power, Opportunities, and Constraints |date=1998 |publisher=L. Rienner Publishers |isbn=978-1-55587-704-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in Nigeria, formal education was seen as a policy making tool, as women's formal education has been linked to having effects on "population growth, health, nutrition, fertility, infant mortality, and changes in women's productivity and earnings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Female Participation in Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|last=UNESCO Division of Statistics, African|publisher=UNESCO Division of Statistics, African Academy of Sciences|year=1995|location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have cited some disadvantages however to this reliance on women's formal education. One, there is concern for women being alienated from their indigenous cultures and not receiving the education in values that were typically received through pre-colonial indigenous educational systems.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, there is an increasing body of literature that suggests how the formal education institutions channel women into particular lower-earning job fields such as the humanities, while guiding women away from more technical jobs with higher wages.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In regards to academic achievement, according to the FAWE Conference girls across the Sub-Saharan region reported lower scores in Math and Science subjects.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Education of Girls and Women in Africa|last=Gachukia|first=Edduh|publisher=Forum for African Women Educationalists|year=1995|location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency for girls to be pushed into clerical positions upon finishing school is also a widely researched and held belief.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Despite this, formal education offers many benefits recognized internationally. The Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women has released publications citing numerous ways through which women's education in Africa is beneficial to society as a whole. These entail an increase in family health, in higher wage jobs available to women, an improvement in quality standards of childhood development, and a greater inclusion of women in decisions making that can impact a nation in environmental, political, social and economic ways.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Despite there being a drop in participation of women in education in the majority of countries in West Africa in the 1950s and 1960s, rates of women education have been steadily climbing since then. However, there is still much statistical gender disparity as according to UNESCO statistics on women's enrollment and graduation rates.

Due to handicapes made for the afghan women and girls for getting education by Taliban government, United nations dedicated 2023 World education day to the afghan girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Iqbal |first=Anwar |date=2023-01-24 |title=UN dedicates World Education Day to Afghan girls and women |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1733328 |access-date=2023-01-25 |website=DAWN.COM |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Gender disparities =====
One of the primary ways in which there are gender disparities in education in West Africa are in the ratios of male to female participation: 43.6% of men have completed primary education as opposed to 35.4% of women, 6.0% of men have completed secondary education as opposed to 3.3% of women, and 0.7% of men have completed tertiary education as opposed to 0.2% of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stromquist |first1=Nelly P. |chapter=Agents in Women's Education: Some Trends in the African Context |pages=25–46 |editor1-last=Bloch |editor1-first=Marianne N. |editor2-last=Beoku-Betts |editor2-first=Josephine A. |editor3-last=Tabachnick |editor3-first=B. Robert |title=Women and Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Power, Opportunities, and Constraints |date=1998 |publisher=L. Rienner Publishers |isbn=978-1-55587-704-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasons for poor enrollment and participation is the "male breadwinner" ideal that prioritizes educating boys over girls and limited funds available to families for education. In addition, in West Africa women are seen as the primary providers of [[Care work|unpaid care work]]. This offers competing demands on the time of girls and oftentimes their families will prioritize girls' spending time taking care of siblings or doing [[domestic labor]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, a leading cause of gender disparities in education are gender disparities in the labor market, which lead to gendered ideas of women's role in a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vavrus |first1=Frances |last2=Bloch |first2=Marianne |chapter=Gender and Educational Research, Policy and Practice in Sub-Saharan Africa: Theoretical and Empirical Problems and Prospects |pages=1–24 |editor1-last=Bloch |editor1-first=Marianne N. |editor2-last=Beoku-Betts |editor2-first=Josephine A. |editor3-last=Tabachnick |editor3-first=B. Robert |title=Women and Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Power, Opportunities, and Constraints |date=1998 |publisher=L. Rienner Publishers |isbn=978-1-55587-704-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, some gender disparities are caused by teacher's attitudes towards students in the classroom according to the students' gender.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson-Levitt |first1=Kathryn M. |last2=Bloch |first2=Marianne |last3=Soumare |first3=Aminata M. |chapter=Inside Classrooms in Guinea: Girls' Experiences |pages=99–130 |editor1-last=Bloch |editor1-first=Marianne N. |editor2-last=Beoku-Betts |editor2-first=Josephine A. |editor3-last=Tabachnick |editor3-first=B. Robert |title=Women and Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Power, Opportunities, and Constraints |date=1998 |publisher=L. Rienner Publishers |isbn=978-1-55587-704-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some preconceived notions that boys are more intelligent and harder working than girls in some West African countries. In particular in [[Guinea]], surveys have been taken by researchers suggesting that school teachers, particularly in rural schools, believe that boys learn lessons better, have more ambition, are smarter, and work harder, while girls make less effort, rarely give good responses to questions, and use poor French expression.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition in both urban and rural schools analyzed, girls were expected to do the manual labor to keep the schools clean while this expectation was not held for the boys.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Gender disparities in higher education persist as well, with women accounting for a little over 20% of university level enrollment in all of Sub-Saharan Africa, and countries in West Africa such as Niger and Ghana reporting rates of 15% and 21%, respectively.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beoku-Betts|first=Josephine|date=1998|title=Gender and Formal Education in Africa: An Exploration of the Opportunity Structure at the Secondary and Tertiary Levels}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered a contributing factor to why there are so few women in higher-level management and administrative jobs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In Ghana in 1990, women made up less than 1% of managers in the labor market, but with an average annual growth rate of 3.2%.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Researchers hope that improving primary education attainment and accomplishment will lead to more attainment and accomplishment in the tertiary educational level and in the labor market.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Gender equality in African education ====
In the past few decades, African countries have attached great importance to the role of education in the process of nation-state construction and development. Therefore, education has been placed on the policy priorities, and the rapid expansion of the number of educational institutions at all levels has greatly increased women's educational opportunities. In particular, after the World Conference on Education for All, women's education received special attention in Africa and achieved rapid development.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's literacy in worldwide perspective|last=Leslie|first=Limage|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Progress =====
Taking Sub-Saharan Africa as an example: in early 1960, the gross enrollment rate of girls in primary education, secondary education and higher education was 25%, 1% and 0.1%, respectively. By 2006, the figures were 89%, 28% and 4%, respectively.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dunne|first1=Máiréad|last2=Sayed|first2=Yusuf|date=2002|title=Transformation and Equity: Women and Higher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa|journal=International Studies in Educational Administration|volume=30|issue=1|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the enrollment rate of women at all levels is increasing, the gender parity index is also improving. In sub-Saharan Africa, the gender parity index for primary school enrollment in 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2006 was 0.77, 0.81, 0.89, and 0.92, respectively. In some countries, women's gross enrollment ratios even exceed men's gross enrollment rates, such as the Gambia, Ghana, Malawi, and Zambia. The gender parity index for secondary and higher education also tends to increase.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In addition to the enrollment rate and gender parity index, other indicators, such as repetition rates, dropout rates, graduation rates, etc., also reflect the progress of women's education in Africa. In 1999, the repetition rate of female primary education in Sub-Saharan African countries was 17.7%, and in 2006 it fell to 13.3%. At the same time, the increase in female enrollment rates has also led to a growing number of female teachers in Africa.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===== Challenge =====
In recent decades, female education in Africa has made great (though uneven) progress. On the one hand, the level of development of women's education between countries and countries in this region is still significantly different due to differences in geographical location, social class, language and ethnicity. On the other hand, compared with the rest of the world, Africa, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, still lags behind in the field of women's education.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-12688-3_12 |chapter=Gender and Mathematics Education Revisited |title=The Proceedings of the 12th International Congress on Mathematical Education |year=2015 |last1=Leder |first1=Gilah C. |pages=145–170 |isbn=978-3-319-10685-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational interventions in conflict-affected regions must adopt a more holistic and culturally sensitive approach to reshape gender norms and foster sustainable peace-building efforts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Datzberger |first=Simone |last2=Le Mat |first2=Marielle L. J. |date=2018-03-01 |title=Just add women and stir?: Education, gender and peacebuilding in Uganda |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059317300342 |journal=International Journal of Educational Development |volume=59 |pages=61–69 |doi=10.1016/j.ijedudev.2017.09.006 |issn=0738-0593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with men, women in most African countries have been disadvantaged in education, and the higher the level of education, the more unfavorable the situation. One of the most important reasons for this "vertical separation" is that girls' academic performance is worse than that of boys, and the percentage of students who can graduate and pass the exam is low. At the same time, in the diversion of secondary education and higher education, there is also a "level separation" of gender, which means that boys and girls are concentrated in certain classes and majors, so that these courses become male-dominated subjects or female-dominated subjects. For example, in the fields of education, humanities, and art, the proportion of girls generally far exceeds that of boys. Science, engineering, and architecture are dominated by boys.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

==== Obstacles ====
There are gender differences in education in Africa, and the factors that lead to these differences are manifold. The factors that hinder the education of gender equality can be roughly divided into economic factors, school-related factors, and social and cultural factors.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socio-Cultural and Economic Factors Affecting Primary Education of Maasai Girls in Loitokitok District, Kenya.|last=Nkoyiai|first=Anastasia|publisher=Western Journal of Black Studies|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Economic =====
Family economic status is an important factor in determining whether a parent is capable of withstanding the direct and indirect costs of a child's education. Direct costs include tuition, school uniform fees, transportation fees and other material fees like textbooks. In Kenya, 47% of the rural population and 27% of the urban population live below the poverty line, yet they have to bear nearly 60% of the cost of primary education. This forces them to selectively educate their children. For poor families, girls are the most direct victims when education costs are unaffordable. In a survey in the mid-1990s, 58% of respondents let their daughters to drop out, while only 27% of respondents chose sons.&lt;ref name=":33"/&gt;

Compared with boys, the [[opportunity cost]] of girls to go to school is higher, because they bear multiple roles such as family workers and mothers' assistants, and they have to bear more labor than men. For example, in a province of Zambia, girls spend four times as much time on direct productive labor as boys. Therefore, girls' late schooling, absenteeism and dropouts are closely related to labor.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

===== School-related =====
The location of the school has a direct impact on the type of education that women receive, the quality of education, and the time of education. Many parents are unwilling to let young children go to school far away from home, and the distance between the school and the home is very common in rural Africa. Insufficient infrastructure such as school teaching, health, and dormitory can also prevent women from entering school. At the same time, the curriculum and related teachers, syllabus, textbooks and teaching methods lack gender awareness, or exist gender bias, which has far more adverse effects for girls than boys. In many African countries, it is still to strengthen the society's perception of women's family life, and to hide the prejudice that women's intelligence is not as good as men's. In such a learning environment, women's learning attitudes are often negative, and they cannot fully exert their abilities. In the secondary and higher education stages, women are usually assigned to learn courses that are more feminine, such as home economics, craft classes or biology (biological is considered to be related to women's traditional occupations, such as nursing).&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

In addition, various forms of sexual violence and sexual harassment in schools, or concerns about sexual violence and sexual harassment, are silent barriers to girls' enrollment. These behaviors not only affect the school's academic performance, but also cause pregnancy, early marriage and so on. At the same time, in many countries, teenage pregnancy almost interrupted girls' school education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bisika |first1=Thomas |last2=Ntata |first2=Pierson |last3=Konyani |first3=Sidon |title=Gender-violence and education in Malawi: a study of violence against girls as an obstruction to universal primary school education |journal=Journal of Gender Studies |date=1 September 2009 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=287–294 |doi=10.1080/09589230903057183 |s2cid=72635362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Social =====
Africa's deep-rooted attitude towards women may be traced back to the patriarchal system that continued in African native culture and colonial experience. Traditionally, women's reproductive and family roles are of great value. Adolescent African girls feel this pressure strongly because she either assists her mother or other female relatives to complete their home tasks or achieves a transition to an adult role such as a wife or mother at this time. From that age, some girls who are still in elementary school are at risk of interrupting their studies. The traditional concept of marriage in Africa regards investment in women's education as a waste, that is, all proceeds flow to another family. Therefore, it is often difficult for women to get care from their father and thus lose many educational opportunities.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

Many tribes in different parts of the world, do not advocate women education. Their cultural values are violated in case of disobeyance of their ancestors.

==== Policy interventions ====

===== Cost-related =====
Effectively promote universal, free and compulsory basic education, reduce or eliminate the direct cost of basic education, so that primary education can be more affordable. For example, in 2001, Tanzania implemented free primary education, resulting in a rapid increase in the gross enrollment rate of women's primary education from 61.6% to 88.8%.&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

===== Schools =====
Schools create a safe and fair learning environment and institutional culture that is conducive to women. Gender considerations will be taken into account in the supply and allocation of resources to meet women's specific educational needs. More important is to strengthen gender awareness education for all teachers and educators.&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt;

===== Governments =====
The government plays an important role in advancing gender equality in education. One of its roles is to create a good environment through laws and policies to promote women's education to achieve gender equality. Beyond the law, the government must also set up a clear framework. For example, in Ethiopia, the government clearly stipulates that women and men have the same opportunity to accept the same curriculum, and are free to choose a profession to ensure that women have the same employment opportunities as men.&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt;

After the [[Second World War]] modernization reforms were seen as necessary by the government, which resulted in the resurrection of a state women's movement.

After [[2021 Taliban offensive|taking control of the country in 2021]], the [[Taliban]] gradually banned education for girls and women above the 6th grade. Women were also prohibited from working as teachers and in other professions, creating problems for girls' elementary education and leading to a risky underground network of girls' schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2022/12/25/1145491191/with-the-talibans-latest-move-the-highest-level-of-education-an-afghan-girl-can- With the Taliban's latest move, the highest level of education an Afghan girl can get is 6th grade]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the custom of [[footbinding]] among Chinese women that lasted through the end of the 19th century, it was recognized that a woman's virtue lay with her lack of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blake |first1=C.

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near one another, the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male doctors of Western medicine. This resulted in a tremendous need for women in Western medicine in China. Thus, female medical missionary, Dr. Mary H. Fulton (1854–1927),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04TOSAAACAAJ |title=Inasmuch |author=Mary H.

Hackett (1851–1916) of Indiana, United States. The college was dedicated in 1902 and offered a four-year curriculum.  By 1915, there were more than 60 students, mostly in residence. Most students became Christians, due to the influence of Dr. Fulton. The college was officially recognized, with its diplomas marked with the official stamp of the Guangdong provincial government. The college was aimed at the spreading of Christianity and modern medicine and the elevation of Chinese women's social status.

======People's Republic (1949–present)======
Between the years 1931 and 1945, the percent of uneducated women was over 90%, and most of the women who were educated had only completed the elementary level.&lt;ref name="docin.com"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.docin.com/p-267194495.html |script-title=zh:中国女性教育发展 - 豆丁网 |publisher=Docin.com |date=2011-10-04 |access-date=2015-04-17|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1950s, after the establishment of People Republic China, the government started a civilization project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gov.163.com/14/0917/16/A6BULAB100234KKR.html |title=1950年："扫盲"字眼消失 一个落后时代的远去_网易政务 |publisher=Gov.163.com |date=2014-09-17 |access-date=2015-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111205351/http://gov.163.com/14/0917/16/A6BULAB100234KKR.html |archive-date=2014-11-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It enabled large amounts of uneducated women to learn basic writing and calculation. This project raised the proportion of educated women. It was promoted not only in cities but also in rural area. Villages had their own elementary schools. Instead of only taking care of children and chores at home, middle-aged women had chances to learn writing and reading in local schools.

In the 1980s, Chinese central government passed a new education law, which required local governments to promote 9-year obligation education nationwide.&lt;ref name="中华人民共和国义务教育法_教育部门户网站_MOE.GOV.CN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.edu.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/moe_619/200606/15687.html|title=中华人民共和国义务教育法_教育部门户网站_MOE.GOV.CN|date=2006-06-30|publisher=Moe.edu.cn|access-date=2015-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232448/http://www.moe.edu.cn/publicfiles/business/htmlfiles/moe/moe_619/200606/15687.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new education law guaranteed education rights until middle school. Before the 1960s, female enrollment in elementary school was 20%. 20 years after publishment of education law, in the year 1995, this percentage had increased to 98.2%. By 2003, proportion of female who dropped from middle school decreased to 2.49%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hannum |first1=Emily |title=Political Change and the Urban-Rural Gap in Basic Education in China, 1949-1990 |journal=Comparative Education Review |date=May 1999 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=193–211 |doi=10.1086/447554 |jstor=1189018 |s2cid=144407513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the fifth national census in 2000, the average education length of females is up to 7.4 years. This digit increases from 7.0 years to 7.4 years in 3 years. However, the female education duration is still 0.8 year less than male's duration. This gap in higher-level of education is larger in rural areas. In the countryside, parents tend to use their limited resources for sons because they believe sons have abilities to bring more back and their contributions to family in the future are more significant than daughters. In an investigation, parents are 21.9% more likely to stop financing girls' education if they come into financial problems and family issues. Boys are provided with more opportunities for further studying, especially after middle school. This difference became more evident in the universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lavely |first1=William |last2=Zhenyu |first2=Xiao |last3=Bohua |first3=Li |last4=Freedman |first4=Ronald |title=The Rise in Female Education in China: National and Regional Patterns |journal=The China Quarterly |date=March 1990 |volume=121 |pages=61–93 |doi=10.1017/S0305741000013515 |s2cid=154871316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, university education is becoming more prevalent. The total enrollment goes up. Compare to the year of 1977, which is the first year when college entrance examination was recovered, the admission rate increased from 4.8% to 74.86%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.cn/gao_kao_1051/20130507/t20130507_939505.shtml |title=全国历年参加高考人数和录取人数统计-中国教育 |publisher=Edu.cn |access-date=2015-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611143115/http://www.edu.cn/gao_kao_1051/20130507/t20130507_939505.shtml |archive-date=2013-06-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the general admission has largely risen, more students got into universities. Although women are assumed to own the same rights of general education, they are forced to do better in the Chinese college entrance examination ([[Gaokao]]) than males. Girls need to achieve higher grades than male students in order to get into the same level university. It is an invisible ceiling for Chinese female, especially in the top universities. It is not a public rule but a mainstream consensus among most of Chinese university admission offices. According to a telephone interview with an officer, who declined to give her name, at the Teaching Office at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]], "female students must account for less than 15 percent of students because of the nature of their future career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tatlow |first1=Didi Kirsten |title=Women in China Face Rising University Entry Barriers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/world/asia/08iht-educlede08.html |work=The New York Times |date=7 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====India=====
======Vedic period======
Most females were allowed to pursue education without significant constraints in the Vedic period. Women's education, unlike in the subsequent periods was not neglected. Female scholars were also present during this period. The educators of this period had divided women into two groups – Brahmavadinis and Sadyodvahas. The former were life-long students of philosophy and theology. Sadyodvahas used to continue their studies until they got married. There were many women poets and philosophers, such as Apala, Ghosha, Visvavara, Sulabha Maitreyi and Gargi.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

The Church Missionary Society tasted greater success in South India. The first boarding school for girls came up in Tirunelveli in 1821. By 1840 the Scottish Church Society constructed six schools with roll strength of 200 Hindu girls. When it was mid-century, the missionaries in Madras had included under its banner, 8,000 girls.
Women's employment and education was acknowledged in 1854 by the East Indian Company's Programme: Wood's Dispatch. Slowly, after that, there was progress in female education, but it initially tended to be focused on the primary school level and was related to the richer sections of society. The overall literacy rate for women increased from 0.2% in 1882 to 6% in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/s/3N/EP/3NEP0401.htm |title=Educational Development of Girls and Women |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022012638/http://www.education.nic.in/cd50years/s/3N/EP/3NEP0401.htm |archive-date=2011-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In western India, [[Jyotiba Phule]] and his wife [[Savitribai Phule]] became pioneers of female education when they started a school for girls in 1848 in Pune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cuhciewLjbUC&amp;q=phule+poona+bhide++girls+school&amp;pg=PP8|title=The sexual life of English : caste and desire in modern India|last1=Chandra|first1=Shefali|date=2012|publisher=Duke Univ.

With participation of like-minded social reformers like Ramgopal Ghosh, Raja Dakshinaranjan Mukherjee and Pandit Madan Mohan Tarkalankar, he established Calcutta's (now Kolkata) first school for girls in 1849 called the secular Native Female School, which later came to be known as Bethune School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bethunecollege.ac.in/BethuneCollege/BethuneCollege.htm | title=Bethune College, Kolkata : History | access-date=2023-11-03 | archive-date=2023-03-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230321133930/http://bethunecollege.ac.in/bethuneCollege/BethuneCollege.htm | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, Poromesh.

In 1878, the [[University of Calcutta]] became one of the first Indian universities to admit female graduates to its degree programmes, before any British universities would begin to do the same. This point was later raised during the controversy surrounding the 1883 [[Ilbert Bill]], a proposed legislation which would allow Indian judges to judge European offenders. The [[Anglo-Indian people|Anglo-Indian community in India]] largely opposed the bill, claiming that Indians (both male and female) were largely uneducated and thus unsuited to judging European offenders in court. Indian women who supported the bill responded by noting that they were more educated as a whole then the Anglo-Indian women who opposed the bill, pointing out that more women in India had gained [[academic degree]]s than those living in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Feminist Postcolonial Theory: A Reader|author1=Reina Lewis|author2-link=Sara Mills (linguist)|author2=Sara Mills|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-415-94275-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/feministpostcolo0000unse/page/451 451–3]|location=New York|author1-link=Reina Lewis|url=https://archive.org/details/feministpostcolo0000unse/page/451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Independent India======
[[File:Sacred Heart College.jpg|thumbnail|A girls' college in [[Palakkad]], India]]

After India attained independence in 1947, the University Education Commission was created to recommend suggestions to improve the quality of education. However, their report spoke against female education, referring to it as: "Women's present education is entirely irrelevant to the life they have to lead. It is not only a waste but often a definite disability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. P. Agrawal|author2=J. C.

However, the fact that the female literacy rate was at 8.9% post-Independence could not be ignored. Thus, in 1958, a national committee on women's education was appointed by the government, and most of its recommendations were accepted. The crux of its recommendations were to bring female education on the same footing as offered for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Soon afterwards, committees were created that talked about equality between men and women in the field of education. For example, one committee on differentiation of curriculum for boys and girls (1959) recommended equality and a common curricula at various stages of their learning. Further efforts were made to expand the education system, and the Education Commission was set up in 1964, which largely talked about female education, which recommended a national policy to be developed by the government. This occurred in 1968, providing increased emphasis on female education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwds.ac.in/OCPaper/Post-IndependenceEducational.pdf|title=Post- Independence Educational|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222012631/http://www.cwds.ac.in/OCPaper/Post-IndependenceEducational.pdf|archive-date=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Current policies======
Before and after Independence, India has been taking active steps towards women's status and education. The 86th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2001, has been a path breaking step towards the growth of education, especially for females. According to this act, elementary education is a fundamental right for children between the ages of 6 and 14. The government has undertaken to provide this education free of cost and make it compulsory for those in that age group. This undertaking is more widely known as [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] (SSA).

Since then, the SSA has come up with many schemes for inclusive as well as exclusive growth of Indian education as a whole, including schemes to help foster the growth of female education.

The major schemes are the following:

* Mahila Samakhya Program: This program was launched in 1988 as a result of the New Education Policy (1968). It was created for the empowerment of women from rural areas especially socially and economically marginalized groups. When the SSA was formed, it initially set up a committee to look into this programme, how it was working and recommend new changes that could be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya Scheme (KGBV): This scheme was launched in July, 2004, to provide education to girls at primary level. It is primarily for the underprivileged and rural areas where literacy level for females is very low. The schools that were set up have 100% reservation: 75% for backward class and 25% for BPL (below Poverty line) females.
* National Programme for Education of Girls at Elementary Level (NPEGEL): This programme was launched in July 2003. It was an incentive to reach out to the girls who the SSA was not able to reach through other schemes. The SSA called out to the "hardest to reach girls". This scheme has covered 24 states in India. Under the NPEGEL, "model schools" have been set up to provide better opportunities to girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable success came in 2013, when the first two girls ever scored in the top 10 ranks of the entrance exam to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-22/entrance-exams/40133825_1_jee-mains-jee-advanced-the-iits |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626012202/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-22/entrance-exams/40133825_1_jee-mains-jee-advanced-the-iits |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-06-26 |title=In a first, girls among IIT entrance test toppers |date=2013-06-22 |work=[[The Times of India]] |access-date=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sibbala Leena Madhuri ranked eighth, and Aditi Laddha ranked sixth.&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"/&gt;

In addition, the status and literacy rates between West Bengal and Mizoram were found to be profound; a study compared the two states as they took on politically different approaches to helping empower women (Ghosh, Chakravarti, &amp; Mansi, 2015).  In West Bengal, literacy rates were found to be low even after fulfilling the 73rd amendment from 1992.  The amendment established affirmative action by allotting 33% of seats at panchayats, or local self-governments, to women.  Mizoram chose not to partake in the 73rd Amendment but has seen greater literacy rates, it is second highest in the country, and also has a better sex ratio.  It was thus found that affirmative actions steps alone were not enough.  Women also need to be given the opportunity to develop through formal education to be empowered to serve and profit from holding these public leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Ratna|date=2015|title=Women's Empowerment and Education: Panchayats and Women's Self-Help Groups in India|journal=Policy Futures in Education|volume=13|issue=3|pages=294–314|doi=10.1177/1478210315571214|s2cid=146126795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Raising awareness ======
The Canadian start-up Decode Global has developed the mobile game ''[[Get Water!]]'', a game for social change focusing on the [[water scarcity in India]] and the effect it has on girls' education, especially in slums and rural areas. In areas with no ready access to water, girls are often pulled out of school to collect water for their families.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Jordan (2013-03-22). ''[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2013/03/22/a-touch-screen-game-that-wants-to-save-the-world/ A Touch-Screen Game That Wants to Save the World]'', Forbes. Retrieved 2014-03-31. Retrieved 2014-03-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Another step in this direction has been Shakti program started by Anandmurti Gurumaa where girls are trained in entrepreneurial skills for financial independence. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2016-02-17 |title='Education will give flight to girls': Anandmurti Gurumaa |language=en-IN |work=The Hindu |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/education-will-give-flight-to-girls-anandmurti-gurumaa/article8249133.ece |access-date=2023-10-17 |issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Iran=====
======Islamic Republic of Iran======
{{Further|Women in Iran}}
Since the 1979 revolution, Iran was under control of [[Islamic rules]], the progress of female education was affected by Islamic ecclesiocracy. Women are forced to wear [[veiling]] and are prevented from going to the same school as male students. Female students have to learn different versions of textbooks, which are special editions only for female students. Unmarried women are ineligible for financial aid if they attempt to study abroad. Throughout the past 30 years, the issue of female education has been constantly under debate.&lt;ref name=Mehran2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mehran |first1=Golnar |title='Doing and undoing gender': Female higher education in the Islamic Republic of Iran |journal=International Review of Education |date=November 2009 |volume=55 |issue=5–6 |pages=541–559 |doi=10.1007/s11159-009-9145-0 |bibcode=2009IREdu..55..541M |s2cid=144006744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian women do have desires and abilities to pursue further education. An Iranian high school student can earn a diploma after studying for three years. If students aim to enter colleges, they will stay in the high schools for the fourth year study, which has very intense study. According to researches, 42% of female students choose to have fourth year in the high school but only 28% of male students choose to study in order to enter university. Moreover, women have a much higher probability than men to pass college entrance exams. Islamic female are in need of achieving higher education and truth proved that their abilities are enough for getting higher education. The education opportunities for female need more national attention and less regulations.&lt;ref name=Mehran2009/&gt;

During 1978 and 1979, the proportion of women who participated in universities as students or faculties was rather low. 31% of students admitted to universities were women. For faculty gender composition, there are 14% female. This situation has changed with time passing by. University enrollment was decreased under the influence of [[Iranian Cultural Revolution]]. The general enrollment population declined during that time. After the cultural revolution, the amount of enrollment was going up. The increase in the number of university students is accompanied with an increase in female rate.&lt;ref name=Mehran2009/&gt;

Islamic higher education contains five levels: associate, bachelor's, master's, professional doctorate and specialized doctorate.&lt;ref name=Mehran2009/&gt; Before the revolution, the gender gap is obvious in master level and specialized doctorate, which are only 20% and 27%. It has changed after 30 years. In 2007, the female percent in master's degree rose up to 43% and for specialized doctorate degree, this data rose up to 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/6046/education-levels-nine-predominantly-islamic-countries.aspx |title=Education Levels: Nine Predominantly Islamic Countries |date=21 May 2002 |publisher=Gallup.com |access-date=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female rate has not only increased in the students but also in faculty. Twenty years ago, only 6% of all professors and 8% of all associated professors were women. Now 8% of all professors and 17% of all associated professors are female.&lt;ref name=Mehran2009/&gt;

======Literacy programs======

While formal education is prevalent amongst Iranian women, non-formal educational intuitions are an option as well. Non-formal education in the Islamic Republic of Iran originated from the Literary Movement Organization (LMO), which aspired to decrease illiteracy rates in the country. Established in 1984, LMO's tremendous efforts rectified the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] regime's neglect in regards to educating children and populations in rural areas. In the late 1980s, LMO created adult literacy programs, vocational-technical schools, and religious institutions to combat high illiteracy rates. Adult literacy programs teach introductory reading, writing, and math in two cycles. While reading, writing, dictation, and arithmetic are introduced in the first cycle, the second cycle delves into Islamic studies, experimental and social sciences, and the Persian language. Although these educational organizations are gender inclusive, they mainly cater to women; in fact, 71% of enrollees are women between the ages of 15 and 45. Throughout the 1990s, two-thirds of enrollees in literacy programs were women, which directly led to a dramatic rise (20%) in female literacy rates in Iran from 1987 to 1997.

======Religious schools======

Religious schools are another educational route for Iranian women. Their popularity is illustrated by the rise in the institution of "female seminaries" as of 2010. In 1984, Ayatollah Khomeini, former supreme leader of Iran, called for the creation of [[Jamiat al-Zahra|Jami‘at al-Zahra]], an alliance of smaller religious schools. This led to the creation of the first female seminary in Iran. These institutions offer the opportunity to earn anything from high school diplomas to doctoral degrees. The acceptance rate for women into these religious institutions was 28% in 2010 (7,000 accepted out of 25,000 applicants).

======Other educational routes======

Newlyweds (women specifically) are educated on family planning, safe sex, and birth control in population control programs. In addition, the government has established rural health houses managed by local health workers. These health professionals travel to different areas in order to impart information about women's health and birth control.

=====Saudi Arabia=====
Women in Saudi Arabia play an important role, and Women have a higher graduation rate from college than males do in 2023. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alhawsawi |first=Sajjadllah |last2=Jawhar |first2=Sabria Salama |date=2023-05-19 |title=Education, employment, and empowerment among Saudi women |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540253.2023.2189917 |journal=Gender and Education |language=en |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=401–419 |doi=10.1080/09540253.2023.2189917 |issn=0954-0253}}&lt;/ref&gt;Women receive free, widespread access to K-12, undergraduate, and graduate Education, including full-board scholarships to over 512 universities globally.  

Further, Saudi Arabia is currently implementing Vision 2030, one of the most strongest women empowerment cases in the 21st century.

[[Women in Islam]] played an important role in the foundations of many educational institutions, such as [[Fatima al-Fihri]]'s founding of the mosque of [[University of Al Karaouine|Al Karaouine]], from which in later centuries developed what some consider the oldest existing, continually operating educational institution in the world according to [[UNESCO]] and [[Guinness World Records]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/3000/oldest-university Oldest University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medina of Fez|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/170|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 859. This continued through to the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] in the 12th and 13th centuries, when 160 mosques (places of worship) and [[madrasas]] (places of education) were established in [[Damascus]], 26 of which were funded by women through the [[Waqf]] (charitable trust or trust law) system. Half of all the royal [[Patronage|patrons]] for these institutions were also women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2005|isbn=978-0-313-32270-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmedie00lind/page/197 197]|url=https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmedie00lind/page/197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sunni scholar [[Ibn Asakir]], in the 12th century, there were opportunities for female education in the [[Islamic Golden Age|mediaeval Islamic world]]. Asakir wrote that women should study, earn ''ijazahs'' (academic degrees), and qualify as [[Ulema|scholars]] and teachers. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2005|isbn=978-0-313-32270-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmedie00lind/page/196 196 &amp; 198]|url=https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmedie00lind/page/196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Asakir himself had studied under 80 different female teachers in his time. According to a hadith collected in the ''Saḥih'' of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|al-Bukhārī]], the women of [[Medina]] who aided [[Muhammad]] were notable for not letting social mores restrain their education in religious knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berkey|first1=Jonathan|title=The Transmission of Knowledge in Medieval Cairo: A Social History of Islamic Education|date=1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-03191-0|page=162|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1318410}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Further, In the 15th century, al-Sakhawi dedicated an entire volume of his biographical dictionary to female scholars, documenting information on 1,075 of them.

{{blockquote|text="How splendid were the women of the [[Ansar (Islam)|''anṣār'']]; shame did not prevent them from becoming learned [''yatafaqqahna''] in the faith."}}

While it was unusual for females to enroll as students in formal [[Class (education)|classes]], it was common for women to attend informal lectures and study sessions at mosques, madrasas, and other public places. While there were no legal restrictions on female education, some men, such as [[Moḥammed ibn al-Haj al-Abdari al-Fasi|Muhammad ibn al-Hajj]] (d. 1336), did not approve of this practice and were appalled at the behaviour of some women who informally audited lectures in his time.&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2005|isbn=978-0-313-32270-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmedie00lind/page/198 198]|url=https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmedie00lind/page/198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While women accounted for no more than one percent of Islamic scholars prior to the 12th century, there was a large increase of female scholars after this. In the 15th century, [[al-Sakhawi]] devoted an entire volume of his 12-volume biographical dictionary ''{{transliteration|ar|ALA|al-Ḍawʾ al-lāmiʻ}}'' to female scholars, giving information on 1,075 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Women in Iran from the Rise of Islam to 1800|last=Guity Nashat|first=Lois Beck|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-252-07121-8|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the scholar [[Mohammad Akram Nadwi]], currently a researcher from the [[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]], has written 40 volumes on the [[muhaddith|{{transliteration|ar|ALA|muḥaddithāt}}]] (the women scholars of [[hadith|{{transliteration|ar|ALA|ḥadīth}})]], ( a short introduction published named ''[[Al-Muhaddithat]]'') and found at least 8,000 of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Power |first1=Carla |author-link=Carla Power |title=A Secret History |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/magazine/25wwlnEssay.t.html |work=The New York Times |date=25 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Ancient period====
[[File:Herkulaneischer Meister 002.jpg|thumb|Portrait emphasizing the female subject's literacy, from [[Pompeii]], mid-1st century AD]]
In ancient Rome, [[nobiles|upper class]] women seem to have been well-educated, some highly so, and were sometimes praised by male historians of the time for their learning and cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, "The Roman Family," in ''The Family in Ancient Rome: New Perspectives'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), pp. 30, 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornelia Metella]], for instance, was distinguished for her knowledge of geometry, literature, music, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Pompey'' 55 LacusCurtius [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html#55 edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the wall paintings of Pompeii, women are more likely than men to be pictured with writing implements.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Zanker, ''The Mask of Socrates: The Image of the Intellectual in Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1995), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Some women had sufficient knowledge of Roman [[law]] and oratorical training to conduct court cases on their own behalf, or on behalf of others.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Bauman, ''Women and Politics in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 1992, 1994), p. 50 ''et passim'', citing a section from the historian Valerius Maximus that deals with women's abilities in the courtroom.&lt;/ref&gt; Among occupations that required education, women could be scribes and secretaries, [[calligraphy|calligraphers]],&lt;ref&gt;Beryl Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder,''Natural History'', 35.147, gives a list of female artists and their painters.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some and perhaps many Roman girls went to a [[ludus (ancient Rome)|ludus]]. Boys and girls were educated either together or with similar methods and curriculum. One passage in [[Livy]]'s history assumes that the daughter of a [[centurion]] would be in school; the social rank of a centurion was typically equivalent to modern perceptions of the "middle class".&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', pp. 197-198, citing also evidence from [[Ovid]] and [[Martial]].&lt;/ref&gt; Girls as well as boys participated in public [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]], and sang advanced choral compositions that would require formal musical training.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, ''Children and Childhood in Roman Italy'', p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medieval period====
[[File:Choir-of-Virgins---Benedictional-of-St-Aethelwold---c-9751-AD.jpg|thumb|right|Page from an illuminated manuscript from the late 10th century. The three nuns in front are all holding books, and the middle one appears to be teaching, gesturing to make a point.]]

Medieval education for females was typically tied to a convent. Research has uncovered that several early women educators were in charge of schools for girls:

'''[[Íte of Killeedy|St. Ita of Ireland]]'''—died 570 AD. Founder and teacher of a co-ed school for girls and boys at her monastery of Cell Ide. Several important saints studied under her, including [[Brendan the Navigator|St. Brendan the Navigator]].&lt;ref&gt;Schulenburg, Jane. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w8FMjgPTWBUC Forgetful of their Sex: Female Sanctity and Society, ca. 500-1100.] Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998. p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caesaria the Younger'''—died 550 AD. Successor to the sister of [[Caesarius of Arles|St. Caesarius]] and abbess of the convent he founded for her nuns, Caesaria the Younger continued the teaching of over a hundred women at the convent and aided in the copying and preservation of books.&lt;ref&gt;Schulenburg (1998), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. [[Hilda of Whitby]]'''—died 680 AD. Founder of the co-ed monastery of Whitby (men and women lived in separate houses), she established a center of education in her monastery similar to what was founded by the Frankish nuns. According to the Venerable Bede, "Her prudence was so great, that not only meaner men in their need, but sometimes even kings and princes, sought and received her counsel."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Book_IV_Chap_XXIII |title=Bede. Ecclesiastical History of England. Book IV, Chapter XXIII |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2011-12-17 |access-date=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St. Bertilla'''—died {{Circa|700 AD}}. Queen [[Bathild]] requested her services for the convent she had founded at Chelle. Her pupils founded convents in other parts of western Europe, including Saxony.&lt;ref&gt;Schulenburg (1998), p. 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Leoba|St. Leoba]]'''—died 782 AD. St. [[Boniface]] requested her presence on his mission to the Germans and while there she founded an influential convent and school.

[[Bede|St. Bede the Venerable]] reports that noble women were often sent to these schools for girls even if they did not intend to pursue the religious life,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38326/38326-h/38326-h.html#Book_III_Chap_VIII |title=Bede. Ecclesiastical History of England. Book III, Chapter VIII |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2011-12-17 |access-date=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and St. Aldhelm praised their curriculum for including grammar, poetry, and scriptural study.&lt;ref&gt;Schulenburg, Jane. Forgetful of their Sex: Female Sanctity and Society, ca. 500-1100. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998. p. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; The biography of Sts. Herlinda and Renilda also demonstrates that women in these convent schools could be trained in art and music.&lt;ref&gt;Schulenburg (1998), pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his reign, Emperor Charlemagne had his wife and daughters educated in the liberal arts at the Palace Academy of Aachen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/einhard.asp#Private%20Life%20(continued) |title=Einhard. Life of Charlemagne. Written before 840 AD. Chapter 19 |publisher=Fordham.edu |access-date=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which he is praised in the Vita Karolini Magni. There is evidence that other nobles had their daughters educated at the Palace Academy as well. In line with this, authors such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]] indicate that the daughters of the nobility were widely given to education so that they could satisfy the expectations of their future social positions.

During the late Middle Ages in England, a girl could receive an education in the home, in domestic service, in a classroom hosted in a royal or aristocratic household, or in a convent. There is some evidence of informal elementary schools in late medieval towns, where girls may have received some schooling from parish priests or clerks. Near the end of the Middle Ages, references to women as schoolteachers appear in some French and English records. The instruction of girls was usually oral, although instructors sometimes read texts aloud to girls until they could read on their own. Families with the status and financial means could send daughters to nunneries for education outside the home. There, they could encounter a wide range of reading material, including spiritual treatises, theological studies, lives of the fathers, histories, and other books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Megan |title=Women's Education and Literacy in England, 1066-1540 |journal=History of Education Quarterly |date=May 2021 |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=181–212 |doi=10.1017/heq.2021.8|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early modern period====
In 1237, [[Bettisia Gozzadini]] earned a law degree at the [[University of Bologna]], becoming the first woman to graduate university. In 1239 she taught there, becoming first woman believed to teach at a university.

In [[early modern]] Europe, the question of female education had become a commonplace one, in other words a [[literary topos]] for discussion. Around 1405 [[Leonardo Bruni]] wrote ''De studies et letteris'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/bruni.html |title=Online English text |publisher=History.hanover.edu |access-date=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed to Baptista di Montefeltro, the daughter of Antonio II da Montefeltro, [[Duke of Urbino]]; it commends the study of Latin, but warns against [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], [[astronomy]], and [[rhetoric]]. In discussing the classical scholar [[Isotta Nogarola]], however, [[Lisa Jardine]]&lt;ref&gt;''Women Humanists: Education for What?'', pp. 48-81 in ''Feminism and Renaissance Studies'' (1999), edited by [[Lorna Hudson]].&lt;/ref&gt; notes that (in the middle of the 15th century), {{" '}}Cultivation' is in order for a noblewoman; formal competence is positively unbecoming." [[Christine de Pisan]]'s ''Livre des Trois Vertus'' is contemporary with Bruni's book, and "sets down the things which a lady or baroness living on her estates ought to be able to do."&lt;ref&gt;[[Eileen Power]], ''The Position of Women'', p. 418, in ''The Legacy of the Middle Ages'' (1926), edited by [[G. C. Crump]] and [[E. F. Jacob]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1516 book ''[[Utopia (More book)|Utopia]]'', [[Thomas More]] advocated for women to have the right to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Real Wealth of Nations: Creating a Caring Economics|author=Riane Eisler|date=2007|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erasmus]] wrote at length about education in ''De pueris instituendis'' (1529, written two decades before); not mostly concerned with female education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sowards |first1=J. K. |title=Erasmus and the Education of Women |journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal |date=1982 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=77–89 |doi=10.2307/2540011 |jstor=2540011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in this work he does mention with approbation the trouble Thomas More took with teaching his whole family.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Erasmus Reader'' (1990), edited by Erika Rummel, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine of Aragon]] "had been born and reared in one of the most brilliant and enlightened of European courts, where the cultural equality of men and women was normal".&lt;ref&gt;Morris Marples, ''Princes in the Making: A Study of Royal Education'' (1965), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; By her influence, she made education for English women both popular and fashionable. In 1523, [[Juan Luis Vives]], a follower of Erasmus, wrote in Latin his ''[[De institutione feminae Christianae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaufman |first1=Gloria |title=Juan Luis Vives on the Education of Women |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |date=July 1978 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=891–896 |doi=10.1086/493546 |id={{ProQuest|1300108426}} |jstor=3173122 |s2cid=144998348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was commissioned by Catherine, who had charge of the education of her daughter for the future [[Queen Mary I of England]]; in translation it appeared as ''Education of a Christian Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;Translated in 1524, by [[Richard Hyrde]]; [http://www.valpo.edu/english/emtexts/vives1.html excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625163032/http://www.valpo.edu/english/emtexts/vives1.html |date=2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in line with traditional [[didactic literature]], taking a strongly religious direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibe.unesco.org/publications/ThinkersPdf/vivese.pdf PDF] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042008/http://www.ibe.unesco.org/publications/ThinkersPdf/vivese.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It also placed a strong emphasis on Latin literature.&lt;ref&gt;Marples, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Comenius]] was an advocate of formal education for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About John Amos Comenius|url=http://www.comeniusfoundation.org/comenius.htm|website=Comenius Foundation|access-date=22 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015013145/http://www.comeniusfoundation.org/comenius.htm|archive-date=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact his emphasis was on a type of universal education making no distinction between humans; with an important component allowed to parental input, he advocated in his ''Pampaedia'' schooling rather than other forms of tutoring, for all.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Murphy, ''Comenius: A Critical Reassessment of his Life and Works'' (1995), Chapter IV, ''The Comenian Vision of Universal Education''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reformation]] prompted the establishment of compulsory education for boys and girls. Most important was [[Martin Luther]]'s text 'An die Ratsherren aller Städte deutschen Landes' (1524), with the call for establishing schools for both girls and boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=LmOsRpe0nC0C |page=70 |title=Luther deutsch }}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially the Protestant South-West of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with cities like [[Strassburg]], became pioneers in educational questions. Under the influence of Strasbourg in 1592, the German Duchy Pfalz-Zweibrücken became the first territory of the world with compulsory education for girls and boys.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Sehling (ed.), Die evangelischen Kirchenordnungen des 16. Jahrhunderts. Vol 18: Rheinland-Pfalz I. Tübingen 2006, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth I of England]] had a strong humanist education, and was praised by her tutor [[Roger Ascham]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Charleton, ''Education in Renaissance England'' (1965), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; She fits the pattern of education for leadership, rather than for the generality of women. When [[Johannes Sturm]] published Latin correspondence with Ascham centred on the achievements in humanist study of Elizabeth and other high-ranking English persons, in [[Konrad Heresbach]]'s ''De laudibus Graecarum literarum oratio'' (1551), the emphasis was on the nobility of those tackling the classics, rather than gender.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence V. Ryan, ''Roger Ascham'' (1963) p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern period====
[[File:Nikolaj Alexandrowitsch Jaroschenko - Girl student.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A student of the [[Bestuzhev Courses]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], 1880]]
The issue of female education in the large, as emancipatory and rational, is broached seriously in [[the Enlightenment]]. [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], who worked as a teacher, governess, and school-owner, wrote of it in those terms. Her first book was ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'', years before the publication of ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''.

{{blockquote|The historian, [[Hannah Lawrance]] (1795–1875), played an important role in nineteenth-century public debate about women's education. Like [[Catharine Macaulay]] and Mary Wollstonecraft, she argued that virtue had no sex and she promoted the broad education of women in order to increase their opportunities for employment. But unlike her [[bluestocking]] predecessors, she derived her argument from a scholarly reappraisal of women's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dabby, Benjamin|title=Hannah Lawrance and the claims of women's history in nineteenth-century England|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=53|issue=3|year=2010|pages=699–722|doi=10.1017/S0018246X10000257|s2cid=154800326}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first state-financed higher education institution for women in Europe, {{interlanguage link|Smolny Institute for Noble Maidens|ru|Смольный институт благородных девиц}}, was established by [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1764. The [[Commission of National Education]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], founded in 1777, considered the first [[Ministry of Education]] in history, was a central, autonomous body responsible for nationwide, secular and coeducational training. In the late 19th century, in what was then the Russian province of [[Poland]], in response to the lack of higher training for women, the so-called [[Flying University]] was organized, where women were taught covertly by Polish scholars and academics. Its most famous student was [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]], better known as Marie Curie, who went on to win two [[Nobel Prizes]].

Much education was channelled through religious establishments. Not all of these educated women only for marriage and motherhood; for example, [[Quaker views on women]] had allowed much equality from the foundation of the denomination in the mid-17th century. The [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] [[William Allen (English Quaker)|William Allen]] and his wife [[Grizell Hoare]] set up the [[Newington Academy for Girls]] in 1824, teaching an unusually wide range of subjects from languages to sciences.

[[File:Elementary education of Bosnian women in 1948.jpg|thumb|Bosnian Muslim and Christian women learning to read and write in 1948]]

Actual progress in institutional terms, for secular education of women, began in the West in the 19th century, with the founding of colleges offering single-sex education to young women. These appeared in the middle of the century. ''The Princess: A Medley'', a [[narrative poem]] by [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], is a satire of women's education, still a controversial subject in 1848, when [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] first opened in London. [[Emily Davies]] campaigned for women's education in the 1860s, and founded [[Girton College]] in 1869, as did [[Anne Clough]] found [[Newnham College]] in 1875. Progress was gradual, and often depended on individual efforts—for example, those of [[Frances Lupton]], which led to the founding of the [[Leeds Girls' High School]] in 1876. [[W. S. Gilbert]] parodied Tennyson's poem and treated the themes of women's higher education and [[feminism]] in general with ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]'' in 1870 and ''[[Princess Ida]]'' in 1883.

Once women began to graduate from institutions of higher education, there steadily developed also a stronger academic stream of schooling, and the [[teacher training]] of women in larger numbers, principally to provide primary education. Women's access to traditionally all-male institutions took several generations to become complete.

====Educational reform====
[[Image:Mary Lyon ivory miniature cropped.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Mary Lyon]] (1797–1849) founded the first woman's college in the United States.]]

The interrelated themes of barriers to education and employment continued to form the backbone of feminist thought in the 19th century, as described, for instance, by [[Harriet Martineau]] in her 1859 article "Female Industry" in the ''[[Edinburgh Journal]]''. Despite the changes in the economy, the position of women in society had not greatly improved and, unlike [[Frances Power Cobbe]], Martineau did not support the emerging call for the vote for practical reasons.

Slowly the efforts of women like Emily Davies and [[English Woman's Journal#Like-minded women|the Langham group]] (under [[Barbara Bodichon|Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon]]) started to make inroads. [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] (1848) and [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]] (1849) in London started to offer some education to women, and by 1862 Davies was establishing a committee to persuade the universities to allow women to sit for the recently established (1858) [[UCLES|Cambridge Local Examinations]], with partial success (1865). A year later she published ''The Higher Education of Women.'' She and Bodichon founded the first higher educational institution for women, with five students, which became [[Girton College, Cambridge]] in 1873, followed by [[Somerville College]] and [[Lady Margaret Hall]] at Oxford in 1879. Bedford had started awarding degrees the previous year. Despite these measurable advances, few could take advantage of them and life for women students was very difficult.

As part of the continuing dialogue between British and American feminists, [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]], the first woman in the U.S. to graduate in medicine (1849), lectured in Britain with Langham support. They also supported [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson|Elizabeth Garrett's]] attempts to assail the walls of British medical education against strong opposition; she eventually took her degree in France. Garrett's successful campaign to run for office on the [[London School Board]] in 1870 is another example of how a small band of determined women were starting to reach positions of influence at the level of local government and public bodies.

====By country====

=====Denmark=====
Girls were included as pupils in the first attempt of a public elementary school system in 1739, though this attempt was not fully realized until 1814.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Inger Dübeck: Kvinders retlige stilling. I Den Store Danske. Hentet 7. october 2015&lt;/ref&gt; From the foundation of the [[J. Cl. Todes Døtreskole]] in the 1780s, schools for secondary education for females were established in the capital of Copenhagen, though female teachers were only allowed to teach girls or very small boys.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  One of the first schools for females of any note was the ''[[Døtreskolen af 1791]]'', and in the 1840s, schools for girls spread outside the capital and a net of secondary education girl schools was established in Denmark. The first college for women, the teachers seminary [[Den højere Dannelsesanstalt for Damer]], was opened in 1846.&lt;ref name="Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon"&gt;Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1875, women were given access to university education.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=====Finland=====
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, private schools for girls were established in Finland; among the better known were those of [[Christina Krook]], [[Anna Salmberg]] and [[Sara Wacklin]], preferred by those who did not wish to send their daughters to schools in Sweden. The private girls' schools were, however, criticized for shallow education of accomplishments, which resulted in girls' education being included in the school reform of 1843. The following year, two Swedish-language state schools for girls was founded in Turku and Helsinki: ''[[Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Åbo]]'' and ''[[Svenska fruntimmersskolan i Helsingfors]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Siegberg, Arthur: Den högre kvinnobildningen i Finland, dess utveckling och mål., W. C. Fabritius &amp; Sonner, Kr.a.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the establishment of a net of girls' schools of a similar kind in Finland. At first these schools were reserved for girls from upper-class families. 
 
At this time it was not possible for the girls to pass the baccalaureate and move on to university studies. In 1865, a grammar school made it clear that only girls whose upbringing and manners were impeccable, whose company could not be considered detrimental to others, and who were from "respectable" families could be in that school.

After the first woman in Finland, [[Maria Tschetschulin]], was accepted as a university student by dispensation in 1870, advanced classes and college classes were included in many girls' schools to prepare students for university (by means of dispensation). In 1872, the demand that all students must be members of the Swedish-speaking upper classes was dropped. Women were given the right to teach in grammar schools for girls in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.helsinki.fi/sukupuolentutkimus/aanioikeus/en/articles/path.htm|title = The path of Finnish women towards liberty and education|website = Centenary of Women's full political rights in Finland|last = Tuomaala|first = Saara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====France=====

As was normal in Catholic countries in Europe, girls were normally educated in convent schools for girls operated by nuns, such as [[Abbaye de Penthemont]] in Paris. A rare exception was [[Maison royale de Saint-Louis]], founded by [[Madame de Maintenon]] in 1684. After the [[French revolution]], [[girls' school]]s became more common, often operated by governesses—a famous pioneer school being that of [[Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan]].

France formally included girls in the state elementary education school system in 1836, but girls and boys were only integrated in the lower levels; the secondary education of girls was entrusted to girls' schools managed by nuns or governesses, who lacked necessary qualifications.&lt;ref name="ref_1"&gt;William Fortescue, ''The Third Republic in France 1870–1940: Conflicts and Continuities''&lt;/ref&gt; When women were formally allowed to attend university in France in 1861, for them to qualify was often difficult due to the poor quality of their secondary education. When the problem of unqualified female teachers in girls' secondary education was addressed by a state teacher's seminary for women as well as state secondary education for girls, both of these were still gender segregated.&lt;ref name="ref_1"/&gt; The French school system was not desegregated on the middle secondary education level until the 20th century.

=====Germany=====

Germany was a pioneer in the education of girls. Beginning in the 17th century, schools for girls were opened in both Catholic Southern Germany as well as Protestant Northern Germany.&lt;ref name="James C. Albisetti"/&gt; In Catholic Germany, the Catholic Ursuline and Elisabeth sisters established first elementary education schools for poor children and orphans and eventually (before 1750), also a type of secondary education girls' schools for wealthy girls called "daughters institutes", which were essentially finishing schools.&lt;ref name="James C. Albisetti"&gt;James C. Albisetti: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FggABAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=August+Hermann+Francke+girls%27+school&amp;pg=PA25 Schooling German Girls and Women]''&lt;/ref&gt; In Protestant Germany, the great Pietist school innovator [[August Hermann Francke]] of Halle founded Gynaeceum, the first girls' school or 'Mädchenschule' in 1698.&lt;ref name="James C. Albisetti"/&gt; The Gynaeceum was followed by many Pietist girls schools in Germany, notably the Magdalenenstift in Altenburg and Johann Julius Hecker's Royal Elisabeth School in Berlin in 1747.&lt;ref name="James C. Albisetti"/&gt;

In the 18th century, it became common with so called {{Lang|de|Töchterschulen}} ('daughters' schools') in German cities, supported by the merchant class who wished for their daughters to be given elementary schooling, as well as girls' schools known as ''{{Lang|de|Mädchenpensionate}}'', essentially finishing schools for upper class daughters.&lt;ref name="James C. Albisetti"/&gt; In the early 19th century, girls' secondary schools known as {{Lang|de|höhere Töchterschulen}} ('daughters' high schools') became common; in many German cities later in the century, these schools were given government support, became public and had their education adjusted to become equivalents of boys' high schools.&lt;ref name="James C. Albisetti"/&gt; In 1908, women were allowed to attend university; in the 20th century, the public secondary education system was integrated.&lt;ref name="James C. Albisetti"/&gt;

===== Ireland =====
Religion and cultural traditions had an influence on education for both girls and boys in the education system.

Schools in Ireland taught more than academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Fuchs |first1=Rachel G. |title=women in nineteenth century Europe |last2=Thompson |first2=Victoria E. |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |year=2005 |location=New York |pages=90 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; They taught about social practices such as manners and conversation skills. Other skills that could help create "proper" adults.&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, Mary and O’Neill, Ciaran. ''Education and Empowerment: Cosmopolitan Education and Irish Women in the Early nineteenth Century.'' Oxford. Vol.30 (1), p.93-109, (Wiley Subscription Services, Inc, 2018), 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, most schools aimed their female education to help reinforce women's values and proper education for the future mothers of the generation while limiting their educational opportunities compared to their male classmates.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Linda L. ''Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe''. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 160-161.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1830s in Ireland, there was an introduction of a [[Education in the Republic of Ireland|national education system]] to educate the classes who could not afford proper education. Therefore, more schools were built to house incoming students of all social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Myrtle and Pollock, Vivienne. ''Women of Ireland, Image and experience c. 1880-1920'' (Belfrast, Ireland: The Blackstaff Press Limited, 1999), 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to superintendents, there was poor student attendance amongst the children due to their chores, illness, bad weather, or the lack of clothing.&lt;ref name="Hill 1999"&gt;Hill, Myrtle and Pollock, Vivienne. ''Women of Ireland, Image and experience c. 1880-1920'' (Belfrast, Ireland: The Blackstaff Press Limited, 1999), 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Most girls in Irish schools had multiple absences and were the majority of the statistic in school due to duties at home.&lt;ref name="Hill 1999"/&gt;

Most girls had to leave school early or be home after school to look after the house and their siblings.&lt;ref name="Hill 1999"/&gt; This would often be overlooked due to the impression that boys' education was more important than their female classmates.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Myrtle and Pollock, Vivienne. ''Women of Ireland, Image and experience c. 1880-1920'' (Belfrast, Ireland: The Blackstaff Press Limited, 1999), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1892, school attendance was made mandatory for students.&lt;ref&gt;Clear, Caitriona. ''Social change and everyday life in Ireland, 1850-1922.'' (Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 2007), 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls could attend a fee-paying school in Ireland from the ages of 7/8 to 17/18 years of age,&lt;ref name="Clear, Caitriona 1922"&gt;Clear, Caitriona. ''Social change and everyday life in Ireland, 1850-1922.'' (Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 2007), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; although, since education can be expensive, they most often put the boys in school, with the impression that they would need it more.&lt;ref name="Clear, Caitriona 1922"/&gt;

By the second half of the 19th century, female students were criticized for learning other skills, such as artistic skills like the piano and painting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;Clear, Caitriona. ''Social change and everyday life in Ireland, 1850-1922.'' (Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 2007), 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the education was often poor, some schools, such as [[Protestantism|the Protestant]] and [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholics]] schools, had the opportunity to teach more of the present-day academics, such as math.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

Girls from urban families with parents who did not know how to read or write, still were taught religion and skills of the family trade.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, G. Rachel and Thompson, E. Victoria.  ''women in nineteenth century Europe'' (New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2005), 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some families relied on private, in-home education through tutors or siblings. This form of education was usually expensive, and therefore, only middle to upper-classed families could afford it.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Linda L. ''Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe''. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Russia=====

By the time of the [[Reforms of Peter the Great]] in the 18th century, women's education in Russia was almost non existent, and even noblewomen were often illiterate.  With the exceptions of some smaller private schools in the Western European foreign colony of St Petersburg, women's education in Russian started when empress [[Catherine the Great]] opened the pioneering state girls' schools [[Smolny Institute]] in St Petersburg in 1764 and [[Novodevichii Institute]] in Moscow in 1765.&lt;ref name="Bisha, Robin (2002)"&gt;Bisha, Robin (2002). Russian Women, 1698-1917 Experience and Expression: An Anthology of Sources. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of these schools were very high even for Western European standards, and they became a role model for later girls' schools in Russia. The were followed by both private girls' schools as well as by state schools who allowed girls in the lower classes, and in 1792, there were 302 state schools in European Russia with 17,178 pupils, 1,178 of whom were girls.&lt;ref name="Barbara Evans Clements"&gt;:''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qWE8iQyGLSEC&amp;dq=russia+women%27s+education+girls%27+school&amp;pg=PA64 A History of Women in Russia: From Earliest Times to the Present]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The state schools however only allowed girls in the elementary education classes, not on the secondary education lewel, and the majority of the private girls' schools gave a shallow education of accomplishments with focus on becoming a wife and mother or, if they failed in marrying, a seamstress or governess.&lt;ref name="Barbara Evans Clements" /&gt;

In the 1850s the women's movement started in Russia, which were firstly focused on charity for working-class women and greater access to education for upper- and middle-class women, and they were successful since male intellectuals agreed that there was a need for secondary education for women, and that the existing girls' schools were shallow.&lt;ref name="Christine Johanson"&gt;Christine Johanson:''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B_BfKgWKDy8C&amp;q=russia+women%27s+education+girls%27+school]''&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1857 public secondary education girls' schools, called lyceum or girls' gymnasiums (as the equivalent to the state gymnasium's for boys), were opened in Russia. The Russian school regulation for state secondary girls' schools of 1860 stated that in contrast to state secondary boys' school, which were to prepare students for university, girls were foremost to be educated to become wives and mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Regulations on Women’s Schools of the Ministry of National Education, 1860, May 10. In Memorial Book of the Ministry of National Education for 1865, Saint Petersburg: Rogalskiy &amp; Co PrintingHouse, pp: 135-139&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the abolition of serfdom in Russia in 1861, village folk schools were established for the peasantry where boys and girls were given elementary education together as children, but until the [[Russian revolution]] the law mandated that secondary education was always to be gender-segregated in accordance with the school regulation of 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Regulations on Women’s Gymnasiums and Progymnasiums of the Ministry of National Education, (1870). Date Views 22.04.2016 iknigi.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were allowed to attend lectures at the university in 1861, but were banned again when they attempted to enroll as students in 1863. When this resulted in women studying in Western Europe (mainly Switzerland), the [[Guerrier Courses]] opened in Moscow in 1872 and the [[Bestuzhev Courses]] in St Petersburg in 1878: however they did not issue formal degrees, and women were not allowed to attend university until 1905.&lt;ref name="Norma Noonan Corigliano, Norma C. Noonan, Carol Nechemias"&gt;Norma Noonan Corigliano, Norma C. Noonan, Carol Nechemias: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qk-ICsx5L90C&amp;dq=women+encyclopedia&amp;pg=PA1 Encyclopedia of Russian Women's Movements]''&lt;/ref&gt; After the Russian revolution of 1917, men and women were given equal access to education on all levels.

=====Sweden=====

Around 1800, girls' middle-secondary schools begun to appear, and become more common during the 19th century. By the mid-1970s, most of them had been scrapped and replaced with [[mixed-sex education|coeducation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/12/94/34/1994d30d.pdf|title=Flickor och pojkar i skolan - hur jämställt är det?|publisher=Government of Sweden|language=sv|page=140|date=2009|access-date=29 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915155300/http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/12/94/34/1994d30d.pdf|archive-date=2011-09-15|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By a law from the 1570s ([[1571 års kyrkoordning]]), girls as well as boys were expected to be given elementary schooling. The establishment for girls' schools was left to each city's own authorities, and no school for girls were founded until the [[Rudbeckii flickskola]] in 1632, and that school was to be an isolated example. However, schools for boys did accept female students at the lowest lewels and occasionally even at high levels: Ursula Agricola and [[Maria Jonae Palmgren]] were accepted at Visingsö [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in 1644 and 1645 respectively, and [[Aurora Liljenroth]] graduated from the same school in 1788.

During the 18th century, many girls' schools were established, referred to as ''Mamsellskola'' ([[Mamsell]] School) or ''Franskpension'' (French Pension).&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"&gt;[[Gunhild Kyle]] (1972). Svensk flickskola under 1800-talet. Göteborg: Kvinnohistoriskt arkiv. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt; These schools could normally be classified as [[finishing school]]s, with only a shallow education of polite conversation in French, embroidery, piano playing and other accomplishments, and the purpose was only to give the students a suitable minimum education to be a lady, a wife and a mother.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt;

In the first half of the 19th century, a growing discontent over the shallow education of women eventually resulted in the finishing schools being gradually replaced by girls' schools with a higher level of academic secondary education, called "Higher Girl Schools", in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt; At the time of the introduction of the compulsory [[elementary school]] for both sexes in Sweden in 1842, only five schools in Sweden provided academic secondary education to females: the [[Societetsskolan]] (1786), [[Fruntimmersföreningens flickskola]] (1815) and [[Kjellbergska flickskolan]] (1833) in [[Gothenburg]], [[Askersunds flickskola]] (1812) in [[Askersund]], and [[Wallinska skolan]] (1831) in Stockholm.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt;

During the second half of the 19th century, there were secondary education girl schools in most Swedish cities.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt; All of these were private, with the exception of the [[women's college]] ''[[Högre lärarinneseminariet]]'' in Stockholm from 1861, and its adjacent girls' school ''Statens normalskola för flickor''.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt;  The [[Girls' School Committee of 1866]] organized the regulation of girls' schools and female education in Sweden: from 1870, some girls' schools were given the right to offer the Gymnasium level to their students, and from 1874, those girls' schools which met the demands were given governmental support and some were given the right to administer the school leaving exam.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt;  This was necessary to make it possible for women to enroll at the universities, which had been opened to women in 1870, as female students were not accepted in the same middle schools as male students.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt;

Between 1904 and 1909, girls were integrated in state boys' schools on the secondary lewels, which made it possible for girls to complete their elementary and middle lewel education in a state school instead of having to go to an expensive private girls' school.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt;  Finally in 1927, all state [[secondary school]]s for boys were integrated, and the private girls' schools started to be transformed into co-educational schools, a process which was completed by 1970.&lt;ref name="Gunhild Kyle 1972"/&gt;

==Catholic tradition==
In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition, concern for female education has expressed itself from the days of the [[Catechetical School of Alexandria]], which in the 200s AD had courses for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesaria. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm Ecclesiastical History, Book VI], Chapter VIII, Paragraph I. Written before 340 AD&lt;/ref&gt; Later Church writers such as St. [[Ambrose]], St. [[Augustine]], and St. [[Jerome]] all left letters of instruction{{Clarify|reason=what is a "letter of instruction"?|date=April 2021}} for women in [[convent]]s that they either founded or supported. In the Middle Ages, several [[religious institute]]s were established with ministries addressing women's education. For medieval examples of convent schools, which are one form of such institutions, see the examples at [[#Medieval period|the section on the medieval period]]. In the early modern period, this tradition was continued with the [[Ursulines]] (1535) and the [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary]] (1849).&lt;ref&gt;Others are [[Society of the Holy Child Jesus]], the [[Sisters of St. Joseph]], [[Sisters of the Holy of Jesus and Mary]], [[School Sisters of Notre Dame]], [[Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur]], [[Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco]].&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary convent schools are usually not restricted to Catholic pupils. Students in contemporary convent education may be boys (particularly in India).
