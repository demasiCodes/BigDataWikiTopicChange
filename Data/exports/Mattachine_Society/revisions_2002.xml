It was founded in the [[City of New York]] in [[1955]] by [[Harry Hay]], but was not incorporated until [[1961]]. Several other related organizations were formed shortly afterward in [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Philadelphia]].

It was named after [[Mattacino]] (or the Anglicized Mattachino), a character in (Venetian?) Italian theater. Mattacino was a kind of court [[jester]], who would speak the truth to the King when nobody else would.

Mattachine's goal was to provide a variety of services to the gay community, including referral services for legal and other professionals, and counselling. They also lobbied for the repeal of sodomy laws and other laws gay people considered discriminatory.

It was associated with other groups in ECHO ([[East Coast Homophile Organizations]]).

During the [[1960s]], Mattachine was one of the foremost gay rights groups in the United States. Following the [[Stonewall riots]] of [[1969]], it became increasingly to be seen as too stodgy and traditional, and not willing enough to be confrontational. It lost support, and fell prey to infighting. Eventually it closed due to impending bankruptcy, and was disbanded in January of [[1987]].</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
