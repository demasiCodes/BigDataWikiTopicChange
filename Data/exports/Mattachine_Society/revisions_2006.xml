The '''Mattachine Society''' was the earliest [[homophile]] organization in the [[United States]]. It was not the first organization in America to deal with the issue of [[gay rights]].

== Founding ==

The organization was founded by [[Harry Hay]] along with a small group of friends. The group first met in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], on November 11, [[1950]], with Harry, [[Rudi Gernreich]], Bob Hull, Chuck Rowland, and Dale Jennings in attendance, but was not incorporated until [[1954]] when a different group assumed leadership positions.

Several other related organizations were formed shortly afterward in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[New York City, New York|New York City]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].  The primary goal of the society was to engender public acceptance of [[homosexuality]] — they wrote in their manifesto that homosexuals' "physiological and psychological handicaps need be no deterrent in integrating 10 percent of the world's population towards the constructive social progress of mankind."

== Naming ==

The Mattachine Society was named by Harry Hay, inspired by a French medieval and renaissance [[masque]] group he had studied while preparing a course on the history of popular music for a workers' education project. In a 1976 interview with Jonathan Ned Katz, Hay was asked the origin of the name Mattachine. He mentioned the medieval-Renaissance French Sociétés Joyeux: 

:"One [[masque]] group was known as the 'Société Mattachine.' These societies, lifelong secret fraternities of unmarried townsmen who never performed in public unmasked, were dedicated to going out into the countryside and conducting dances and rituals during the Feast of Fools, at the Vernal Equinox. Sometimes these dance rituals, or masques, were peasant protests against oppression — with the maskers, in the people’s name, receiving the brunt of a given lord’s vicious retaliation. So we took the name Mattachine because we felt that we 1950s Gays were also a masked people, unknown and anonymous, who might become engaged in morale building and helping ourselves and others, through struggle, to move toward total redress and change." 

This French group was named in turn after [[Mattacino]] (or the Anglicized Mattachino), a character in Italian theater.  Mattacino was a kind of court [[jester]], who would speak the truth to the king when nobody else would.  The "mattachin" (from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''mutawajjihin'' — "mask-wearers") were originally [[Moorish]] (Hispano-Arab) sword-dancers who wore elaborate, colorful costumes and masks. 

The Mattachine Society used so-called [[harlequin]] diamonds as their [[emblem]]. The design consisted of four diamonds arranged in a pattern to form a larger diamond.

== Affiliations ==

Most of the Mattachine founders were affiliated with [[Communism]] and based the organization on the cell structure of the [[Communist Party USA]] (i.e. [[democratic centralism]]).  As the [[Red Scare]] progressed, the association with communism concerned some members as well as supporters and Hay, a dedicated member of the communist party for 15 years, stepped down as the society's leader.  Others were similarly ousted, and the leadership structure became influenced less by communism, more by a [[moderate]] [[ideology]] similar to that espoused by the liberal reformist [[civil rights]] organizations that existed for [[African Americans]].

Although Harry Hay claimed "never to have even heard" of the earlier gay liberation struggle in [[Germany]] - by the people around [[Adolf Brand]], [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and [[Leontine Sagan]] - he is known to have talked about it with German emigrés in America, including Rudi Gernreich.

The Mattachine Society existed as a single national organization headquartered first in Los Angeles and then, beginning around 1956, in San Francisco. Outside of Los Angeles and San Francisco, chapters were established in New York, Washington DC, Chicago, and other locales. Due to internal in-fighting, the national organization disbanded in 1961. The San Francisco national chapter retained the name "Mattachine Society," while the New York chapter became "Mattachine Society of New York, Inc.". 

A largely amicable split within the Society in 1952 resulted in a new organization called [[ONE, Inc.]].  ONE admitted women, and together with Mattachine, provided vital help to the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] in the launching of Bilitis' magazine ''The Ladder: A Lesbian Review'' in [[1956]].  The Daughters of Bilitis was the counterpart lesbian organization to the Mattachine Society, and the two organizations worked together on some campaigns, although their approaches to visibility in the mass media differed considerably. Under a different leadership, however, the Daughters of Bilitis came under attack in the early 1970s for "siding" with Mattachine rather than with the new separatist [[feminist]] organizations. Also in the 1960s, The Mattachine Society New York was associated with other groups in ECHO ([[East Coast Homophile Organizations]]). 

== Goals ==
The Mattachine Society's goal was to liberate the oppressed homosexual community and provide a variety of services to the gay community, including referral services for legal and other professionals, and counseling.  They also lobbied for the repeal of [[sodomy law]]s and other laws that are discriminatory toward gay people.  It published ''The Mattachine Review''.

== Decline ==

During the [[1960s]], the various unaffiliated Mattachine Societies, especially the Mattachine Society in San Francisco and the Mattachine Society New York were the foremost gay rights groups in the United States, but beginning in the middle 1960s and, especially, following the [[Stonewall riots]] of [[1969]], they began increasingly to be seen as stodgy and traditional and not willing enough to be confrontational.  Like the divide that occurred within the black civil rights movement, the late 1960s and the 1970s brought a new generation of activists who felt that the gay rights movement needed to endorse a larger and more radical agenda to address other forms of oppression, the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[sexual revolution]].  Many of the various, unaffiliated entities that went under the auspices "Mattachine Society" eventually lost support and fell prey to infighting; for example, due to impending [[bankruptcy]], The Mattachine Society New York was disbanded in January of [[1987]].

Unrelated to the earlier iterations of the Mattachine Society, a group reorganized under the name [http://www.xanga.com/themattachinesociety Mattachine Society] in Shreveport, LA in 2005.
