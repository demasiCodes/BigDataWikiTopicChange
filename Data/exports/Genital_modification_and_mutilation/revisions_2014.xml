Some forms of genital alteration are performed at the behest of an adult, with their informed consent. Other forms are performed on people who do not give informed consent, including infants or children. Any of these procedures may be considered modifications or mutilations by different groups of people.

== Body modification ==
{{main|Body modification}}
Many types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons. [[Penile subincision]], or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of [[Indigenous Australian]]s.  This procedure has taken root in [[Western culture|Western]] [[body modification]] culture. [[Meatotomy]] is a form that involves splitting of the [[glans penis]] alone, while [[genital bisection]] is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.
[[File:Merrill Labia and clit by Tommy T.jpg|thumb|upright|Contemporary female genital piercings: [[Clitoral hood piercing]] and [[labia piercing]]]]
[[Genital piercing]]s and [[genital tattooing]] may be performed for aesthetic reasons, but piercings have the benefit of increasing [[Human sexuality|sexual]] [[pleasure]] for the pierced individual or their [[sex partner]]s.&lt;ref name="expressmilwaukee"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-7386-penises-piercings-and-pleasure.html |title=Penises, Piercings and Pleasure |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Pearling (body modification)|Pearling]] involves surgical insertion of small, inert spheres under the skin along the shaft of the penis for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to the walls of the vagina.

[[Clitoris enlargement]] may be achieved temporarily through the use of a [[clitoral pump]], or it may be achieved permanently through application of [[testosterone]] cream to the clitoris, or through injectable testosterone.  [[Penis enlargement]] is a term for various techniques used to attempt to increase the size of the penis, though the safety and efficacy of these techniques are debated.

==Voluntary sex reassignment==
{{main|Sex reassignment surgery}}
People who are [[transgender]] may undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]] in order to modify their bodies to match their [[gender identity]]. Not all [[transgender]] people elect to have these surgeries, but those who do usually see an improvement in their sexual lives as well as their mental and emotional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Cuypere, G., T’Sjoen, G., Beerten, R., Selvaggi, G., Sutter, P., Hoebeke, P., Monstrey, S., Vansteenwegen, A., &amp; Rubens, R.

''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 34(6), 679-690. {{DOI|10.1007/s10508-005-7926-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the surgical procedures are [[breast augmentation]] and [[vaginoplasty]] for [[trans women]] and [[mastectomy]], [[metoidioplasty]], and [[phalloplasty]] for [[trans men]]. [[Trans women]] may also benefit from hair removal and facial feminization surgery while some [[trans men]] may have liposuction to remove fat deposits around their hips and thighs.

==Involuntary sex assignment==
{{Main|Sex assignment|Intersex surgery}}
[[Intersex]] children and children with ambiguous genitalia may be subjected to genital surgeries to "normalize" the appearance of the genitalia. These surgeries are usually performed for cosmetic benefit rather than for therapeutic benefits. Most surgeries involving children with ambiguous genitalia are sexually damaging and may render them [[infertile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/node/97 ISNA's Amicus Brief on Intersex Genital Surgery] [[Intersex Society of North America|The Intersex Society of North America]], Dated February 7, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in cases involving male children with [[micropenis]], doctors may recommend the child be reassigned as female.&lt;ref&gt;Karen S Vogt, MD, Michael J Bourgeois, MD, Arlan L Rosenbloom, MD, Mary L Windle, PharmD, George.

In some cases, a child's gender may be reassigned due to genital injury. There have been at least seven cases of healthy male infants being reassigned as female due to [[circumcision]] damaging their penises beyond repair,&lt;ref&gt;Gearhart JP, Rock JA.

==In disease or medical necessity==
If the genitals become diseased, as in the case of [[cancer]], sometimes the diseased areas are surgically removed.  Biological females may undergo [[vaginectomy]], while males may undergo [[penectomy]].  [[Reconstructive surgery]] may be performed to restore what was lost, often with techniques similar to those used in [[sex reassignment surgery]].

Similarly, during [[childbirth]], [[episiotomy]] is sometimes performed to increase the amount of space through which the baby may emerge.  Advocates of [[natural childbirth]] and [[unassisted birth]] state that this intervention is often performed without medical necessity, with significant damage to the person giving birth.

[[Hymenotomy]] is the surgical perforation of an [[imperforate hymen]].  It may be performed to allow [[menstruation]] to occur.  An adult individual may opt for increasing the size of her hymenal opening, or removal of the hymen altogether, to facilitate [[sexual penetration]] of her vagina.

==Self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation==
{{main|Skoptic syndrome|Self-mutilation}}
A person may engage in self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation such as [[castration]], [[penectomy]], or [[clitoridectomy]]. The motivation behind such actions vary widely; it may be done due to [[skoptic syndrome]], personal crisis related to [[gender identity]], [[mental illness]], [[self-mutilation]], [[body dysmorphia]], or social reasons.

==Female genitals==
{{category see also|Female genital modification}}
Cosmetic surgery of female genitalia, known as '''elective genitoplasty''', has become pejoratively known as '''designer vagina'''. In May 2007, an article published in the British Medical Journal strongly criticised the "designer vagina" craze, citing its popularity being rooted in commercial and media influences.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite news | last=Bourke |first=Emily | title = Designer vagina craze worries doctors| publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date = 2009-11-12| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/12/2741446.htm?site=local| accessdate = 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Liao | first = Lih Mei|author2=Sarah M Creighton| title = Requests for cosmetic genitoplasty: how should healthcare providers respond?| journal = BMJ| volume = 334| issue = 7603 | pages = 1090–1092| publisher = [[British Medical Journal]]| date = 2007-05-26| url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/334/7603/1090| doi = 10.1136/bmj.39206.422269.BE| accessdate = 2007-05-29| pmid = 17525451 | pmc = 1877941}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar concerns have been expressed in Australia.&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;

===Female genital mutilation===

{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), female circumcision, or female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), refers to "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external [[human female genitalia|female genitalia]] or other surgery of the female [[sex organ|genital organs]] whether for [[culture|cultural]], [[religion|religious]] or other non-therapeutic reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not the same as the procedures used in [[Sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment surgery]] or the [[genital modification]] of [[intersexual]]s. It is practiced in several parts of the world, but the practice is concentrated more heavily in [[Africa]], and parts of the [[Middle East]], and some other parts of Asia. Over 125 million women and girls have experienced FGM in the 29 countries in which it is concentrated.&lt;ref name=125million&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&amp;nbsp;22: "More than 125 million girls and women alive today have been cut in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where FGM/C is concentrated.&lt;p&gt;

The number of girls and women who have been cut was calculated using 2011 demographic figures produced by the UN Population Division&amp;nbsp;... The number of cut women aged 50 and older is based on FGM/C prevalence in women aged 45 to 49."&lt;/ref&gt; Over eight million have been [[infibulation|infibulated]], a practice found largely in Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan.&lt;ref name=Yoder2008p13&gt;P.&amp;nbsp;Stanley Yoder, Shane Khan, [http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/WP39/WP39.pdf "Numbers of women circumcised in Africa: The Production of a Total"], USAID, DHS Working Papers, No. 39, March 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–14: "Infibulation is practiced largely in countries located in northeastern Africa: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan.

In the past several decades, efforts have been made by global health organizations, such as the WHO, to end the practice. However, because of its importance in [[tradition]]al life, it continues to be practiced in many societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nthWORD Magazine |url=http://www.nthword.com/issue5/Interview_Liz_Canner_Orgasm_Inc.php |title=nthWORD Magazine Interview with Liz Canner, filmmaker of Orgasm, Inc |publisher=Nthword.com |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymenorrhaphy===
[[Hymenorrhaphy]] refers to the practice of thickening the hymen, or, in some cases, implanting a capsule of red liquid within the newly created vaginal tissue.  The newly created hymen is created to cause physical resistance, blood, or the appearance of blood, at the time that the individual's new husband inserts his penis into her vagina.  This is done in cultures where a high value is placed on female [[virginity]] at the time of marriage. In these cultures, a woman may be punished, perhaps violently, if the community leaders deem that she was not virginal at the time of [[consummate|consummation]] of her marriage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Individuals who are victims of [[rape]], who were virginal at the time of their rape, may elect for hymenorrhaphy.

===Labia stretching===
[[Labia stretching]] is the act of elongating the ''[[labia minora]]'' through manual manipulation (pulling) or physical equipment (such as weights).&lt;ref name=Rwanda&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/97388.php], "Rwandan Women View The Elongation Of Their Labia As Positive", retrieved on 2008-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement&gt;[http://www.sexylabia.com/labia-enlargement1.htm], "Enlarging Your Labia", retrieved on 2008-06-22&lt;/ref&gt; It is a familial cultural practice in [[Rwanda]],&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt; common in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/hrp/progress/67.pdf], "Sexual health--a new focus for WHO", page 6, retrieved on 2008-06-19&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[body modification]] practice elsewhere.&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt; It is performed for [[Human sexuality|sexual]] enhancement of both partners, [[aesthetics]], [[symmetry]] and [[gratification]].&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt;

===Labiaplasty and vaginoplasty===
[[File:Nach der Entfernung der inneren Schamlippen 1.jpg|thumb|100px|Vulva with ''labia minora'' surgically removed]]
Some women undergo [[vaginoplasty]] or [[labiaplasty]] procedures to alter the shape of their [[vulva]]s to meet personal [[aesthetic]] standards.&lt;ref name="The Perfect Vagina Documentary"&gt;[http://documentarystorm.com/sexuality/the-perfect-vagina/ The Perfect Vagina Documentary] Retrieved {{Nowrap|13 February 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery itself is controversial, and critics refer to the procedures as "designer vagina".&lt;ref&gt;Green, Fiona: "From clitoridectomies to 'designer vaginas': The medical construction of heteronormative female bodies and sexuality through female genital cutting." ''Sexualities, Evolution &amp; Gender'' 7(2):153-187, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Essen, B &amp; Johnsdotter, S: "Female Genital Mutilation in the West: Traditional Circumcision versus Genital Cosmetic Surgery".

''Sexualities'' 8(4):407-424, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article Designer Vaginas by Simone Weil Davis, she talks about the modification of woman’s vagina and the outside influences women are pressured with, which can cause them to feel shame towards their [[labia minora]]. She states that the media such as pornography is creating an unhealthy view of what a “good looking vagina” is and  how women feel that their privates are inferior and are therefore pressured to act upon that mindset. These insecurities are forced upon women by their partners and other women as well.  Davis states, "These days, in part because of the video dissemination and the mainstreaming of pornography, women . . . can see the vaginas of a lot of different other women.” (271). If a woman does wish to change their vagains they’ll have to be economically stable to do so. Davis goes on to include a quote from The Los Angeles Times’ interview with plastic surgeon Dr. David Matlock, of the influence of pornography on his patients seeking [[labiaplasty]]. Matlock states, “Women are coming in saying, I want something different, I want to change things. They look at Playboy, the ideal women perse, for the body and the shape and so on. You don’t see women in there with excessively long labia minora” (270). This can relate to the idea of Cycle of Socialization; Which is  how our surroundings can define our personalities, and our “norms” as well as our decisions, actions, and the people we turn out to be. What are the outside factors that are influencing women to believe that they should have those kind of vaginas and what are influencing men as well to believe that those are inferior vaginas? The article also mentions  the practice of African [[Female Genital Mutilation]].  Davis states “Although consent is at the heart of the issue of genital operations on children, a topic both urgent and not to be downplayed, we must also look at the social and cultural means whereby consent is manufactured, regardless of age, in the West as well as in African and  other countries engaging in FGOs.” (273). This is an important point, because in both cases women and children are looking to be accepted as normal, to conform to the societal norms.

===Clitoral hood reduction ===
[[Clitoral hood reduction]], also termed '''clitoral hoodectomy''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1586/17474108.4.2.101 Gynecological cosmetic surgery: Expert Rev. Obstet.

When performed with the consent of the adult individual, it can be considered an [[Elective surgery|elective]] [[plastic surgery]] procedure for reducing the size and the area of the [[clitoral hood]] (prepuce) in order to further expose the [[clitoral glans]] of the [[clitoris]]; the therapeutic goal is thought to improve the sexual functioning of the woman, and the aesthetic appeal of her [[vulva]]. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a [[labiaplasty]] procedure for reducing the [[labia minora]]; and occasionally within a [[vaginoplasty]] procedure. When these procedures are performed on individuals without their consent, they are considered a form of [[female genital mutilation]].

==Male genitals==
{{category see also|Male genital modification}}

===Castration===
{{Main|Castration}}
&lt;!-- [[File:William III of Sicily 15.jpg|thumb|100px|The torture of William III of Sicily]] --&gt;
Castration in the genital modification and mutilation context involves the amputation of the [[testicles]]. Sometimes the term (meaning "cutting") is also used to refer to penis removal, but that is less common.

===Circumcision===
[[File:Global_Map_of_Male_Circumcision_Prevalence_at_Country_Level.png|thumb|right||250 px|Prevalence of male circumcision by country]]
{{Main|Circumcision}}
Male [[circumcision]] is the removal of part or all of the [[foreskin]]. It is a procedure usually performed for [[religious male circumcision|religious]], cultural or medical reasons, and leaves some or all of the glans permanently exposed. The age at which circumcision may be performed varies widely, with Americans and religious groups such as [[Muslims]] and [[Jews]] typically circumcising in the [[neonatal]] period, and [[Filipinos]] and African tribes such as the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] circumcising in teenage years as an initiation into adulthood.

In modern medicine, circumcision may be used as treatment for severe [[phimosis]] or recurrent [[balanitis]]. Advocacy is often centered around [[preventive medicine]] while opposition is often centered around [[human rights]] (particularly the [[bodily integrity]] of the infant when circumcision is performed in the neonatal period) and the potentially harmful side effects of the procedure.&lt;ref name="Svoboda2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Svoboda|first=J.

The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that roughly 30% of the world's men are circumcised, the majority being Muslims.&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf| title = Male circumcision: Global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety and acceptability| accessdate = 2009-03-04| year = 2007| publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreskin restoration===
{{Main|Foreskin restoration}}
Foreskin restoration is the partial recreation of the [[foreskin]] after its removal by [[circumcision]]. Surgical restoration involves grafting skin taken from the [[scrotum]] onto a portion of the penile shaft. Nonsurgical methods involve [[tissue expansion]] by stretching the penile skin forward over the [[glans penis]] with the aid of [[tension (physics)|tension]]. Nonsurgical restoration is the preferred method as it is less costly and typically yields better results than surgical restoration. A foreskin restoration device may be of help to men pursuing nonsurgical foreskin restoration. While restoration cannot recreate the nerves or tissues lost to circumcision, it can recreate the appearance and some of the function of a natural foreskin.

===Infibulation===
{{Main|Infibulation}}
&lt;!-- [[Image:Anacreon infibulated.jpg|thumb|100px|The Greek poet [[Anacreon]] (582 BCE – 485 BCE), showing [[kynodesme|''kynodesmē'']]]] --&gt;
Infibulation of males involves [[suturing]] the foreskin together over the [[glans penis|head of the penis]]. In [[ancient Greece]], public performers practiced a nonsurgical form of infibulation by wearing a [[kynodesme]]. In modern times, male infibulation may be performed for personal preferences or as part of [[BDSM]].

===Pearling===
{{Main|Pearling (body modification)}}
Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitals—of the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of partners during vaginal or anal intercourse.

===Penectomy===
{{Main|Penectomy}}
[[File:partial penectomy.jpg|thumb|100px|Genital area of male after partial penectomy.]]
[[Penis removal]] involves the amputation of [[human penis|penis]]. Sometimes, the removal of the entire penis was done in conjunction with [[castration]], or alternatively referred to as castration. Removing the penis was often performed on [[eunuchs]] and high ranking men who would frequently be in contact with women, such as those belonging to a [[harem]]. The [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] of India may remove their penis as an expression of their [[gender identity]]. In the medical field, removal of the penis may be performed for reasons of [[gangrene]] or [[cancer]]. Penis removal may occur through unintentional genital injury.

Penis removal for purposes of assault or revenge is overwhelmingly a female-on-male crime, particularly in [[Thailand]]. [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbit]] infamously removed her husband's penis in 1993. In cases of accidental removal, it may be possible to reattach the penis.

===Penile subincision===
{{Main|Penile subincision}}

Penile subincision is a form of genital modification involves a [[urethrotomy]] and vertically slitting the underside of the penis from the [[meatus]] towards to the base. It is performed by people of many cultures, such as the [[Indigenous Australians]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrente]], the [[Luritja]], the [[Samburu people|Samburu]], the [[Samoans]], and the [[Native Hawaiians]]. It may also be performed for personal preference. Penile subincision may leave a man with an increased risk of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], issues with fertility (due to lack of control over what direction the sperm goes after [[ejaculation]]), and may require a man to sit down while [[urination|urinating]].&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Meatotomy&lt;/ref&gt; When the surgery is not performed in a hospital or by a licensed medical professional, complications such as infection, [[exsanguination]], or permanent damage are major concerns.

{{Main|Dorsal slit}}

A dorsal slit (also known as superincision) is an incision made along the upper length of the foreskin with the intention to expose the [[glans penis]] without removing skin or tissue. It may be performed as a part of traditional customs, such as those in the [[Pacific Islands]] and the [[Philippines]]. In the medical field, it may be performed for as an alternative to [[circumcision]] when circumcision is undesired or impractical. It remains a rare surgery and practice overall.
