Some forms of genital alteration are performed at the behest of an adult, with their informed consent. Other forms are performed on people who do not give informed consent, including infants or children. Any of these procedures may be considered modifications or mutilations by different groups of people.

== Body modification ==
{{main|Body modification}}
Many types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons. [[Penile subincision]], or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of [[Indigenous Australian]]s.  This procedure has taken root in [[Western culture|Western]] [[body modification]] culture. [[Meatotomy]] is a form that involves splitting of the [[glans penis]] alone, while [[genital bisection]] is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.
[[File:Merrill Labia and clit by Tommy T.jpg|thumb|upright|Contemporary female genital piercings: [[Clitoral hood piercing]] and [[labia piercing]]]]
[[Genital piercing]]s and [[genital tattooing]] may be performed for aesthetic reasons, but piercings have the benefit of increasing [[Human sexuality|sexual]] [[pleasure]] for the pierced individual or their [[sex partner]]s.&lt;ref name="expressmilwaukee"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-7386-penises-piercings-and-pleasure.html |title=Penises, Piercings and Pleasure |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Pearling (body modification)|Pearling]] involves surgical insertion of small, inert spheres under the skin along the shaft of the penis for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to the walls of the vagina.

[[Clitoris enlargement]] may be achieved temporarily through the use of a [[clitoral pump]], or it may be achieved permanently through application of [[testosterone]] cream to the clitoris, or through injectable testosterone.  [[Penis enlargement]] is a term for various techniques used to attempt to increase the size of the penis, though the safety and efficacy of these techniques are debated.

==Voluntary sex reassignment==
{{main|Sex reassignment surgery}}
People who are [[transgender]] may undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]] in order to modify their bodies to match their [[gender identity]]. Not all [[transgender]] people elect to have these surgeries, but those who do usually see an improvement in their sexual lives as well as their mental and emotional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Cuypere, G., T’Sjoen, G., Beerten, R., Selvaggi, G., Sutter, P., Hoebeke, P., Monstrey, S., Vansteenwegen, A., &amp; Rubens, R. (2005). Sexual and physical health after sex reassignment surgery. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 34(6), 679-690. doi:10.1007/s10508-005-7926-5&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the surgical procedures are [[breast augmentation]] and [[vaginoplasty]] for [[transwomen]] and [[mastectomy]], [[metoidioplasty]], and [[phalloplasty]] for [[transmen]]. [[Transwomen]] may also benefit from hair removal and facial feminization surgery while some [[transmen]] may have liposuction to remove fat deposits around their hips and thighs.

[[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]], a [[third gender]] found in the [[Indian subcontinent]], may opt to undergo [[castration]].&lt;ref&gt;Serena Nanda, "Neither Man nor Woman: The Hijras of India" Published 1999, Wadsworth Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involuntary sex assignment==
{{Main|Sex assignment|Intersex surgery}}
[[Intersex]] children and children with ambiguous genitalia may be subjected to genital surgeries to "normalize" the appearance of the genitalia. These surgeries are usually performed for cosmetic benefit rather than for therapeutic benefits. Most surgeries involving children with ambiguous genitalia are sexually damaging and may render them [[infertile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/node/97 ISNA's Amicus Brief on Intersex Genital Surgery] [[Intersex Society of North America|The Intersex Society of North America]], Dated February 7, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in cases involving male children with [[micropenis]], doctors may recommend the child be reassigned as female.&lt;ref&gt;Karen S Vogt, MD, Michael J Bourgeois, MD, Arlan L Rosenbloom, MD, Mary L Windle, PharmD, George. P Chrousos, MD, FAAP, MACP, MACE, FRCP, Merrily P M Poth, MD, Stephen Kemp, MD, PhD [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/923178-overview#a0199 Microphallus: Epidemiology] [[Medscape]], Updated August 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intersex Society of North America]] (ISNA) objects to elective surgeries performed on people without their informed consent on grounds that such surgeries subject patients to unnecessary harm and risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/faq/surgery What's ISNA's position on surgery?] - [[Intersex Society of North America|The Intersex Society of North America]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a child's gender may be reassigned due to genital injury. There have been at least seven cases of healthy male infants being reassigned as female due to [[circumcision]] damaging their penises beyond repair,&lt;ref&gt;Gearhart JP, Rock JA.

Atlanta Constitution, Tuesday, March 12, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; including the late [[David Reimer]] (born Bruce Reimer, later Brenda Reimer), who was the subject of [[John Money|John Money's]] John/Joan case, an unnamed American child, who was awarded $750,000 by Judge [[Walter McGovern]] of the [[Federal District Court]] after a military doctor was found guilty of [[medical malpractice]] in 1975, and an unnamed child who was circumcised at [[Northside Hospital]], who received an undisclosed amount of money from the hospital.

==In disease or medical necessity==
If the genitals become diseased, as in the case of [[cancer]], sometimes the diseased areas are surgically removed.  Biological females may undergo [[vaginectomy]], while males may undergo [[penectomy]].  [[Reconstructive surgery]] may be performed to restore what was lost, often with techniques similar to those used in [[sex reassignment surgery]].  

Similarly, during [[childbirth]], [[episiotomy]] is sometimes performed to increase the amount of space through which the baby may emerge.  Advocates of [[natural childbirth]] and [[unassisted birth]] state that this intervention is often performed without medical necessity, with significant damage to the person giving birth. 

[[Hymenotomy]] is the surgical perforation of an [[imperforate hymen]].  It may be performed to allow [[menstruation]] to occur.  An adult individual may opt for increasing the size of her hymenal opening, or removal of the hymen altogether, to facilitate [[sexual penetration]] of her vagina.

==Self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation==
{{main|Skoptic syndrome|Self-mutilation}}
A person may engage in self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation such as [[castration]], [[penectomy]], or [[clitoridectomy]]. The motivation behind such actions vary widely; it may be done due to [[skoptic syndrome]], personal crisis related to [[gender identity]], [[mental illness]], [[self-mutilation]], [[body dysmorphia]], or social reasons.

==Female genitals==
{{see also category|Female genital modification}}
Cosmetic surgery of female genitalia, known as '''elective genitoplasty''', has become pejoratively known as '''designer vagina'''. In May 2007, an article published in the British Medical Journal strongly criticised the "designer vagina" craze, citing its popularity being rooted in commercial and media influences.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite news | last=Bourke |first=Emily | title = Designer vagina craze worries doctors| publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date = 2009-11-12| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/12/2741446.htm?site=local| accessdate = 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Liao | first = Lih Mei| coauthors = Sarah M Creighton| title = Requests for cosmetic genitoplasty: how should healthcare providers respond?| journal = BMJ| volume = 334| issue = 7603 | pages = 1090–1092| publisher = [[British Medical Journal]]| date = 2007-05-26| url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/334/7603/1090| doi = 10.1136/bmj.39206.422269.BE| accessdate = 2007-05-29| pmid = 17525451 | pmc = 1877941}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar concerns have been expressed in Australia.&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;

===Female genital mutilation===
{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), female circumcision, or female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), refers to "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external [[human female genitalia|female genitalia]] or other surgery of the female [[sex organ|genital organs]] whether for [[culture|cultural]], [[religion|religious]] or other non-therapeutic reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not the same as the procedures used in [[Sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment surgery]] or the [[genital modification]] of [[intersexual]]s. It is practiced throughout the world, but the practice is concentrated more heavily in [[Africa]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[Middle East]]. There is much controversy surrounding [[infibulation]] procedures, due to concerns regarding the safety and consequences of the procedure.  In the past several decades, efforts have been made by global health organizations, such as the WHO, to end the practice. However, because of its importance in [[tradition]]al life, it continues to be practiced in many societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nthWORD Magazine |url=http://www.nthword.com/issue5/Interview_Liz_Canner_Orgasm_Inc.php |title=nthWORD Magazine Interview with Liz Canner, filmmaker of Orgasm, Inc |publisher=Nthword.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymenorrhaphy===
[[Hymenorrhaphy]] refers to the practice of thickening the hymen, or, in some cases, implanting a capsule of red liquid within the newly created vaginal tissue.  The newly created hymen is created to cause physical resistance, blood, or the appearance of blood, at the time that the individual's new husband inserts his penis into her vagina.  This is done in cultures where a high value is placed on female [[virginity]] at the time of marriage. In these cultures, a woman may be punished, perhaps violently, if the community leaders deem that she was not virginal at the time of [[consummate|consummation]] of her marriage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Individuals who are victims of [[rape]], who were virginal at the time of their rape, may elect for hymenorrhaphy.

===Labia stretching===
[[Labia stretching]] is the act of elongating the ''[[labia minora]]'' through manual manipulation (pulling) or physical equipment (such as weights).&lt;ref name=Rwanda&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/97388.php], "Rwandan Women View The Elongation Of Their Labia As Positive", retrieved on 2008-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement&gt;[http://www.sexylabia.com/labia-enlargement1.htm], "Enlarging Your Labia", retrieved on 2008-06-22&lt;/ref&gt; It is a familial cultural practice in [[Rwanda]],&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt; common in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/hrp/progress/67.pdf], "Sexual health--a new focus for WHO", page 6, retrieved on 2008-06-19&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[body modification]] practice elsewhere.&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt; It is performed for [[Human sexuality|sexual]] enhancement of both partners, [[aesthetics]], [[symmetry]] and [[gratification]].&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt;

===Labiaplasty and Vaginoplasty===
[[File:Nach der Entfernung der inneren Schamlippen 1.jpg|thumb|100px|Vulva with ''labia minora'' surgically removed]]
Some women undergo [[vaginoplasty]] or [[labiaplasty]] procedures to alter the shape of their [[vulva]]s to meet personal [[aesthetic]] standards.&lt;ref name="The Perfect Vagina Documentary"&gt;[http://documentarystorm.com/sexuality/the-perfect-vagina/ The Perfect Vagina Documentary] Retrieved {{Nowrap|13 February 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery itself is controversial, and critics refer to the procedures as "designer vagina".&lt;ref&gt;Green, Fiona: "From clitoridectomies to 'designer vaginas': The medical construction of heteronormative female bodies and sexuality through female genital cutting."

===Clitoral hood reduction ===
[[Clitoral hood reduction]], also termed '''clitoral hoodectomy''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1586/17474108.4.2.101 Gynecological cosmetic surgery: Expert Rev. Obstet.

Published in Volume: 27 Issue 1: March 18, 2011: "Clitoral phimosis is seldom reported. It is treated by '''hoodectomy''' or [[dorsal slit]]."&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Elective surgery|elective]] [[plastic surgery]] procedure for reducing the size and the area of the [[clitoral hood]] (prepuce) in order to further expose the [[clitoral glans]] of the [[clitoris]]; the therapeutic goal is to improve the sexual functioning of the woman, and the aesthetic refinement of her [[vulva]]. It is a form of hoodplasty. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a [[labiaplasty]] procedure for reducing the [[labia minora]]; and occasionally within a [[vaginoplasty]] procedure.

==Male genitals==
{{see also category|Male genital modification}}
===Castration===
{{Main|Castration}}
&lt;!-- [[File:William III of Sicily 15.jpg|thumb|100px|The torture of William III of Sicily]] --&gt;
Castration in the genital modification and mutilation context involves the amputation of the [[testicles]]. Sometimes the term (meaning "cutting") is also used to refer to penis removal, but that is less common. In [[Greek mythology]], [[Cronus]] severed [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]' testicles through castration and threw them into the sea, causing the goddess [[Aphrodite]] to rise from the foam.

===Circumcision===
{{Main|Circumcision}}
Male [[circumcision]] is the removal of the [[foreskin]], usually for [[religious male circumcision|religious]], cultural or medical reasons and leaves a [[circumcision scar]]. The [[frenectomy|removal of the frenulum]] may be performed at the same time. The age at which circumcision may be performed varies widely, with groups such as [[Americans]] and [[Jews]] typically circumcising in the [[neonatal]] period and African tribes such as the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] circumcising in teenage years as initiation into adulthood. In modern medicine, circumcision may be used as treatment for severe [[phimosis]] or recurrent [[balanitis]]. Advocacy is often centered around [[preventive medicine]] while opposition is often centered around [[human rights]] and the potentially harmful side effects. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that roughly 30% of the world's men are circumcised.&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf| title = Male circumcision: Global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety and acceptability| accessdate = 2009-03-04| year = 2007| publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreskin restoration===
{{Main|Foreskin restoration}}
Foreskin restoration is the partial recreation of the [[foreskin]] after its removal by [[circumcision]]. Surgical restoration involves grafting skin taken from the [[scrotum]] onto a portion of the penile shaft. Nonsurgical methods involve [[tissue expansion]] by stretching the penile skin forward over the [[glans penis]] with the aid of [[tension (physics)|tension]]. Nonsurgical restoration is the preferred method as it is less costly and typically yields better results than surgical restoration. A foreskin restoration device may be of help to men pursuing nonsurgical foreskin restoration. While restoration cannot recreate the nerves or tissues lost to circumcision, it can recreate the appearance and some of the function of a natural foreskin.

===Infibulation===
{{Main|Infibulation}}
&lt;!-- [[Image:Anacreon infibulated.jpg|thumb|100px|The Greek poet [[Anacreon]] (582 BCE – 485 BCE), showing [[kynodesme|''kynodesmē'']]]] --&gt;
Infibulation of males involves [[suturing]] the foreskin together over the [[glans penis|head of the penis]]. In [[ancient Greece]], public performers practiced a nonsurgical form of infibulation by wearing a [[kynodesme]]. In modern times, male infibulation may be performed for personal preferences or as part of [[BDSM]].

===Pearling===
{{Main|Pearling (body modification)}}
Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitals—of the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of partners during vaginal or anal intercourse.

===Penectomy===
{{Main|Penectomy}}
[[File:partial penectomy.jpg|thumb|100px|Genital area of male after partial penectomy.]]
[[Penis removal]] involves the amputation of [[human penis|penis]]. Sometimes, the removal of the entire penis was done in conjunction with [[castration]], or alternatively referred to as castration. Removing the penis was often performed on [[eunuchs]] and high ranking men who would frequently be in contact with women, such as those belonging to a [[harem]]. The [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] of India may remove their penis as a part of their [[gender identity]]. In the medical field, removal of the penis may be performed for reasons of [[gangrene]] or [[cancer]]. Penis removal may occur through unintentional genital injury.

Penis removal for purposes of assault or revenge is overwhelmingly a female-on-male crime, particularly in [[Thailand]]. [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbit]] famously removed her husband's penis in 1993. In cases of accidental removal, the penis may be able to be reattached.

===Penile subincision===
{{Main|Penile subincision}}
[[File:Full subincision.jpg|thumb|100px|upright|Penile subincision]]
Penile subincision is a form of genital modification involves a [[urethrotomy]] and vertically slitting the underside of the penis from the [[meatus]] towards to the base. It is performed by people of many cultures, such as the [[Indigenous Australians]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrente]], the [[Luritja]], the [[Samburu people|Samburu]], the [[Samoans]], and the [[Native Hawaiians]]. It may also be performed for personal preference. Penile subincision may leave a man with an increased risk of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], issues with fertility (due to lack of control over what direction the sperm goes after [[ejaculation]]), and will require a man to sit down while [[urination|urinating]]. As the surgery is not performed in a hospital or by a licensed medical professional, complications such as infection, [[exsanguination]], or permanent damage are major concerns.

=== Penile superincision ===
{{Main|Dorsal slit}}

A dorsal slit (also known as superincision) is an incision made along the upper length of the foreskin with the intention to expose the [[glans penis]] without removing skin or tissue. It may be performed as a part of traditional customs, such as those in the [[Pacific Islands]] and the [[Philippines]]. In the medical field, it may be performed for as an alternative to [[circumcision]] when circumcision is undesired or impractical. It remains a rare surgery and practice overall.
