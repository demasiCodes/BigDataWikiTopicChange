'''Genital modifications''' are forms of [[Body modification|body modifications]] applied to the [[human sex organs|human sexual organs]], such as [[Genital piercing|piercings]], [[circumcision]], or [[labiaplasty]].  

'''Genital mutilations''' are alterations that involve horrendous damage to an [[Human sexuality|individual's sexual life]], such as [[clitoridectomy]]. 

== Reasons ==
=== Body modification ===
{{main|Body modification}}
Many types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons.

[[Penile subincision]], or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of [[Indigenous Australian]]s. This procedure has taken root in Western [[body modification]] culture, the [[modern primitive]]s. [[Meatotomy]] is a form that involves splitting of the [[glans penis]] alone, while bisection is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.

[[Genital piercing]]s and [[genital tattooing]] may be performed for aesthetic reasons, but piercings can have the benefit of increasing [[sexual pleasure]] for the pierced individual or their [[sex partner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Neluis T., Armstrong M.

Similarly, [[Pearling (body modification)|pearling]] involves surgical insertion of small, inert spheres under the skin along the shaft of the penis for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to the walls of the vagina. Similar to tattooing, [[scarification|genital scarification]] is primarily done for aesthetic reasons by adding cosmetic scars to the skin. The genital decoration by scars is an ancient tradition in many cultures, both for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Angulo J.

[[Clitoris enlargement]] may be achieved temporarily through the use of a [[clitoral pump]], or it may be achieved permanently through the [[Testosterone (medication)|application or injection of testosterone]]. [[Penis enlargement]] is a term for various techniques used to attempt to increase the size of the penis, though the safety and efficacy of these techniques are debated.

=== Intersex ===
{{Main|Sex assignment|Intersex surgery}}
[[Intersex]] children and children with ambiguous genitalia may be subjected to surgeries to "normalize" the appearance of their genitalia. 

These surgeries are usually performed for cosmetic benefit rather than for therapeutic reasons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"David Reimer, 38, Subject of the John/Joan Case" [[New York Times|The New York Times]], New York, US, Published May 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Most surgeries involving children with ambiguous genitalia are sexually damaging and may render them [[infertile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/node/97 ISNA's Amicus Brief on Intersex Genital Surgery] [[Intersex Society of North America|The Intersex Society of North America]], Dated February 7, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in cases involving male children with [[micropenis]], doctors may recommend the child be reassigned as female.&lt;ref&gt;Karen S Vogt, MD, Michael J Bourgeois, MD, Arlan L Rosenbloom, MD, Mary L Windle, PharmD, George.

===Sex-reassignment surgery===
{{main|Sex reassignment surgery}}
People who are [[transgender]] may undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]] to alter their bodies to match their [[gender identity]]. Not all transgender people elect to have these surgeries. 

Some of the surgical procedures are [[breast augmentation]], [[vaginoplasty]] (creation of a vagina), and [[vulvoplasty]] (creation of a vulva) for [[trans women]] and [[mastectomy]] (breast removal), [[metoidioplasty]] (elongation of the clitoris), [[phalloplasty]] (creation of a penis), and [[scrotoplasty]] for [[trans men]]. Trans women may also benefit from [[hair removal]] and [[facial feminization surgery]], while some trans men may have [[liposuction]] to remove fat deposits around their hips and thighs.{{cn|date=April 2022}} [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]], a [[third gender]] found in the [[Indian subcontinent]], may opt to undergo [[castration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Serena|last=Nanda|author-link=Serena Nanda|title=Neither Man nor Woman: the Hijras of India|year=1999|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|place=Belmont, CA|edition=2nd|isbn=9780534509033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a child's gender may be reassigned due to [[genital injury]], including [[David Reimer]], who was the subject of [[John Money]]'s John/Joan case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gearhart JP, Rock JA |year=1989 |title=Total ablation of the penis after circumcision with electrocautery: a method of management and long-term followup |journal=J Urol |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=799–801 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5347(17)38893-6 |pmid=2769863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As treatment===
If the genitals become diseased, as in the case of cancer, sometimes the diseased areas are surgically removed. Females may undergo [[vaginectomy]] or [[vulvectomy]] (to the vagina and vulva, respectively), while males may undergo [[penectomy]] or [[orchiectomy]] (removal of the penis and testicles, respectively). [[Reconstructive surgery]] may be performed to restore what was lost, often with techniques similar to those used in [[sex reassignment surgery]].

During [[childbirth]], an [[episiotomy]] (cutting part of the tissue between the vagina and the anus) is sometimes performed to increase the amount of space through which the baby may emerge. Advocates{{who|date=April 2022}} of [[natural childbirth]] and [[unassisted birth]] state that this intervention is often performed without medical necessity, with significant damage to the female giving birth.{{cn|date=April 2022}}

[[Hymenotomy]] is the surgical perforation of an [[imperforate hymen]]. It may be performed to allow [[menstruation]] to occur. An adult individual may opt for increasing the size of her hymenal opening, or removal of the hymen altogether, to facilitate [[sexual penetration]] of her vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Puri |first1=Prem |title=Pediatric surgery: diagnosis and management |last2=Höllwarth |first2=Michael E. |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-69560-8 |location=Berlin New York |pages=963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Blumenthal |first1=Paul D. |title=A Practical Guide to Office Gynecologic Procedures |last2=Berek |first2=Jonathan S. |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health |year=2013 |isbn=9781451153897 |pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-inflicted===
{{main|Skoptic syndrome|Self-mutilation}}
A person may engage in self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation such as [[castration]], [[penectomy]], or [[clitoridectomy]]. The motivation behind such actions vary widely; it may be done due to [[skoptic syndrome]], personal crisis related to [[gender identity]], [[mental illness]], [[self-mutilation]], [[body dysmorphia]], or social reasons.{{cn|date=April 2022}}

===During armed conflict===

Genital mutilation is common in some situations of war or armed conflict, with perpetrators using violence against the genitals of men, women, and non-binary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Eichert |first1= David|date= 2019|title= 'Homosexualization' Revisited: An Audience-Focused Theorization of Wartime Male Sexual Violence|journal= International Feminist Journal of Politics|volume= 21|issue= 3|pages= 409–433|doi= 10.1080/14616742.2018.1522264|s2cid= 150313647}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different forms of [[sexual violence]] can terrorize targeted individuals and communities, prevent individuals from reproducing, and cause tremendous pain and psychological anguish for victims.

{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), female circumcision, or female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), refers to "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the [[Vulva|external female genitalia]] or other surgery of the female [[sex organ|genital organs]] whether for cultural, religious or other non-therapeutic reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the same as the procedures used in [[Sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment surgery]] or the [[genital modification]] of [[intersex]] persons. 

It is practised in several parts of the world, but the practice is concentrated more heavily in Africa, parts of the Middle East, and some other parts of Asia. Over 125 million women and girls have experienced FGM in the 29 countries in which it is concentrated.&lt;ref name="125million"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405083031/http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf |date=2015-04-05 }}, p.&amp;nbsp;22: "More than 125 million girls and women alive today have been cut in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where FGM/C is concentrated.&lt;p&gt;

In the past several decades, efforts have been made by global health organizations, such as the WHO, to end the practice. FGM is condemned by international human rights organizations. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits FGM (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168008482e|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FGM is considered a form of [[violence against women]] by the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]], which was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1993; it states: "Article Two: Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including ... female genital mutilation ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 – Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women – UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|author=United Nations General Assembly|website=www.un-documents.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of its importance in traditional life, it continues to be practised in many societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nthWORD Magazine|url=http://www.nthword.com/issue5/Interview_Liz_Canner_Orgasm_Inc.php|title=nthWORD Magazine Interview with Liz Canner, filmmaker of Orgasm, Inc|publisher=Nthword.com|access-date=2010-11-07|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714011000/http://www.nthword.com/issue5/Interview_Liz_Canner_Orgasm_Inc.php|archive-date=2010-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymenorrhaphy===
{{Main|Hymenorrhaphy}}
Hymenorrhaphy refers to the practice of thickening the hymen, or, in some cases, implanting a capsule of red liquid within the newly created vaginal tissue. This new hymen is created to cause physical resistance, blood, or the appearance of blood, at the time that the individual's new husband inserts his penis into her vagina. This is done in cultures where a high value is placed on female [[virginity]] at the time of marriage. In these cultures, a woman may be punished, perhaps violently, if the community leaders deem that she was not virginal at the time of [[consummate|consummation]] of her marriage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Individuals who are victims of [[rape]], who were virginal at the time of their rape, may elect for hymenorrhaphy.

[[Cosmetic surgery]] of female genitalia, known as ''elective genitoplasty'', has become pejoratively known as ''"designer vagina"''.

In the article Designer Vaginas by Simone Weil Davis, she talks about the modification of woman's vagina and the outside influences women are pressured with, which can cause them to feel shame towards their [[labia minora]]. She states that the media, such as pornography, creates an unhealthy view of what a "good looking vagina" is and how women feel that their privates are inferior and are therefore pressured to act upon that mindset. These insecurities are forced upon women by their partners and other women as well.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Simone Weil. "Designer Vaginas." Women's Voices, Feminist Visions. Ed. Susan Shaw and Janet Lee. New York: McGraw Hill (2012): 270–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Also leading to a surge of these types of procedures is increased interest in non-surgical genital alterations, such as Brazilian waxing, that make the vulva more visible to judgment. The incentive to participate in labia- and vaginoplasty may also come about in an effort to manage women's physical attributes and their sexual behavior, treating their vagina as something needing to be managed or controlled and ultimately deemed "acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Rodrigues Sara|s2cid = 145095068|year = 2012|title = From Vaginal Exception to Exceptional Vagina: The Biopolitics of Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery|doi = 10.1177/1363460712454073|journal = Sexualities|volume = 15|issue = 7|pages = 778–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clitoral hood reduction ===
{{Main|Clitoral hood reduction}}
[[File:Clitoral hood reduction in adult caucasian female.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Clitoral hood reduction]]]]
Clitoral hood reduction is a form of hoodplasty. When performed with the consent of the adult individual, it can be considered an [[Elective surgery|elective]] [[plastic surgery]] procedure for reducing the size and the area of the [[clitoral hood]] (prepuce) in order to further expose the [[Clitoris#Glans|glans]] of the [[clitoris]]; the therapeutic goal is thought to improve the sexual functioning of the woman, and the aesthetic appeal of her [[vulva]]. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a [[labiaplasty]] procedure for reducing the [[labia minora]]; and occasionally within a [[vaginoplasty]] procedure. When these procedures are performed on individuals without their consent, they are considered a form of [[female genital mutilation]].

===Castration===
{{Main|Castration}}
Castration in the genital modification and mutilation context is the removal of the [[testicles]]. Occasionally the term is also used to refer to [[#penectomy|penis removal]], but that is less common. Castration has been performed in many cultures throughout history, but is now rare. It should not be confused with [[chemical castration]].

The removal of one testicle (sometimes referred to as ''unilateral castration'') is usually done in the modern world only for medical reasons.&lt;!-- I'm pretty sure Ford and Beech refer to an initiation right which includes this --&gt;

Support for circumcision is often centered on medical benefits, while opposition is often centered on [[human rights]] (particularly the [[bodily integrity]] of the infant when circumcision is performed in the neonatal period) and the potentially harmful side effects of the procedure.&lt;ref name="Dekkers"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dekkers|journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal|title=Routine (non-religious) neonatal circumcision and bodily integrity: a transatlantic dialogue.|doi=10.1353/ken.0.0279|pmid=19623819|volume=19|issue=2|date=June 2009|pages=125–46|s2cid=43235291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreskin restoration===
{{Main|Foreskin restoration}}
Foreskin restoration is the partial recreation of the [[foreskin]] after its removal by [[circumcision]]. 

Surgical restoration involves grafting skin taken from the [[scrotum]] onto a portion of the penile shaft. Nonsurgical methods involve [[tissue expansion]] by stretching the penile skin forward over the [[glans penis]] with the aid of [[tension (physics)|tension]]. Nonsurgical restoration is the preferred method as it is less costly and typically yields better results than surgical restoration. A foreskin restoration device may be of help to men pursuing nonsurgical foreskin restoration. While restoration cannot recreate the nerves or tissues lost to circumcision, it can recreate the appearance and some of the function of a natural foreskin.

===Infibulation===
{{Main|Infibulation}}
[[File:Anacreon infibulated.jpg|thumb|The Greek poet [[Anacreon]] (582–485 BCE), showing {{transliteration|grc|[[kynodesme|kynodesmē]]}}]]
''Infibulation'' literally means "to close with a clasp or a pin". The word is used to include [[Surgical suture|suturing]] of the foreskin over the [[glans penis|head of the penis]].

Early Greek infibulation consisted of piercing the foreskin and applying a gold, silver or bronze ring (''annulus''), a metal clasp (''fibula'') or pin. This was done for aesthetic reasons. The Greeks also used a nonsurgical form of infibulation by wearing a {{transliteration|grc|[[kynodesme]]}}.&lt;ref name="Schultheiss"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=D. Schultheiss|author2=J.J. Mattelaer|author3=F.M. Hodges|date=2003|title=Preputial infibulation: from ancient medicine to modern genital piercing|journal=BJU International|volume=92|issue=7|pages=758–763|doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.2003.04490.x|pmid=14616462|s2cid=8855134|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In modern times, male infibulation may be performed for personal preferences or as part of [[BDSM]].

===Emasculation===
{{Main|Emasculation}}

Emasculation is the removal of both the [[penis]] and the [[Testicle|testicles]], the external [[Male reproductive system|male sex organs]]. It differs from [[castration]], which is the removal of the testicles only, although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably

Due to the high risk of death from bleeding and infection, it was often considered a punishment equivalent to a [[death sentence]]. It was part of the eunuch-making of the [[Chinese court]], and it was widespread in the [[Arab slave trade]]. A castrated slave was worth more, and this offset the losses from death.&lt;ref name="Gordon 1989"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Murray Gordon|title=Slavery in the Arab World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5l81hwFPvzYC|date=1989|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-941533-30-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nullo (body modification)|Nullification]] is the term used by the modern body modification community to describe the procedure of emasculation. "Nullo" is the term used to describe those who have undergone nullification.

In modern-day [[South Asia]], some members of [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] communities reportedly undergo emasculation. It is called ''nirwaan'' and seen as a [[rite of passage]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, S. "Hijras: An Alternative Sex and Gender Role in India (in Herdt, G. (1996) Third Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History. Zone Books.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pearling===
{{Main|Pearling (body modification)}}
Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitals—of the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of the receptive partner(s) during vaginal or anal intercourse.

===Penectomy===
{{Main|Penectomy|Penis removal}}
Penectomy involves the partial or total amputation of penis. Sometimes, the removal of the entire penis was done in conjunction with castration, or incorrectly referred to as castration. Removing the penis was often performed on [[eunuchs]] and high ranking men who would frequently be in contact with women, such as those belonging to a [[harem]]. The hijra of India may remove their penis as an expression of their [[gender identity]]. In the medical field, removal of the penis may be performed for reasons of [[gangrene]] or [[cancer]]. Penis removal may occur through unintentional genital injury, such as during routine neonatal circumcision mishaps.&lt;ref&gt;"Family Is Awarded $850,000 For Circumcision Accident" The New York Times, New York, USA, Published November 2, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"David Reimer, 38, Subject of the John/Joan Case" [[The New York Times]], New York, USA, Published May 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Seabrook. $22.8 million in botched circumcision.

[[Penis removal]] for purposes of assault or revenge is overwhelmingly a female-on-male crime, particularly in [[Thailand]]. In the United States In 1907 [[Bertha Boronda]] sliced off her husband's penis with a straight razor.&lt;ref name="Bobbit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bobbitt's Amputation Case Similar to a 1907 Account|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1993-11-30-9311300561-story.html|access-date=27 November 2019|agency=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=30 November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbit]] infamously removed her husband's penis in 1993.

===Penile subincision===
{{Main|Penile subincision}}
Penile subincision is a form of genital modification involves a [[urethrotomy]] and vertically slitting the underside of the penis from the [[Urinary meatus|meatus]] towards to the base. It was performed by people of some cultures, such as the [[Indigenous Australians]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrente]], the [[Luritja]], the [[Samburu people|Samburu]], the [[Samoans]], and the [[Native Hawaiians]]. It may also be performed for personal preference. Penile subincision may leave a man with an increased risk of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], issues with fertility (due to lack of control over what direction the sperm goes after [[ejaculation]]), and may require a man to sit down while [[urination|urinating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Meatotomy|title=Meatotomy – BME Encyclopedia|website=wiki.bme.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the surgery is not performed in a hospital or by a licensed medical professional, complications such as infection, [[exsanguination]], or permanent damage are major concerns.

=== Penile superincision ===

A rectal slit (also known as superincision) is an incision made along the upper length of the foreskin with the intention to expose the [[glans penis]] without removing skin or tissue.

The practice appears to have occurred in Ancient Egypt, though not commonly:
{{Blockquote|A few examples of [[Old Kingdom]] ... statuary present some adult males—usually priests, functionaries, or low-status workers—as having undergone a vertical slit on the dorsal aspect of the prepuce, although no flesh has been removed.&lt;ref name="Hodges"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Hodges|first = Frederick M.|year = 2001|title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme|journal = [[Bulletin of the History of Medicine|The Bulletin of the History of Medicine]]|volume = 75|issue = Fall 2001|pages = 375–405|url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/|format = PDF|access-date = 2018-02-06|doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119|pmid=11568485|s2cid = 29580193}} Hodges draws a strong distinction between the kynodesme and infibulation
"
Tethering the ''akroposthion'' with the ''kynodesme'' is frequently confused with preputial infibulation, which had different objectives and was achieved by surgically piercing the prepuce and using the holes so created for the insertion of a metal clasp (fibula) in order to fasten the prepuce shut."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It may be performed as a part of traditional customs, such as those in the [[Pacific Islands]] and the [[Philippines]]. In the medical field, it may be performed for as an alternative to circumcision when circumcision is undesired or impractical. It remains a rare surgery and practice overall.
