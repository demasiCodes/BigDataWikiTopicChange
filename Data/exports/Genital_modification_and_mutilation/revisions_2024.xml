{{short description|Permanent or temporary changes to human sex organs}}

'''Genital modifications''' are forms of [[Body modification|body modifications]] applied to the [[human sex organs|human sexual organs]]. When there's cutting involved, '''genital cutting''' or '''[[surgery]]''' can be used. The term '''genital enhancement''' seem to be generally used for genital modifications that modify the external aspect, the way the patient wants it.&lt;ref name=Cosmeticmalegenitalsurgery2023&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Danino |first1=Michel Alain |last2=Trouilloud |first2=Pierre |last3=Benkhadra |first3=Mehdi |last4=Danino |first4=Arthur |last5=Laurent |first5=Romain |date=26 October 2023 |title=Cosmetic male genital surgery: a narrative review |journal=Annals of Translational Medicine |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=11 |doi=10.21037/atm-23-351 |doi-access=free |issn=2305-5839 |pmid=38304911|pmc=10777246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''genital mutilation''' is used for genital modifications that drastically diminish the recipient's [[quality of life]] and result in [[adverse health outcome]]s, whether [[Health|physical or mental]].    

== Reasons ==
=== Body modification ===
{{main|Body modification}}
==== Voluntary ====

Many types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons.

Social acceptance for male intimate cosmetic surgery seem to have happened around the 2010s, decades after other types of cosmetic surgeries.&lt;ref name=Cosmeticmalegenitalsurgery2023/&gt;

[[Penile subincision]], or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of [[Indigenous Australian]]s. This procedure has taken root in Western [[body modification]] culture, the [[modern primitive]]s. [[Meatotomy]] is a form that involves splitting of the [[glans penis]] alone, while bisection is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.

[[Genital piercing]]s and [[genital tattooing]] may be performed for aesthetic reasons, but piercings can have the benefit of increasing [[sexual pleasure]] for the pierced individual or their [[sex partner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Neluis T, Armstrong ML, Young C, Roberts AE, Hogan L, Rinard K |year = 2014|title = Prevalence and implications of genital tattoos: A site not forgotten|journal = British Journal of Medical Practitioners|volume = 7|issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="expressmilwaukee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-7386-penises-piercings-and-pleasure.html|title=Penises, Piercings and Pleasure|date=2009-07-23|access-date=2010-01-17|archive-date=2015-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709222053/http://expressmilwaukee.com/article-7386-penises-piercings-and-pleasure.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Pearling (body modification)|pearling]] involves surgical insertion of small, inert spheres under the skin along the shaft of the penis for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to the walls of the vagina. Similar to tattooing, [[scarification|genital scarification]] is primarily done for aesthetic reasons by adding decorative scars to the skin. The genital decoration by scars is an ancient tradition in many cultures, both for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Angulo JC, García-Díez M, Martínez M |year = 2011|title = Phallic decoration in paleolithic art: genital scarification, piercing and tattoos|journal = The Journal of Urology|volume = 186|issue = 6|pages = 2498–2503|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2011.07.077|pmid = 22019163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clitoris enlargement]] may be achieved temporarily through the use of a [[clitoral pump]], or it may be achieved permanently through the [[Testosterone (medication)|application or injection of testosterone]]. [[Penis enlargement]] is a term for various techniques used to attempt to increase the size of the penis, though the safety and efficacy of these techniques are debated.

=====Gender-affirming surgery=====
{{main|Gender-affirming surgery}}
People who are [[transgender]] may undergo [[gender-affirming surgery]] to alter their genitals to match their [[gender identity]]. Not all transgender people elect to have these surgeries. 

Some of the surgical procedures are [[vaginoplasty]] (creation of a vagina) and [[vulvoplasty]] (creation of a vulva) for [[trans women]] and [[metoidioplasty]] (elongation of the clitoris), [[phalloplasty]] (creation of a penis), and [[scrotoplasty]] (creation of a scrotum) for [[trans men]]. Trans women may also benefit from [[hair removal]] and [[facial feminization surgery]], while some trans men may have [[liposuction]] to remove fat deposits around their hips and thighs.{{cn|date=April 2022}} [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]], a [[third gender]] found in the [[Indian subcontinent]], may opt to undergo [[castration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Serena|last=Nanda|author-link=Serena Nanda|title=Neither Man nor Woman: the Hijras of India|year=1999|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|place=Belmont, CA|edition=2nd|isbn=9780534509033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a child's gender may be reassigned due to [[genital injury]], including [[David Reimer]], who was the subject of [[John Money]]'s John/Joan case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gearhart JP, Rock JA |year=1989 |title=Total ablation of the penis after circumcision with electrocautery: a method of management and long-term followup |journal=J Urol |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=799–801 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5347(17)38893-6 |pmid=2769863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Opposition======
{{See also|Children's rights|Bodily integrity|Intersex human rights|Female genital mutilation|Circumcision controversies|Ethics of circumcision|Circumcision and law|Compulsory sterilization}}

The Brussels collaboration on [[Bodily integrity]] is made up of "physicians, ethicists, nurse-midwives, public health professionals, legal scholars, human rights advocates, political scientists, anthropologists, psychologists, sexologists, sociologists, philosophers, and feminists from Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas with interdisciplinary or experiential expertise in child genital cutting practices across a wide range of cultural contexts".&lt;ref name=BCBI2024/&gt;{{rp|p=42}}

In its second statement, it says: &lt;blockquote&gt;therefore, that as a matter of justice, inclusivity, and gender equality in medical-ethical policy (we do not take a position as to criminal law), clinicians should not be permitted to perform any nonvoluntary genital cutting or surgery in prepubescent minors, irrespective of the latter’s sex traits or gender assignment, unless urgently necessary to protect their physical health.&lt;ref name=BCBI2024/&gt;{{rp|p=1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====== Intersex ======
{{Main|Sex assignment|Intersex surgery|History of intersex surgery|Intersex human rights}}
[[Intersex]] children and children with ambiguous genitalia may be subjected to surgeries to "normalize" the appearance of their genitalia. 

These surgeries are usually performed for cosmetic benefit rather than for therapeutic reasons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"David Reimer, 38, Subject of the John/Joan Case" [[New York Times|The New York Times]], New York, US, Published May 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Most surgeries involving children with ambiguous genitalia are sexually damaging and may render them [[infertile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/node/97 ISNA's Amicus Brief on Intersex Genital Surgery] [[Intersex Society of North America|The Intersex Society of North America]], Dated February 7, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in cases involving male children with [[micropenis]], doctors may recommend the child be reassigned as female.&lt;ref&gt;Karen S Vogt, MD, Michael J Bourgeois, MD, Arlan L Rosenbloom, MD, Mary L Windle, PharmD, George.

====As sexual violence====

Genital mutilation is common in some situations of war or armed conflict, with perpetrators using violence against the genitals of men, women, and non-binary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Eichert |first1= David|date= 2019|title= 'Homosexualization' Revisited: An Audience-Focused Theorization of Wartime Male Sexual Violence|journal= International Feminist Journal of Politics|volume= 21|issue= 3|pages= 409–433|doi= 10.1080/14616742.2018.1522264|s2cid= 150313647}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different forms of [[sexual violence]] can terrorize targeted individuals and communities, prevent individuals from reproducing, and cause tremendous pain and psychological anguish for victims.

===As treatment===
If the genitals become diseased, as in the case of cancer, sometimes the diseased areas are surgically removed. Females may undergo [[vaginectomy]] or [[vulvectomy]] (to the vagina and vulva, respectively), while males may undergo [[penectomy]] or [[orchiectomy]] (removal of the penis and testicles, respectively). [[Reconstructive surgery]] may be performed to restore what was lost, often with techniques similar to those used in [[gender-affirming surgery]].

During [[childbirth]], an [[episiotomy]] (cutting part of the tissue between the vagina and the anus) is sometimes performed to increase the amount of space through which the baby may emerge. 

[[Hymenotomy]] is the surgical perforation of an [[imperforate hymen]]. It may be performed to allow [[menstruation]] to occur. An adult individual may opt for increasing the size of her hymenal opening, or removal of the hymen altogether, to facilitate [[sexual penetration]] of her vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Puri |first1=Prem |title=Pediatric surgery: diagnosis and management |last2=Höllwarth |first2=Michael E. |date=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-69560-8 |location=Berlin New York |pages=963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Blumenthal |first1=Paul D. |title=A Practical Guide to Office Gynecologic Procedures |last2=Berek |first2=Jonathan S. |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health |year=2013 |isbn=9781451153897 |pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-inflicted===
{{main|Self-mutilation}}
A person may engage in self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation such as [[castration]], [[penectomy]], or [[clitoridectomy]]. The motivation behind such actions vary widely; it may be done due personal crisis related to [[gender identity]], [[mental illness]], [[self-mutilation]], [[body dysmorphia]], or social reasons.{{cn|date=April 2022}}

In the past several decades, efforts have been made by global health organizations, such as the WHO, to end the practice. FGM is condemned by international human rights organizations. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits FGM (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168008482e|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FGM is considered a form of [[violence against women]] by the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]], which was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1993; it states: "Article Two: Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including ... female genital mutilation ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 – Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women – UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|author=United Nations General Assembly|website=www.un-documents.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of its importance in traditional life, it continues to be practised in many societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nthWORD Magazine|url=http://www.nthword.com/issue5/Interview_Liz_Canner_Orgasm_Inc.php|title=nthWORD Magazine Interview with Liz Canner, filmmaker of Orgasm, Inc|publisher=Nthword.com|access-date=2010-11-07|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714011000/http://www.nthword.com/issue5/Interview_Liz_Canner_Orgasm_Inc.php|archive-date=2010-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymenorrhaphy===
{{Main|Hymenorrhaphy}}
Hymenorrhaphy refers to the practice of thickening the hymen, or, in some cases, implanting a capsule of red liquid within the newly created vaginal tissue. This new hymen is created to cause physical resistance, blood, or the appearance of blood, at the time that the individual's new husband inserts his penis into her vagina. This is done in cultures where a high value is placed on female [[virginity]] at the time of marriage. In these cultures, a woman may be punished, perhaps violently, if the community leaders deem that she was not a virgin when her marriage was [[consummate]]d.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Individuals who are victims of [[rape]], who were virginal at the time of their rape, may elect for hymenorrhaphy.

[[Cosmetic surgery]] of female genitalia, known as ''elective genitoplasty'', has become pejoratively known as ''"designer vagina"''. In May 2007, an article published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' strongly criticised this craze, citing its popularity being rooted in commercial and media influences.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bourke|first=Emily|title = Designer vagina craze worries doctors|publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date = 2009-11-12|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/12/2741446.htm?site=local|access-date = 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Liao|first = Lih Mei|author2=Sarah M Creighton|title = Requests for cosmetic genitoplasty: how should healthcare providers respond?|journal = BMJ|volume = 334|issue = 7603|pages = 1090–1092|date = 2007-05-26|doi = 10.1136/bmj.39206.422269.BE|pmid = 17525451|pmc = 1877941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns have been expressed in Australia.&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;

Some women undergo vaginoplasty or vulvoplasty procedures to alter the shape of their [[vulva]]s to meet personal or societal [[aesthetic]] standards.&lt;ref name="The Perfect Vagina Documentary"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Perfect Vagina Documentary |url=https://documentaryheaven.com/the-perfect-vagina/ |website=Documentary Heaven |access-date=October 12, 2022}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery itself is controversial, and critics refer to the procedures as "designer vagina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Green Fiona|year = 2005|title = From clitoridectomies to 'designer vaginas': The medical construction of heteronormative female bodies and sexuality through female genital cutting|journal = Sexualities, Evolution &amp; Gender|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 153–187|doi=10.1080/14616660500200223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1-last=Essen |author1-first=Birgitta |author2-last=Johnsdotter |author2-first=Sara |year=2004 |title=Female Genital Mutilation in the West: Traditional Circumcision versus Genital Cosmetic Surgery |url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/127139 |journal=[[Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica]] |volume = 83 |issue = 7 |pages = 611–613 |doi=10.1111/j.0001-6349.2004.00590.x |pmid = 15225183 |s2cid = 44583626 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414232252/http://www.hmb.utoronto.ca/HMB303H/Case_Studies/Kenya-FGM/FGM_%26_Cosmetic_Surgery.pdf |archive-date=14 April 2013 |access-date=11 October 2022|doi-access=free }}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Braun Virginia|year = 2005|title = In search of (better) sexual pleasure: female genital 'cosmetic' surgery|journal = Sexualities|volume = 8|issue = 4|pages = 407–424|doi=10.1177/1363460705056625|s2cid = 145795666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article Designer Vaginas by Simone Weil Davis, she talks about the modification of woman's vagina and the outside influences women are pressured with, which can cause them to feel shame towards their [[labia minora]]. She states that the media, such as pornography, creates an unhealthy view of what a "good looking vagina" is and how women feel that their privates are inferior and are therefore pressured to act upon that mindset. These insecurities are forced upon women by their partners and other women as well.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Simone Weil. "Designer Vaginas." Women's Voices, Feminist Visions. Ed. Susan Shaw and Janet Lee. New York: McGraw Hill (2012): 270–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Also leading to a surge of these types of procedures is increased interest in non-surgical genital alterations, such as Brazilian waxing, that make the vulva more visible to judgment. The incentive to participate in vulvo- and vaginoplasty may also come about in an effort to manage women's physical attributes and their sexual behavior, treating their vagina as something needing to be managed or controlled and ultimately deemed "acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Rodrigues Sara|s2cid = 145095068|year = 2012|title = From Vaginal Exception to Exceptional Vagina: The Biopolitics of Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery|doi = 10.1177/1363460712454073|journal = Sexualities|volume = 15|issue = 7|pages = 778–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clitoral hood reduction in adult caucasian female.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Clitoral hood reduction]]]]
Clitoral hood reduction is a form of hoodplasty. When performed with the consent of the adult individual, it can be considered an [[Elective surgery|elective]] [[plastic surgery]] procedure for reducing the size and the area of the [[clitoral hood]] (prepuce) in order to further expose the [[Clitoris#Glans|glans]] of the [[clitoris]]; the therapeutic goal is thought to improve the sexual functioning of the woman, and the aesthetic appeal of her [[vulva]]. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a [[labiaplasty]] procedure for reducing the [[labia minora]]; and occasionally within a [[vaginoplasty]] procedure. When these procedures are performed on individuals without their consent, they are considered a form of [[female genital mutilation]].

===Castration===
{{Main|Castration}}
Castration in the genital modification and mutilation context is the removal of the [[testicles]]. Occasionally the term is also used to refer to [[#penectomy|penis removal]], but that is less common. Castration has been performed in many cultures throughout history, but is now rare. It should not be confused with [[chemical castration]].

The removal of one testicle (sometimes referred to as ''unilateral castration'') is usually done in the modern world only for medical reasons.&lt;!-- I'm pretty sure Ford and Beech refer to an initiation right which includes this --&gt;

===Foreskin restoration===
{{Main|Foreskin restoration}}
[[File:Forward and Right View of Foreskin Restoration.png|thumb|Circumcised at birth, the foreskin has been restored over years of foreskin restoration.]]
Foreskin restoration is the partial recreation of the [[foreskin]] after its removal by [[circumcision]]. 

Surgical restoration involves grafting skin taken from the [[scrotum]] onto a portion of the penile shaft. Nonsurgical methods involve [[tissue expansion]] by stretching the penile skin forward over the [[glans penis]] with the aid of [[tension (physics)|tension]]. Nonsurgical restoration is the preferred method as it is less costly and typically yields better results than surgical restoration. A foreskin restoration device may be of help to men pursuing nonsurgical foreskin restoration. While restoration cannot recreate the nerves or tissues lost to circumcision, it can recreate the appearance and some of the function of a natural foreskin.

===Infibulation===
{{Main|Infibulation}}
[[File:Anacreon infibulated.jpg|thumb|The Greek poet [[Anacreon]] (582–485 BC), showing {{transliteration|grc|[[kynodesme|kynodesmē]]}}]]
''Infibulation'' literally means "to close with a clasp or a pin.” The word is used to include [[Surgical suture|suturing]] of the foreskin over the [[glans penis|head of the penis]].

Early Greek infibulation consisted of tying the most distal portion of the foreskin with {{transliteration|grc|[[kynodesme]]}} to conceal the glans. The kynodesme was also used by the Etruscans and Romans (ligatura praeputii), but the Romans preferred to apply a gold, silver, or bronze ring (''annulus''), a metal clasp (''fibula'') or pin.&lt;ref name="Schultheiss"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=D.

In modern times, male infibulation may be performed for personal preferences or as part of [[BDSM]].

===Emasculation===
{{Main|Emasculation}}

Emasculation is the removal of both the [[penis]] and the [[Testicle|testicles]], the external [[Male reproductive system|male sex organs]]. It differs from [[castration]], which is the removal of the testicles only, although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

Genital nullification is a procedure practiced in a [[body modification]] subculture made up mostly of men who have had their genitals surgically removed. Those undergoing the procedure often go by the name of nullos, and  are not necessarily [[transgender]] or [[Non-binary gender|nonbinary]]; some identify as [[eunuch]]s.&lt;ref name="DeMello2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Encyclopedia of Body Adornment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0122BsqrZwC&amp;pg=PA57|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-33695-9|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''nullo'' is short for ''genital nullification''.&lt;ref name="gizm_TheM"&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Most Extreme Body Hacks That Actually Change Your Physical Abilities| last = Knibbs | first = Kate| work = Gizmodo| date = 2015-05-14| access-date = 2017-08-23| url = https://gizmodo.com/the-most-extreme-body-hacks-that-actually-change-your-p-1704056851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the procedure is mostly sought by men, female genital mutilation may be referred to as clitoral nullification.&lt;ref name="Harrington2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee Harrington|title=Traversing Gender: Understanding Transgender Realities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBMHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT23|date=1 May 2016|publisher=Mystic Productions Press|isbn=978-1-942733-83-6|pages=23–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern-day [[South Asia]], some members of [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] communities reportedly undergo emasculation. It is called ''nirwaan'' and seen as a [[rite of passage]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, S. "Hijras: An Alternative Sex and Gender Role in India (in Herdt, G. (1996) Third Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History. Zone Books.)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was part of the eunuch-making of the [[Chinese court]], and it was widespread in the [[Arab slave trade]]. A castrated slave was worth more, and this offset the losses from death.&lt;ref name="Gordon 1989"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Murray Gordon|title=Slavery in the Arab World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5l81hwFPvzYC|date=1989|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-941533-30-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pearling===
{{Main|Pearling (body modification)}}
Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitals—of the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of the receptive partner(s) during vaginal or anal intercourse.

===Penectomy===
{{Main|Penectomy|Penis removal}}
Penectomy involves the partial or total amputation of penis. Sometimes, the removal of the entire penis was done in conjunction with castration, or incorrectly referred to as castration. Removing the penis was often performed on [[eunuchs]] and high ranking men who would frequently be in contact with women, such as those belonging to a [[harem]]. The hijra of India may remove their penis as an expression of their [[gender identity]]. In the medical field, removal of the penis may be performed for reasons of [[gangrene]] or [[cancer]]. Penis removal may occur through unintentional genital injury, such as during routine neonatal circumcision mishaps.&lt;ref&gt;"Family Is Awarded $850,000 For Circumcision Accident" The New York Times, New York, USA, Published November 2, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"David Reimer, 38, Subject of the John/Joan Case" [[The New York Times]], New York, USA, Published May 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Seabrook. $22.8 million in botched circumcision.

===Penile subincision===
{{Main|Penile subincision}}
Penile subincision is a form of genital modification involves a [[urethrotomy]] and vertically slitting the underside of the penis from the [[Urinary meatus|meatus]] towards to the base. It was performed by people of some cultures, such as the [[Indigenous Australians]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrente]], the [[Luritja]], the [[Samburu people|Samburu]], the [[Samoans]], and the [[Native Hawaiians]]. It may also be performed for personal preference. Penile subincision may leave a man with an increased risk of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], issues with fertility (due to lack of control over what direction the sperm goes after [[ejaculation]]), and may require a man to sit down while [[urination|urinating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Meatotomy|title=Meatotomy – BME Encyclopedia|website=wiki.bme.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the surgery is not performed in a hospital or by a licensed medical professional, complications such as infection, [[exsanguination]], or permanent damage are major concerns.

=== Penile superincision ===

A rectal slit (also known as superincision) is an incision made along the upper length of the foreskin with the intention to expose the [[glans penis]] without removing skin or tissue.

The practice appears to have occurred in Ancient Egypt, though not commonly:
{{Blockquote|A few examples of [[Old Kingdom]] ... statuary present some adult males—usually priests, functionaries, or low-status workers—as having undergone a vertical slit on the dorsal aspect of the prepuce, although no flesh has been removed.&lt;ref name="Hodges"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Hodges|first = Frederick M.|year = 2001|title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme|journal = [[Bulletin of the History of Medicine|The Bulletin of the History of Medicine]]|volume = 75|issue = Fall 2001|pages = 375–405|url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/|format = PDF|access-date = 2018-02-06|doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119|pmid=11568485|s2cid = 29580193}} Hodges draws a strong distinction between the kynodesme and infibulation
"
Tethering the ''akroposthion'' with the ''kynodesme'' is frequently confused with preputial infibulation, which had different objectives and was achieved by surgically piercing the prepuce and using the holes so created for the insertion of a metal clasp (fibula) in order to fasten the prepuce shut."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It may be performed as a part of traditional customs, such as those in the [[Pacific Islands]] and the [[Philippines]]. In the medical field, it may be performed for as an alternative to circumcision when circumcision is undesired or impractical. It remains a rare surgery and practice overall.
