When genital alterations are used for punishment, typically for [[rape]], [[adultery]] or other socially forbidden sexual practices, such modifications have included [[castration]] (actual or chemical) or [[penectomy]]. Typically, female genital mutilation occurs in countries located in Africa, traditionally to welcome young girls into adulthood.    

==Circumcision==
&lt;!-- this isn't the place to go into the whys and wherefores, see main articles ---&gt;
===Female===
{{main|Female genital cutting}}
This consists of removal and/or surgery of various parts of the female genitals, such as removal of the clitoral hood ([[Female genital cutting#Clitoridotomy|Clitoridotomy]]), removal of the clitoris ([[Female genital cutting#Clitoridectomy|Clitoridectomy]]) and sewing up the [[labia]] ([[Female genital cutting#Infibulation|Infibulation]]). When performed on minors, these procedures can be highly [[controversial]].

===Male===
{{main|Male circumcision}}
The removal of the foreskin for religious, social, aesthetic, or medical reasons (for [[phimosis]], for example).

==Female genital modification surgery==
Female genital enhancement [[surgery]] includes [[laser]] resurfacing of the labia to remove [[wrinkles]] and clitoral repositioning for those not achieving optimum stimulation as well as [[labiaplasty]] and [[Vagina tightening and toning|vaginal tightening]].

A '''designer vagina''' is a [[cosmetic surgery]] procedure and the result of that procedure. The procedure is also known as [[labiaplasty]] (a reduction of the [[labia minora]], the flaps of skin which form the lips of a woman's [[genitalia]] and cover the [[clitoris]] and [[vagina]]l opening) and [[Vagina tightening and toning|vaginal tightening]] (involving surgery on the interior of the vaginal vault). It is a type of genital modification.

==Types of genital alteration==
The procedures listed below are examples of genital alterations. Any of these changes may be considered modifications or mutilations by different groups of people.
