Some forms of genital alteration are performed on an adult at his or her own behest, with their informed consent. Other forms are performed on people who do not give informed consent, including infants or children. Any of these procedures may be considered modifications or mutilations by different groups of people.

== Body modification ==

[[File:Penis tattoo - Genital tattooed like a canvas.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Male [[genital tattooing]]]]
{{main article|Body modification}}
Many types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons. [[Penile subincision]], or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of [[Indigenous Australian]]s.  This procedure has taken root in Western [[body modification]] culture, the [[modern primitive]]s. [[Meatotomy]] is a form that involves splitting of the [[glans penis]] alone, while [[genital bisection]] is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.

[[Genital piercing]]s and [[genital tattooing]] may be performed for aesthetic reasons, but piercings have the benefit of increasing [[sexual pleasure]] for the pierced individual or their [[sex partner]]s.&lt;ref name="expressmilwaukee"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-7386-penises-piercings-and-pleasure.html |title=Penises, Piercings and Pleasure |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Pearling (body modification)|Pearling]] involves surgical insertion of small, inert spheres under the skin along the shaft of the penis for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to the walls of the vagina.

[[Clitoris enlargement]] may be achieved temporarily through the use of a [[clitoral pump]], or it may be achieved permanently through the [[Testosterone (medication)|application or injection of testosterone]]. [[Penis enlargement]] is a term for various techniques used to attempt to increase the size of the penis, though the safety and efficacy of these techniques are debated.

==Voluntary sex reassignment==
{{main article|Sex reassignment surgery}}
People who are [[transgender]] may undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]] in order to modify their bodies to match their [[gender identity]]. Not all transgender people elect to have these surgeries, but those who do usually see an improvement in their sexual lives as well as their mental and emotional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cuypere G. |author2=T'Sjoen G. |author3=Beerten R. |author4=Selvaggi G. |author5=Sutter P. |author6=Hoebeke P. |author7=Monstrey S. |author8=Vansteenwegen A. |author9=Rubens R. |year=2005 | title = Sexual and physical health after sex reassignment surgery |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 679–690 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-005-7926-5 | pmid=16362252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the surgical procedures are [[breast augmentation]] and [[vaginoplasty]] for [[trans women]] and [[mastectomy]], [[metoidioplasty]], and [[phalloplasty]] for [[trans men]]. Trans women may also benefit from hair removal and facial feminization surgery, while some trans men may have [[liposuction]] to remove fat deposits around their hips and thighs.

==Involuntary sex assignment==
{{Main article|Sex assignment|Intersex surgery}}
[[Intersex]] children and children with ambiguous genitalia may be subjected to genital surgeries to "normalize" the appearance of the genitalia. These surgeries are usually performed for cosmetic benefit rather than for therapeutic benefits. Most surgeries involving children with ambiguous genitalia are sexually damaging and may render them [[infertile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/node/97 ISNA's Amicus Brief on Intersex Genital Surgery] [[Intersex Society of North America|The Intersex Society of North America]], Dated February 7, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in cases involving male children with [[micropenis]], doctors may recommend the child be reassigned as female.&lt;ref&gt;Karen S Vogt, MD, Michael J Bourgeois, MD, Arlan L Rosenbloom, MD, Mary L Windle, PharmD, George.

In some cases, a child's gender may be reassigned due to genital injury. There have been at least seven cases of healthy male infants being reassigned as female due to [[circumcision]] damaging their penises beyond repair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gearhart JP, Rock JA | year = 1989 | title = Total ablation of the penis after circumcision with electrocautery: a method of management and long-term followup | url = | journal = J Urol | volume = 142 | issue = 3| pages = 799–801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"David Reimer, 38, Subject of the John/Joan Case" [[New York Times|The New York Times]], New York, USA, Published May 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Family Is Awarded $850,000 For Circumcision Accident" [[New York Times|The New York Times]], New York, USA, Published November 2, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Seabrook. $22.8 million in botched circumcision.

==In disease or medical necessity==
If the genitals become diseased, as in the case of cancer, sometimes the diseased areas are surgically removed.  Females may undergo [[vaginectomy]] or [[vulvectomy]], while males may undergo [[penectomy]]. [[Reconstructive surgery]] may be performed to restore what was lost, often with techniques similar to those used in [[sex reassignment surgery]].

During [[childbirth]], an [[episiotomy]] (cutting part of the tissue between the vagina and the anus) is sometimes performed to increase the amount of space through which the baby may emerge.  Advocates of [[natural childbirth]] and [[unassisted birth]] state that this intervention is often performed without medical necessity, with significant damage to the person giving birth.

[[Hymenotomy]] is the surgical perforation of an [[imperforate hymen]].  It may be performed to allow [[menstruation]] to occur.  An adult individual may opt for increasing the size of her hymenal opening, or removal of the hymen altogether, to facilitate [[sexual penetration]] of her vagina.

The world's first penis reduction surgery was performed in 2015, on a 17-year-old boy who had an [[Football (ball)#American and Canadian football|American football]]-shaped penis as a result of recurrent [[priapism]].&lt;ref name="penisreduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2015/02/18/penis-reduction-surgery-grow-up/#7c6365c42fce|title=Penis Reduction Surgery Is No Laughing Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation==
{{main article|Skoptic syndrome|Self-mutilation}}
A person may engage in self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation such as [[castration]], [[penectomy]], or [[clitoridectomy]]. The motivation behind such actions vary widely; it may be done due to [[skoptic syndrome]], personal crisis related to [[gender identity]], [[mental illness]], [[self-mutilation]], [[body dysmorphia]], or social reasons.

===Female genital mutilation===
[[File:FGM prevalence UNICEF 2013.svg|right|thumb|300px|Prevalence of FGM by country, according to a 2013 UNICEF report&lt;ref name=childinfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevalence of FGM/C|url=http://data.unicef.org/child-protection/fgmc|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main article|Female genital mutilation}}
[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), female circumcision, or female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), refers to "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external [[human female genitalia|female genitalia]] or other surgery of the female [[sex organ|genital organs]] whether for cultural, religious or other non-therapeutic reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not the same as the procedures used in [[Sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment surgery]] or the [[genital modification]] of [[intersex]] persons. It is practised in several parts of the world, but the practice is concentrated more heavily in Africa, parts of the Middle East, and some other parts of Asia. Over 125 million women and girls have experienced FGM in the 29 countries in which it is concentrated.&lt;ref name=125million&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&amp;nbsp;22: "More than 125 million girls and women alive today have been cut in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where FGM/C is concentrated.&lt;p&gt;

The number of cut women aged 50 and older is based on FGM/C prevalence in women aged 45 to 49."&lt;/ref&gt; Over eight million have been [[infibulation|infibulated]], a practice found largely in Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan.&lt;ref name=Yoder2008p13&gt;P.&amp;nbsp;Stanley Yoder, Shane Khan, [http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/WP39/WP39.pdf "Numbers of women circumcised in Africa: The Production of a Total"], USAID, DHS Working Papers, No. 39, March 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–14: "Infibulation is practiced largely in countries located in northeastern Africa: Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan.

In the past several decades, efforts have been made by global health organizations, such as the WHO, to end the practice. However, because of its importance in traditional life, it continues to be practised in many societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nthWORD Magazine |url=http://www.nthword.com/issue5/Interview_Liz_Canner_Orgasm_Inc.php |title=nthWORD Magazine Interview with Liz Canner, filmmaker of Orgasm, Inc |publisher=Nthword.com |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymenorrhaphy===
[[Hymenorrhaphy]] refers to the practice of thickening the hymen, or, in some cases, implanting a capsule of red liquid within the newly created vaginal tissue.  This new hymen is created to cause physical resistance, blood, or the appearance of blood, at the time that the individual's new husband inserts his penis into her vagina.  This is done in cultures where a high value is placed on female [[virginity]] at the time of marriage. In these cultures, a woman may be punished, perhaps violently, if the community leaders deem that she was not virginal at the time of [[consummate|consummation]] of her marriage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Individuals who are victims of [[rape]], who were virginal at the time of their rape, may elect for hymenorrhaphy.

===Labia stretching===
[[Labia stretching]] is the act of elongating the ''[[labia minora]]'' through manual manipulation (pulling) or physical equipment (such as weights).&lt;ref name=Rwanda&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/97388.php], "Rwandan Women View The Elongation Of Their Labia As Positive", retrieved on 2008-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement&gt;[http://www.sexylabia.com/labia-enlargement1.htm], "Enlarging Your Labia", retrieved on 2008-06-22&lt;/ref&gt; It is a familial [[cultural practice]] in Rwanda,&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt; common in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/hrp/progress/67.pdf], "Sexual health--a new focus for WHO", page 6, retrieved on 2008-06-19&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[body modification]] practice elsewhere.&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt; It is performed for sexual enhancement of both partners, aesthetics, symmetry and gratification.&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt;

===Labiaplasty and vaginoplasty===
[[File:Nach der Entfernung der inneren Schamlippen 1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Vulva with ''labia minora'' surgically removed]]

[[Cosmetic surgery]] of female genitalia, known as '''elective genitoplasty''', has become pejoratively known as '''designer vagina'''. In May 2007, an article published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' strongly criticised this craze, citing its popularity being rooted in commercial and media influences.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite news | last=Bourke |first=Emily | title = Designer vagina craze worries doctors| publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date = 2009-11-12| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/12/2741446.htm?site=local| accessdate = 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Liao | first = Lih Mei|author2=Sarah M Creighton| title = Requests for cosmetic genitoplasty: how should healthcare providers respond?| journal = BMJ| volume = 334| issue = 7603 | pages = 1090–1092| publisher = [[British Medical Journal]]| date = 2007-05-26| url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/334/7603/1090| doi = 10.1136/bmj.39206.422269.BE| accessdate = 2007-05-29| pmid = 17525451 | pmc = 1877941}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar concerns have been expressed in Australia.&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;

Some women undergo [[vaginoplasty]] or [[labiaplasty]] procedures to alter the shape of their [[vulva]]s to meet personal or societal [[aesthetic]] standards.&lt;ref name="The Perfect Vagina Documentary"&gt;[http://documentarystorm.com/sexuality/the-perfect-vagina/ The Perfect Vagina Documentary] Retrieved {{Nowrap|13 February 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery itself is controversial, and critics refer to the procedures as "designer vagina".&lt;ref&gt;Green, Fiona: "From clitoridectomies to 'designer vaginas': The medical construction of heteronormative female bodies and sexuality through female genital cutting." ''Sexualities, Evolution &amp; Gender'' 7(2):153-187, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Essen, B &amp; Johnsdotter, S: "Female Genital Mutilation in the West: Traditional Circumcision versus Genital Cosmetic Surgery".

''Sexualities'' 8(4):407-424, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article Designer Vaginas by Simone Weil Davis, she talks about the modification of woman's vagina and the outside influences women are pressured with, which can cause them to feel shame towards their [[labia minora]]. She states that the media, such as pornography, creates an unhealthy view of what a "good looking vagina" is and how women feel that their privates are inferior and are therefore pressured to act upon that mindset. These insecurities are forced upon women by their partners and other women as well.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Simone Weil. "Designer Vaginas." Women's Voices, Feminist Visions. Ed. Susan Shaw and Janet Lee. New York: McGraw Hill (2012): 270-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Also leading to a surge of these types of procedures is increased interest in non-surgical genital alterations, such as Brazilian waxing, that make the vagina more visible to judgment. The incentive to participate in labia- and vaginoplasty may also come about in an effort to manage women's physical attributes and their sexual behavior, treating their vagina as something needing to be managed or controlled and ultimately deemed "acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rodrigues Sara | year = | title = From Vaginal Exception to Exceptional Vagina: The Biopolitics of Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery | url = | journal = Sexualities | volume = 2012 | issue = | pages = 778–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a [[labiaplasty]] procedure for reducing the [[labia minora]]; and occasionally within a [[vaginoplasty]] procedure. When these procedures are performed on individuals without their consent, they are considered a form of [[female genital mutilation]].

==Male genitals==
{{category see also|Male genital modification}}

===Castration===
{{Main article|Castration}}
Castration in the genital modification and mutilation context is the removal of the [[testicles]]. Sometimes the term (meaning "cutting") is also used to refer to penis removal, but that is less common.

===Hemi-castration===
The removal of one testicle (sometimes referred to as ''unilateral castration'') is usually done in the modern world only for medical reasons.&lt;!-- I'm pretty sure Ford and Beech refer to an initiation right which includes this --&gt;

===Circumcision===
[[File:Circumcision by Country 2.png|thumb|right|400px|Prevalence of male circumcision by country]]
{{Main article|Circumcision}}
[[File:Adult circumcision before and after.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Before and after circumcision, in this case done to treat [[phimosis]]]]
[[Circumcision]] is the surgical removal of part or all of the [[foreskin]]. It is usually performed for [[religious male circumcision|religious]], cultural or medical reasons and leaves some or all of the glans permanently exposed. [[Jews]] and many [[Americans]] typically have their infants circumcised during the [[neonatal]] period, while [[Filipinos]], most Muslims and African tribes such as the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] circumcise in teenage years or childhood as an initiation into adulthood.

In modern medicine, circumcision may be used as treatment for severe [[phimosis]] or recurrent [[balanitis]]. Advocacy is often centered on [[preventive medicine]] while opposition is often centered on [[human rights]] (particularly the [[bodily integrity]] of the infant when circumcision is performed in the neonatal period) and the potentially harmful side effects of the procedure.&lt;ref name="Svoboda2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Svoboda|first=J.

===Foreskin restoration===
{{Main article|Foreskin restoration}}
Foreskin restoration is the partial recreation of the [[foreskin]] after its removal by [[circumcision]]. Surgical restoration involves grafting skin taken from the [[scrotum]] onto a portion of the penile shaft. Nonsurgical methods involve [[tissue expansion]] by stretching the penile skin forward over the [[glans penis]] with the aid of [[tension (physics)|tension]]. Nonsurgical restoration is the preferred method as it is less costly and typically yields better results than surgical restoration. A foreskin restoration device may be of help to men pursuing nonsurgical foreskin restoration. While restoration cannot recreate the nerves or tissues lost to circumcision, it can recreate the appearance and some of the function of a natural foreskin.

===Infibulation===
{{Main article|Infibulation}}
[[File:Anacreon infibulated.jpg|thumb|upright|The Greek poet [[Anacreon]] (582 BCE – 485 BCE), showing [[kynodesme|''kynodesmē'']]]]
Infibulation literally means to close with a clasp or a pin.  The word is used to include [[Surgical suture|suturing]] of the foreskin over the [[glans penis|head of the penis]].

Infibulation is seen in rock art in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rock Art Research in Southern Africa 2000–2004|author=Jean-Loïc Le Quellec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The hunter and his art: A survey of rock art in Southern Africa|author=Jalmar and Ione Rudner|publisher=C.

Early Greek infibulation consisted of piercing the foreskin and applying a gold, silver or bronze ring (''annulus''), a metal clasp (''fibula'') or pin. This was done for aesthetic reasons.  The Greeks also used a nonsurgical form of infibulation by wearing a [[kynodesme]].&lt;ref name="Hodges"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hodges FM | year = 2001 | title = The ideal prepuce in ancient Greece and Rome. male genital aesthetics and their relation to lipodermos, circumcision, foreskin restoration, and the kynodesme | url = | journal = Bull Hist Med. | volume =  75| issue = | pages =  375–405| doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119 | pmid=11568485}} Hodges draws a strong distinction between the kynodesme and infibulation "Tethering the ''akroposthion'' with the ''kynodesme'' is frequently confused with preputial infibulation, which had different objectives and was achieved by surgically piercing the prepuce and using the holes so created for the insertion of a metal clasp (fibula) in order to fasten the prepuce shut."&lt;/ref&gt;  Infibulation in Romano-Greek culture is attested as early as Aulus Cornelius Celcus (25 BC-50 AD) and as late as [[Oribasisus]] (325-405 AD).&lt;ref name=" Schultheiss"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=D.

In the Victorian era, both in the UK and in the United States, routine infibulation was second only to circumcision in the "war on masturbation" and was used in orphanages and mental institutions, supported by leading physicians.&lt;ref name="Schultheiss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Darby"&gt;The masturbation taboo and the rise of routine male circumcision: A review of the historiography RRJL Darby - Journal of Social History, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, male infibulation may be performed for personal preferences or as part of [[BDSM]].

===Nullification===
[[Nullo (body modification)|Total genital nullification]] is complete removal of the male genitals.

{{Main article|Pearling (body modification)}}
Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitals—of the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of partners during vaginal or anal intercourse.

===Penectomy===
{{Main article|Penectomy|Penis removal}}
[[File:partial penectomy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Male genital area after partial [[penectomy]]]]
Penectomy involves the partial or total amputation of [[human penis|penis]]. Sometimes, the removal of the entire penis was done in conjunction with [[castration]], or incorrectly referred to as castration. Removing the penis was often performed on [[eunuchs]] and high ranking men who would frequently be in contact with women, such as those belonging to a [[harem]]. The [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] of India may remove their penis as an expression of their [[gender identity]]. In the medical field, removal of the penis may be performed for reasons of [[gangrene]] or [[cancer]]. Penis removal may occur through unintentional genital injury.

In the [[ulwaluko]] circumcision ceremony, which is performed by spear, accidental penectomy is a serious risk.&lt;ref&gt;Rijken, D.J. (2014).

[[Penis removal]] for purposes of assault or revenge is overwhelmingly a female-on-male crime, particularly in [[Thailand]]. [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbit]] infamously removed her husband's penis in 1993. In some circumstances it may be possible to reattach the penis.

===Penile subincision===
[[File:Full subincision.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Penile subincision]]
{{Main article|Penile subincision}}
Penile subincision is a form of genital modification involves a [[urethrotomy]] and vertically slitting the underside of the penis from the [[meatus]] towards to the base. It is performed by people of many cultures, such as the [[Indigenous Australians]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrente]], the [[Luritja]], the [[Samburu people|Samburu]], the [[Samoans]], and the [[Native Hawaiians]]. It may also be performed for personal preference. Penile subincision may leave a man with an increased risk of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], issues with fertility (due to lack of control over what direction the sperm goes after [[ejaculation]]), and may require a man to sit down while [[urination|urinating]].&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Meatotomy&lt;/ref&gt; When the surgery is not performed in a hospital or by a licensed medical professional, complications such as infection, [[exsanguination]], or permanent damage are major concerns.

=== Penile superincision ===
{{Main article|Dorsal slit}}

A dorsal slit (also known as superincision) is an incision made along the upper length of the foreskin with the intention to expose the [[glans penis]] without removing skin or tissue.

The practice appears to have occurred in Ancient Egypt, though not commonly: 
{{Block quote|A few examples of [[Old Kingdom]] [...] statuary present some adult males — usually priests, functionaries, or low-status workers98—as having undergone a vertical slit on the dorsal aspect of the prepuce, although no flesh has been removed.&lt;ref name="Hodges"/&gt;}}

It may be performed as a part of traditional customs, such as those in the [[Pacific Islands]] and the [[Philippines]]. In the medical field, it may be performed for as an alternative to [[circumcision]] when circumcision is undesired or impractical. It remains a rare surgery and practice overall.
