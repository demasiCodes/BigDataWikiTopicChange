{{LGBT rights}}
The countries of the world have a wide variety of laws relating to [[same-sex relationship|sexual relations between people of the same sex]] - everything from full legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]] to the [[death penalty]] as punishment for [[homosexual]] conduct.

In addition to laws against same-sex relationships, many countries have laws geared towards a [[homosexual orientation]], everything from passing anti-discrimination laws to barring those with a homosexual orientation from adoption.

==History of homosexuality laws==
{{globalize}}

The first recorded [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] laws supposedly ''against'' sexual intercourse between men are dated by scholars to circa [[550 BC]], during the [[Babylonian captivity]] of the [[Jews|Jewish people]]; they are recorded in [[Leviticus]] (though conservative scholars date Leviticus to be much older), and they prescribe the death penalty. At the time same-sex relations were incorporated into many pagan religions.

Some people therefore believe that the ultimate origin of punitive laws targeting homosexual relations lies with Abrahamic religions. But also see similar patterns across [[Indo-European]] cultures in ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' in Ancient Rome and ''[[nith]]'' in protohistoric Germanic culture, or the [[Assyrian_Empire#Middle_Assyrian_period|Middle Assyrian]] Law Codes dating 1075 BCE&lt;ref&gt;The Middle [[Assyrian law|Assyrian Law Codes]] (1075 BC) states: ''"If a man have intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a eunuch"'', see [[Sodomy_law#History]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

This pattern continued throughout history with punitive laws arising from traditional interpretations of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. With the advent of [[colonialism]] this attitude spread along with political control by the [[imperialism|imperial powers]] of the nations with Abrahamic state religion; however, the fact that homosexuals were legally persecuted in communist China (a country which neither adopted an Abrahamic religion nor was colonized - except for Hong Kong and Macau which were colonized with Victorian era social mores, and China's largest most influential neighbors India and Pakistan also were under British rule with harsh anti-gay laws) and that homosexuality in the People's Republic was not decriminalized until 1997&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-12/26/content_3970520.htm Quiet pink revolution in dark before dawn?]"&lt;/ref&gt; calls the universal application of this theory into at least some question. Often an Abrahamic religion is the primary factor when accounting for a law against homosexuality and the major supporter. Most anti-homosexual laws sprouted in regions where religious and political leaders sought to focus sexual energies of the masses into population growth to compete with perceived religious, ethnic, tribal, and/or international foes.

==Homosexuality laws==
{{Refimprove|section|date=April 2008}}

''This is a list of [[laws]] around the world concerning homosexuality, and is arranged alphabetically by region. It should be noted that the list should not be assumed to represent a standard for measuring a nation's views, per se. Nations which have retained negative laws may, in practice, be less oppressive than the laws suggest, as the laws are not enforced. Similarly, a country which lacks laws against homosexual behaviour may possess a culture which is openly hostile and thus persecutes individuals by other means. No country has criminalised solely female-female sex; nations either criminalise all forms of homosexual behaviour or just male homosexuality. Homosexual behaviour remains illegal in over 80 countries, including some which even ban heterosexual sodomy. (Note: the understanding of sodomy can include anal sex, oral sex, fornication (i.e. sex outside of marriage) or even any sexual behaviour that does not lead to procreation within marriage. In tables below the [[age of consent]] for same sex relationships is the same as for heterosexuals, unless it is otherwise noted.''
