{{LGBT rights}}
'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)''' related laws vary greatly by country or territory &amp;ndash; everything from legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]] or [[Same-sex union|other types of partnerships]], to the [[death penalty]] as punishment for same-sex sexual activity.

[[LGBT]]-related laws include but are not limited to: [[sodomy law]]s, anti-[[lesbian]]ism laws, higher [[age of consent|ages of consent]] for same-sex activity, government recognition of [[same-sex unions|same-sex relationships]], [[LGBT adoption]], [[sexual orientation and military service]], [[immigration equality]], anti-discrimination laws, and hate crime laws regarding [[violence against LGBT people]].

==History of LGBT-related laws==
{{See also|Timeline of LGBT history|LGBT social movements|Sodomy law#History}}
{{Globalize|section|date=October 2009}}

Throughout history and across cultures, the regulation of sexuality reflects broader cultural norms.  Norms change in response to economic, social or political changes, including interactions with other societies.  

Most of the history of sexuality is unrecorded.  Even recorded norms do not always shed full light on actual practices. Early societies permitted certain forms of homosexuality, but were not necessarily free alternatives to established forms of marriage and family.  In Ancient Athens, for example, homosexuality among men provided no alternative to marriage within a heterosexually structured household.  Moreover, no individual or sexual freedom was available to women.  Nor was sexuality inevitably consensual.  Male heads of households could enjoy sexual relations with male or female slaves, including pre-adolescents, without the latter's consent.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Some people{{Who|date=September 2009}} believe that the ultimate origin of punitive laws targeting homosexual relations lies with Abrahamic religions.  The first recorded [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] laws against sexual intercourse between men are dated by scholars to circa [[550 BC]], during the [[Babylonian captivity]] of the [[Jews|Jewish people]]; they are recorded in [[Leviticus]] (though conservative scholars date Leviticus to be much older), and prescribe the death penalty.  It is unclear how rigorously that prohibition was enforced, nor should it be assumed that patterns of enforcement remained constant.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Similar prohibitions are found across [[Indo-European]] cultures in ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' in Ancient Rome and ''[[Níð|nith]]'' in protohistoric Germanic culture, or the [[Assyrian_Empire#Middle_Assyrian_period|Middle Assyrian]] Law Codes dating 1075 BC.&lt;ref&gt;The Middle [[Assyrian law|Assyrian Law Codes]] (1075 BC) states: ''"If a man have intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a eunuch"'', see [[Sodomy_law#History]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Punitive laws spread as military conquest, [[colonialism]], and missionary work spread the influence of traditional interpretations of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Laws prohibiting homosexuality were also passed in [[communist China]].  (The [[People's Republic of China]] neither adopted an Abrahamic religion nor was colonized, except for [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] which were colonized with Victorian era social mores and maintain separate legal system from the rest of the PRC.)  Homosexuality was not decriminalized there until 1997.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-12/26/content_3970520.htm Quiet pink revolution in dark before dawn?]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, LGBT people face different laws for certain medical procedures than other groups.  For example, in the United States, sexually active gay men have been prohibited from [[giving blood]] since 1983,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18827137/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaypeopleschronicle.com/stories06/march/0317062.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and FDA guidelines recommended against accepting them as [[sperm donor]]s in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/6-7-2005-71220.asp FDA Recommends Barring Gay Men From Being Sperm Donors] By Linda Orlando&lt;/ref&gt;
