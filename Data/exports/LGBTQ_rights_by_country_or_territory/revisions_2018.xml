{{World homosexuality laws map}}{{LGBT rights at the UN}}
Laws affecting [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people vary greatly by country or territory — encompassing everything from the legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]] to the [[death penalty for homosexuality]].

Laws that affect LGBT people include, but are not limited to, the following:

* laws concerning the recognition of [[same-sex relationship]]s, including [[same-sex marriage]], [[civil union]]s, and [[domestic partnership]]s
* laws concerning [[LGBT parenting]], including [[LGBT adoption|adoption by LGBT people]]
* [[anti-discrimination laws]] in employment, housing, education, public accommodations
* [[anti-bullying legislation]] to protect LGBT children at school
* [[hate crime laws]] imposing enhanced criminal penalties for prejudice-motivated [[violence against LGBT people]]
* [[bathroom bill]]s affecting access to sex-segregated facilities by transgender people
* laws related to [[sexual orientation and military service]]
* laws concerning access to [[assisted reproductive technology]]
* [[sodomy laws]] that penalize consensual same-sex sexual activity
* [[age of consent]] laws that may impose higher ages for same-sex sexual activity
* laws regarding [[MSM blood donor controversy|donation of blood by men who have sex with men]]
* laws concerning access to [[sex reassignment surgery]] and [[hormone replacement therapy (transgender)|hormone replacement therapy]]
* [[Legal aspects of transgenderism|legal recognition and accommodation of reassigned gender]]

Notably, 25 countries, all of which being developed democracies or developing democracies, recognized [[same-sex marriage]] as of 2018. By contrast, 10 countries or jurisdictions, all of which are Islamic and ruled by [[sharia]], impose the [[death penalty for homosexuality]].

In 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights, following which the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] issued a report documenting violations of the rights of LGBT people, including [[hate crime]]s, criminalization of [[homosexuality|homosexual activity]], and [[discrimination]]. Following the issuance of the report, the [[United Nations]] urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBT rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.N. council passes gay rights resolution|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/06/17/un.lgbt.rights/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=Jill Dougherty|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN issues first report on human rights of gay and lesbian people|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40743|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=December 15, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Celts===
According to [[Aristotle]], although most "belligerent nations" were strongly influenced by their women, the Celts were unusual because their men openly preferred male lovers (''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' II 1269b).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Percy |first=William A. |title=Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1996 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=TCvoj1efp8UC&amp;pg=PA18 |page=18 |isbn=0-252-06740-1 |accessdate=2009-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rankin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rankin |first1=David |last2=Ranking |first2=H.D. |title=Celts and the Classical World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdqk4vXqntgC&amp;pg=PA55 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-4151-5090-3 |pages=55 and 78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; H. D. Rankin in ''Celts and the Classical World'' notes that "Athenaeus echoes this comment (603a) and so does [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] (30.9). It seems to be the general opinion of antiquity."&lt;ref name="Rankin"/&gt; In book XIII of his ''[[Deipnosophistae|Deipnosophists]]'', the Roman Greek rhetorician and grammarian [[Athenaeus]], repeating assertions made by [[Diodorus Siculus]] in the 1st century BC (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' 5:32), wrote that Celtic women were beautiful but that the men preferred to sleep together. Diodorus went further, stating that "the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused". Rankin argues that the ultimate source of these assertions is likely to be [[Poseidonius]] and speculates that these authors may be recording "some kind of bonding ritual ... which requires abstinence from women at certain times".&lt;ref name="Rankin"/&gt;

===Ancient India===
Throughout [[Hindu]] and [[Vedic]] texts there are many descriptions of saints, demigods, and even the Supreme Lord transcending gender norms and manifesting multiple combinations of sex and gender.&lt;ref&gt;ritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; There are several instances in ancient   [[Indian epic poetry]] of same sex depictions and unions by gods and goddesses. There are several stories depicting love between those of the same sex, especially among kings and queens. [[Kamasutra]], the ancient [[Ancient India|Indian]] treatise on love talks about feelings for same sexes. [[Transsexuals]] are also venerated e.g. [[Lord Vishnu]] as [[Mohini]] and [[Lord Shiva]] as [[Ardhanarishwara]] (which means half woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://galva108.org/deities.html |title=Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association, Inc |publisher=[[The Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association]] |accessdate=2013-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023063544/http://galva108.org/deities.html |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient West Asia===

====Ancient Israel====
The ancient [[Law of Moses]] (the [[Torah]]) forbids men lying with men (intercourse) in Leviticus 18 and gives a story of attempted homosexual rape in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], the cities being soon destroyed after that. The death penalty was prescribed. In Deuteronomy 22:5, cross-dressing is condemned as being "abominable".

====Ancient Persia====
In Persia homosexuality and homoerotic expressions were tolerated in numerous public places, from monasteries and seminaries to taverns, military camps, bathhouses, and coffee houses. In the early [[Safavids|Safavid]] era (1501–1723), male houses of [[prostitution]] (''amrad khane'') were legally recognized and paid taxes. Persian poets, such as [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]] (d. 1291), [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] (d. 1389), and [[Jami]] (d. 1492), wrote poems replete with homoerotic allusions. The two most commonly documented forms were commercial sex with transgender young males or males enacting transgender roles exemplified by the [[köçek]]s and [[Sufi]] spiritual practices in which the practitioner admired the form of a beautiful boy in order to enter ecstatic states and glimpse the beauty of God.

====Assyria====
In [[Assyria]]n society, [[sex crime]]s were punished identically whether they were homosexual or heterosexual.&lt;ref name="Nissinen"&gt;Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective, by Martti Nissinen, Fortress Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHSNPG85tUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage p. 24–28]&lt;/ref&gt; An individual faced no punishment for penetrating someone of equal [[social class]], a cult prostitute, or with someone whose [[gender role]]s were not considered solidly masculine.&lt;ref name="Nissinen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies, by James Neill, McFarland, 27 Oct 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage p.83]&lt;/ref&gt; Such sexual relations were even seen as good [[Luck|fortune]], with an [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian tablet]], the ''[[Šumma ālu]]'', reading, "If a man copulates with his equal from the rear, he becomes the leader among his peers and brothers".&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RKhFRgR-1awC&amp;q=equal+basis#v=onepage ''The Construction of Homosexuality'', authored by David Greenberg, University of Chicago Press, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epistle.us/hbarticles/neareast.html|title=Homosexuality in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt by Bruce Gerig    in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt|website=epistle.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, homosexual relationships with fellow soldiers, slaves, royal attendants, or those where a social better was [[Top, bottom and versatile|submissive or penetrated]], were treated as bad [[omens]].&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay Rights Or Wrongs: A Christian's Guide to Homosexual Issues and Ministry, by Mike Mazzalonga, 1996, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle Assyrian [[Assyrian law|Law Codes]] dating 1075 BC has a particularly harsh law for [[Sexual orientation and military service|homosexuality in the military]], which reads: "If a man have intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a eunuch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halsall|first1=Paul|title=The Code of the Assura|url=https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.asp|website=[[Internet History Sourcebooks Project]]|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=[[Fordham University]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230918/http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.asp|archivedate=11 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homosexuality, Erik Holland page 334"&gt;The Nature Of Homosexuality, Erik Holland, page 334, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRjGApZVwPIC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=Code%20of%20the%20Assura%20homosexulaity|title=Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar law code reads, "If a seignior lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a [[eunuch]]". This law code condemns a situation that involves homosexual [[rape]]. Any Assyrian male could visit a [[prostitute]] or lie with another male, just as long as false rumors or forced sex were not involved with another male.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Driver and J. C. Miles, The Assyrian Laws (Oxford, Clarendon Press [1935]), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
The "conquest mentality" of the [[ancient Romans]] shaped [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Roman homosexual practices]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. xi; Marilyn B. Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Republic]], a [[Roman citizenship|citizen]]'s political liberty was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion or use by others;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; for the male citizen to submit his body to the giving of pleasure was considered servile.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; As long as a man played the penetrative role, it was socially acceptable and considered natural for him to have [[Pathicus|same-sex relations]], without a perceived loss of his [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|masculinity or social standing]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225, and "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits, and the ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia'' 288a; Thomas Habinek, "The Invention of Sexuality in the World-City of Rome," in ''The Roman Cultural Revolution'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 39; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 545–546. Scholars disagree as to whether the ''Lex Scantinia'' imposed the death penalty or a hefty fine.&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptable same-sex partners were males excluded from legal protections as citizens: [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], male [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]], and the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'', entertainers or others who might be technically free but whose lifestyles set them outside the law.

"Homosexual" and "heterosexual" were thus not categories of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Roman sexuality]], and no words exist in [[Latin]] that would precisely translate these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, ''Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome'' (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; A male citizen who willingly performed [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|oral sex]] or received [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Anal sex|anal sex]] was disparaged, but there is only limited evidence of legal penalties against these men, who were presumably "homosexual" in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 214–215; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In courtroom and political rhetoric, charges of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Effeminacy and transvestism|effeminacy]] and passive sexual behaviors were directed particularly at "democratic" politicians ''([[populares]])'' such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Mark Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, ''The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] addressed the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#The rape of men|rape of a male citizen]] as early as the 2nd century BC, when a ruling was issued in a case that may have involved a man of same-sex orientation. It was ruled that even a man who was "disreputable and questionable" had the same right as other citizens not to have his body subjected to forced sex.&lt;ref&gt;As recorded in a fragment of the speech ''De Re Floria'' by [[Cato the Elder]] (frg. 57 Jordan = [[Aulus Gellius]] 9.12.7), noted and discussed by Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; A law probably dating to the [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] of Julius Caesar defined rape as forced sex against "boy, woman, or anyone"; the rapist was subject to execution, a rare penalty in Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 562–563. See also ''Digest'' 48.5.35 [34] on legal definitions of rape that included boys.&lt;/ref&gt; A male classified as ''infamis'', such as a prostitute or actor, could not as a matter of law be raped, nor could a slave, who was legally classified as property; the slave's owner, however, could prosecute the rapist for property damage.&lt;ref&gt;Under the ''[[Lex Aquilia]]''. See McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality, and the Law in Ancient Rome'', p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman army]] of the Republic, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex in the military|sex among fellow soldiers]] violated the decorum against intercourse with citizens and was subject to harsh penalties, including death,&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; as a violation of [[military discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;Sara Elise Phang, ''Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek historian [[Polybius]] (2nd century BC) lists [[desertion|deserters]], thieves, [[perjury|perjurers]], and "those who in youth have abused their persons" as subject to the ''[[fustuarium]]'', clubbing to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]], ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html#37 6.37.9] (translated as [[bastinado]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources are most concerned with the effects of [[sexual harassment]] by officers, but the young soldier who brought an accusation against his superior needed to show that he had not willingly taken the passive role or prostituted himself.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', pp. 280–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers were free to have [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|relations with their male slaves]];&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of a fellow citizen-soldier's body was prohibited, not homosexual behaviors per se.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 112 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late Republic and throughout the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], there is increasing evidence that men whose lifestyle marked them as "homosexual" in the modern sense served openly.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=jyFdUxqYZ48C&amp;pg=PA285#v=onepage&amp;q=%22more%20tolerant%20of%20homosexual%20relations%20between%20soldiers%22 pp. 285–292.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Roman law did not recognize marriage between men, and in general Romans regarded marriage as a heterosexual union with the primary purpose of producing children, in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating [[Marriage in ancient Rome|traditional marriage rites]]. [[Juvenal]] remarks with disapproval that his friends often attended such ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''Satire'' 2; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Nero]] had two marriages to men, once as the bride (with a [[freedman]] [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]]) and once as the groom. His consort [[Sporus]] appeared in public as Nero's wife wearing the regalia that was customary for the Roman empress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]] ''Life of Nero'' 28–29; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 279ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from measures to protect the prerogatives of citizens, the prosecution of homosexuality as a general crime began in the 3rd century of the Christian era when male prostitution was banned by [[Philip the Arab]]. By the end of the 4th century, after the [[Roman Empire]] had come under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]], passive homosexuality was [[Death by burning|punishable by burning]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia: Three Types of Explanation," in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; "Death by sword" was the punishment for a "man coupling like a woman" under the [[Theodosian Code]].&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'' 9.7.3 (4 December 342), introduced by the sons of Constantine in 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Justinian]], all same-sex acts, passive or active, no matter who the partners, were declared contrary to nature and punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia," p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congo ===
[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] recorded that in the past male [[Azande]] warriors in the northern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] routinely took on young male lovers between the ages of twelve and twenty, who helped with household tasks and participated in [[intercrural sex]] with their older husbands. The practice had died out by the early 20th century, after Europeans had gained control of African countries, but was recounted to Evans-Pritchard by the elders to whom he spoke.&lt;ref name=evanspritchard&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans-Pritchard | first1 = E.

=== Feudal Japan ===
In feudal [[Japan]], homosexuality was recognized, between equals (bi-do), in terms of [[pederasty]] (wakashudo), and in terms of prostitution. The younger partner in a pederastic relationship often was expected to make the first move; the opposite was true in ancient Greece. In religious circles, same-sex love spread to the warrior ([[samurai]]) class, where it was customary for a boy in the ''[[wakashū]]'' age category to undergo training in the martial arts by apprenticing to a more experienced adult man. The man was permitted, if the boy agreed, to take the boy as his lover until he came of age; this relationship, often formalized in a "brotherhood contract",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leupp |first=Gary P. |title=Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |pages=53–54 |isbn=0-520-20909-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6q-PqPDAmIC&amp;pg=PA53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was expected to be exclusive, with both partners swearing to take no other (male) lovers. The [[Samurai]] period was one in which homosexuality was seen as particularly positive. Later when Japanese society became pacified, the middle classes adopted many of the practices of the warrior class.

=== Lesotho ===
Anthropologists [[Stephen O. Murray|Stephen Murray]] and [[Will Roscoe]] reported that women in [[Lesotho]] engaged in socially sanctioned "long term, erotic relationships" called ''[[motsoalle]].''&lt;ref name=murrayroscoe&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boy Wives and Female Husbands: Studies of African Homosexualities |last=Murray |first=Stephen (ed.) |authorlink=Stephen O. Murray |author2=[[Will Roscoe|Roscoe, Will]] (ed.) |year=1998 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-312-23829-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In [[Papua New Guinea]], same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture of certain tribes until the middle of the last century. The [[Etoro tribe|Etoro]] and [[Marind-anim]] for example, even viewed heterosexuality as wasteful and celebrated homosexuality instead. They believed that in sharing semen, they are sharing their life force, yet women simply wasted this force any time they didn't get pregnant after sex. In many traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would "inseminate" him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty.&lt;ref name=melanesia&gt;{{citation |title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia |first=Gilbert H. |last=Herdt |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-08096-3 |pages=128–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;
