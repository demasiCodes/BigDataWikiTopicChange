{{LGBT rights at the UN}}
'''Rights''' affecting '''lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ([[LGBT]]) people vary greatly '''by country''' or jurisdiction — encompassing everything from the legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]] to the [[death penalty for homosexuality]].

Notably, {{as of|2019|lc=y}}, 28 countries recognize [[same-sex marriage]], they are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Perper |first1=Rosie |title=The 28 countries around the world where same-sex marriage is legal |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/where-is-same-sex-marriage-legal-world-2017-11 |accessdate=15 August 2019 |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=12 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, 6 countries effectively impose the death penalty on consensual same-sex sexual acts, with three in Asia (Iran, Saudi Arabia and Yemen) and three in Africa (Nigeria (the northern states), Sudan and Somalia (Jubaland region)). In addition, the death penalty is a possible punishment in 6 other countries: Afghanistan, Brunei, Mauritania, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Iraq has been removed from this list following the elimination of the Islamic State (ISIL/ISIS), it remains as a "de facto" criminalising country due to reports of State prosecution using laws on public indecency, prostitution or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ilga.org/downloads/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2019.pdf|title=State-Sponsored Homophobia 2019|last=Mendos|first=Lucas Ramón|publisher=ILGA|year=2019|isbn=|location=Geneva|pages=15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/04/04/lgbtqi-killings-brunei/|title=Brunei not the only place LGBTQI can be killed for who they love|date=4 April 2019|website=The New Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights, following which the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] issued a report documenting violations of the rights of LGBT people, including [[hate crime]]s, criminalization of [[homosexual activity]], and [[discrimination]]. Following the issuance of the report, the [[United Nations]] urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBT rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.N. council passes gay rights resolution|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/06/17/un.lgbt.rights/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=Jill Dougherty|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN issues first report on human rights of gay and lesbian people|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40743|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=December 15, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Celts===
According to [[Aristotle]], although most "belligerent nations" were strongly influenced by their women, the Celts were unusual because their men openly preferred male lovers (''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' II 1269b).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Percy |first=William A. |title=Pederasty and Pedagogy in Archaic Greece |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1996 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=TCvoj1efp8UC&amp;pg=PA18 |page=18 |isbn=978-0-252-06740-2 |accessdate=2009-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rankin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rankin |first1=David |last2=Ranking |first2=H.D. |title=Celts and the Classical World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdqk4vXqntgC&amp;pg=PA55 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-4151-5090-3 |pages=55 and 78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; H. D. Rankin in ''Celts and the Classical World'' notes that "Athenaeus echoes this comment (603a) and so does [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] (30.9). It seems to be the general opinion of antiquity."&lt;ref name="Rankin"/&gt; In book XIII of his ''[[Deipnosophistae|Deipnosophists]]'', the Roman Greek rhetorician and grammarian [[Athenaeus]], repeating assertions made by [[Diodorus Siculus]] in the 1st century BC (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' 5:32), wrote that Celtic women were beautiful but that the men preferred to sleep together. Diodorus went further, stating that "the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused". Rankin argues that the ultimate source of these assertions is likely to be [[Poseidonius]] and speculates that these authors may be recording "some kind of bonding ritual ... which requires abstinence from women at certain times".&lt;ref name="Rankin"/&gt;

===Ancient India===
Throughout [[Hindu]] and [[Vedic]] texts, there are many descriptions of saints, demigods, and even the Supreme Lord transcending gender norms and manifesting multiple combinations of sex and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alka Pande]] says that alternate sexuality was an integral part of ancient India and homosexuality was considered to be a form of the sacred, drawing upon the examples of the hermaphrodite [[Shikhandi]] and [[Arjuna]] who became a eunuch. [[Ruth Vanita]] argues that ancient India was relatively tolerant and views on it were ambiguous, from acceptance to rejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rbth.com/articles/2012/03/19/what_went_wrong_for_gays_in_india_15190|title=What went wrong for gays in India?|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Hindu texts mention homosexuality and support them. The [[Kamasutra]] mentions homosexuality as a type of sexual pleasure. There are also legends of Hindu gods change gender or are hermaphrodites and engage in relations that would be considered homoerotic in the other case.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Siker, p.10, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N6nYCeP_w8YC&amp;pg=PA10r&amp;dq=ancient+india+homosexuals+poems&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF_vmw5qTiAhXS63MBHdgLBHo4ChDoAQhLMAY#v=onepage&amp;f=false Homosexuality and Religion: An Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality was also practiced in the royal families especially with servants.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Vanita, p. 27 [https://books.google.com/books?id=McoYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=rajatarangini+licentiousness&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhgr7O7aTiAhVO63MBHRYwChgQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=rajatarangini%20licentiousness&amp;f=false Same-Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History]&lt;/ref&gt; Kamasutra also mentions the "svairini" who used to live by herself or with another woman.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Vanita, p. 27 [https://books.google.com/books?id=nGoag6b3JvYC&amp;pg=PA362&amp;dq=kamasutra+brahmin+homosexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhs__b66TiAhVWfisKHS36DEQQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions, Volume 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The king [[Bhagiratha]] is described as being born of sexual union of two queens of the king Dilip, however there is also a patriarchal background represented as the king left no heir and his younger wife took on the role of a man.&lt;ref&gt;Giti Thadani, p. 27 [https://books.google.com/books?id=M0TqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=ancient+india+queens+lesbian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4hZas7aTiAhUF7HMBHU3YBLEQ6AEILDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=queen&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions, Volume 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayoni or non-vaginal sex of all types are punishable in the [[Arthashastra]]. Homosexual acts are however treated as a smaller offence punishable by a fine while unlawful heterosexual sex have much harsher punishment. The [[Dharmaśāstra|Dharmsastras]] especially the later ones prescribed against non-vaginal sex like the [[Vashistha Dharmasutra]]. The [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]] prescribes fines for such acts including those with other men. [[Manusmriti]] prescribes light punishments for such acts.&lt;ref name=DharmaLGBT&gt;p. 50-51, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uP57zh13BqQC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=dharmasastra+ayoni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO3bmPkvXhAhXNh3AKHfKKB8IQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dharmasastra%20ayoni&amp;f=false Sexual Diversity in Asia, c. 600 - 1950], edited by Raquel A.G.

The [[Narada Purana]] in 1.15.936 states that those who have non-vaginal intercourse will go to Retobhojana where they have to live on semen. [[Ruth Vanita]] states that the punishment in afterlife suggested by it is comical and befitting the act. The [[Skanda Purana]] states that those who indulge in such acts will acquire impotency.&lt;ref name=A0&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P2nprDLPRLwC&amp;pg=PT56&amp;dq=skanda+purana+impotent&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgwsfU9_fhAhXZh3AKHYscBTUQ6AEIPzAE Same-Sex Love in India], edited by [[Ruth Vanita]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many tales in Hindu mythology interpreted as representing transsexual people, cross-dressers, bonding women and accounts interpreted to have elements of lesbian relations. These include [[Brihannala]], [[Shikhandi]], the goddess [[Mohini]]. Also in the [[Ramayana]], Lord Shiva transforms into a woman to play with [[Parvati]] in the tale of [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]]. The king [[Mandhatri|Yuvanaswa]] is shown as giving birth to a boy. A few temples represent homosexual relations in their architecture. The most prominent example are that of [[Khajuraho]].&lt;ref&gt;Pramod K. Nayar, p. 180-181 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yGP2KORMViYC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=ardhanarishvara+mohini+transsexual&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA_4H22LbiAhUXTo8KHdC3BCsQ6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=falsePostcolonial Literature: An Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient West Asia===

====Ancient Israel====
The ancient [[Law of Moses]] (the [[Torah]]) forbids men from lying with men (i.e., from having intercourse) in [[Leviticus 18]] and gives a story of attempted homosexual rape in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis 19]], in the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], after which the cities were soon destroyed with "brimstone and fire, from the Lord"&lt;ref name="S&amp;G"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fields |first1=Weston W. |title=Sodom and Gomorrah: History and Motif in Biblical Narrative |date=1997 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=9780567062611 |url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=i9lA3UVoHjAC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Sodom+gomorrah+destroyed&amp;hl=bn&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwtYPVpY3kAhXCfH0KHSMEB5QQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Sodom%20gomorrah℅20destruction&amp;f=false |accessdate=18 August 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SG2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Loader |first1=J.

====Ancient Persia====
In Persia, homosexuality and homoerotic expressions were tolerated in numerous public places, from monasteries and seminaries to taverns, military camps, bathhouses, and coffee houses. In the early [[Safavids|Safavid]] era (1501–1723), male houses of [[prostitution]] (''amrad khane'') were legally recognized and paid taxes. Persian poets, such as [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]] (d. 1291), [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]] (d. 1389), and [[Jami]] (d. 1492), wrote poems replete with homoerotic allusions. The two most commonly documented forms were commercial sex with transgender young males or males enacting transgender roles exemplified by the [[köçek]]s and [[Sufi]] spiritual practices in which the practitioner admired the form of a beautiful boy in order to enter ecstatic states and glimpse the beauty of God.

====Assyria====
In [[Assyria]]n society, [[sex crime]]s were punished identically whether they were homosexual or heterosexual.&lt;ref name="Nissinen"&gt;Homoeroticism in the Biblical World: A Historical Perspective, by Martti Nissinen, Fortress Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-sHSNPG85tUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage p. 24–28]&lt;/ref&gt; An individual faced no punishment for penetrating someone of equal [[social class]], a cult prostitute, or with someone whose [[gender role]]s were not considered solidly masculine.&lt;ref name="Nissinen" /&gt; Such sexual relations were even seen as good [[Luck|fortune]], with an [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian tablet]], the ''[[Šumma ālu]]'', reading, "If a man copulates with his equal from the rear, he becomes the leader among his peers and brothers".&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKhFRgR-1awC&amp;q=equal+basis#v=onepage|title=The Construction of Homosexuality|first=David F.|last=Greenberg|date=15 August 1990|publisher=University of Chicago Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780226306285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epistle.us/hbarticles/neareast.html|title=Homosexuality in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt by Bruce Gerig in the Ancient Near East, beyond Egypt|website=epistle.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, homosexual relationships with fellow soldiers, slaves, royal attendants, or those where a social better was [[Top, bottom and versatile|submissive or penetrated]], were treated as bad [[omens]].&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay Rights Or Wrongs: A Christian's Guide to Homosexual Issues and Ministry, by Mike Mazzalonga, 1996, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle Assyrian [[Assyrian law|Law Codes]] dating 1075 BC has a particularly harsh law for [[Sexual orientation and military service|homosexuality in the military]], which reads: "If a man have intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a eunuch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halsall|first1=Paul|title=The Code of the Assura|url=https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.asp|website=[[Internet History Sourcebooks Project]]|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=[[Fordham University]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230918/http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.asp|archivedate=11 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Homosexuality, Erik Holland page 334"&gt;The Nature Of Homosexuality, Erik Holland, page 334, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gRjGApZVwPIC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q=Code%20of%20the%20Assura%20homosexulaity|title=Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex|isbn=9781453503164|last1=Wilhelm|first1=Amara Das|date=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar law code reads, "If a seignior lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a [[eunuch]]". This law code condemns a situation that involves homosexual [[rape]]. Any Assyrian male could visit a [[prostitute]] or lie with another male, just as long as false rumors or forced sex were not involved with another male.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Driver and J. C. Miles, The Assyrian Laws (Oxford, Clarendon Press [1935]), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
The "conquest mentality" of the [[ancient Romans]] shaped [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Roman homosexual practices]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. xi; Marilyn B. Skinner, introduction to ''Roman Sexualities'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Republic]], a [[Roman citizenship|citizen]]'s political liberty was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion or use by others;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; for the male citizen to submit his body to the giving of pleasure was considered servile.&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; As long as a man played the penetrative role, it was socially acceptable and considered natural for him to have [[Pathicus|same-sex relations]], without a perceived loss of his [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|masculinity or social standing]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225, and "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits, and the ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia'' 288a; Thomas Habinek, "The Invention of Sexuality in the World-City of Rome," in ''The Roman Cultural Revolution'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997), p. 39; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 545–546. Scholars disagree as to whether the ''Lex Scantinia'' imposed the death penalty or a hefty fine.&lt;/ref&gt; Acceptable same-sex partners were males excluded from legal protections as citizens: [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], male [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]], and the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'', entertainers or others who might be technically free but whose lifestyles set them outside the law.

"Homosexual" and "heterosexual" were thus not categories of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Roman sexuality]], and no words exist in [[Latin]] that would precisely translate these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, ''Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome'' (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; A male citizen who willingly performed [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|oral sex]] or received [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Anal sex|anal sex]] was disparaged, but there is only limited evidence of legal penalties against these men, who were presumably "homosexual" in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', pp. 214–215; Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In courtroom and political rhetoric, charges of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Effeminacy and transvestism|effeminacy]] and passive sexual behaviors were directed particularly at "democratic" politicians ''([[populares]])'' such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Mark Antony]].&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, ''The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] addressed the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#The rape of men|rape of a male citizen]] as early as the 2nd century BC, when a ruling was issued in a case that may have involved a man of same-sex orientation. It was ruled that even a man who was "disreputable and questionable" had the same right as other citizens not to have his body subjected to forced sex.&lt;ref&gt;As recorded in a fragment of the speech ''De Re Floria'' by [[Cato the Elder]] (frg. 57 Jordan = [[Aulus Gellius]] 9.12.7), noted and discussed by Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; A law probably dating to the [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]] of Julius Caesar defined rape as forced sex against "boy, woman, or anyone"; the rapist was subject to execution, a rare penalty in Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;Richlin, "Not before Homosexuality," pp. 562–563. See also ''Digest'' 48.5.35 [34] on legal definitions of rape that included boys.&lt;/ref&gt; A male classified as ''infamis'', such as a prostitute or actor, could not as a matter of law be raped, nor could a slave, who was legally classified as property; the slave's owner, however, could prosecute the rapist for property damage.&lt;ref&gt;Under the ''[[Lex Aquilia]]''. See McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality, and the Law in Ancient Rome'', p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman army]] of the Republic, [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex in the military|sex among fellow soldiers]] violated the decorum against intercourse with citizens and was subject to harsh penalties, including death,&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; as a violation of [[military discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;Sara Elise Phang, ''Roman Military Service: Ideologies of Discipline in the Late Republic and Early Principate'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek historian [[Polybius]] (2nd century BC) lists [[desertion|deserters]], thieves, [[perjury|perjurers]], and "those who in youth have abused their persons" as subject to the ''[[fustuarium]]'', clubbing to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]], ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/6*.html#37 6.37.9] (translated as [[bastinado]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient sources are most concerned with the effects of [[sexual harassment]] by officers, but the young soldier who brought an accusation against his superior needed to show that he had not willingly taken the passive role or prostituted himself.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', pp. 280–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers were free to have [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|relations with their male slaves]];&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of a fellow citizen-soldier's body was prohibited, not homosexual behaviors per se.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 112 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; By the late Republic and throughout the [[Roman Empire|Imperial period]], there is increasing evidence that men whose lifestyle marked them as "homosexual" in the modern sense served openly.&lt;ref&gt;Phang, ''The Marriage of Roman Soldiers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=jyFdUxqYZ48C&amp;pg=PA285#v=onepage&amp;q=%22more%20tolerant%20of%20homosexual%20relations%20between%20soldiers%22 pp. 285–292.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Roman law did not recognize marriage between men, and in general Romans regarded marriage as a heterosexual union with the primary purpose of producing children, in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating [[Marriage in ancient Rome|traditional marriage rites]]. [[Juvenal]] remarks with disapproval that his friends often attended such ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''Satire'' 2; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Nero]] had two marriages to men, once as the bride (with a [[freedman]] [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]]) and once as the groom. His consort [[Sporus]] appeared in public as Nero's wife wearing the regalia that was customary for the Roman empress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]] ''Life of Nero'' 28–29; Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'', p. 279ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from measures to protect the prerogatives of citizens, the prosecution of homosexuality as a general crime began in the 3rd century of the Christian era when male prostitution was banned by [[Philip the Arab]]. By the end of the 4th century, after the [[Roman Empire]] had come under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]], passive homosexuality was [[Death by burning|punishable by burning]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia: Three Types of Explanation," in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; "Death by sword" was the punishment for a "man coupling like a woman" under the [[Theodosian Code]].&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'' 9.7.3 (4 December 342), introduced by the sons of Constantine in 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Justinian]], all same-sex acts, passive or active, no matter who the partners, were declared contrary to nature and punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;Groneberg, "Reasons for Homophobia," p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congo ===
[[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]] recorded that in the past male [[Azande]] warriors in the northern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] routinely took on young male lovers between the ages of twelve and twenty, who helped with household tasks and participated in [[intercrural sex]] with their older husbands. The practice had died out by the early 20th century, after Europeans had gained control of African countries, but was recounted to Evans-Pritchard by the elders to whom he spoke.&lt;ref name=evanspritchard&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans-Pritchard | first1 = E.

=== Feudal Japan ===
In feudal [[Japan]], homosexuality was recognized, between equals (bi-do), in terms of [[pederasty]] (wakashudo), and in terms of prostitution.{{cn|date=October 2019}} The younger partner in a pederastic relationship often was expected to make the first move;{{cn|date=October 2019}} the opposite was true in ancient Greece. In religious circles, same-sex love spread to the warrior ([[samurai]]) class, where it was customary for a boy in the ''[[wakashū]]'' age category to undergo training in the martial arts by apprenticing to a more experienced adult man.{{cn|date=October 2019}} The man was permitted, if the boy agreed, to take the boy as his lover until he came of age;{{cn|date=October 2019}} this relationship, often formalized in a "brotherhood contract",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leupp |first=Gary P. |title=Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |pages=53–54 |isbn=978-0-520-20909-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6q-PqPDAmIC&amp;pg=PA53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was expected to be exclusive, with both partners swearing to take no other (male) lovers.{{cn|date=October 2019}}

=== Lesotho ===
Anthropologists [[Stephen O. Murray|Stephen Murray]] and [[Will Roscoe]] reported that women in [[Lesotho]] engaged in socially sanctioned "long term, erotic relationships" called ''[[motsoalle]].''&lt;ref name=murrayroscoe&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boy Wives and Female Husbands: Studies of African Homosexualities |last=Murray |first=Stephen (ed.) |authorlink=Stephen O.

=== Papua New Guinea ===
In [[Papua New Guinea]], same-sex relationships were an integral part of the culture of certain tribes until the middle of the last century. The [[Etoro tribe|Etoro]] and [[Marind-anim]] for example, even viewed heterosexuality as wasteful and celebrated homosexuality instead. They believed that in sharing semen, they are sharing their life force, yet women simply wasted this force any time they didn't get pregnant after sex. In many traditional Melanesian cultures a prepubertal boy would be paired with an older adolescent who would become his mentor and who would "inseminate" him (orally, anally, or topically, depending on the tribe) over a number of years in order for the younger to also reach puberty.&lt;ref name=melanesia&gt;{{citation |title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia |first=Gilbert H. |last=Herdt |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-08096-6 |pages=128–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;
