The countries of the world have a wide variety of laws relating to homosexuality - everything from full [[same-sex marriage]] to the [[death penalty]] as punishment for homosexual acts. Among the first laws on homosexuality ca. ''[[600 BC]]'' are those in ancient Crete and Sparta, which required all adult men to engage in [[pederasty|mentoring homosexual relationships]].

The first recorded law ''against'' homosexuality dates to ''[[550 BC]]'' during the [[Babylonian captivity]] of the [[Jews|Jewish people]], it is recorded in [[Leviticus]] (though some scholars date Leviticus much older), and it prescribes the death penalty for sexual relations between men.  It is largely seen as a distinction between Judaism and [[Paganism]] on par with worshiping "false gods".   At the time homosexuality was incorporated into many Pagan religions.  This pattern was continued throughout history with punitive laws arising from Judaism and its descendants: [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].  With the advent of [[colonialism]] this attitude spread along with political control from the [[imperialism|imperial powers]] of the [[Abrahamic religions]].  In post-colonial times some non-Abrahamic religions have maintained their adoptive views of homosexuality.  Usually an Abrahamic religion is the primary factor when accounting for a law against homosexuality and the major supporter.

In addition to laws against the practice of homosexuality, many countries around the world consider calling a person homosexual sufficient grounds for a libel lawsuit. For example, [[Jason Donovan]] and [[Liberace]] have sued newspapers that ran articles insinuating they were gay; both men won their lawsuits. In [[2003]] in [[Finland]], member of parliament [[Tony Halme]] was threatened with legal action for mistakenly calling president [[Tarja Halonen]] a lesbian.

This is a list of [[laws]] around the world concerning homosexuality. The list is arranged alphabetically by region.  It should be noted that this list should not be assumed to represent a standard for measuring a nation's views, per se. Many nations which retained negative laws for a lengthy period of time, or even retain them today may in practice be societies that are not oppressive of homosexuality, with such laws simply being unenforced [[anachronism|anachronisms]]. Similarly, a country which lacks formal laws against it may possess a culture which is openly hostile and may chose to persecute individuals by other means.

However, the 'public manifestation' law against homosexuality is used against transgender people, effeminate men or any public displays of same-sex affection. In 1997 Penal Code was changed. The offence designated 'public scandal' was changed to "sexual insult" which now includes harassment with "sexual demands" instead of "hassling with homosexual demands".
