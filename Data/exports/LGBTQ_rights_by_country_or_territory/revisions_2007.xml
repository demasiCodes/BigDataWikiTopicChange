{{LGBT}}
The countries of the world have a wide variety of laws relating to sexual relations between people of the same sex - everything from full [[same-sex marriage]] to the [[death penalty]] as punishment for [[homosexual]] conduct. Among the first laws on same-sex relations ca. [[600 BC]] are those in ancient Crete and Sparta, which encouraged all adult men to engage in [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|mentoring homoerotic friendships]].

In addition to laws against the practice of homosexuality, many countries around the world consider calling a person homosexual sufficient grounds for a libel lawsuit. For example, [[Jason Donovan]] and [[Liberace]] have sued newspapers that ran articles insinuating they were gay; both men won their lawsuits.

==History of homosexuality laws==

The first recorded laws ''against'' sexual intercourse between men are dated by scholars to circa [[550 BC]], during the [[Babylonian captivity]] of the [[Jews|Jewish people]]; they are recorded in [[Leviticus]] (though conservative scholars date Leviticus much older), and they prescribe the death penalty. It is largely seen as a distinction between Judaism and [[Paganism]] on par with worshiping "false gods". At the time same-sex relations were incorporated into many Pagan religions.  This pattern was continued throughout history with punitive laws arising from traditional interpretations of Judaism and its descendants: [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. With the advent of [[colonialism]] this attitude spread along with political control from the [[imperialism|imperial powers]] of the nations with [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] state religion. In post-colonial times some non-Abrahamic religions have maintained their adoptive views of homosexuality. Usually an Abrahamic religion is the primary factor when accounting for a law against homosexuality and the major supporter.

Christian psychologists in Europe also attempted to rationalize the negative views of sodomy predominant in Europe in the Middle Ages with secular language, calling it a disease, by which means it was later absorbed as non-religious science in [[Communist state]]s.

==Homosexuality laws==
''This is a list of [[laws]] around the world concerning homosexuality. The list is arranged alphabetically by region. It should be noted that this list should not be assumed to represent a standard for measuring a nation's views, per se. Many nations which retained negative laws for a lengthy period of time, or even retain them today, may in practice be less oppressive of homosexuality than this suggests, with such laws simply being unenforced [[anachronism]]s. Similarly, a country which lacks formal laws against it may possess a culture which is openly hostile and may chose to persecute individuals by other means. No country in the world just criminalizes lesbianism or female-female sex, usually all homosexuality or just male homosexuality is still illegal in about 70 countries and/or even heterosexual sodomy (Sodomy is not just anal sex, it can also include oral sex, fornification or any sexual behavoiur that does not lead to procreation or birth of a child within marriage. The [[age of consent]] is equal - Unless it is noted below.''
