The '''Lavender Scare''' refers to the fear and persecution of [[homosexual]]s in the [[1950s|fifties]] that paralleled the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] [[McCarthyism|Red Scare]].  Because the psychiatric community regarded homosexuality as a [[mental illness]], gay men and lesbians were considered susceptible to [[blackmail]], thus constituting a “security risk.” In 1950, the same year that Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] claimed 205 communists were hiding in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]],  John Puerifory, the Undersecretary of state claimed that there was a "homosexual underground" in the State Department, so&lt;ref&gt;http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/gays-in-govt.html&lt;/ref&gt; the government fired 91 homosexual employees for security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Representative [[Arthur L. Miller|Miller]] ([[Nebraska|NE]]). [http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/gays-in-govt.html "Homosexuals in Government."] ''Congressional Record'' 96:4 ([[March 29]], [[1950]]) p. H4527.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,807544,00.html Smiling Jack], [[Time (magazine)|Time]] in partnership with [[CNN]], ([[August 22]], [[1955]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Because most homosexuals in the 1950s were not "out" and some were married, McCarthey assumed that communists would blackmail homosexuals in the federal government and force them into giving secret information on the US government. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/usa/usnews098.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically (but not publicly known until decades later), McCarthy hired as chief counsel of his Congressional subcommittee a [[closeted]] homosexual, [[Roy Cohn]].  Together, McCarthy and Cohn were responsible for the firing of scores of gay men from government employment, some of whom lost their homes and their families; some even committed suicide. There was also a rumor about  McCarthy and Cohn having a homosexual relationship, but there are no written facts.

Several causes for the Lavender Scare have been suggested, including the growing visibility of homosexuality, shifts in [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy thinking]], a perceived crisis in American [[masculinity]], and political efforts to root out [[New Deal]] conservatives. They also considered homosexuality as unmoral as communism. Because homosexuals were so secretive and would hang out in closed groups they were tagged as being equal and as shameful as communist partisans. 

The term for this persecution was popularized by [[David K. Johnson]] based on [[Lavender (color)#Lavender in human culture|the association of the color lavender with homosexuality]],&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson |first=David K. |title=The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2004 |id= ISBN 0226401901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;and is used in his book [[The Lavender Scare: the Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government.]]
