The '''Lavender Scare''' refers to the fear and persecution of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]s in the 1950s in the United States, which paralleled the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] campaign known as [[McCarthyism]].

Because the psychiatric community regarded homosexuality as a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], gay men and [[lesbian]]s were considered susceptible to [[blackmail]], thus constituting a security risk. U.S. government officials assumed that [[Communism|communist]]s would blackmail homosexual employees of the federal government who would provide them classified information rather than risk exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Gay Today: [http://gaytoday.com/interview/010104in.asp "Historian David K. Johnson: Exposes the U.S. Government's Anti-Gay Crusades"], accessed July 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the same year that Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] claimed 205 communists were working in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], [[Undersecretary]] of State [[John Puerifoy]] said the State Department had allowed 91 homosexuals to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Representative [[Arthur L. Miller|Miller]] ([[Nebraska|NE]]). [http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/gays-in-govt.html "Homosexuals in Government."] ''Congressional Record'' 96:4 (March 29, 1950) p. H4527.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,807544,00.html "Smiling Jack," August 22, 1955], accessed April 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy hired [[Roy Cohn]] &amp;mdash; himself a [[closeted]] homosexual &amp;mdash; as chief counsel of his Congressional subcommittee. Together, McCarthy and Cohn were responsible for the firing of scores of gay men from government employment, and strong-armed many opponents into silence using rumors of their homosexuality.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;David K. Johnson, ''The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, ISBN 0226401901, page ??&lt;/ref&gt;

The term for this persecution was popularized by David K. Johnson's study of this anti-homosexual campaign, ''The Lavender Scare'', which drew its title from the term "lavender lads," used repeatedly by Sen. [[Everett Dirksen]] as a synonym for homosexuals. In 1952 he said that a Republican victory in the November elections would mean the removal of "the lavender lads" from the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Whitfield, ''The Culture of the Cold War'', 2nd ed. (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996), 44; Byron C. Hulsey, ''Everett Dirksen and his Presidents: How a Senate Giant Shaped American Politics''  (University Press of Kansas, 2000), 48-9&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used by ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' magazine, a periodical known for gossiping about the sexuality of politicians and prominent Hollywood stars.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Bernstein, "Lavender Lads Bartone Babes," ''The Advocate'', February 27, 2007. On the association of a variety colors with homosexuality, see Venetia Newall, "Folklore and Male Homosexuality,"  ''Folklore'', vol. 97, no. 2, 1986, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature-length documentary film called ''The Lavender Scare'', based on Johnson's book, is in production.&lt;ref&gt;''University of South Florida News'': [http://news.usf.edu/article/templates/?a=2403 Barbara Melendez, "Book Lavender Scare To Be Documentary," June 9, 2010], accessed July 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
