The '''lavender scare''' refers to the fear and persecution of [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] in the 1950s in the United States and United Kingdom, which paralleled the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] campaign known as [[McCarthyism]]. Gay men and lesbians were often considered communist sympathizers ("[[fellow traveler]]s"), and the era of lavender scare "may be seen as the time when homosexuals became the chief scapegoats of the [[Cold War]]."&lt;ref name=glbtq.com&gt;{{cite web|title=McCarthyism |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/mccarthyism.html|publisher=[[glbtq.com]]|first=Luca|last=Prono|accessdate=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former U.S. Senator [[Alan K. Simpson]] has written: "The so-called 'Red Scare' has been the main focus of most historians of that period of time. A lesser-known element ... and one that harmed far more people was the witch-hunt McCarthy and others conducted against homosexuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Alan K. |chapter=Prologue |title=Dying for Joe McCarthy's Sins: The Suicide of Wyoming Senator Lester Hunt |first2=Rodger |last2=McDaniel |publisher=WordsWorth Press |year=2013|page=x |isbn= 978-0983027591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term for this persecution was popularized by David K. Johnson's 2004 study of this anti-homosexual campaign, ''The Lavender Scare'', which drew its title from the term "[[lavender (color)|lavender]] lads", used repeatedly by Senator [[Everett Dirksen]] as a synonym for homosexuals. In 1952 Dirksen said that a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] victory in the November elections would mean the removal of "the lavender lads" from the [[State Department]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Whitfield, ''The Culture of the Cold War'', 2nd ed. (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996), p. 44; Byron C. Hulsey, ''Everett Dirksen and his Presidents: How a Senate Giant Shaped American Politics'' (University Press of Kansas, 2000), 48–9&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used by ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' magazine, a periodical known for gossiping about the sexuality of politicians and prominent Hollywood stars.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Bernstein, "Lavender Lads Bartone Babes", ''[[The Advocate]]'', February 27, 2007. On the association of a variety colors with homosexuality, see Venetia Newall, "Folklore and Male Homosexuality", ''Folklore'', vol. 97, no. 2, 1986, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

McCarthy often used accusations of homosexuality as a [[smear tactic]] in his anti-communist crusade, often combining the [[Second Red Scare]] with the Lavender Scare.  On one occasion, he went so far as to announce to reporters, "If you want to be against McCarthy, boys, you've got to be either a Communist or a cocksucker."&lt;ref&gt;Cuordileone, K.A.  "'Politics in an Age of Anxiety': Cold War Political Culture and the Crisis in American Masculinity, 1949-1960"  ''The Journal of American History'' 87 (2) (2000): 515-545&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have argued that, in linking communism and homosexuality and psychological imbalance, McCarthy was employing guilt-by-association if evidence for communist activity was lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Joy |last1=Damousi|first2=Mariano Ben |last2=Plotkin|title=Psychoanalysis and Politics: Histories of Psychoanalysis Under Conditions of Restricted Political Freedom|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RhhpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA221|date=5 January 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-992316-8|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Association of communism with "subversives" ===
Both homosexuals and communist party members were seen as subversive elements in American society who all shared the same ideals of [[antitheism]]; rejection of [[Bourgeoisie#Bourgeois culture|bourgeois culture]] and middle-class morality; lack of conformity; they were scheming and manipulative and, most importantly, would put their own agendas above others, in the eyes of the general population.&lt;ref name=glbtq.com/&gt; McCarthy also associated homosexuality and communism as "threats to the "American way of life.""&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Dennis. "Gayness, multicultural education, and community." [https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=K2_VMQyk-ZMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA233 Beyond black and white: New faces and voices in the U.S. Schools] (1997): 233-256.&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality was directly linked to security concerns, and more government employees were dismissed because of their homosexual [[sexual orientation]] than because they were left-leaning or communist. George Chauncey noted that, "The specter of the invisible homosexual, like that of the invisible communist, haunted Cold War America," and homosexuality (and by implication homosexuals themselves) were constantly referred to not only as a disease, but also as an invasion, like the perceived danger of communism and subversives.&lt;ref&gt;Field, Douglas, ed. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DztQtydwimMC American cold war culture]. Edinburgh University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Kenneth S. Wherry|Kenneth Wherry]] similarly attempted to invoke a connection between homosexuality and [[anti-nationalism]]. He said in an interview with [[Max Lerner]] that "You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives."  Later in that same interview he drew the line between patriotic Americans and gay men: "But look Lerner, we're both Americans, aren't we?  I say, let's get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government."&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Max, ''The Unfinished Country: A Book of American Symbols'' Simon and Schuster, 1959 pp 313-316&lt;/ref&gt;

Connections between gay rights groups and so-called subversive elements were not entirely baseless. The Mattachine Society, one of the earliest gay rights groups in the United States, was founded by [[Harry Hay]], a former member of the [[Communist Party USA]], who resigned when the membership condemned his politics as a threat to the organization he had founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lillian Faderman|author2=Stuart Timmons|title=Gay L.A.: A History of Sexual Outlaws, Power Politics, and Lipstick Lesbians |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I5SVsJmVxDUC&amp;pg=PA113|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02288-5 |page=113 |accessdate=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary views of homosexuality ===
Because social attitudes toward homosexuality were overwhelmingly negative and the psychiatric community regarded homosexuality as a [[mental disorder]], [[gay]] men and [[lesbian]]s were considered susceptible to [[blackmail]], thus constituting a security risk. U.S. government officials assumed that [[Communism|communists]] would blackmail homosexual employees of the federal government to provide them classified information rather than risk exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Gay Today |url=http://gaytoday.com/interview/010104in.asp |title=Historian David K. Johnson: Exposes the U.S. Government's Anti-Gay Crusades |first=Raj |last=Ayyar |accessdate=May 8, 2015|date=January 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Loughery, author of a study of gay identity in the 20th century, "few events indicate how psychologically wracked America was becoming in the 1950s ... than the presumed overlap of the Communist and the homosexual menace."&lt;ref name=glbtq.com/&gt;

== Resistance ==
According to Lillian Faderman, the [[LGBT community]] formed a [[subculture]] of its own in this era, constituting "not only a choice of sexual orientation, but of social orientation as well." The [[Mattachine Society]] and the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], which formed the [[homophile]] movements of the U.S., were in many ways defined by McCarthyism and the lavender scare. They were underground organizations that maintained the anonymity of their members.&lt;ref name=glbtq.com/&gt;

==Documentary==
A feature-length documentary film by producer-director Josh Howard, ''The Lavender Scare'', based on Johnson's book, was released in the summer of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=University of South Florida News |url=http://news.usf.edu/article/templates/?a=2403 |first=Barbara |last=Melendez |title=Book ''Lavender Scare'' To Be Documentary |date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/film/2012/03/05/lavender-scare-film-documents-antigay-witch-hunt |title=Film Documents Antigay Witch Hunt |work=[[The Advocate]] |date= March 5, 2012| accessdate= June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
