The '''Lavender Scare''' refers to the fear and persecution of [[homosexual]]s in the [[1950s|fifties]] that paralleled the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] [[McCarthyism|Red Scare]].  Because the psychiatric community regarded homosexuality as a [[mental illness]], gay men and lesbians were considered susceptible to [[blackmail]], thus constituting a “security risk.” In 1950, the same year that Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] claimed 205 communists were hiding in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], the government fired 190 homosexual employees for security reasons. 

Ironically (but not publicly known until decades later), McCarthy hired as chief counsel of his Congressional subcommittee a [[closet|closeted]] homosexual, [[Roy Cohn]].  Together, McCarthy and Cohn were responsible for the firing of scores of gay men from government employment, some of whom lost their homes and their families; some even committed suicide.  {{see|Roy_Cohn#Private_life_and_death}}

Several causes for the Lavender Scare have been suggested, including the growing visibility of homosexuality, shifts in [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy thinking]], a perceived crisis in American [[masculinity]], and political efforts to root out [[New Deal]] conservatives.  

The term for this persecution was coined by [[David K. Johnson]] based on [[Lavender (color)#Lavender in human culture|the association of the color lavender with homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book| last = Johnson | first =David K. | title =The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government | publisher =University of Chicago Press | date =2004 | id =  ISBN 0226401901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
