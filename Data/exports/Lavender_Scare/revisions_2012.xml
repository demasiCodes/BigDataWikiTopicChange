The '''Lavender Scare''' refers to the fear and persecution of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]s in the 1950s in the United States, which paralleled the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] campaign known as [[McCarthyism]].

Because the psychiatric community regarded homosexuality as a [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], gay men and [[lesbian]]s were considered susceptible to [[blackmail]], thus constituting a security risk. U.S. government officials assumed that [[Communism|communist]]s would blackmail homosexual employees of the federal government who would provide them classified information rather than risk exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Gay Today |url=http://gaytoday.com/interview/010104in.asp |title=Historian David K. Johnson: Exposes the U.S. Government's Anti-Gay Crusades |first=Raj |last=Ayyar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the same year that Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] claimed 205 communists were working in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], [[Undersecretary]] of State [[John Peurifoy]] said that the State Department had allowed 91 homosexuals to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Representative [[Arthur L. Miller|Miller]] ([[Nebraska|NE]]).

McCarthy hired [[Roy Cohn]] &amp;mdash; himself a [[closeted]] homosexual &amp;mdash; as chief counsel of his Congressional subcommittee. Together, McCarthy and Cohn were responsible for the firing of scores of gay men from government employment, and strong-armed many opponents into silence using rumors of their homosexuality.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book|first=David K. |last=Johnson |title=The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2004 |ISBN=0-226-40190-1 |at={{Rp | needed = yes |date=February 2012}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term for this persecution was popularized by David K. Johnson's study of this anti-homosexual campaign, ''The Lavender Scare'', which drew its title from the term "lavender lads," used repeatedly by Sen. [[Everett Dirksen]] as a synonym for homosexuals. In 1952 he said that a Republican victory in the November elections would mean the removal of "the lavender lads" from the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Whitfield, ''The Culture of the Cold War'', 2nd ed. (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996), p. 44; Byron C. Hulsey, ''Everett Dirksen and his Presidents: How a Senate Giant Shaped American Politics''  (University Press of Kansas, 2000), 48–9&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used by ''[[Confidential (magazine)|Confidential]]'' magazine, a periodical known for gossiping about the sexuality of politicians and prominent Hollywood stars.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Bernstein, "Lavender Lads Bartone Babes", ''The Advocate'', February 27, 2007. On the association of a variety colors with homosexuality, see Venetia Newall, "Folklore and Male Homosexuality", ''Folklore'', vol. 97, no. 2, 1986, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature-length documentary film by producer-director Josh Howard, ''The Lavender Scare'', based on Johnson's book of the same name, has been scheduled for release in the fall of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=University of South Florida News |url=http://news.usf.edu/article/templates/?a=2403 |first=Barbara |last=Melendez |title=Book Lavender Scare To Be Documentary |date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/film/2012/03/05/lavender-scare-film-documents-antigay-witch-hunt "Film Documents Antigay Witch Hunt," ''The Advocate'' online], March 5, 2012, accessed June 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
