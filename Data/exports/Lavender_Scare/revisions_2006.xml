Because the psychiatric community regarded homosexuality as a mental illness, gays were considered susceptible to blackmail and perverse influences, thus constituting a “security risk.” In 1950, the same year that Senator [[McCarthy]] claimed 205 communists were hiding in the state department, the government fired 190 homosexual employees for security reasons.  

Several causes for the Lavender Scare have been suggested, including the growing visibility of homosexuality, shifts in conspiracy thinking, a perceived crisis in American masculinity, and political efforts to root out New Deal conservatives.  

The name for this persecution was termed by David K. Johnson in his book, "The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government."
