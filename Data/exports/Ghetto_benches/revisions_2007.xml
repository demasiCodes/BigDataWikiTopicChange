'''''Ghetto ławkowe''''' (the "bench [[ghetto]]") was a form of [[segregation]] in the seating of students, primarily [[Jew]]ish students, introduced into [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]'s universities beginning in 1935, first at the [[Lwów Polytechnic]]. By 1937, most [[rector]]s at other institutions of [[higher education]] had adopted it. The "bench-ghetto" system required Jewish  students (as well as [[Ukrainian minority in Poland|Ukrainian]] students) at Polish universities to sit in segregated benches.

The "bench ghetto" marked the peak of [[antisemitism]] in Poland.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; "It antagonized not only Jews, but also many Poles."&lt;ref name="HD"&gt;[[Jerzy Jan Lerski]], ''Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945'', Greenwood Press, 1996, ISBN 0313260079, [http://books.google.com/books?id=FPxhOu_n1VYC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22bench+Ghetto%22&amp;ei=KEkJR6mzFZP-7gLgtciIAg&amp;sig=Nk7j4jCbzZNio2KasodEoPLnnWQ Google Print, p.22]&lt;/ref&gt; "Jewish students protested these policies, along with a few Poles supporting them..."&lt;ref name="Diagh"/&gt; The segregation continued in force until the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] in [[World War II]] and [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Poland's occupation by the Nazis]] suppressed the entire [[education in Poland|Polish education]]al system.

==Background==
Discrimination against [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]] in education in Poland continued a practice of the [[Russian Empire]]'s ''[[numerus clausus]]'' policy, implemented during [[partitions of Poland|Poland's partitions]]. ''Numerus clausus'' restricted, by means of [[quota]]s, the participation of [[Jews]] in public life.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; By the time of Poland's independence ([[1918]]), Polish universities had become strongholds of the [[nationalist]], [[antisemitic]] [[National Democracy]] movement.&lt;ref name="Melzer"&gt;[[Emmanuel Melzer]] ''No Way Out: The Politics of Polish Jewry, 1935-1939'' [[Wayne State University Press]], 1997, ISBN 0878204180, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; 

Poland's Jewish population was [[urbanize]]d and constituted up to 50% of inteligensia, while being only 10% of the total population. This was a result of restrictions in education of Poles of Roman Catholic denomination by the occupants during partitions of Poland (up to 1918). The nationalist sentiment, which led to the country's independence in 1918, was also a advocating to spread education among Polish children. However the Poles of Jewish descent, comming from urban families, outperformed the christian Poles at entrance exams. As a result, the Jewish university-student population was proportionally higher than that of "Christian" Poles; in the early 1920s, Jews constituted over one-third of students attending Polish universities.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Proposals to restrict Jewish enrollment to 10% of the student body (roughly the percentage of Jews living in Poland) were made as early as 1923.&lt;ref name="dia30"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.diapozytyw.pl/pl/site/temat/antysemityzm30 Antysemityzm lat 30-tych], Dia-pozytyw&lt;/ref&gt; However, as this would have violated the Versailles Minorities Treaty, the proposals were rejected. The minorities treaty was renounced in 1934.&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"&gt;[[Feigue Cieplinski]], "[http://www.binghamton.edu/history/resources/bjoh/PolesAndJews.htm Poles and Jews: the Quest for Self-Determination, 1919-1934]," ''Binghamton Journal of History'', fall 2002, last accessed [[2 June]] [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Various means of limiting the number of Jewish students were adopted, seeking to increase the intake of underpivileged, rural Christian Poles. &lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; The situation of Jews improved under  [[Józef Piłsudski]],&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulsson, Gunnar S., ''Secret City: The Hidden Jews of Warsaw, 1940-1945'', [[Yale University Press]], 2003, ISBN 0300095465, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300095465&amp;id=vjJimC--9-kC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Pilsudski,+Jews&amp;sig=LiJGKRzy0dm5BA9pqohB8gmvq5U Google Books, p. 37]&lt;/ref&gt; but after his death in 1935 the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] regained much of their power and the status calling to fight Communism supporters. These were associated with the students of Jewish descent. A student "Green League" was organized in 1931; its platform called for the boycott of Jewish businesses and the enforcement of the ''numerus clausus''. Its members distributed anti-semitic material, and   violent incidents were said to be more widespread during their school holidays. In 1934 a group of [[rabbi]]s petitioned the [[Archbishop]] of Warsaw, [[Aleksander Kakowski]], to stop the "youthful outbursts"; Kakowski responded that the incidents were regrettable, but also stated that Jewish newspapers were "infecting public culture with atheism."&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"/&gt; 

As [[intelligentsia]] were heavily hit by unemployment during the [[Great Depression|economic recession of the 1930s]], agitation against Jewish students intensified.&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; There were growing demands to decrease the number of Jews in science and business so that "Christian" Poles could fill their positions.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt; In November 1931, violence accompanied demands to reduce the number of Jewish students at several Polish universities.&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; The universities' autonomous status contributed to this,&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"&gt; H. Rabinowicz "The Battle of the Ghetto Benches," ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'', New Series, vol. 55, no. 2 (October, 1964), pp. 151-59.&lt;/ref&gt; as university [[rector]]s tended not to call in police to protect Jewish students from attacks on the campuses,&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; and no action was taken against students involved in anti-Jewish violence.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melzer73"/&gt;

==Attempts to legalize segregated seating==
In 1935 students associated with [[National Democracy]] and the [[National Radical Camp]], influenced by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Nuremberg Laws]],&lt;ref name="Melzer72"&gt;Melzer, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; demanded [[Racial segregation|segregation]] of Jews into separate sections in the classrooms, known as "ghetto benches".&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; The majority of Jewish students refused to accept this system of seating, considering it to be a violation of their [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name="Michlic"&gt;[[Joanna Beata Michlic]] ''Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present'', University of Nebraska Press, 2006 p. 113-114&lt;/ref&gt; Facing the refusal to obey the new system, at some universities Polish students attempted to forcibly move Jews to the ghetto benches.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt;

In 1935 anti-Jewish riots broke out at the [[University of Warsaw]] and the [[Warsaw Polytechnic]]. From the campuses violence spread to the streets of Warsaw.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; Subsequently violence broke out at other universities in Poland as well.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; An uninterrupted wave of anti-Jewish violence eventually led to the temporary closure of all of Warsaw's institutions of higher education in November 1935. The [[National Democracy]] press put the blame for the riots on Jews  refusing to comply with special seating arrangements set by Polish students.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;

==Introduction of ghetto benches==
[[Image:Ghetto benches.jpg||thumb|right|Demonstration of Polish students demanding implementation of ghetto benches at [[Lwów Polytechnic]] (1937).]]

Ghetto benches were officially sanctioned for the first time in December 1935 at the [[Lwów Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; Following several violent attacks against Jewish students, school officials ordered that they sit in separate sections, under threat of expulsion.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Penalties were imposed on those who stayed away from classes in protest against segregated seating.&lt;ref name="Melzer73"/&gt; The move to legalize ghetto benches was contested by the Jewish community, which saw it as a dangerous precedent. Ghetto benches were criticized by Jewish deputies to the ''[[Sejm]]'' (Polish parliament). In January 1936 a delegation of representatives of the Jewish community of [[Lviv|Lwów]] (''Lviv'') met with [[Polish Ministry of Education|Poland's Education Minister]], who promised to discuss the issue with school administrations, and in February 1936 the ghetto-bench order was canceled by the Lwów Polytechnic's [[academic senate]].&lt;ref name="Melzer73"&gt; Melzer, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

This setback for the segregationist cause did not stop attempts to establish ghetto benches in Polish universities. Demands for segregated seating were again raised by the [[OZON]]-led [[Union of Young Poland]] (''[[:pl:Związek Młodej Polski|Związek Młodej Polski]]''),&lt;ref name="Melzer74"&gt; Melzer, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[National Democracy|ND]]'' [[All-Polish Youth]], and other nationalist youth organizations.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; The Ministry of Education in Warsaw was opposed to the ghetto benches, declaring ''[[numerus clausus]]'' a violation of the constitution, and another one stated that: "Student ghettos would not be introduced at the Polish Universities".&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; However in light of the continuing serious riots at the university, which the Ministry condemned as "zoological patriotism", the Ministry slowly gave in and decided to withdrew its opposition, hoping that the introduction of the ghetto's would end the riots.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; The ethno-nationalists finally won their campaign for ghetto benches in 1937 when by Ministry decision universities were granted the right to regulate the seating of Polish and Jewish students.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; On [[October 5]] [[1937]] the Rector of [[Warsaw Polytechnic]] ordered the establishment of the institution of ghetto benches in the lecture halls.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Within few days similar orders were given in other universities of Poland &lt;ref name="Melzer76"&gt; Melzer, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; notable Polish professors (for example, [[Marceli Handelsman]], [[Stanisław Ossowski]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], [[Manfred Kridl]]) criticized the introduction of the ghetto benches and declined to enforce either a quota or the ghetto bench system, but their voices were ignored;&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;[[Richard M. Watt]], ''Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate, 1918-1939'', Hippocrene Books, 1998, ISBN 0781806739, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; together with a few Polish students that objected to the ghettos, they would protest by standing in class, refusing to sit down.&lt;ref name="Diagh"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.diapozytyw.pl/pl/site/slownik_terminow/getto_lawkowe/ Getto ławkowe], based on Alina Cała, Hanna Węgrzynek and Gabriela Zalewska, ''Historia i kultura Żydów polskich. Słownik'', WSiP&lt;/ref&gt; The only rector that refused to establish ghetto benches in his university was Prof. [[Stanisław Kulczyński]] of [[Lwów University]]. Facing the decision to sign the order introducing segregated seating, Prof. Kulczyński resigned from his position.&lt;ref name="Melzer76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Nevertheless the instruction ordering special "mandatory seats" for all Jewish students still was issued by the vice-rector of Lwów University the next morning.&lt;ref name="Melzer76"/&gt; The only faculty in Poland that did not have ghetto benches introduced was that of the Children's Clinic in the [[Piłsudski University of Warsaw]] led by Professor [[Mieczysław Michałowicz]], who refused to obey to the Rector's order.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt;

The introduction of ghetto benches was criticized internationally. Over 300 British professors signed an anti-ghetto bench manifesto. [[The International League for Academic Freedom]] in New York published an open letter signed by 202 professors condemning ghetto benches as "alien to the spirit of academic freedom."&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt;

Despite the arguments by [[Sanacja]] government that introduction of ghetto benches would stop the disturbances, anti-Jewish violence continued, resulting in clashes between Jewish and Polish students organisations which even resulted in two fatalities among the Jewish students&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt; and assaults or even assassination attempts &lt;ref name="Connelly"&gt;[[John Connelly]] Captive University: The Sovietization of East German, Czech and Polish Higher Education, UNC Press, 2000, ISBN 0807848654, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; on Polish professors critical of the segregation policies.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt;

The practice of segregated seating for the Jewish students in Poland ended with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|demise of the Polish state]] in the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]] after which most of the Polish education was shut down (see [[Education in Poland during World War II]]) although [[Lwów Polytechnic]] remained. Many Jews perished in the [[Holocaust in Poland]].

==Aftermath==
The ghetto bench system and other anti-Semitic demonstrations of the segment of student youth inspired cruel vengeance mostly among Jewish students of the Polytechnic upon the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|arrival of Soviet authorities]].&lt;ref name="Politechnika"&gt;{{pl icon}} "Politechnika Lwowska 1844-1945".

In the third week of October of 1939 there was a liquidation meeting with [[NKVD]] directed by lieutenant-colonel Jusimow, during which communist Jewish activists recognized four pre-war Polish members of an anti-Semitic organization from their college, and pointed them out to NKVD officers. All four were taken out, beaten and then shot in the hallway right away while the NKVD orchestra was performing inside. Their names were: Henryk Różakolski, Jan Płończak (from the student Bratniak organization), Ludwik Płaczek and Józef Obrocki. The meeting was terminated, shocked people left the hall walking past their murdered colleagues.&lt;ref name="Represje"&gt;{{pl icon}} Zbysław Popławski, "Represje okupantów na Politechnice Lwowskiej".

The search for the guilty continued all the time.&lt;ref name="Politechnika" /&gt; Professor Eberman from the Combustion Engines department, as well as engineers Jerzy Węgierski and Zbigniew Budzianowski were fired, singled out by their Jewish students. In 1940 an assistant professor of sculpture, renown artist and [[Silesian Uprisings|Silesian insurgent]], Jan Nalborczyk, was arrested and bludgeoned in prison. Dr Zdzisław Rodewald from Institute of Chemistry [[Forced disappearance|disappeared]].&lt;ref name="Represje" /&gt; 

This and other instances of collaboration of Poles of Jewish descent with the Soviet occupant alienated them from Poles of Christian denomination. In the eyes of many this confirmed the Communist tendencies of Jewes, and suspition of unloyalty to independent Poland - both of which were primary reasons of antisemitism in Poland. Poles of Jewish descent were also often associated with collaborating with pro-soviet government in the post war Poland which further enforced antisemitic sentiment.
