Under the ''ghetto ławkowe'' system Jewish university students were forced, under threat of expulsion, to sit in a left-hand side section of the lecture halls reserved exclusively for them. This official policy of enforced segregation was often accompanied by acts of violence directed against Jewish students by members of the Polish [[fascist]] organization [[Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny|ONR]] (delegalised already after three months in 1934) and other pro-fascist organizations.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt;

The "bench Ghetto" marked a peak of [[antisemitism]] in Poland between the world wars.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; "It antagonized not only Jews, but also many Poles."&lt;ref name="HD"&gt;[[Jerzy Jan Lerski]], ''Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945'', Greenwood Press, 1996, ISBN 0313260079, [http://books.google.com/books?id=FPxhOu_n1VYC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22bench+Ghetto%22&amp;ei=KEkJR6mzFZP-7gLgtciIAg&amp;sig=Nk7j4jCbzZNio2KasodEoPLnnWQ Google Print, p.22]&lt;/ref&gt; "Jewish students protested these policies, along with some Poles supporting them...[i.e. the Jewish students]"&lt;ref name="Diagh"/&gt; and stood instead of sitting.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt; The segregation continued in force until the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] in [[World War II]] and [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Poland's occupation by Nazi Germany]] suppressed the entire [[education in Poland|Polish education]]al system.

==Background==

The percentage of Poland's Jewish population skyrocketed during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Several hundred thousand joined the already numerous Polish Jewish minority living predominantly in urban environment.&lt;ref name="Kadish"&gt;Sharman Kadish, Bolsheviks and British Jews: The Anglo-Jewish Community, Britain, and the Russian Revolution.

Jewish representation in educational institutions started to increase already during [[World War I]] and, since Jewish culture highly supported education,&lt;ref&gt;Edward H. Flannery, ''The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism'', Paulist Press, 2005, ISBN 0809143240, [http://books.google.com/books?id=r1ulI_N0zW8C&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=Pi%C5%82sudski+antisemite&amp;lr=&amp;ei=ECm3SPjmL4y4yASx4-mbAw&amp;sig=ACfU3U0__xS1-7YHZ_0dFRljVtyjOpgJJg Google Print. p.200]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; the Jewish student population of Polish universities was out of proportion with that of [[gentile]] Poles during the [[Interbellum]]. In the early 1920s, Jews constituted over one-third of all students attending Polish universities.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; At the same time, Polish universities had become the stronghold of the [[nationalist]], [[antisemitic]] [[National Democracy]] supporters.&lt;ref name="Melzer"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Emmanuel Melzer]]|title=No Way Out: The Politics of Polish Jewry, 1935-1939|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|year=1997|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=co3KJikOaBYC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=endecja+polish+universities&amp;lr=lang_en%7Clang_lt%7Clang_pl&amp;sig=gWslTSJDH3z51HdxQlN52zY-YcQ|pages=pp. 71-73|quote=In fact, ever since the attainment of independence, the universities in Poland had been strongholds of Endejca supporters and centers for anti-semitic agitation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Proposals to reinstitute the ''numerus clausus'', which would restrict Jewish enrollment to 10% of the student body (roughly the percentage of Jews living in Poland) were made as early as 1923. However, as this would have violated the [[Little Treaty of Versailles]], the proposals were rejected. In spite of these earlier objections, Poland later renounced the Treaty in 1934.&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"&gt;[[Feigue Cieplinski]], "[http://www.binghamton.edu/history/resources/bjoh/PolesAndJews.htm Poles and Jews: the Quest for Self-Determination, 1919-1934]," ''Binghamton Journal of History'', fall 2002, last accessed [[2 June]] [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; Polish nationalism and hostility towards minorities, particularly Jews, increased.&lt;ref name="dia30"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.diapozytyw.pl/pl/site/temat/antysemityzm30 Antysemityzm lat 30-tych], Dia-pozytyw.

Issues that had earlier been resolved by the [[Russian Empire]] were now decided locally, uniting the Poles while dividing the nation as a whole.&lt;ref name=haller1&gt;{{cite book|author=Celia Stopnicka Heller|year=1993|title=On the Edge of Destruction: Jews of Poland Between the Two World Wars|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GmVt-O3AR34C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=apparent+paradox+of+Jewish+existence+in+independent+Poland&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=SoiZ92QDXdq0s2JjwnkIRAyJizk

Various means of limiting the number of Jewish students were adopted, seeking to reduce the Jewish role in Poland's economic and social life.&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; The situation of Jews improved under  [[Józef Piłsudski]],&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulsson, Gunnar S., ''Secret City: The Hidden Jews of Warsaw, 1940-1945'', [[Yale University Press]], 2003, ISBN 0300095465, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0300095465&amp;id=vjJimC--9-kC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Pilsudski,+Jews&amp;sig=LiJGKRzy0dm5BA9pqohB8gmvq5U Google Books, p. 37]&lt;/ref&gt; but after his death in 1935 the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] regained much of their power and the status of Jewish students deteriorated. A student "Green Ribbon" League was organized in 1931; its members distributed anti-semitic material and called for the boycott of Jewish businesses and the enforcement of the ''numerus clausus''.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna B. Michlic.

Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 a group of [[rabbi]]s petitioned the [[Archbishop]] of Warsaw, [[Aleksander Kakowski]], to stop the "youthful outbursts"; Kakowski responded that the incidents were regrettable, but also stated that Jewish newspapers were "infecting public culture with atheism."&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"/&gt; 

Agitation against Jewish students intensified during the [[Great Depression|economic recession of the 1930s]] and afterwards, as unemployment began to affect the Polish intellectual strata.&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; There were growing demands to decrease the number of Jews in science and business so that "Christian" Poles could fill their positions.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt; In November 1931, violence accompanied demands to reduce the number of Jewish students at several Polish universities.&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; The universities' autonomous status contributed to this,&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"&gt; H. Rabinowicz "The Battle of the Ghetto Benches," ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'', New Series, vol. 55, no. 2 (October, 1964), pp. 151-59.&lt;/ref&gt; as university [[rector]]s tended not to call in police to protect Jewish students from attacks on the campuses,&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; and no action was taken against students involved in anti-Jewish violence.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melzer73"/&gt;

==Attempts to legalize segregated seating==

In 1935 students associated with [[National Democracy]] and the [[National Radical Camp]], influenced by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Nuremberg Laws]],&lt;ref name="Melzer72"&gt;Melzer, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; demanded [[Racial segregation|segregation]] of Jews into separate sections in the classrooms, known as "ghetto benches".&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; The majority of Jewish students refused to accept this system of seating, considering it to be a violation of their [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name="Michlic"&gt;[[Joanna Beata Michlic]] ''Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present'', University of Nebraska Press, 2006 p. 113-114&lt;/ref&gt; At some universities Polish students even attempted to forcibly move Jews to the ghetto benches.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt;

Following [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski]]'s death in 1935, anti-Jewish riots broke out at the [[University of Warsaw]] and the [[Warsaw Polytechnic]]. The violence spread from the campuses to the streets of Warsaw.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; Subsequently violence broke out at other universities in Poland as well.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; An uninterrupted wave of anti-Jewish violence eventually led to the temporary closure of all of Warsaw's institutions of higher education in November 1935. The [[National Democracy]] press put the blame for the riots on Jews  refusing to comply with special seating arrangements set by Polish students.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;

==Introduction of ghetto benches==

[[Image:Ghetto benches.jpg||thumb|left|Demonstration of Polish students demanding implementation of ghetto benches at [[Lwów Polytechnic]] (1937).]]
While the Polish government initially opposed the segregation policies, the universities enjoyed significant level of autonomy and were able to impose their local regulations. Ghetto benches were officially sanctioned for the first time in December 1935 at the [[Lwów Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; Following several violent attacks against the Jewish students, school officials ordered that they sit in separate sections, under threat of expulsion.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Penalties were imposed on those who stayed away from classes in protest against segregated seating.&lt;ref name="Melzer73"/&gt; The move to legalize ghetto benches was contested by the Jewish community, which saw it as a dangerous precedent. Ghetto benches were criticized by Jewish deputies to the ''[[Sejm]]'' (Polish parliament). In January 1936 a delegation of representatives of the Jewish community of [[Lviv|Lwów]] (''Lviv'') met with [[Polish Ministry of Education|Poland's Education Minister]], who promised to discuss the issue with school administrations, and in February 1936 the ghetto-bench order was cancelled by the Lwów Polytechnic's [[academic senate]].&lt;ref name="Melzer73"&gt; Melzer, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

This setback for the segregationist cause did not stop attempts to establish ghetto benches in other Polish universities. Demands for segregated seating were again raised by the [[OZON]]-led [[Union of Young Poland]] (''[[:pl:Związek Młodej Polski|Związek Młodej Polski]]''),&lt;ref name="Melzer74"&gt; Melzer, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[National Democracy|ND]]'' [[All-Polish Youth]], and other nationalist youth organizations.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; The Ministry of Education in Warsaw was opposed to the ghetto benches, declaring ''[[numerus clausus]]'' a violation of the constitution, and Polish Minister of Education stated that: "Student ghettos would not be introduced at the Polish Universities".&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; However in light of the continuing serious riots at the university, which the Ministry condemned as "zoological patriotism", the Ministry slowly gave in and decided to withdrew its opposition, hoping that the introduction of the ghettos would end the riots.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; The ethno-nationalists finally won their campaign for ghetto benches in 1937 when by Ministry decision universities were granted the right to regulate the seating of Polish and Jewish students.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; On [[October 5]] [[1937]] the Rector of [[Warsaw Polytechnic]] ordered the establishment of the institution of ghetto benches in the lecture halls.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Within few days similar orders were given in other universities of Poland &lt;ref name="Melzer76"&gt; Melzer, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; notable Polish professors (for example, [[Marceli Handelsman]], [[Stanisław Ossowski]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], [[Manfred Kridl]]) criticized the introduction of the ghetto benches and declined to enforce either a quota or the ghetto bench system, but their voices were ignored;&lt;ref name="Watts"&gt;[[Richard M. Watt]], ''Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate, 1918-1939'', Hippocrene Books, 1998, ISBN 0781806739, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; together with a few Polish students that objected to the ghettos, they would protest by standing in class, refusing to sit down.&lt;ref name="Diagh"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.diapozytyw.pl/pl/site/slownik_terminow/getto_lawkowe/ Getto ławkowe], based on Alina Cała, Hanna Węgrzynek and Gabriela Zalewska, ''Historia i kultura Żydów polskich. Słownik'', WSiP&lt;/ref&gt; The only rector that refused to establish ghetto benches in his university was Prof. [[Stanisław Kulczyński]] of [[Lwów University]]. Facing the decision to sign the order introducing segregated seating, Prof. Kulczyński resigned from his position.&lt;ref name="Melzer76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Nevertheless the instruction ordering special "mandatory seats" for all Jewish students still was issued by the vice-rector of Lwów University the next morning.&lt;ref name="Melzer76"/&gt; The only faculty in Poland that did not have ghetto benches introduced was that of the Children's Clinic in the [[Piłsudski University of Warsaw]] led by Professor [[Mieczysław Michałowicz]], who refused to obey to the Rector's order.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Some fifty-six professors of Warsaw, Poznań, and Wilno universities signed a protest against the Ghetto benches in December 1937. The total number was nearly 100, about one in every six Polish professors. The list included the "elite of Polish scholarship", signatories such as [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], sociologists [[Józef Chałasiński]], [[Stanisław Ossowski|Stanisław]] and [[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Jan Stanisław Bystroń]], biologists [[Stanisław Kulczyński]] and [[Jan Dembowski]], psychologist [[Władysław Witwicki]], physicist [[Konstanty Zakrzewski]], and historians [[Seweryn Wysłouch]], [[Tadeusz Manteuffel]] and [[Natalia Gąsiorowska]].&lt;ref name="Connelly"&gt;John Connelly, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=OyU6o8V_K90C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=%22in+solidarity+with+students+who+stood+in+protest+of+the+ghetto+benches%22&amp;sig=rA2C7KuIebe7kgRtU15yN4aKxzo  Captive University], UNC Press, 2000, 456 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of ghetto benches was criticized internationally. Over 300 British professors signed an anti-ghetto bench manifesto. [[The International League for Academic Freedom]] in New York published an open letter signed by 202 professors condemning ghetto benches as "alien to the spirit of academic freedom."&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt;

Despite the arguments by [[Sanacja]] government that introduction of ghetto benches would stop the disturbances, anti-Jewish violence continued, resulting in clashes between Jewish and Polish students organisations which even resulted in two fatalities among the Jewish students&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt; and assaults or even assassination attempts &lt;ref name="Connelly"&gt;[[John Connelly (historian)|John Connelly]] Captive University: The Sovietization of East German, Czech and Polish Higher Education, UNC Press, 2000, ISBN 0807848654, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; on Polish professors critical of the segregation policies.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt;


==Aftermath==
The ghetto bench system and other anti-Semitic demonstrations of the segment of student youth inspired vengeance among some Jewish students of [[Lwów Polytechnic]] upon the arrival of the Soviet authorities, following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland]].&lt;ref name="Politechnika"&gt;{{pl icon}} "Politechnika Lwowska 1844-1945".

The practice of segregated seating for the Jewish students in Poland ended with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|demise of the Polish state]] in the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]] after which most of the Polish education was shut down (see [[Education in Poland during World War II]]) although [[Lwów Polytechnic]] remained. Most [[Polish Jews]] perished in the [[Holocaust in Poland]].
