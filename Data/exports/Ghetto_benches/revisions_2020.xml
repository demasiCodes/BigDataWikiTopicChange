'''Ghetto benches''' (known in Polish as ''getto ławkowe'')&lt;ref name="adl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="netfirms"/&gt; was a form of official segregation in the seating of university students, introduced in 1935 at the [[Lwow Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="Antisemitism and Its Opponents in Modern Poland"/&gt; [[Rector (academia)|Rectors]] at other [[higher education]] institutions in the [[Second Polish Republic]] had adopted this form of [[racial segregation| segregation]] when the practice became conditionally legalized by 1937.&lt;ref name="maxveritas"/&gt; Under the ''ghetto ławkowe'' system, [[Jewish]] university students were required under threat of expulsion to sit in a left-hand side section of the lecture halls reserved exclusively for them. This official policy of enforced segregation was often accompanied by acts of violence directed against Jewish students by members of the [[National Radical Camp (1934)|ONR]] (outlawed after three months in 1934) and other extreme right and anti-Semitic organizations like the [[National Democracy]] movement.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eliyahu Yones 2004 25"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliyahu Yones|title=Smoke in the Sand: The Jews of Lvov in the War Years 1939-1944|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=70_5lXXSL6YC&amp;pg=PA25|year=2004|publisher=Gefen Books|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seating in benches marked a peak of [[antisemitism]] in Poland between the world wars according to [[Jerzy Jan Lerski]].&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; It antagonized not only Jews, but also many Poles.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Jewish students protested these policies, along with some Poles who supported them by standing instead of sitting.&lt;ref name="Diagh"/&gt; The segregation continued until the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] in [[World War II]]. [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Poland's occupation by Nazi Germany]] suppressed the entire [[education in Poland|Polish education]]al system. In the eastern half of Poland annexed by the [[Soviet Union]], similar discriminatory policies were lifted and replaced with other repressive actions against Jews.&lt;ref name="Tomasz Kamusella, Krzysztof Jaskułowski 2009 203"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tomasz Kamusella, Krzysztof Jaskułowski|title=Nationalisms Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_0rT6V_OV4C&amp;pg=PA203|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang AG, International Academic Publishers|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{further|History of the Jews in 20th-century Poland}}
The percentage of Poland's Jewish population increased greatly during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Following Poland's return to independence, several hundred thousand Jews joined the already numerous Polish Jewish minority living predominantly in the cities.&lt;ref name="Kadish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson"/&gt; The new arrivals were the least assimilated of all European Jewish communities of that period.&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; [[Polish Jews|Jews]] formed the second largest minority after [[Ukrainians]], of about 10 percent of the total population of the [[Polish Second Republic]]. Jewish representation in the institutions of higher learning began to increase already during [[World War I]]. By early 1920s, Jews constituted over one-third of all students attending Polish universities.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; The difficult situation in the private sector, compounded by the [[Great Depression]],&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Timothy Snyder |first=Timothy |last=Snyder |title=The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569–1999 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-10586-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&amp;pg=PA144 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a massive enrollment in universities. In 1923 the Jewish students constituted 62.9 percent of all students of [[stomatology]], 34 percent of medical sciences, 29.2 percent of philosophy, 24.9 percent of chemistry and 22.1 percent of law (26 percent by 1929) at all Polish universities. Their number, which remained out of proportion with that of the overwhelmingly [[gentile]] population of Poland during the [[Interbellum]], were the probable cause of a backlash.&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sytuacja prawna mniejszosci żydowskiej w Drugiej Rzeczypospolitej |trans-title=The legal status of the Jewish minority in the Second Republic |at=pp. 65–66 (20/38 in PDF) |author=Anna Jaskóła, [[University of Wrocław]] |publisher=Wydział Prawa, Administracji i Ekonomii.

Proposals to reinstitute the ''[[numerus clausus]]'', which would restrict Jewish enrollment to 10 percent of the student body (roughly the percentage of Jews living in Poland) were made as early as 1923. However, the proposals were rejected as they would have violated the [[Little Treaty of Versailles]]. In spite of these earlier objections, Poland later renounced the Treaty in 1934.&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"/&gt; Polish nationalism and hostility towards minorities, particularly Jews, increased.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt;  Discriminatory policies regarding [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]] in education in Poland continued the practice of the [[Russian Empire]]'s ''numerus clausus'' policy, implemented by the Empire during [[partitions of Poland|Poland's partitions]], which restricted, by means of [[Jewish quota|quota]]s, the participation of [[Jews]] in public life.&lt;ref name="HD"/&gt; Issues that had earlier been resolved by the [[Russian Empire]] were now decided locally, uniting the Poles while dividing the nation as a whole.&lt;ref name="haller1"/&gt;

Various means of limiting the number of Jewish students were adopted, seeking to reduce the Jewish role in Poland's economic and social life.&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; The situation of Jews improved under  [[Józef Piłsudski]],&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; but after his death in 1935 the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] regained much of their power and the status of Jewish students deteriorated. A student "Green Ribbon" League was organized in 1931; its members distributed anti-semitic material and called for the boycott of Jewish businesses and the enforcement of the ''numerus clausus''.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google4"/&gt; In 1934 a group of [[rabbi]]s petitioned the [[Archbishop]] of Warsaw, [[Aleksander Kakowski]], to stop the "youthful outbursts"; Kakowski responded that the incidents were regrettable, but also stated that Jewish newspapers were "infecting public culture with atheism."&lt;ref name="Cieplinski"/&gt;

Agitation against Jewish students intensified during the [[Great Depression|economic recession of the 1930s]] and afterwards, as unemployment began to affect the Polish intellectual strata.&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; There were growing demands to decrease the number of Jews in science and business so that Christian Poles could fill their positions.&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt; In November 1931, violence accompanied demands to reduce the number of Jewish students at several Polish universities.&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; The universities' autonomous status contributed to this,&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; as university [[Rector (academia)|rector]]s tended not to call in police to protect Jewish students from attacks on the campuses,&lt;ref name="Melzer"/&gt; and no action was taken against students involved in anti-Jewish violence.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melzer73"/&gt;

==Attempts to legalize segregated seating==
In 1935, students associated with [[National Democracy]] and the [[National Radical Camp (1934)|National Radical Camp]], influenced by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Nuremberg Laws]],&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; demanded [[Racial segregation|segregation]] of Jews into separate sections in the classrooms, known as "ghetto benches".&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; The majority of Jewish students refused to accept this system of seating, considering it to be a violation of their [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; At some universities Polish students even attempted to forcibly move Jews to the ghetto benches.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt;

Following [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski]]'s death in 1935, anti-Jewish riots broke out at the [[University of Warsaw]] and the [[Warsaw Polytechnic]]. The violence spread from the campuses to the streets of Warsaw.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; Subsequently violence broke out at other universities in Poland as well.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; The student riots and violence were however mutual. Especially Jewish students from Academic Zionist Association "Kadimah" (Akademicki Związek Syjonistyczny "Kadimah") were involved in violence against Polish students.&lt;ref name="kulińska"/&gt; An uninterrupted wave of anti-Jewish violence eventually led to the temporary closure of all of Warsaw's institutions of higher education in November 1935. The [[National Democracy]] press put the blame for the riots on Jews  refusing to comply with special seating arrangements set by Polish students.&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt;

==Introduction of ghetto benches==
[[File:Żądamy urzędowego getta Obóz Narodowo-Radykalny Politechnika Lwowska.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration of Polish students demanding implementation of ghetto benches at [[Lwów Polytechnic]] in 1930s.]]

While the Polish government initially opposed the segregation policies, the universities enjoyed significant level of autonomy and were able to impose their local regulations. Ghetto benches were officially sanctioned for the first time in December 1935 at the [[Lwów Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="Melzer72"/&gt; Following several violent attacks against the Jewish students, school officials ordered that they sit in separate sections, under threat of expulsion.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Penalties were imposed on those who stayed away from classes in protest against segregated seating.&lt;ref name="Melzer73"/&gt; The move to legalize ghetto benches was contested by the Jewish community, which saw it as a dangerous precedent. Ghetto benches were criticized by Jewish members of the ''[[Sejm]]''. In January 1936, a delegation of representatives of the Jewish community of [[Lviv|Lwów]] met with [[Polish Ministry of Education|Poland's Education Minister]], who promised to discuss the issue with school administrations, and in February 1936 the ghetto-bench order was cancelled by the Lwów Polytechnic's [[academic senate]].&lt;ref name="Melzer73"/&gt;

This setback for the segregationist cause did not stop attempts to establish ghetto benches in other Polish universities. Demands for segregated seating were again raised by the [[Obóz Zjednoczenia Narodowego|OZON]]-led [[Union of Young Poland]] (''[[:pl:Związek Młodej Polski|Związek Młodej Polski]]''),&lt;ref name="Melzer74"/&gt; the ''[[National Democracy|ND]]'' [[All-Polish Youth]], and other nationalist youth organizations.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; The Ministry of Education in Warsaw was opposed to the ghetto benches, declaring ''[[numerus clausus]]'' a violation of the constitution, and Polish Minister of Education stated that: "Student ghettos would not be introduced at the Polish Universities".&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; However, in light of the continuing serious riots at the university, which the Ministry condemned as "zoological patriotism", the Ministry slowly gave in and decided to withdraw its opposition, hoping that the introduction of the ghettos would end the riots.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; The ethno-nationalists finally won their campaign for ghetto benches in 1937 when by Ministry decision universities were granted the right to regulate the seating of Polish and Jewish students.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; On October 5, 1937, the Rector of [[Warsaw Polytechnic]] ordered the establishment of the institution of ghetto benches in the lecture halls.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Within a few days, similar orders were given in other universities of Poland.&lt;ref name="Melzer76"/&gt;

Over 50 notable Polish professors (including [[Marceli Handelsman]], [[Stanisław Ossowski]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], and [[Manfred Kridl]]) criticized the introduction of the ghetto benches,&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; and refused to enforce either a quota, or the ghetto bench system, but their voices were ignored together with those gentile students who objected to the policy;&lt;ref name="Watts"/&gt; they would protest by standing in class, and refusing to sit down.&lt;ref name="Diagh"/&gt; Rector [[Władysław Marian Jakowicki]] of the [[Stefan Batory University]] in [[Vilna|Wilno]] (Vilnius) resigned from his position in protest of the introduction of the benches.&lt;ref name="Hass1999"/&gt; Another rector who refused to establish ghetto benches in his university was Prof. [[Stanisław Kulczyński]] of [[Lwów University]]. Facing the decision to sign the order introducing segregated seating, Prof. Kulczyński resigned from his position instead of signing it.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melzer76"/&gt; Nevertheless, the instruction ordering special "mandatory seats" for all Jewish students still was issued by the vice-rector of Lwów University the next morning.&lt;ref name="Melzer76"/&gt; The only faculty in Poland that did not have ghetto benches introduced was that of the Children's Clinic in the [[Piłsudski University of Warsaw]] led by Professor [[Mieczysław Michałowicz]], who refused to obey to the Rector's order.&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt; Some fifty-six professors of universities in Warsaw, Poznań, and Wilno signed a protest against the Ghetto benches in December 1937. The list included the "elite of Polish scholarship", such as [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]]; sociologists [[Józef Chałasiński]], [[Stanisław Ossowski|Stanisław]], [[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Jan Stanisław Bystroń]]; biologists [[Stanisław Kulczyński]] and [[Jan Bohdan Dembowski|Jan Dembowski]]; psychologist [[Władysław Witwicki]]; physicist [[Konstanty Zakrzewski]]; as well as historians [[Seweryn Wysłouch]] and [[Tadeusz Manteuffel]].&lt;ref name="Connelly"/&gt;

The introduction of ghetto benches was criticized internationally. Over 300 British professors signed an anti-ghetto bench manifesto. In New York, the League for Academic Freedom published an open letter signed by 202 professors condemning ghetto benches as "alien to the spirit of academic freedom."&lt;ref name="Rabinowicz"/&gt;

Despite the arguments by [[Sanacja]] government that introduction of ghetto benches would stop the disturbances, the clashes between Jewish and gentile youth resulted in two fatalities among the Jewish students,&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; and further assaults, or even an assassination attempt on Polish professor Konrad Górski critical of the segregation policies.&lt;ref name="Connelly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dia30"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The ghetto bench system and other anti-Semitic demonstrations of the segment of student youth inspired vengeance among some Jewish students of [[Lwów Polytechnic]] upon the arrival of the Soviet authorities, following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasion of Poland]].&lt;ref name="Politechnika"/&gt;

The practice of segregated seating for the Jewish students in Poland ended with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|demise of the Polish state]] in the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. After which most Polish educational institutions were shut down (see [[Education in Poland during World War II]]) although [[Lwów Polytechnic]] remained. Most [[Polish Jews]] perished during the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German occupation of Poland]] in the [[Holocaust in Poland|Holocaust]].
