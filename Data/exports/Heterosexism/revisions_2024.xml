'''Heterosexism''' is a system of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[bias]], and [[discrimination]] in favor of [[heterosexuality]] and heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name="JungSmith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Patricia Beattie|author2=Smith, Ralph F.|title=Heterosexism: An Ethical Challenge|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1696-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/heterosexismethi0000jung}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Elizabeth Cramer, it can include the belief that all people are or should be [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] and that heterosexual relationships are the only [[Norm (social)|norm]]&lt;ref name="Cramer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Cramer|title=Addressing Homophobia and Heterosexism on College Campuses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqAAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=5 March 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-82328-5|page=2|quote=The definition for heterosexism that I used for authors in the collection is: The expectation that all persons should be or are heterosexual.

Although heterosexism is defined in the online editions of the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' and the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary]]'' as anti-gay [[discrimination]] or prejudice "by heterosexual people"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/heterosexism|title=Yahoo|access-date=4 July 2016|archive-date=29 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201517/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/heterosexism|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "by heterosexuals",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heterosexism|title=Definition of HETEROSEXISM|access-date=4 July 2016|archive-date=21 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421182730/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heterosexism|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, people of any [[sexual orientation]] can hold such attitudes and bias, and can form a part of [[internalized homophobia|internalised hatred]] of one's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ego.thechicagoschool.edu/s/843/images/editor_documents/heterosexism.doc |title=Heterosexism and Internalized Heterosexism |author=Kira Weidner |access-date=3 September 2014 |archive-date=4 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904120027/http://ego.thechicagoschool.edu/s/843/images/editor_documents/heterosexism.doc |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexism as discrimination ranks [[gay men]], [[lesbian]]s, [[bisexual]]s and other sexual minorities as [[second-class citizen]]s with regard to various legal and [[civil rights]], economic opportunities, and [[social equality]] in many of the world's jurisdictions and societies. It is often related to [[homophobia]].

== Background ==
While the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary]]'' notes the first use of the term heterosexism as having occurred in 1972, the term was first published in 1971 by [[gay rights activist]], [[Craig Rodwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodwell, Craig. ' 'The Tarnished Golden Rule' ' pg. 5, QQ Magazine, Queen's Quarterly Publishing, New York. (January/February 1971 issue, Vol. 3, No. 1) Retrieved 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology and usage===
Similar terms include "heterocentrism" and "heterosexualism".&lt;ref&gt;Corsini, Raymond J. (1992). ''The Dictionary of Psychology''. {{ISBN|1-58391-328-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the well-established term ''heterosexism'' is often explained as a [[Neologism|coinage]] modeled on ''[[sexism]]'', the derivation of its meaning points more to (1.) ''heterosex(ual)'' + ''-ism'' than (2.) ''hetero-'' + ''sexism''. 

Given this lack of [[Transparency (linguistic)#Descriptive|semantic transparency]], researchers, outreach workers, [[critical theorists]] and [[LGBTQ]] activists have proposed and use terms such as ''institutionalized homophobia'', ''state(-sponsored) homophobia'',&lt;ref&gt;International Lesbian and Gay Association. [http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1058&amp;FileCategory=10&amp;ZoneID=7 "State-sponsored Homophobia"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023063034/http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1058&amp;FileCategory=10&amp;ZoneID=7 |date=23 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''sexual prejudice'', ''anti-gay [[bigotry]]'', ''[[straight privilege]]'', ''[[La pensée straight|The Straight Mind]]'' (a collection of essays by French writer [[Monique Wittig]]), ''heterosexual bias'', ''[[compulsory heterosexuality]]''&lt;ref&gt;LGBTQ on-line encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer culture&lt;/ref&gt; or the much lesser known terms ''heterocentrism'', ''[[homonegativity]]'', and from [[gender theory]] and [[queer theory]], ''[[heteronormativity]]''. However, not all of these descriptors are synonymous to ''heterosexism''.

===Contrast to homophobia===

''[[Homophobia]]'', a form of heterosexism, refers both to "unreasoning fear of or [[antipathy]] towards homosexuals and homosexuality"&lt;ref name=dictionary.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homophobia|title=Dictionary.com|access-date=29 January 2008|year=2008|publisher=Dictionary.com|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304210844/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homophobia|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to "behavior based on such a feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia |title=homophobia – Dictionary definition and pronunciation – Yahoo!

''Gender, Race, and Class in Media: A Text-Reader''. {{ISBN|0-7619-2261-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and stems from the [[essentialist]] cultural notion that [[maleness]]-[[masculinity]] and femaleness-[[femininity]] are complementary.

Psychology professor Gregory M. Herek states that "[Heterosexism] operates through a dual process of invisibility and attack. Homosexuality usually remains culturally invisible; when people who engage in homosexual behavior or who are identified as homosexual become visible, they are subject to attack by society."&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/prej_defn.html |author= Gregory M.

===Parallels and intersections===
{{Rquote|right|Using the term heterosexism highlights the parallels between antigay sentiment and other forms of prejudice, such as [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[sexism]].  |[[Gregory M. Herek]], researcher, author, and professor of psychology at [[University of California at Davis|UC Davis]].&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt;}}

It has been argued that the concept of heterosexism is similar to the concept of [[racism]] in that both ideas promote privilege for dominant groups within a given society. For example, borrowing from the racial concept of [[white privilege]], the concept of [[heterosexual privilege]]&lt;ref name="genderknot149"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Allan J.|title=The Gender Knot|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|year=1997|page=149|isbn=1-56639-519-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been applied to benefits of (presumed) heterosexuality within society that heterosexuals take for granted. The analogy is that just as racism against non-white people places white people as superior to [[Person of color|people of color]], heterosexism places heterosexual people or relationships as superior to [[non-heterosexual]] ones. In trying to rebut this premise, some commentators point to differences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bet.com/news/youthvote/4-reasons-why-gay-is-not-the-new-black/4|title=Celebrities|access-date=4 July 2016|archive-date=9 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220309212643/https://www.bet.com/vertical/jo1ilh/celebrity|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the categories of race and sexual orientation, claiming they are too complex to support any generalizations. For example, "[[Diversity training|trainer on diversity]]" and consultant Jamie Washington has commented, although heterosexism and racism are "woven from the same fabric" they are "not the same thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://susquehanna.edu/crusader/article.cfm?IssueID=59&amp;SectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=2573 |title=Issues of race and sexuality discussed, Susquehanna Crusader Online, accessed Aug 29, 2009  |access-date=29 August 2009 |archive-date=8 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008182457/http://susquehanna.edu/crusader/article.cfm?IssueID=59&amp;SectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=2573 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some American Conservative leaders such as Rev.

Heterosexism can also [[Intersectionality|intersect]] with racism by further emphasizing differences among arbitrary groups of people.&lt;ref name="tatum22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tatum|first=Beverly|title=Why are all the Black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?|publisher=Basic Books|year=1997|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, heterosexism can compound the effects of racism by:
* promoting injustices towards a person already facing injustices because of their race
* establishing [[social hierarchies]] that allow one group more privilege than other groups.

Likewise, racism can allow LGBT people to be subjected to additional discrimination or violence if they belong to or are considered a part of a socially devalued racial category.&lt;ref&gt;(2008) Heterosexism and Homophobia.

[[File:Save Our Children From Homosexuality Brochure.jpg|thumb|upright|Brochure used by [[Save Our Children]] in 1977]]
Heterosexism as a set of beliefs and attitudes relies on a core tenet according to which [[heteronormativity|homosexuality and bisexuality do not normally exist]] and, as such, constitute [[mental disorder|mental illnesses]] or [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behaviors]].&lt;ref name="genderknot17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Allan J.|title=The Gender Knot|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|year=1997|page=17|isbn=1-56639-519-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a heterosexist ideology or [[mindset]], the concept of [[sexual orientation]] is rejected or deemed irrelevant. A set of more nuanced heterosexist views, which some may consider faith, [[dogma]], [[Moral absolutism|universal truths]], natural law, [[Appeal to authority|appeals to authority]], or popular beliefs, but others consider to be [[conventional wisdom]] or [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] knowledge can include, among others, the following:

* Non-heterosexual people should keep their sexual orientations private (i.e., they should remain "[[closeted]]").&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/sup&gt;
* The attitude that gay men are not [[machismo|"real" men]] or lesbians are not "real" women because of the socially pervasive view that heterosexual attractions or activities are the "norm" and therefore superior.&lt;ref name="genderknot149" /&gt;
* "God created [[Adam and Eve]], not [[Adam and Steve]] (or Madame and Eve)" and similar essentialist cultural notions that maleness-masculinity and femaleness-femininity are complementary;
* Heterosexuality alone being natural, good and right.&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/sup&gt;
* The idea that (in the words of [[Anita Bryant]] during her [[Save Our Children]] campaign): "homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must [[Homosexual recruitment|recruit]] our children."
* Because of their lifestyle, homosexuals do not have families with children, so they undermine the survival of the human race ([[natalism]]).
* Homosexuality is an affectional or [[mental disorder]] or simply a social ill, therefore, it can be cured or stamped out. If it is not eradicated, it will lead to [[Social solidarity|social disintegration]] and [[societal collapse]].
* Homosexuals can be [[conversion therapy|converted]] to heterosexuality.&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;/sup&gt;

In an attempt to bring awareness to people who exhibit heterosexist views but are possibly not aware of it, Mark Rochlin constructed a set of questions in 1977 which are questions that non-heterosexual people are often exposed to, but not heterosexuals, such as "''What do you think caused your sexuality?''" This heterosexuality questionnaire is often distributed around college campuses to bring awareness of heterosexist sexual prejudice against LGBT persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkpractice.co.uk/quaire.htm|title=The Pink Practice – Heterosexuality Questionnaire|access-date=4 July 2016|archive-date=2 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502215246/http://www.pinkpractice.co.uk/quaire.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional level===
As well as comprising attitudes held by an individual or a social group, heterosexism can also exist as the expression of attitudes within an institution. As a result, schools, hospitals, and correctional facilities can act as a showcase for heterosexist attitudes in various ways. First, schools may implement these attitudes and ideas through unequal and inconsistent disciplinary actions. One such example is meting out harsher punishment to a same-sex couple violating the school ground rules while allowing a heterosexual couple to pass with a more lenient disciplinary action for an equal or identical violation. Also, hospitals may limit patient visiting only to immediate family, i.e., relatives, and exclude same-sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;Heterosexism and Homophobia. Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, 2, 1–4. Retrieved 31 March 2008 from Gale Virtual Reference Library: http://find.galegroup.com/ips/start.do?prodId=IPS {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107141711/http://find.galegroup.com/ips/start.do?prodId=IPS |date=7 January 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexism affects the family in several ways. For example, in many countries around the world, [[same-sex marriage]] is not allowed, so non-heterosexual persons must remain unmarried or enter into heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref name="TFDASJ" /&gt; Many countries also deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples, including custodial and adoption rights for children, Social Security benefits, [[Durable power of attorney|automatic durable power of attorney]], and hospital spousal rights.&lt;ref name="TFDASJ"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Maurianne |author2=Bell, Lee Anne |author3=Griffin, Pat|title=Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|edition=2|chapter=Appendix 9H|isbn=978-0-415-95200-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and measurements ==

===Measurements===

Psychologists have aimed to measure heterosexism using various methods. One particular method involves the use of a [[Likert scale]]. However, since heterosexism is perceived as something that is unseen, it is difficult to determine if someone is heterosexist based on a [[Self-report study|self-report method.]] Researchers, thus, have constructed implicit measurements of heterosexism. An example of this would be an [[Implicit Association Test]]. A popular implicit association test measuring heterosexism that is open to the public is a virtual laboratory called [https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/ Project Implicit].

One limitation present in research on heterosexism is that there often is not a distinction between homophobia and heterosexism. Individuals are more likely to be aware of homophobic tendencies rather than heterosexist views; thus, researchers often measure homophobia instead of heterosexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herek |first1=Gregory M. |title=The Psychology of Sexual Prejudice |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=2000 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=19–22 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00051|s2cid=36963920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

Research on heterosexism has focused on variables that may affect views of heterosexism. For instance, in a study by psychologist, [[Gregory M. Herek]], it was found that there was a gender difference between heterosexual attitudes toward lesbians and gay men.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herek |first1=Gregory M. |title=Heterosexuals' attitudes toward lesbians and gay men: Correlates and gender differences |journal=Journal of Sex Research |date=1988 |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=451–477 |doi=10.1080/00224498809551476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the study reveals that heterosexual individuals all seem to have some heterosexist tendency, however, heterosexual males have a greater tendency than heterosexual females to exhibit negative attitudes towards non-heterosexual individuals (this includes gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals). Another notable finding of Herek's study was that heterosexual males showed a greater tendency to demonstrate hostility towards gay men rather than lesbians.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"/&gt; Other factors that Herek acknowledges to contribute to heterosexism include individual differences, religiosity, conforming to social norms, [[right-wing authoritarianism]], customs and beliefs regarding cultural tradition, and personal experience with non-heterosexual individuals.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"/&gt; Research has also recognized the effects of level of education on views of heterosexism.&lt;ref name="Wright L. W. 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Lester W. Jr. |last2=Adams |first2=Henry E. |last3=Bernat |first3=Jeffery |title=Development and Validation of the Homophobia Scale |journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment |date=1999 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=337–347 |doi=10.1023/A:1022172816258|s2cid=142657023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright et al. revealed that higher levels of education, or having more years of education, is related to less homophobic tendencies.&lt;ref name="Wright L. W. 1999"/&gt;

== As discrimination ==

===Explicit or open===

This type of heterosexism includes [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay]] laws, policies, and institutional practices, harassment based on sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation; [[stereotyping]], discriminatory language and discourse, and other forms of [[discrimination against LGBT persons]] such as:
* [[Hate speech]], [[terms of disparagement]], [[hate mail]], [[death threats]], [[Stop Murder Music|"murder music"]]
* [[Scapegoating]], [[mobbing]], [[Witch-hunt#Political usage|witch-hunts]], [[moral panic]]; using gay men and homosexuality as a [[folk devil]] for the [[AIDS pandemic]].
* Negative portrayals or stereotypes of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals solely as villains, suicide or murder victims&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Psychological perspectives on lesbian and gay male experiences|last= Garnets|first= Linda|author2= Kimmel, Douglas C.|year= 1993|publisher= [[Columbia University Press]]|isbn= 0-231-07884-6|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/psychologicalper0000unse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using the [[gay panic defense]] in assault or murder cases.
* [[Sodomy law]]s when enforced almost exclusively against consenting, adult, same-sex partners. ''See also: [[Bowers v. Hardwick]] and [[Lawrence v. Texas]]''
* In some countries where [[Homosexuality laws of the world|homosexuality is criminalized]], such as Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, offenders may receive the maximum sentence of [[capital punishment]]. ''See also: [[Paragraph 175]]''
* Discrepancies in [[Age of consent#Homosexual and heterosexual age discrepancies in law|age of consent]] laws in which legal sexual activity between members of the same sex is set at a higher age than that for partners in female–male relationships.

* In the context of sex education or professional advice, referring only to female–male relationships when discussing female or male [[sexual attraction]] and activity;
* Silence on issues affecting homosexual and bisexual people at school or work or absence of their discussion in a positive light;
* Implementation and use of [[content-control software]] (censorware) to filter out information and websites that focus on homosexuality or bisexuality;

== Effects ==

Heterosexism causes a range of effects on people of any sexual orientation. However, the main effects of heterosexism are marginalization, and anti-LGBT violence and abuse.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Marginalization ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

The main effect of heterosexism is the [[marginalization]] of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals within society. Heterosexism has led to [[Social stigma|stigmatization]] and persecution of not only these people but also those of other [[sexual diversity]] such as transgender, and [[transsexual]] people. Along with [[homophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], and [[internalized homophobia]], heterosexism continues to be a significant social reality that compels people to conceal their homosexual or bisexual orientation, or metaphorically, to remain in [[Closeted|the closet]] in an effort to [[Passing (sexual orientation)|pass]] for heterosexual.

Marginalization also occurs when marriage rights are heterosexist. More specifically, when marriage rights are exclusive to female–male couples, all same-sex couples, be they gay, lesbian, straight or mixed, are prevented from enjoying marriage's corresponding legal privileges, especially those regarding property rights, health benefits, and child custody. Moreover, such limitation prevents same-sex couples from receiving the inherent social respect of marriage and its cultural symbolism.

=== Anti-LGBT violence and abuse ===

Yolanda Dreyer, professor of practical theology at [[University of Pretoria]], has stated that "Heterosexism leads to prejudice, discrimination, harassment, and [[Violence against LGBT people|violence]]. It is driven by fear and hatred (Dreyer 5)."&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer, Yolanda. "Hegemony and the Internalisation of Homophobia Caused by Heteronormativity." Department of Practical Theology. 2007. University of Pretoria.5 May 2008 [www.up.ac.za/dspace/bitstream/2263/2741/1/Dreyer_Hegemony(2007).pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, forensic psychologist Karen Franklin explains violence caused by heterosexism toward both men and women, regardless of their sexual orientations:&lt;ref name="Franklin" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]hrough heterosexism, any male who refuses to accept the dominant culture's assignment of appropriate masculine behavior is labeled early on as a "[[Sissy#Pejorative|sissy]]" or "[[Fag (slang)|fag]]" and then subjected to [[bullying]]. Similarly, any woman who opposes male dominance and control can be labeled a lesbian and attacked. The potential of being ostracized as homosexual, regardless of actual sexual attractions and behaviors, puts pressure on all people to conform to a narrow standard of appropriate gender behavior, thereby maintaining and reinforcing our society's hierarchical gender structure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another form of heterosexist violence as [[social control]] that most often targets lesbian women is [[corrective rape]]: a [[gang rape]] of a lesbian to "cure" her of her same-sex attractions. A notorious example from South Africa is the corrective rape and murder of [[Eudy Simelane]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT-rights]] activist and member of the [[South Africa women's national football team|women's national football team]].&lt;ref name="guardian120309"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/12/eudy-simelane-corrective-rape-south-africa|title=Raped and killed for being a lesbian: South Africa ignores 'corrective' attacks|last=Kelly|first=Annie|date=12 March 2009|work=The Guardian|access-date=14 March 2009|archive-date=21 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621232447/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/12/eudy-simelane-corrective-rape-south-africa|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Frontline article titled "Inside the Mind of People Who Hate Gays", bias-related violence against homosexuals is believed to be widespread in the United States, with perpetrators typically described by victims as young men in groups who assault targets of convenience. Victims accounts suggest that assailants possess tremendous rage and hatred; indeed, documentation of horrific levels of brutality has led gay activists to characterize the violence as political terrorism aimed at all gay men and lesbians. Other motives for antigay violence suggested in the literature include male bonding, proving heterosexuality, and purging secret homosexual desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Roots Of Homophobia – Inside The Mind Of People Who Hate Gays {{!}} Assault On Gay America |url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html|website = FRONTLINE |publisher= PBS |first1=Karen |last1=Franklin |access-date = 26 October 2015|archive-date = 12 October 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111012171702/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses ==

According to an article in the ''Howard Journal of Communications'', some LGBT individuals have responded to heterosexism through direct confrontation and communication, or through the removal of self from the hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Camara |first1=Sakile K. |last2=Katznelson |first2=Amy |last3=Hildebrandt-Sterling |first3=Jenny |last4=Parker |first4=Todd |title=Heterosexism in Context: Qualitative Interaction Effects of Co-Cultural Responses |journal=Howard Journal of Communications |date=2012 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=312–331 |doi=10.1080/10646175.2012.722836|s2cid=143268150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
