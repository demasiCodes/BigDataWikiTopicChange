'''Heterosexism''' is a term that applies to [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[bias]], and [[discrimination]] in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships. It can include the presumption that everyone is [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the [[norm]] and therefore superior. People of any [[sexual orientation]] can hold such attitudes. As a predisposition toward heterosexuals and heterosexuality, heterosexism has been described as being "encoded into and characteristic of the major social, cultural, and economic institutions of our society."&lt;ref&gt;Dines, Gail (2002). ''Gender, Race, and Class in Media: A Text-Reader''. ISBN 076192261X.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
===Etymology and usage===
Similar terms include '''''heterocentrism''''' and '''''heterosexualism'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Corsini, Raymond J. (1992). ''The Dictionary of Psychology''. ISBN 1583913289.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the well-established term ''heterosexism'' is often explained as a [[Neologism|coinage]] modeled on ''[[sexism]]'', the derivation of its meaning points more to (1.) ''heterosex&lt;s&gt;ual&lt;/s&gt;'' + ''-ism'' than (2.) ''hetero-'' + ''sexism''. In fact, the [[portmanteau]] word ''heterosexualism'' has been used as an equivalent to sexism and racism.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M. Herek. [http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/prej_defn.html "Definitions: Homophobia, Heterosexism, and Sexual Prejudice"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this lack of [[Transparency (linguistic)#Descriptive|semantic transparency]], researchers, outreach workers, [[critical theorists]] and [[LGBT]] activists have proposed and use terms such as ''institutionalized [[homophobia]]'', ''state(-sponsored) homophobia'',&lt;ref&gt;International Lesbian and Gay Association. [http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1058&amp;FileCategory=10&amp;ZoneID=7 "State-sponsored Homophobia"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''sexual prejudice'', ''anti-gay [[bigotry]]'', ''straight [[privilege]]'', ''[[La pensée straight|The Straight Mind]]'' (a collection of essays by French writer [[Monique Wittig]]), ''heterosexual [[bias]]'', ''compulsory heterosexuality''&lt;ref&gt;LGBTQ on-line encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer culture&lt;/ref&gt; or the much lesser known terms ''heterocentrism'', ''[[homonegativity]]'', and from [[gender theory]] and [[queer theory]], ''[[heteronormativity]]''.

While ''heterosexism'' is sometimes confused with or eclipsed by the word ''[[homophobia]]'', heterosexism refers to a bias toward heterosexuality, while homophobia refers to [[antipathy]] towards homosexuality (or gay men and lesbians).

===Parallels and intersections===
The concept of heterosexism is similar to the concept of [[racism]] in that both ideas promote privilege for dominant groups within a given society. Just as racism against non-white people places [[white people]] as superior to non-whites, heterosexism places heterosexual people or relationships as superior to non-heterosexual ones. "[[Straight-acting]]" gay men, lesbians, and bisexual people, who project themselves as or are perceived as heterosexual, are also privileged by heterosexism.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} Borrowing from the racial concept of [[white privilege]], the term "straight privilege"{{Fact|date=April 2008}} has been applied to benefits of heterosexuality within society that heterosexuals take for granted.

What's more, heterosexism can [[Intersectionality|intersect]] with racism by further emphasizing differences among arbitrary groups of people.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} For example, heterosexism can compound the effects of racism by:
*promoting [[injustices]] towards a person already facing injustices because of their race 
*establishing [[social hierarchies]] that allow one group more privilege than other groups.

Likewise, racism can allow LGBT people to be subjected to additional [[discrimination]] or violence if they belong to or are considered a part of a socially devalued racial category.&lt;ref&gt;(2008) Heterosexism and Homophobia. Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, 2, 1-4. Retrieved [[March 31]], [[2008]] from Gale Virtual Reference Library: http://find.galegroup.com/ips/start.do?prodId=IPS.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the privileges afforded to people falling into the categories of white people and (perceived) heterosexuals include, but are not limited to, social acceptance, prestige, freedom from negative [[stereotypes]], and the comfort of being within the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] and thereby not being [[marginalized]] or viewed as different.&lt;ref&gt; Simoni, J. M. &amp; Walters, K. L. (2001). Heterosexual Identity and Heterosexism: Recognizing Privilege to Reduce Prejudice. Journal of Homosexuality, 1(1), 157-173. Retrieved [[March 30]], [[2008]] from Google Scholar: http://www.haworthpress.com/store/E-Text/View_EText.asp?a=3&amp;fn=J082v41n01_06&amp;i=1&amp;s=J082&amp;v=41&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heterosexism as a set of beliefs and attitudes ==
{{Original research|date=December 2007}}
{{seealso|Religion and homosexuality|Homosexuality and psychology|Sexual orientation and medicine|Social attitudes toward homosexuality}}

=== Individual and group level ===
Heterosexism as a set of beliefs and attitudes relies on a core [[tenet]] according to which homosexuality and bisexuality do not normally exist and, as such, constitute [[illness]]es or [[deviant behavior]]s{{Fact|date=May 2008}}. Within a heterosexist [[ideology]] or [[mindset]], the concept of [[sexual orientation]] is rejected or deemed irrelevant. A set of more nuanced heterosexist views, which some may consider [[faith]], [[dogma]], [[Moral absolutism|universal truth]]s, natural law, [[Appeal to authority|appeals to authority]], or popular beliefs, but others consider to be [[conventional wisdom]] or [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] knowledge can include, among others, the following:

*A person can choose his or her sexual “preference” and, as a result, homosexuality is a [[lifestyle]] choice or a current [[Fads and trends|fad]].
*The attitude that gay men aren't "real" men or lesbians aren't "real" women because of the socially pervasive view that heterosexual attractions or activities are the "norm" and therefore superior.
*Homosexuality being wrong, ungodly, and against nature, it is therefore a [[sin]], [[evil]] or subhuman.
*Views identical or akin to [[Anita Bryant]]'s notorious statement during her [[Anita Bryant#Save Our Children|Save Our Children]] campaign:
:"As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must [[Homosexual recruitment|recruit]] our children."
*Because of their lifestyle, homosexuals do not have families with children, so they undermine the survival of the human race. ([[natalism]])
*Homosexuality is an [[Affection|affectional]] or [[mental disorder]] or simply a social ill, therefore, it can be cured or stamped out. If it is not eradicated, it will lead to [[Social solidarity|social disintegration]] and [[societal collapse]].
*Homosexuals can be converted "back" to heterosexuality through [[religious conversion]] or [[conversion therapy]].

===Institutional level===
As well as comprising attitudes held by an individual or a social group, heterosexism can also exist as the expression of attitudes within an institution. As a result, schools, hospitals, and [[Prison|correctional facilities]] can act as a showcase for heterosexist attitudes in various ways. First, schools may implement these attitudes and ideas through unequal and inconsistent disciplinary actions. One such example is meting out harsher punishment to a same-sex couple violating the school ground rules while allowing a heterosexual couple to pass with an easier and more subtle disciplinary action for an equal or identical violation. Also, hospitals may limit patient visiting only to immediate family, i.e. relatives, and exclude [[same sex]] partners. &lt;ref&gt; Heterosexism and Homophobia. Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, 2, 1-4. Retrieved [[March 31]], [[2008]] from Gale Virtual Reference Library: http://find.galegroup.com/ips/start.do?prodId=IPS.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[marriage]] model of opposite-sex marriage is heterosexist in that it does not recognize any type of same-sex couple or any sexual orientation other than a heterosexual orientation.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} For example, one man and one woman can marry regardless of either person’s sexual orientation. More specifically, in those jurisdictions in which marriage is limited to opposite-sex couples, a gay man or a lesbian woman is not allowed to marry a member of the same sex yet can marry a member of the opposite sex.

== Heterosexism as discrimination ==

===Explicit or open discrimination===
This type of heterosexism includes [[anti-gay]] laws, [[harassment]] based on sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation; negative [[stereotyping]], discriminatory language and [[discourse]], and other forms of discrimination against gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals such as:

*[[Hate speech]], [[terms of disparagement]], [[hate mail]], [[death threats]], [[Murder Music]]
*[[Scapegoating]], [[mobbing]], [[Witch-hunt#Political usage|witch-hunts]], [[moral panic]]; using gay men and homosexuality as a [[folk devil]] for the [[AIDS pandemic]]. 
*Negative portrayals or stereotypes of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals solely as villains, the butt of jokes, objects of curiosity. This can occur on television and in movies as well as in jokes between friends or among co-workers.
*Using the [[gay panic defense]] in [[assault]] or [[murder]] cases.
*[[Sodomy law]]s when enforced almost exclusively against consenting, adult, [[same-sex]] partners. ''See also: [[Bowers v. Hardwick]] and [[Lawrence v. Texas]]''
*In some countries where [[Homosexuality laws of the world|homosexuality is criminalized]], such as [[Sudan]], [[Mauritania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[Islamic Republic]] of [[Iran]], offenders may receive the maximum sentence of [[capital punishment]]. ''See also: [[Paragraph 175]]''
*Discrepancies in [[Age of consent#Homosexual and heterosexual age discrepancies in law|age of consent]] laws in which legal sexual activity between members of the same sex is set at a higher age than that for opposite-sex partners. ''See also: [[Chris Morris (activist)|Morris v. The United Kingdom]]''
*[[Adoption]] bans against either same-sex couples or gay, lesbian, or bisexual individuals. ''See also: [[LGBT adoption]]''
*Proposals or legislation to prohibit [[equal rights]] protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation, particularly with regard to [[health care]], [[housing]], and [[employment]].
*The institution of opposite-sex [[marriage]] and reserving the right to marry strictly for opposite-sex couples via explicit definitions or through [[ban (law)|bans]] on [[same-sex marriage]] such as “[[Marriage Protection Act|marriage protection act]]s” or “[[Defense of Marriage Act|defense of marriage act]]s”;
*Also, the above restriction even when same-sex couples have access to [[civil union]]s that are either analogous to or not on a par with marriage;  
*Reserving civil unions strictly for opposite-sex couples;
*Barring gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals from serving in the [[armed force]]s or from working in the [[education]] field; this can include policies such as the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]]’s “[[Don't ask, don't tell]]” policy or [[Lech Kaczyński]] and other conservative Polish politicians’ stance to exclude gay men and lesbians from entering the teaching profession. ''See also: [[LGBT rights in Poland]]''
*Organized opposition to [[equal rights]] for gay men, lesbians, bisexuals ([[Gay rights|LGBT rights]]) and same-sex couples; [[Labeling theory|labeling]] such equal rights and privileges as "[[special rights]]" or the "[[Homosexual agenda|Gay Agenda]]";
*Referring to a suspected criminal's homosexuality or bisexuality when in analogous situations there is no mention of a suspect's heterosexuality.

===Implicit or hidden discrimination===
This form of heterosexism operates through invisibility, underrepresentation, and [[wikt:erasure|erasure]]. It includes:

*Lack of portraying LGBT people in advertising to the general public;{{Fact|date=May 2008}}
*[[Censorship]] of LGBT characters, themes, and issues in works of art, literature, entertainment; ''see also [[Postcards from Buster#Controversial episodes|"Sugar Time" episode of Postcards from Buster]]''
*Exclusion of historical and political figures’ and celebrities’ homosexuality or bisexuality; their portrayal as heterosexuals;
*Complete avoidance of mentioning these people and their positive contributions particularly in [[news media]];
*In the context of sex education or professional advice, referring only to opposite-sex partners when discussing female or male [[sexual attraction]] and activity;
*Total silence on [[Portal:LGBT|LGBT issues]] at school or work or absence of their discussion in a positive light;
*Implementation and use of [[content-control software]] (censorware) to filter out information and websites that focus on LGBT topics and issues;
*[[Postal censorship]] and border control or customs seizure of publications deemed [[obscene]] solely on the basis of them containing LGBT-related material even when they contain no [[erotic]] or [[pornographic]] material; ''see also [[Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium]]''
*Work environments that tacitly require gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals not to reveal their sexual orientation via discussion of their relationship status while heterosexuals can discuss their relationships and [[marital status]] freely;
*At public libraries or bookstores: rejection, removal or destruction of [[Homosexuality in children's literature|LGBT-themed books]] (e.g. ''[[Jenny lives with Eric and Martin]]''), films, and posters;
*Refusal to include [[LGBT parenting|LGBT parented]] families at school events or to represent such family diversity in school curricula; ''see also [[anti-bias curriculum]]'';
*Coercive or forced [[sex reassignment surgery]] on gay men and lesbians. For example, many [[Iranian people|Iranian]] gay men and lesbians must turn to sex-reassignment surgery{{Fact|date=May 2008}} as a strategy to avoid [[persecution]] and a death sentence; [[transsexuality]] and being [[transgender]] are not outright forbidden in the [[Qu'ran]]. ''See also: [[LGBT rights in Iran]]''
*[[Forced disappearance]], ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'', [[ostracism]], [[shunning]], and other forms of [[social rejection]] geared towards making LGBT people ''[[Persona non grata|personae non gratae]]''.

== Effects of heterosexism ==
{{Original research|date=December 2007}}

The main effect of heterosexism is the [[marginalization]] of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals within society. Heterosexism has led to [[social stigma|stigmatization]] and [[persecution]] of not only these people but also those of other sexual diversity such as transgender, and transsexual people. Along with [[violence against LGBT people]], [[homophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], and [[Homophobia#Internalized homophobia|internalized homophobia]], heterosexism continues to be a significant social reality that compels people to conceal their homosexual or bisexual orientation, or metaphorically, to remain in [[closeted|the closet]] in an effort to [[Passing (sexual orientation)|pass]] for heterosexual.

Where marriage rights are heterosexist, i.e. exclusive to opposite-sex couples, all same-sex couples, be they gay, lesbian, straight or mixed, are prevented from enjoying marriage’s corresponding legal privileges, especially those regarding property rights, health benefits, and child custody. Moreover, such limitation prevents same-sex couples from receiving the inherent social respect of marriage and its cultural symbolism. In turn, for lack of institutional or religious legitimization, gay and lesbian sex can be viewed as inferior or undesirable just as non-[[Human reproduction|procreative]] and [[pre-marital sex]] are targets of [[sex-negativity]].{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

== In culture ==

On singing duo [[Romanovsky and Phillips]]' album ''Be Political, Not Polite'', the song "When Heterosexism Strikes" discusses possible actions in response to example cases of heterosexism. ([http://www.romanovskyandphillips.com/politicallyrics.htm#hetero lyrics])
