'''Fourth-wave feminism'''  is the resurgence of interest in [[feminism]] that began around 2012 and is associated with the use of [[social media]].&lt;ref name=4thWave-Guardian20131210/&gt; According to feminist scholar [[Prudence Chamberlain]], the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women, particularly opposition to [[sexual harassment]] and [[violence against women]]. Its essence, she writes, is "incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist".{{sfn|Chamberlain|2017|p=115}}

Fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology", according to [[Kira Cochrane]], and characterized particularly by the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]], and blogs such as [[Feministing]] to challenge [[misogyny]].&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|website=NOW Toronto|publisher=|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cochrane|2013}}

Issues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include [[street harassment|street]] and [[workplace harassment]], [[campus sexual assault]] and [[rape culture]]. Several scandals have galvanized the movement, including the [[2012 Delhi gang rape|Delhi gang rape]] (2012), [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|Jimmy Savile allegations]] (2012), [[Bill Cosby sexual assault cases]] (2014), [[2014 Isla Vista killings|Isla Vista killings]] (2014), [[trial of Jian Ghomeshi]] (2016), [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein allegations]] (2017) and subsequent [[Me Too movement]] and [[Weinstein effect]], and the [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals|Westminster sexual scandals]] (2017).&lt;ref&gt;For Cosby, Ghomeshi, #MeToo and fourth wave, see Matheson, Kelsey (17 October 2017).

Examples of fourth-wave feminist campaigns include the [[Everyday Sexism Project]], [[Ni una menos]], [[No More Page 3]], [[Stop Bild Sexism]], ''[[Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)|Mattress Performance]]'', ''[[10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman]]'', [[YesAllWomen|#YesAllWomen]], [[Free_the_Nipple_(campaign)|Free the Nipple]], [[One Billion Rising]], the [[2017 Women's March]], the [[2018 Women's March]], the [[Me Too movement]], and [[Time's Up (movement)|Time's Up]]. In December 2017, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine chose several prominent female activists involved in the #MeToo movement, dubbed "the silence breakers", as [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]].&lt;ref name=Zacharek6Dec2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redden, Molly, and agencies (6 December 2017).

== History ==
{{further|First-wave feminism|Second-wave feminism|Third-wave feminism}}
{{Feminism sidebar|expanded=history}}
Journalist [[Pythia Peay]] argued for the existence of a fourth wave as early as 2005, one focusing on social justice and civil rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Peay | first= Pythia | title =Feminism's Fourth Wave | work =[[Utne Reader]] | issue = 128 | year = 2005 | pages = 59–60 | url = http://www.utne.com/community/feminisms-fourth-wave.aspx | location = Topeka, Kansas | publisher = Ogden Publications | access-date = 7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] dated the start of the fourth wave to 2008.{{sfn|Baumgardner|2011|p=250}} [[Twitter]], the social network most popular with the 18–29 age group, was created in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Brodzky|first=Brandon|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141118182103-28964915-social-media-user-statistics-age-demographics-for-2014|title=Social Media User Statistics &amp; Age Demographics for 2014|date=18 November 2014|website=LinkedIn Pulse|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; making feminism more accessible and giving rise to "hashtag feminism".{{sfn|Bennett|2014}} Cochrane wrote in 2013 that many of the fourth-wave's leaders were teenagers or in their 20s.&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;

By 2013 it was obvious that a new wave of feminist protests was taking place. When [[Wendy Davis (politician)|Wendy Davis]] staged her 13-hour [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] in Texas in 2013 to prevent an abortion bill from passing, women showed their support by rallying around the [[Texas State Capitol]], and those who couldn't be there physically used the #StandWithWendy. Similarly, women protested the often sexist questions directed at female celebrities by tweeting the hashtag #askhermore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Chittal|first=Nisha|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-social-media-changing-the-feminist-movement|title=How Social Media is Changing the Feminist Movement|website=MSNBC|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideas==
Cochrane describes the fourth wave as focusing on sexual harassment (including street harassment), workplace discrimination, [[body shaming]], sexist imagery in the media, online misogyny, assault on public transport, and [[intersectionality]], relying on social media for communication and online petitioning for organizing.&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abrahams|first1=Jessica|title=Everything you wanted to know about fourth wave feminism—but were afraid to ask|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/everything-wanted-know-fourth-wave-feminism|work=Prospect|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bcrw.barnard.edu/wp-content/nfs/reports/NFS8-FemFuture-Online-Revolution-Report-April-15-2013.pdf|title=#FemFuture: Online Revolution|last1=Martin|first1=Courtney E.|last2=Valenti|first2=Vanessa|publisher=Barnard Centre for Research on Women|date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events and organizations included the [[Everyday Sexism Project]], [[Kat Banyard|UK Feminista]], [[Reclaim the Night]], [[One Billion Rising]], and "[[a Lose the Lads' mags protest]]".&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;

Books associated with the new wave include ''[[Men Explain Things to Me]]'' (2014) by [[Rebecca Solnit]] (which gave rise to the term ''[[mansplaining]]''); ''The Vagenda'' (2014) by [[Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett]] and [[Holly Baxter]] (based on their online feminist magazine, ''[[The Vagenda]]'', launched in 2012); ''Sex Object: A Memoir'' (2016) by [[Jessica Valenti]]; and ''Everyday Sexism'' (2016) by [[Laura Bates]] (based on Bates' Everyday Sexism Project).{{sfn|Bates|2014}} Cosslett's and Baxter's book aims to debunk the stereotypes of femininity promoted by the mainstream women's press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vagendamagazine.com/about/|title=Letter from the Editor|publisher=The Vagenda|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates, a British feminist writer, created the Everyday Sexism Project on 16 April 2012 as an online forum where women could post their experiences of everyday harassment.&lt;ref name=Aitkenhead24Jan2016&gt;{{cite news |last=Aitkenhead |first=Decca |author-link=Decca Aitkenhead |title=Laura Bates Interview: 'Two Years Ago, I Didn't Know What Feminism Meant' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/laura-bates-interview-everyday-sexism |newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
One criticism of fourth-wave feminism is that it depends on technology. As [[Ragna Rök Jóns]] argued in ''Bluestockings Magazine'' in 2013, "[t]he key problem that this '4th Wave' will face will be the disproportionate access to and ownership of digital media devices." The fourth wave is left with the "inherent [[classism]] and [[ableism]]" created by giving the biggest voice to those who can afford and use technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bluestockingsmag.com/2013/08/19/is-the-4th-wave-of-feminism-digital/|title=Is the '4th Wave' of Feminism Digital?|last=Jóns|first=Ragna Rök|website=Bluestockings Magazine|date=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that when people participate in Twitter activism, they may not feel the need to do anything else to help the effort. In an article for [[Newuniversity.org]], Alex Guardado argues that after contributing their say, people just "continue on with their day, liking other posts or retweeting". Some may think of themselves as activists while never bothering to attend a single rally or extend their message beyond their Twitter fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newuniversity.org/2015/03/opinion/hashtag-activism-the-benefits-and-limitations-of-activism/|title=Hashtag Activism: The Benefits and Limitations of #Activism |last=Guardado|first=Alex|date=3 March 2015|work=New University|publisher= University of California, Irvine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jennifer Simpkins]] of ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' argued in 2014 that fourth-wave feminism had created a hostile, ''[[Mean Girls]]''–like atmosphere, in which women are more likely to tear each other down. "I've actually never once been belittled and attacked by a man for believing in the cause of feminism," she states, "but women are just about lining up to take a whack at the shoddy piñata of my personal tastes and opinions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Simpkins |first=Jennifer |date=20 January 2014 |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jennifer-simpkins/feminism-fourth-wave-became-mean-girls_b_4616597.html|title='You Can't Sit with Us!' – How Fourth-Wave Feminism Became 'Mean Girls'|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
