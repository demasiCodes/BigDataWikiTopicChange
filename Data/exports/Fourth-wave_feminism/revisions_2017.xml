'''Fourth-wave feminism''' refers to a resurgence of interest in [[feminism]] that began around 2011–2013 and is associated with the use of [[social media]].{{sfn|Rivers|2017|loc=8}}&lt;ref name=4thWave-Guardian20131210/&gt; According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to [[violence against women]] and [[sexual harassment]]. Its essence, she writes, is "incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist".{{sfn|Chamberlain|2017|loc=115}}

Fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology", according to [[Kira Cochrane]], and the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]], and blogs such as [[Feministing]], to further [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of social media means that [[misogyny]] can be challenged immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|website=NOW Toronto|publisher=|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues that fourth-wave feminists have focused on include [[street harassment|street]] and [[workplace harassment]], [[campus sexual assault]] and [[rape culture]], and several scandals involving the harassment and abuse of women and girls that have galvanized the movement. These have included the [[2012 Delhi gang rape]], the [[Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations|Bill Cosby]] and [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|Jimmy Savile allegations]], the 2016 [[trial of Jian Ghomeshi]], and the 2017 [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein allegations]].&lt;ref&gt;For Cosby, Ghomeshi, #MeToo, and fourth wave, see Matheson, Kelsey (17 October 2017).

Examples of fourth-wave feminist campaigns include [[SlutWalk]], the [[Everyday Sexism Project]], [[No More Page 3]], [[One Billion Rising]], [[Stop Bild Sexism]], the [[2017 Women's March]], and the movement sparked by the Weinstein allegations, [[Me Too (hashtag)|#MeToo]].

Journalist Pythia Peay argued for the existence of a fourth wave in 2005, one that focused on social justice and civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Peay | first= Pythia | title =Feminism's Fourth Wave | work =[[Utne Reader]] | issue = 128 | year = 2005 | pages = 59–60 | url = http://www.utne.com/community/feminisms-fourth-wave.aspx | location = Topeka, Kansas | publisher = Ogden Publications | access-date = 7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] dates the start of the fourth wave to 2008.{{sfn|Baumgardner|2011|p=250}}

[[Twitter]], the social network most popular with the 18–29 age group,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Brodzky|first=Brandon|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141118182103-28964915-social-media-user-statistics-age-demographics-for-2014|title=Social Media User Statistics &amp; Age Demographics for 2014|date=18 November 2014|website=LinkedIn Pulse|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created in 2006, and made feminism more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3319081/whyistayed-hashtag-feminism-activism/ |title=Behold the Power of #Hashtag Feminism |last=Bennett |first=Jessica |date=10 September 2014 |website=Time |location=New York |access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Wendy Davis (politician)|Wendy Davis]] staged her 13-hour [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] in Texas in 2013 to prevent an abortion bill from passing, many women showed their support by rallying around the [[Texas State Capitol]]. But for those who couldn't, they were still able to show their solidarity through using the [[hashtag]] #StandWithWendy. Similarly, women protested the often sexist questions directed at female celebrities by tweeting the hashtag #askhermore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Chittal|first=Nisha|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-social-media-changing-the-feminist-movement|title=How Social Media is Changing the Feminist Movement|website=MSNBC|date=26 March 2015|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideas ==
By 2013 it was obvious that a new wave of feminist protests were taking place. The fourth wave is "defined by technology: tools that are allowing women to build a strong, popular, reactive movement online," according to Cochrane. She describes it as focusing on sexual harassment, including street harassment, workplace discrimination, body-shaming, sexist imagery in the media, online misogyny, assault on public transport, sexist comments, and [[intersectionality]], relying on social media for communication and online petitioning for organizing.&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahams, Jessica (14 August 2017). [https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/everything-wanted-know-fourth-wave-feminism "Everything you wanted to know about fourth wave feminism—but were afraid to ask"], ''Prospect''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bcrw.barnard.edu/wp-content/nfs/reports/NFS8-FemFuture-Online-Revolution-Report-April-15-2013.pdf|title=#FemFuture: Online Revolution|last1=Martin|first1=Courtney E.|last2=Valenti|first2=Vanessa|publisher=Barnard Centre for Research on Women|date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events and organizations included the [[Everyday Sexism Project]], [[Kat Banyard|UK Feminista]], [[Take Back the Night|Reclaim the Night]], [[One Billion Rising]], and "a Lose the Lads' mags protest". Cochrane writes that many of the movement's leaders are teenagers or in their 20s.&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;

Books associated with the new wave include ''[[Men Explain Things to Me]]'' (2014) by [[Rebecca Solnit]] (which gave rise to the term ''[[mansplaining]]''); ''The Vagenda'' (2014) by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett and Holly Baxter (based on their online feminist magazine, ''[[The Vagenda]]'', launched in 2012); ''Sex Object: A Memoir'' (2016) by [[Jessica Valenti]]; and ''Everyday Sexism'' (2016) by [[Laura Bates]] (based on Bates' Everyday Sexism Project).{{sfn|Bates|2014}} Cosslett's and Baxter's book aims to debunk the stereotypes of femininity promoted by the mainstream women's press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vagendamagazine.com/about/|title=Letter from the Editor|publisher=The Vagenda|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates, a British feminist writer, created the Everyday Sexism Project on 16 April 2012 as an online forum where women could post their experiences of everyday harassment.&lt;ref name="Bates interview"&gt;{{cite news |last=Aitkenhead |first=Decca |author-link=Decca Aitkenhead |title=Laura Bates Interview: 'Two Years Ago, I Didn't Know What Feminism Meant' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/laura-bates-interview-everyday-sexism |newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences, exhibits==
[[File:WClogo5.png|thumb|Logo of the Fourth Wave Feminist Summit at Yale, 2015]]
The Fourth Wave Feminist Summit was a November 2015 conference of feminist organizations from colleges across the Northeast United States, including [[Middlebury College|Middlebury]], [[Barnard College|Barnard]], [[Quinnipiac University|Quinnipiac]], [[University of Pennsylvania|UPenn]], [[Bates College|Bates]], and [[Cornell University|Cornell]]. Organized by the Women's Center at [[Yale University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://womenscenter.yale.edu/ |title=Yale University Women's Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; the conference discussed strategies on activism and ways to improve solidarity across campus movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/yalewomenscenter/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=719488071485454 |title=The Fourth Wave? {{!}} First Annual Feminist Summit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--needs secondary source--&gt;

In November 2015, a group of historians working with Clio Visualizing History launched ''The Ongoing Feminist Revolution'', a digital history exhibit examining the history of American feminism from the era of World War Two to the present. The exhibit has three major sections: Politics and Social Movements; Body and Health; and Workplace and Family. There are also interactive timelines linking to a vast array of sources documenting the history of American feminism and providing information about current feminist activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cliohistory.org/click/|title=Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--needs secondary source--&gt;

== Criticism ==
One criticism of fourth-wave feminism is that it depends on technology. As Ragna Rök Jóns argued in ''Bluestockings Magazine'' in 2013, "[t]he key problem that this '4th Wave' will face will be the disproportionate access to and ownership of digital media devices." The fourth wave is left with the "inherent [[classism]] and [[ableism]]" created by giving the biggest voice to those who can afford and use technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bluestockingsmag.com/2013/08/19/is-the-4th-wave-of-feminism-digital/|title=Is the '4th Wave' of Feminism Digital?|last=Jóns|first=Ragna Rök|website=Bluestockings Magazine|date=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that when people participate in Twitter activism, they may not feel the need to do anything else to help the effort. In an article for Newuniversity.org, Alex Guardado argues that after contributing their say, people just "continue on with their day, liking other posts or retweeting". Some may think of themselves as activists while never bothering to attend a single rally or extend their message beyond their Twitter fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newuniversity.org/2015/03/opinion/hashtag-activism-the-benefits-and-limitations-of-activism/|title=New University|last=Guardado|first=Alex|date=3 March 2015|website=NewUniversity.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Simpkins of ''The Huffington Post'' argued in 2014 that fourth-wave feminism had created a hostile, ''[[Mean Girls]]''–like atmosphere, in which women are more likely to tear each other down. "I've actually never once been belittled and attacked by a man for believing in the cause of feminism," she states, "but women are just about lining up to take a whack at the shoddy piñata of my personal tastes and opinions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Simpkins |first=Jennifer |date=20 January 2014 |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jennifer-simpkins/feminism-fourth-wave-became-mean-girls_b_4616597.html|title='You Can't Sit with Us!' – How Fourth-Wave Feminism Became 'Mean Girls'|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
