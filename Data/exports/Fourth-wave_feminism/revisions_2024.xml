'''Fourth-wave feminism''' is a [[feminist movement]] that began around the early 2010s and is characterized by a focus on the [[empowerment of women]],&lt;ref name="Abrahams-Prospect"/&gt; the use of internet tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Grady|first=Constance|date=2018-03-20|title=The waves of feminism, and why people keep fighting over them, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth|access-date=2020-06-27|website=Vox|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intersectionality]].&lt;ref name="PSA"/&gt; The fourth wave seeks greater gender equality by focusing on gendered norms and the marginalization of women in society.

Fourth-wave feminism focuses on sexual abuse, sexual harassment, sexual violence, the objectification of women, and sexism in the workplace. [[Internet activism]] is a key feature of the fourth wave.&lt;ref name="Shiva"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Shiva|first1=Negar|last2=Kharazmi|first2=Zohreh Nosrat|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism and the Lack of Social Realism in Cyberspace |oclc=1236110330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Diamond |first1=Jill |last2=Dye |first2=Michaelanee |last3=LaRose |first3=Daphne |last4=Bruckman |first4=Amy |date=2013 |title=Holdback!: the role of storytelling online in a social movement organization |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262314400 |access-date=2023-03-07 |website=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth-wave feminism broadens its focus to other groups, including the LGBTQ+ community and people of color, and advocates for their increased societal participation and power.&lt;ref name="PSA" /&gt; It also advocates for equal incomes regardless of sex and challenges traditional gender roles for men and women, which it believes are oppressive. The movement further argues against sexual assault, objectification, harassment and gender-based violence.&lt;ref name="Phillips 930–943" /&gt;

Some have identified the movement as a reaction to [[post-feminism]], which argues that women and men have already reached equality. It also brought back some second wave-feminist ideas into discourse, with Martha Rampton writing that the movement criticises "sexual abuse, rape, violence against women, unequal pay, slut-shaming, the pressure on women to conform to a single and unrealistic body-type",&lt;ref name="Pacific University-2015"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2015-10-25 |title=Four Waves of Feminism |url=https://www.pacificu.edu/magazine/four-waves-feminism |access-date=2023-05-25 |website=Pacific University |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advocates for "gains in female representation in politics and business".

Some feminists argue that in the 1980s conservative figures like [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] challenged gains feminists had made up to that point.&lt;ref name="codigonuevo-2018"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.codigonuevo.com/mileniales/cuarta-ola-feminista-llegado-debes|title=La cuarta ola feminista ha llegado y esto es lo que debes saber|date=2018-03-05|website=Código Nuevo|language=es|access-date=2019-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425111743/https://www.codigonuevo.com/mileniales/cuarta-ola-feminista-llegado-debes|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, feminists in North America, Latin America, and Europe had succeeded in some of their goals, including the creation of state-run institutions that explicitly promoted women's rights, or feminist involvement in government; however, these institutions also weakened feminist movements by letting the state take over implementation of feminist goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Vega Ugalde|first=Silvia|date=2013|title=Comentarios al Dossier: "Nuevas voces feministas en América Latina: ¿continuidades, rupturas, resistencias?"|url=https://biblat.unam.mx/pt/revista/iconos-revista-de-ciencias-sociales/articulo/comentarios-al-dossier-nuevas-voces-feministas-en-america-latina-continuidades-rupturas-resistencias|magazine=Iconos.

European and Latin American third-wave feminism began in the 1990s, as ''[[lipstick feminism]]'' and ''consumerist feminism'' started to come to an end and as feminist activists were rejecting [[queer theory]] espoused by American academics.&lt;ref name="Urzaiz-2017"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smoda.elpais.com/moda/actualidad/ana-miguel-filosofia/|title=Ana de Miguel: "Considerar que dar las campanadas medio desnuda es un acto feminista es un error garrafal"|last=Urzaiz|first=Begoña Gómez|date=2017-12-21|website=S Moda EL PAÍS|language=es-ES|access-date=2019-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425121930/https://smoda.elpais.com/moda/actualidad/ana-miguel-filosofia/|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guilló Girard-2018"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Guilló Girard|first=Clara Inés|title=El sentido de ser víctima y la víctima como sentido: tecnologías de enunciación de la violencia de género|date=2018|degree=Doctorate|publisher=UNIVERSIDAD COMPLUTENSE DE MADRID|url=http://isonomia.uji.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ZZ.-Actas-Seminario-Int.-violencia-genero-2018.pdf|language=es|access-date=25 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425181934/http://isonomia.uji.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ZZ.-Actas-Seminario-Int.-violencia-genero-2018.pdf|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webdeveloper-2019"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mujerdecantabria.com/estudio-la-recuperacion-integral-las-mujeres-victimas-violencia-genero-cantabria/|title=Estudio sobre la recuperación integral de las mujeres víctimas de violencia de género en Cantabria|last=webdeveloper|website=Dirección General de Igualdad y Mujer|language=es-ES|access-date=2019-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425185954/http://mujerdecantabria.com/estudio-la-recuperacion-integral-las-mujeres-victimas-violencia-genero-cantabria/|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamchatka-2019"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kamchatka.es/es/feminismo-estrategico|title=Somos la Cuarta Ola; el feminismo estratégico|website=Kamchatka|language=es|access-date=2019-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426092329/https://www.kamchatka.es/es/feminismo-estrategico|archive-date=26 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cuaderno-2018"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://elcuadernodigital.com/2018/10/29/entrevista-a-beatriz-gimeno/|title=Entrevista a Beatriz Gimeno|last=Cuaderno|first=El|date=2018-10-29|website=El Cuaderno|language=es-ES|access-date=2019-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426132426/https://elcuadernodigital.com/2018/10/29/entrevista-a-beatriz-gimeno/|archive-date=26 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Las Gafas Violetas-2019"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lasgafasvioletasrevista.com/2019/03/07/somos-la-cuarta-ola-feminista/|title=¿Qué significa que somos la Cuarta Ola feminista?|date=2019-03-07|website=Las Gafas Violetas|language=es|access-date=2019-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426135307/https://lasgafasvioletasrevista.com/2019/03/07/somos-la-cuarta-ola-feminista/|archive-date=26 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth-wave feminism developed slowly, globally via the media and the Internet.&lt;ref name="Digital-2019"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.estrelladigital.es/blog/tasia-aranguez-sanchez/cuarta-ola-movimiento-feminista/20181023183446356371.html|title=La cuarta ola del movimiento feminista|last=Digital|first=Estrella|website=Estrella Digital|language=es-ES|access-date=2019-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425111746/https://www.estrelladigital.es/blog/tasia-aranguez-sanchez/cuarta-ola-movimiento-feminista/20181023183446356371.html|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Las Gafas Violetas-2019" /&gt; The wave emerged from a new generation of women who had largely not been informed about previous waves through their education at high school, institutions and university.

In an [[Anglosphere]] feminist context, journalist Pythia Peay argued for the existence of a fourth wave as early as 2005, to focus on [[social justice]] and civil rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Peay|first=Pythia|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave|magazine=[[Utne Reader]]|issue=128|year=2005|pages=59–60|url=http://www.utne.com/community/feminisms-fourth-wave.aspx|location=Topeka, Kansas|publisher=Ogden Publications|access-date=7 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908222300/http://www.utne.com/community/feminisms-fourth-wave.aspx|archive-date=8 September 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011, [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] dated the start of the fourth wave to 2008.{{sfn|Baumgardner|2011|p=250}} [[Twitter]], the social network most popular with the 18-to-29 age group, was created in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Twitter {{!}} History, Description, Elon Musk, &amp; Uses {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Twitter |access-date=2022-11-21 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; making feminism more accessible and giving rise to "hashtag feminism".{{sfn|Bennett|2014}}

In 2013, Democratic Texas State Senator [[Wendy Davis (politician)|Wendy Davis]] staged a 13-hour [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] in Texas, in an attempt to prevent an anti-abortion bill from passing. Other women showed support by rallying around the [[Texas State Capitol]] and those who were not physically present used the [[hashtag]] #StandWithWendy. Similarly, women protested the perceived sexist questions (for example, focusing on appearance or love life) often directed at female celebrities by tweeting the hashtag #askhermore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Chittal|first=Nisha|url=https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-social-media-changing-the-feminist-movement|title=How Social Media is Changing the Feminist Movement|website=MSNBC|date=26 March 2015|access-date=21 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419094625/http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/how-social-media-changing-the-feminist-movement|archive-date=19 April 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other feminist movements and "calls to action" have arisen from the fourth wave.

Due to the simultaneous existence of multiple waves of feminism – namely the second, third and fourth – many scholars are questioning the use of the wave metaphor in feminism. However, it is still the terminology most commonly used and most easily understood by the public. As the fourth wave finds much of its definition in relation to the previous ones, it is important to understand what the [[History of feminism|other waves]] were.&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Chamberlain|first2=Prudence|date=July 2015|title=Critical Waves: Exploring Feminist Identity, Discourse and Praxis in Western Feminism|url=https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/50807653/critical_waves_final_revisions.pdf|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=14|issue=4|pages=396–409|doi=10.1080/14742837.2014.964199|hdl-access=free|hdl=1983/2b137a20-4d1e-41f6-b427-86046c1a32aa|s2cid=145460318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, comparisons between waves can be difficult. Anglospheric first-wave feminism is second-wave for Europeans and Latin American feminists. Second-wave American and British feminism is also third-wave for Europeans and Latin Americans.&lt;ref name="Oliva Portolés-2019"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.homonosapiens.es/podemos-hablar-de-una-cuarta-ola-en-el-movimiento-feminista-monografico-8m/|title=¿Podemos hablar de una cuarta ola en el movimiento feminista?|last=Oliva Portolés|first=Asunción|date=15 March 2019|website=Homonosapiens|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425120245/https://www.homonosapiens.es/podemos-hablar-de-una-cuarta-ola-en-el-movimiento-feminista-monografico-8m/|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live|access-date=2019-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish feminism went through several waves in the [[Franco era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Spain - Franco's Spain, 1939–75 {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Spain/Francos-Spain-1939-75 |access-date=2022-11-21 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, there are first-wave feminism taking place from the mid-nineteenth century to 1965, second-wave feminism taking place from 1965 to 1975 and third-wave feminism taking place from 1975 to 2012.&lt;ref name="Díez Balda-2019"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenred.net/spip.php?article447|title=El Movimiento feminista en Salamanca después de la muerte de Franco|last=Díez Balda|first=Mª Antonia|website=mujeres en red|publisher=Universidad de Salamanca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330085239/http://www.mujeresenred.net/spip.php?article447|archive-date=30 March 2019|url-status=live|access-date=2019-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nielfa Cristóbal"&gt;Nielfa Cristóbal, Gloria.

Each feminist wave has a separate identity, although they get harder to distinguish and define clearly as time goes on, due to debate among activists and scholars. In an Anglospheric feminist context, the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] was characterized by the [[suffragette movement]]s and had the aim of legalizing women voting in public elections.&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves" /&gt; In the same context, [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] is more difficult to comprehensively define, but is thought to have roots in the 1960s. Its focus shifted to social and personal rights, such as [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]], choice over bodily issues, [[sexual liberation]] and resistance to the gendered [[double standard]] in society.&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves" /&gt; There is much debate among Anglosphere academics and activists regarding the true definition of the [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] of feminism. It is most commonly understood as a push by younger generations to create a feminism more centered on inclusivity; privileging the plights of [[queer]] and non-white women in their messaging. American poet [[Natasha Sajé]] has written, "[It] is an amalgamation of many different streams of theorizing—including that of women of color and younger women disillusioned with what they perceive to make up the body of 'second wave' feminism—in intrinsically different formulations than the theorizing coming from anti-feminists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sajé|first1=Natasha|last2=Saje|first2=Natasha|date=1995|title=Then What Is the Question?|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=21|issue=1|pages=99|doi=10.2307/3178319|issn=0046-3663|jstor=3178319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves" /&gt;

==Ideas==
British journalist [[Kira Cochrane]] and British feminist scholar Prudence Bussey-Chamberlain describe the fourth wave as focusing on justice for women, particularly opposition to [[sexual harassment]] (including street harassment), [[violence against women]], workplace discrimination and harassment, [[body shaming]], sexist imagery in the media, online misogyny, [[campus sexual assault]] and assault on public transport and [[rape culture]]. They also say it supports [[intersectionality]], social media activism and [[online petition]]ing.&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|author-link=Kira Cochrane|date=10 December 2013|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|url-status=live|access-date=14 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314123922/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|archive-date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrahams-Prospect"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abrahams|first1=Jessica|title=Everything you wanted to know about fourth wave feminism—but were afraid to ask|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/everything-wanted-know-fourth-wave-feminism|work=Prospect|date=14 August 2017|access-date=17 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117132924/https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/everything-wanted-know-fourth-wave-feminism|archive-date=17 November 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bcrw.barnard.edu/wp-content/nfs/reports/NFS8-FemFuture-Online-Revolution-Report-April-15-2013.pdf|title=#FemFuture: Online Revolution|last1=Martin|first1=Courtney E.|last2=Valenti|first2=Vanessa|publisher=Barnard Centre for Research on Women|date=15 April 2013|access-date=8 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526211852/http://bcrw.barnard.edu/wp-content/nfs/reports/NFS8-FemFuture-Online-Revolution-Report-April-15-2013.pdf|archive-date=26 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its essence, Chamberlain writes, is "incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist".{{sfn|Chamberlain|2017|p=115}} Events and organizations involved in fourth-wave feminism include [[Everyday Sexism Project]], [[Kat Banyard|UK Feminista]], [[Reclaim the Night]], [[One Billion Rising]] and "a Lose the Lads' mags protest".&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;

Third-wave feminists began introducing the concept of [[male privilege]] in their writings in the 1990s and fourth-wave feminists continue to discuss it in academia and on social media.&lt;ref name="van der Gaag-2014"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism and Men|last=van der Gaag|first=Nikki|date=2014|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=9781780329130|location=London|oclc=886112252}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Peggy McIntosh]] was one of the first feminists to describe the phenomenon of privilege in 1988, calling it (in regards to white privilege) "an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools and blank checks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED355141.pdf?utm#page=43|title=White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack|last=Mcintosh|first=Peggy|date=July 1989|work=Peace and Freedom Magazine|access-date=March 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402042758/https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED355141.pdf?utm#page=43|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth-wave feminists have taken action to reduce and combat this "knapsack" by raising awareness of privileged and unprivileged groups. [[Straight ally|Alliance]] is greatly encouraged by these feminists, who believe that males and other privileged groups can still take action for social change within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Systems of privilege: intersections, awareness, and applications|last=Case|first=Kim A.|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|oclc=799010636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London author Nikki van der Gaag discusses the damaging effects of raising young boys with privilege, citing the Consultative Group on Early Child Care and Development, "a tendency to privilege boys [...] does not teach teach boys responsibility, nor clarify what will be expected from them".&lt;ref name="van der Gaag-2014" /&gt; Fourth-wave feminists have begun promoting solutions to avoid these issues, such as raising children as [[gender-neutral]]. Professor of Neuroscience at Chicago Medical School [[Lise Eliot]] points out that infants and growing children are so impressionable that any small differences in raising the child can lead to large personality differences over time, resulting in reinforced gender stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pink brain, blue brain: how small differences grow into troublesome gaps—and what we can do about it|last=Eliot|first=Lise|date=2010|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=9780547391557|location=Boston|oclc=837684360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-wave feminists have argued that reinforced [[Gender role|gender stereotypes]] create pressure for men to be breadwinners, as opposed to women, who feel obligated to take on the role of homemakers. Feminists argue that these pressures to conform socially can cause [[gender discrimination]] in the workplace and more widely in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ganesh|first1=Sarlaksha|last2=Ganesh|first2=Mangadu Paramasivam|date=2014-05-27|title=Effects of masculinity–femininity on quality of work life|journal=Gender in Management|volume=29|issue=4|pages=229–253|doi=10.1108/gm-07-2013-0085|issn=1754-2413}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pew Research]], a majority of women working in male-dominated workplaces believe that sexual harassment is a problem in their industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/07/women-in-majority-male-workplaces-report-higher-rates-of-gender-discrimination/|title=Gender discrimination more common for women in mostly male workplaces|website=Pew Research Center|date=7 March 2018 |access-date=2019-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402031653/https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/07/women-in-majority-male-workplaces-report-higher-rates-of-gender-discrimination/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intersectionality ==
One of the main critiques of past waves of feminism has been the centrality and privileging of the voices of middle class white women in the movement. The concept of intersectionality originates in black feminism throughout the 20th century and the specific term's coinage is attributed to [[Kimberlé Crenshaw|Kimberle Williams Crenshaw]] in 1991. Intersectionality in a broad sense is defined as "the interactivity of social identity structures such as race, class and gender in fostering life experiences, especially experiences of privilege and oppression".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gopaldas |first=Ahir |date=2013 |title=Intersectionality 101 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43305317 |journal=Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing |volume=32 |pages=90–94 |doi=10.1509/jppm.12.044 |jstor=43305317 |s2cid=220318967 |via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; It addresses the complexities of how different systems of oppression interact and overlap and has expanded to become a topic in fields of study outside of gender studies and feminism as well,&lt;ref name="Okolosie-2014"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Okolosie |first=Lola |date=2014 |title=beyond 'talking' and 'owning' intersectionality |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24571923 |journal=Feminist Review |volume=108 |issue=108 |pages=90–96 |doi=10.1057/fr.2014.14 |jstor=24571923 |s2cid=147259709 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its main goal as a tool within the feminist movement is to give a voice and power to those who have been pushed to the margins, namely women of color and queer people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bose |first=Christine |date=February 2012 |title=Intersectionality and Global Gender Inequality |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23212241 |journal=Gender and Society |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=67–72 |doi=10.1177/0891243211426722 |jstor=23212241 |s2cid=145233506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it has been used widely in conjunction with feminism since the 1990s, the fourth wave of feminism gives the concept a new level of prominence in the movement as the voices of those with marginalized identities are more easily heard with the use of social media. Intersectionality is most closely associated with black feminism in the eyes of both the general public and the world of academia, as a community operating under the oppressive systems of both racism and sexism and as the term intersectionality first gained traction through the work of black feminists. Some would say that "black feminists are read as the embodiment of intersectionality". While the use of intersectionality as a lens through which to view feminist discourse and practice has helped the movement make leaps of progress in regards to bringing forward the voices and needs of oppressed identities, the close association with black women and feminists has given rise to critiques on both sides of the debate.&lt;ref name="Okolosie-2014" /&gt;

In terms of defending black women's experiences of intersectionality, one phrase that has been used is "I live it", in reference to the fact that critics are often attempting to disprove life experiences of black women that they have not themselves experienced or have grounds to falsify. Additional critiques against intersectionality from the viewpoint of white, middle-class leaders of feminism include the supposed use of the term to attack these leaders and the essentializing of gender oppression alone as opposed to all systems of oppression. For example, on a 2013 episode of 'Women's Hour' about fourth wave feminism, a Radio 4 program in the UK, a white feminist leader named Caroline Criado-Perez said "a big part of the problem is the way certain women use intersectionality as a cloak to abuse prominent white feminists". This was said in response to a critique of racism within modern feminism made by Reni Eddo-Lodge, a black feminist. On the other side, while intersectionality gives voices to marginalized communities it also often puts the labor of explaining and educating others about the term on those living under oppression, especially black women.&lt;ref name="Okolosie-2014" /&gt;

Although a large percentage of activists operating under fourth wave feminism define themselves as intersectional feminists, intersectionality lives mostly in the realm of academia at this point in time.&lt;ref name="Okolosie-2014" /&gt;

British professor of marketing and consumer research Pauline Maclaran&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2015.1076497 | volume=31 | issue=15–16 | title=Feminism's fourth wave: a research agenda for marketing and consumer research | year=2015 | journal=Journal of Marketing Management | pages=1732–1738 | last1 = Maclaran | first1 = Pauline| s2cid=145666422 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that although celebrities are at the forefront of fourth-wave feminism, ready access to information has enabled the movement to draw greater attention to economic inequalities faced by women than heretofore possible.&lt;ref name="Maclaran-2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclaran|first=Pauline|date=2015-10-13|title=Feminism's fourth wave: a research agenda for marketing and consumer research|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=31|issue=15–16|pages=1732–1738|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2015.1076497|issn=0267-257X|s2cid=145666422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarded as more inclusive of the [[LGBTQIA+]] community,&lt;ref name="Maclaran-2015" /&gt; fourth-wave feminists such as Jacob Bucher of [[Baker University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/0735648X.2014.949823 | volume=38 | issue=4 | title=Soliciting strain: examining both sides of street prostitution through General Strain Theory | year=2015 | journal=Journal of Crime and Justice | pages=435–453 | last1 = Bucher | first1 = Jacob | last2 = Manasse | first2 = Michelle | last3 = Milton | first3 = Jeffrey| s2cid=143606247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have protested stereotypes surrounding men's supposed uncontrolled sexual desire and objectification of women.

Canadian art historian [[Ruth Phillips]] argues that fourth-wave feminism falls within the broader agenda of financial, political and environmental concerns and is recognized as a key factor in alleviating poverty, improving women's health and achieving economic growth.&lt;ref name="Phillips 930–943"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=Ruth|last2=Cree|first2=Viviene E.|date=21 February 2014|title=What does the 'Fourth Wave' Mean for Teaching Feminism in Twenty-First Century Social Work?|url=https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/15148557/Phillips_Cree_Fourth_Wave_for_Open_Access.pdf|journal=Social Work Education|volume=33|issue=7|pages=930–43|doi=10.1080/02615479.2014.885007|s2cid=144660611|issn=0261-5479|hdl=20.500.11820/a5072043-e5e5-4cf1-af19-2207db4e19f7|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roe v. Wade overturn ==
On June 24, 2022, The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3, in favor of [[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization|Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization]] which subsequently overruled the previous landmark Supreme Court case of [[Roe v. Wade]] as well as [[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]. ''Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization'' ruled that the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right to an abortion. The case was presented on the Constitutionality of a 2018 Mississippi law that banned abortion operations after the 15th week of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Littlefield |first=Amy |date=2021-11-30 |title=The Christian Legal Army Behind the Ban on Abortion in Mississippi |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/alliance-defending-freedom-dobbs/ |access-date=2024-03-05 |language=en-US |issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling makes ''Dobbs'' to be considered a landmark decision of the court. The decision on June 24, 2022 came after a leak on May 2, 2022, which showed leaked documents of the majority opinion by [[Samuel Alito|Justice Samuel Alito]], which criticized ''Roe''. The following day the Supreme Court confirmed these documents to be legitimate but stated these documents do "not represent a decision by the Court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case".&lt;ref&gt;United States Supreme Court.

The impact of the overturn of ''Roe v. Wade'' was significant and impactful for all women across the country. Once ''Roe'' was overturned, various states across the United States followed suit in determining their stance on the Constitutionality of a protected right to abortion. Some states' older restrictions on abortion that were put on hold after ''Roe'' was passed, were now put back into place. Many states also had [[trigger law]]s that were put into place in May 2021, when the Supreme Court agreed to hear ''Dobbs'' arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Kelly |first=Caroline |date=2021-05-18 |title=More states are expected to pass anti-abortion bills targeting Roe v.

[[Kira Cochrane]] has argued that fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology" and characterized particularly by the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]] and blogs such as [[Feministing]] to challenge [[misogyny]].&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon-2009"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|url-status=live|access-date=16 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716184154/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|archive-date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zerbisias-2016"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016172423/https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|archive-date=16 October 2015|access-date=21 April 2016|website=NOW Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The speed of communication and concept of "going viral" has been a major factor in the success of contemporary feminist campaigns, fostering digital phenomenon such as "call-out culture". In the world of cyberfeminism, call-out culture is used as a tool to accuse sexual predators in a manner that allows for optional anonymity and the larger possibility of wide-ranged support. Hashtag feminism campaigns are often a result of this culture.&lt;ref name="Shiva-2019"/&gt;

Social media activism has manifested as Twitter threads critiquing perceived [[transphobia]] in the media&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Parry|first=Diana C.|title=Feminisms in Leisure Studies|pages=1–12|year=2018|chapter=Fourth wave feminism|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781315108476-1|isbn=9781315108476|s2cid=195569730}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in so-called "hashtag feminism" campaigns, notably [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]],&lt;ref name="Cosboy-Ghomeshi-MeToo" /&gt; [[YesAllWomen|#YesAllWomen]], [[Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping|#bringbackourgirls]], #NotYourAsianSidekick and [[Black Twitter|#SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2013-08-14 |title=#SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen: women of color's issue with digital feminism |author=Mikki Kendall |url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/14/solidarityisforwhitewomen-hashtag-feminism |access-date=2022-11-21 |newspaper=The Guardian |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girlgaze, launched by [[Amanda de Cadenet]], is an online multi-sided platform that directly connects businesses, companies and brands with women and non-binary creative talent,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=girlgaze.com|url=https://girlgaze.com |website=Girlgaze}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting the need for diversity, inclusion and representation across the creative industry.

The Everyday Sexism Project, established in 2012 by feminist author Laura Bates, is an example of a fourth-wave feminist campaign that began online and utilized the internet as a medium for women to share stories of sexism and sexual assault they had faced through the use of a hashtag and sites like Twitter and blogs. The project brought awareness to the prolific nature of structurally ingrained sexism and gendered violence that is often a stigmatized topic in the everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Day and Wray |first=K and R |date=2018 |title=Fourth-wave feminism and postfeminism: Successes and failures |url=https://eprints.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/id/eprint/7735/1/FourthWaveFeminismAndPostfeminismSuccessesAndFailuresAM-WRAY.pdf |journal=Transform: A Journal of the Radical Left |volume=4 |pages=113–137 |via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critique of social media feminism is the emotional toll it can take on active leaders and participants as a form of unpaid labor that can often have harsh repercussions in the form of online harassment and abuse.&lt;ref name="Shiva-2019"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crane-2012"/&gt;

Sahar Khamis, a professor at University of Maryland, argues that social media gives feminists a unique avenue to highlight moments of solidarity in the social movement creating a powerful energy.&lt;ref name="Oren-2019"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oren |first1=Tasha |chapter=Contemporary feminism |doi=10.4324/9781315728346-1 |title=The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Feminism |pages=1–19 |place=Abingdon, Oxon |publisher=Routledge |date=2019 |isbn=978-1-315-72834-6 |last2=Press |first2=Andrea L. |s2cid=216612655 |editor=Oren |editor2=Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media allows interconnected groups and individuals to network and connect with each other. Younger generations of feminists are more likely to form their beliefs and opinions and develop their support for the movement through social media.&lt;ref name="Oren-2019" /&gt;

== Men and the fourth wave ==

=== Importance of men's participation ===
According to the International Women's Development Agency, feminism is "about all genders having equal rights and opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What Is Feminism? {{!}} IWDA |url=https://iwda.org.au/learn/what-is-feminism/ |access-date=2024-03-06 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 70% of U.S. fathers take parental leave, but receive less than two weeks off after the birth of their child.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Sutanto |first=Cynthia |date=2023-12-12 |title=Feminism is for Men, Too |url=https://feminist.org/news/feminism-is-for-men-too/ |access-date=2024-03-06 |website=Feminist Majority Foundation |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four times more men than women die by suicide in the U.S., due to stigma around mental health and seeking help for it.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In [[Emma Watson]]'s 2014 speech launching the [[HeForShe]] campaign for [[UN Women]], she points out that "men don't have the benefits of equality either."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2014-09-20 |title=Emma Watson: Gender equality is your issue too |url=https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/emma-watson-gender-equality-is-your-issue-too |access-date=2024-02-29 |website=UN Women – Headquarters |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She cites examples from her own life where she has noticed this, including seeing her "father's role as a parent being valued less by society," and witnessing her male friends struggle to express their emotions.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; From the HeForShe website, HeForShe is "an invitation for men and people of all genders to stand in solidarity with women" in order to achieve gender equality for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Home Page |url=https://www.heforshe.org/en |access-date=2024-02-29 |website=HeForShe |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges for male feminists ===
Societal pressure and the ideals of [[toxic masculinity]] can make it difficult for men to support [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Flood |first=Michael |date=2022-09-21 |title='Toxic masculinity': what does it mean, where did it come from – and is the term useful or harmful? |url=http://theconversation.com/toxic-masculinity-what-does-it-mean-where-did-it-come-from-and-is-the-term-useful-or-harmful-189298 |access-date=2024-02-27 |website=The Conversation |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many societies, to be considered 'masculine', men must be "strong, active, aggressive, tough, daring, heterosexual, emotionally inexpressive and dominant."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Among these types of traits is the idea present in many cultures globally that being a man "often involve[s] male domination over women."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Fourth wave feminism has been able to reach a larger audience than the previous waves via social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-05-04 |title=The Social Media Revolution is Reshaping Feminism - National Organization for Women |url=https://now.org/blog/the-social-media-revolution-is-reshaping-feminism/ |access-date=2024-03-06 |website=now.org |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2023, researchers conducted an experiment designed to find the effect of feminist content on social media on [[Millennials|millennial]] men and men from [[Generation Z]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kosar |first1=Sophia Anneliese |last2=Muruthi |first2=Bertranna A. |last3=Shivers |first3=Carolyn |last4=Zarate |first4=Jose |last5=Byron |first5=Jordan |date=October 2023 |title=Millennials and Generation Z: Men's Perspectives on Hashtag Feminism |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10608265231175832 |journal=The Journal of Men's Studies |language=en |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=478–499 |doi=10.1177/10608265231175832 |hdl=10919/102110 |s2cid=258655810 |issn=1060-8265|hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings included mixed messages, with one participant stating that so-called 'hashtag' feminism "[spread] real awareness of the struggles women face that [men] are not all the time aware of, and sometimes never aware of."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The participants also felt that hashtag feminism was difficult for men to engage with, with one man stating that he doesn't "know how to engage with it in a way that doesn't come off as hostile."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Men's feminist media and advocacy ===
In more recent years, the number of men acting to publicly support feminism has increased; celebrities such as [[Justin Baldoni]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Matt McGorry]], and [[Alan Cumming]] have spoken and acted in support of the movement.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2019-11-25 |title=Five Feminist Men We Are Thankful For |url=https://therepproject.org/five-feminist-men-we-are-thankful-for/ |access-date=2024-02-27 |website=The Representation Project |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baldoni's TED Talk, "Why I'm done trying to be man enough", asks questions like "are you brave enough to be vulnerable?" and "are you strong enough to be sensitive?"&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Why I'm done trying to be "man enough" - Justin Baldoni |url=https://ed.ted.com/lessons/83OhjZcY |access-date=2024-02-27 |website=TED-Ed |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Why I'm done trying to be man enough" touches on recognizing privilege, amplifying women's voices, and the importance of creating male friendships in which men can speak about real struggles together.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In 2014, Terry Crews published his book, ''Manhood: How to Be a Better Man–or Just Live with One'', a memoir discussing how to be a "good man, loving husband, and responsible father."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Manhood: How to Be a Better Man - or Just Live with One |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19287159-manhood |access-date=2024-02-27 |website=Goodreads |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crews has also publicly voiced his support for gender equality in an interview with BUILD Series&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Terry Crews Speaks Out Against Toxic Masculinity | date=22 January 2020 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWZPopmIto |access-date=2024-02-27 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on his [[Twitter]] account.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In addition to celebrities, former president [[Barack Obama]] authored an article titled "This is What a Feminist Looks Like", discussing gender roles and the need for everyone to fight [[sexism]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Obama |first=Barack |date=2016-08-04 |title=Exclusive: President Barack Obama Says, "This Is What a Feminist Looks Like" |url=https://www.glamour.com/story/glamour-exclusive-president-barack-obama-says-this-is-what-a-feminist-looks-like |access-date=2024-02-27 |website=Glamour |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama asserts that gender stereotypes "limit our ability to simply be ourselves" and that twenty-first century feminism is "the idea that when everybody is equal, we are all more free."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In September 2014, the Obama-Biden White House founded [[It's On Us|It's On Us]], which became the largest nonprofit dedicated to preventing sexual assault on college campuses in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=It's On Us {{!}} Our Story |url=https://itsonus.org/about-us/our-story/ |access-date=2024-02-27 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''[[The Mask You Live In]]'', a documentary film directed by [[Jennifer Siebel Newsom]], premiered at [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Newsom |first=Jennifer Siebel |title=The Mask You Live In |date=2015-01-25 |type=Documentary, News |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3983674/ |access-date=2024-02-27 |others=Joe Herman, Michael Kimmel, Caroline Heldman |publisher=The Representation Project, The Annenberg Foundation, The Brin Wojcicki Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary details the environment and expectations that boys grow up with in the United States, using analysis from experts in various fields and firsthand accounts of experiences to illustrate how gender roles affect boys and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=THE MASK YOU LIVE IN |url=https://therepproject.org/films/the-mask-you-live-in/ |access-date=2024-02-27 |website=The Representation Project |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Michael Moore]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], and [[John Legend]], along with a plethora of female public figures, attended women's marches across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Park |first=Andrea |date=2017-01-23 |title=Celebrities attend Women's Marches around the world |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/celebrities-attend-womens-marches-around-the-world/ |access-date=2024-02-27 |website=www.cbsnews.com |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
One criticism of fourth-wave feminism is that it depends on digital and emerging technology, which means enabling underserved communities to engage with digital tools in a way that is empowering, these arguments are advanced and countered in the pioneering work of [[Nancy Mauro-Flude]], recognised for her integration of performance art, digital media, and critical technology studies, with a focus on feminist perspectives and the politics of digital literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mauro-Flude |first1=Nancy |title=Writing the Feminist Internet: a Chthonian Feminist Internet Theory for the twenty first century |journal=Continuum |date=15 Oct 2021 |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=788–804 |doi=10.1080/10304312.2021.1983260 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10304312.2021.1983260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an image of [[Nancy Mauro-Flude]] theatre work Error_in_Time()&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grady |first1=Kendall |title=you will _KNOW how_ : interview with Nancy Mauro-Flude |url=https://mastersofmedia.hum.uva.nl/blog/2011/10/31/you-will-_know-how_-an-interview-with-nancy-mauro-flude/ |website=Masters of Media |date=31 October 2011 |access-date=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to start her article, Ragna Rök Jóns argued that "[t]he key problem that this '4th Wave' will face will be the disproportionate access to and ownership of digital media devices."

Critics argue that efforts by large corporations such as [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] to capitalize on the movement through activist advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/avidan/2017/05/11/dove-invented-femvertising-but-its-latest-stunt-didnt-wash-with-consumers/|title=Dove Invented 'Femvertising' But Its Latest Stunt Didn't Wash With Consumers|last=Dan|first=Avi|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421142925/https://www.forbes.com/sites/avidan/2017/05/11/dove-invented-femvertising-but-its-latest-stunt-didnt-wash-with-consumers/|archive-date=21 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be inimical to fourth-wave feminism, which tends to be critical of capitalism as an economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annis|first=Ashley Hartman|date=Winter 2016|title=Which way is feminism leaning?

The conservative critique of fourth-wave feminism is that when women believe that the world is set against them through social systems such as [[patriarchy]], they will abandon all efforts instead of competing with men as equals. Author Joanna Williams writes in ''[[The American Conservative]]'' that fourth-wave feminism encourages women to "call upon external helpmates, like the state and ugly identity politics that push good men away". Williams also associates the movement with the "[[regressive left]]", claiming fourth-wave feminists are authoritarian and illiberal by dictating acceptable ideologies and policing the speech of men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/fourth-wave-feminismwhy-no-one-escapes/|title=Fourth Wave Feminism: Why No One Escapes|last=Williams|first=Joanna|website=The American Conservative|date=4 September 2018 |access-date=2019-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402031653/https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/fourth-wave-feminismwhy-no-one-escapes/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that when people participate in Internet activism, they may not feel the need to do anything else to help the effort and to make themselves feel good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mitra |first=Zinia |title=Fourth Wave Feminism, Social Media and (Sl)Activism |publisher=[[Kitaab]] |year=2020 |isbn=978-981-18-0550-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of activism is addressed in feminist punk band [[Le Tigre]]'s 2001 song "[[Get Off the Internet]]", from before social media came into the picture. Later, in 2015, Alex Guardado asserted in an article on Twitter activism for NewUniversity.org that after contributing their say, people just "continue on with their day, liking other posts or retweeting". Some may think of themselves as activists while never bothering to attend a rally or extend their message beyond their Twitter fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newuniversity.org/2015/03/opinion/hashtag-activism-the-benefits-and-limitations-of-activism/|title=Hashtag Activism: The Benefits and Limitations of #Activism|last=Guardado|first=Alex|date=3 March 2015|work=New University|publisher=University of California, Irvine|access-date=21 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503053133/http://www.newuniversity.org/2015/03/opinion/hashtag-activism-the-benefits-and-limitations-of-activism/|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; While various feminist campaigns have spread via social media, the term [[slacktivism]] was coined to describe the mass media users who may speak out on their online platform but do little else to stimulate social action outside of their online platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guillard|first=Julianne|date=2016-07-28|title=Is feminism trending?

Jennifer Simpkins of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' argued in 2014 that fourth-wave feminism had created a hostile, ''[[Mean Girls]]''–like atmosphere, in which women are more likely to tear each other down. "I've actually never once been belittled and attacked by a man for believing in the cause of feminism ... but women are just about lining up to take a whack at the shoddy piñata of my personal tastes and opinions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jennifer-simpkins/feminism-fourth-wave-became-mean-girls_b_4616597.html|title='You Can't Sit with Us!'&amp;nbsp;– How Fourth-Wave Feminism Became 'Mean Girls'|last=Simpkins|first=Jennifer|date=20 January 2014|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=21 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510080539/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jennifer-simpkins/feminism-fourth-wave-became-mean-girls_b_4616597.html|archive-date=10 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; British scholar Ealasaid Munro says that the [[call-out culture]] of fourth-wave feminism risks marginalizing and separating people over minor disagreements when they could serve better as allies.&lt;ref name="PSA"/&gt;

Women and their gendered issues are not uniform and many variations in issues are a result of related issues such as race, sexuality and class and Munro also provides the critique that mainstream feminism is focused on the struggle of middle-class white women.&lt;ref name="PSA" /&gt; Social campaigns that cast celebrities as the face of the movement, such as the [[Me Too movement]], have been criticized, because celebrities often represent the privileged sectors of society, which in turn negate the efforts to expand upon the [[intersectionality]] of feminism.&lt;ref name="Looft-2017"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Looft|first=Ruxandra|date=2017-11-02|title=#girlgaze: photography, fourth wave feminism, and social media advocacy|journal=Continuum|volume=31|issue=6|pages=892–902|doi=10.1080/10304312.2017.1370539|issn=1030-4312|s2cid=148881977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wave narrative itself is criticized due to perceptions that it is only inclusive of western feminist movements&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves" /&gt; and that the fourth wave itself takes place in the global north, often neglecting the struggle of women in other regions.&lt;ref name="Phillips 930–943"/&gt; Critics also argue that using waves to define periods of feminism is no longer useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Radford-Hill |first=Sheila |date=2002 |title=Keepin' It Real: A Generational Commentary on Kimberly Springer's "Third Wave Black Feminism?" |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/339638 |journal=Signs |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=1083–1190 |doi=10.1086/339638 |jstor=10.1086/339638 |s2cid=146387753 |issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe there is no need for it anymore and that it can get confusing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Grady |first=Constance |date=2018-03-20 |title=The waves of feminism, and why people keep fighting over them, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth |access-date=2022-11-21 |website=Vox |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wave narrative is also contested due to the overlapping nature of the waves of feminism and the lack of concrete definitions due to disagreements between scholars and activists as to what the waves respectively encompass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chamberlain |first=Prudence |date=2016-04-15 |title=Affective temporality: towards a fourth wave |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540253.2016.1169249 |journal=Gender and Education |language=en |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=458–464 |doi=10.1080/09540253.2016.1169249 |s2cid=147625970 |issn=0954-0253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critiques of fourth-wave feminism include its lack of clear evidence in most cases of social media use. Along with this, some argue that though all issues should be dealt with, smaller issues must not be inflated to a higher level by the feminist movement. One example of this is [[Matt Damon]]'s response to the Harvey Weinstein case, "I do believe that there is a spectrum of behaviour, right? [...] There's a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?" Social media also can be seen as ineffective as it brings down "bogeyman" individuals rather than, "invent[ing] a different language or logic that can excise or alter the structures of oppression" as Sarah K. Burgess describes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Sarah K.|date=2018|title=Between the Desire for Law and the Law of Desire: #MeToo and the Cost of Telling the Truth Today|journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric|volume=51|issue=4|pages=342–367|doi=10.5325/philrhet.51.4.0342|jstor=10.5325/philrhet.51.4.0342|s2cid=149835737|issn=0031-8213}}&lt;/ref&gt;
