'''Fourth-wave feminism''' is a [[feminist movement]] that began around 2012 and is characterized by a focus on the [[empowerment of women]],&lt;ref name="Abrahams-Prospect"/&gt; the use of internet tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Grady|first=Constance|date=2018-03-20|title=The waves of feminism, and why people keep fighting over them, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth|access-date=2020-06-27|website=Vox|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intersectionality]].&lt;ref name="PSA"/&gt; The fourth wave seeks greater gender equality by focusing on gendered norms and marginalization of women in society.

Intersectionality&lt;ref name="PSA"/&gt; and interlocking systems of power are emphasised, and how these contribute to the [[social stratification]] of [[Marginalization|traditionally marginalized groups]], such as [[women of colour]] and [[trans women]]. Fourth-wave feminists advocate (like earlier feminists) for greater representation of these groups in politics and business, and argue that society would be more equitable if policies and practices incorporated the perspectives of all people.&lt;ref name="PSA" /&gt;

Fourth-wave feminism argues for [[equal pay for equal work]] and that the [[equal opportunities]] sought for girls and women should extend also to boys and men to overcome gender norms (for example by expressing emotions and feelings freely, expressing themselves physically as they wish, and to be engaged parents to their children).{{sfn|Chamberlain|2017|pp=1–19}} The utilisation of [[Mass media|print]], [[News media|news]], and [[social media]] platforms to collaborate, mobilize, speak against [[Abuse of power|abusers of power]] in seeking for the empowerment of women and seeking justice against [[sexual assault|assault]] and [[sexual harassment|harassment]] is prominent.&lt;ref name="Phillips 930–943"/&gt;

Some feminists argue that in the 1980s, conservative figures like [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] challenged gains feminists had made up to that point.&lt;ref name="codigonuevo-2018"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.codigonuevo.com/mileniales/cuarta-ola-feminista-llegado-debes|title=La cuarta ola feminista ha llegado y esto es lo que debes saber|date=2018-03-05|website=Código Nuevo|language=es|access-date=2019-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425111743/https://www.codigonuevo.com/mileniales/cuarta-ola-feminista-llegado-debes|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, feminists in North America, [[Latin America]], and [[Europe]] had succeeded in some of their goals, including the creation of state-run institutions that explicitly promoted women's rights, or feminist involvement in government; these institutions, however, also weakened feminist movements by letting the state take over implementation of feminist goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vega Ugalde|first=Silvia|date=2013|title=Comentarios al Dossier: "Nuevas voces feministas en América Latina: ¿continuidades, rupturas, resistencias?"|url=https://biblat.unam.mx/pt/revista/iconos-revista-de-ciencias-sociales/articulo/comentarios-al-dossier-nuevas-voces-feministas-en-america-latina-continuidades-rupturas-resistencias|journal=Iconos.

European and Latin American fourth-wave feminism began in the 1990s, as ''[[lipstick feminism]]'' and ''[[consumerist feminism]]'' started to come to an end and as feminist activists were rejecting [[queer theory]] espoused by American academics.&lt;ref name="Urzaiz-2017"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smoda.elpais.com/moda/actualidad/ana-miguel-filosofia/|title=Ana de Miguel: "Considerar que dar las campanadas medio desnuda es un acto feminista es un error garrafal"|last=Urzaiz|first=Begoña Gómez|date=2017-12-21|website=S Moda EL PAÍS|language=es-ES|access-date=2019-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425121930/https://smoda.elpais.com/moda/actualidad/ana-miguel-filosofia/|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":103"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Guilló Girard|first=Clara Inés|title=El sentido de ser víctima y la víctima como sentido: tecnologías de enunciación de la violencia de género|date=2018|degree=Doctorate|publisher=UNIVERSIDAD COMPLUTENSE DE MADRID|url=http://isonomia.uji.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ZZ.-Actas-Seminario-Int.-violencia-genero-2018.pdf|language=es|access-date=25 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425181934/http://isonomia.uji.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ZZ.-Actas-Seminario-Int.-violencia-genero-2018.pdf|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":113"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mujerdecantabria.com/estudio-la-recuperacion-integral-las-mujeres-victimas-violencia-genero-cantabria/|title=Estudio sobre la recuperación integral de las mujeres víctimas de violencia de género en Cantabria|last=webdeveloper|website=Dirección General de Igualdad y Mujer|language=es-ES|access-date=2019-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425185954/http://mujerdecantabria.com/estudio-la-recuperacion-integral-las-mujeres-victimas-violencia-genero-cantabria/|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kamchatka.es/es/feminismo-estrategico|title=Somos la Cuarta Ola;

In an [[anglosphere]] feminist context, journalist [[Pythia Peay]] argued for the existence of a fourth wave as early as 2005, to focus on [[social justice]] and civil rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Peay|first=Pythia|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave|magazine=[[Utne Reader]]|issue=128|year=2005|pages=59–60|url=http://www.utne.com/community/feminisms-fourth-wave.aspx|location=Topeka, Kansas|publisher=Ogden Publications|access-date=7 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908222300/http://www.utne.com/community/feminisms-fourth-wave.aspx|archive-date=8 September 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011, [[Jennifer Baumgardner]] dated the start of the fourth wave to 2008.{{sfn|Baumgardner|2011|p=250}} [[Twitter]], the social network most popular with the 18-to-29 age group, was created in 2006,{{cn|date=August 2021}} making feminism more accessible, and giving rise to "hashtag feminism".{{sfn|Bennett|2014}}

In 2013, unsuccessful Democratic gubernatorial candidate [[Wendy Davis (politician)|Wendy Davis]] staged a 13-hour [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] in Texas, in an attempt to prevent an anti-abortion bill from passing. Other women showed support by rallying around the [[Texas State Capitol]], and those who were not physically present used the [[hashtag]] #StandWithWendy.

Due to the simultaneous existence of multiple waves of feminism – namely the second, third, and fourth – many scholars are questioning the use of the wave metaphor in feminism. However, it is still the terminology most commonly used and most easily understood by the public. As the fourth wave finds much of its definition in relation to the previous ones, it is important to understand what the [[History of feminism|other waves]] were:&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Chamberlain|first2=Prudence|date=July 2015|title=Critical Waves: Exploring Feminist Identity, Discourse and Praxis in Western Feminism|url=https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/50807653/critical_waves_final_revisions.pdf|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=14|issue=4|pages=396–409|doi=10.1080/14742837.2014.964199|hdl-access=free|hdl=1983/2b137a20-4d1e-41f6-b427-86046c1a32aa|s2cid=145460318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, comparisons between waves can be difficult. Anglospheric first-wave feminism is second-wave for Europeans and Latin American feminists. Second-wave American and British feminism is also third-wave for Europeans and Latin Americans.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.homonosapiens.es/podemos-hablar-de-una-cuarta-ola-en-el-movimiento-feminista-monografico-8m/|title=¿Podemos hablar de una cuarta ola en el movimiento feminista?|last=Oliva Portolés|first=Asunción|date=15 March 2019|website=Homonosapiens|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425120245/https://www.homonosapiens.es/podemos-hablar-de-una-cuarta-ola-en-el-movimiento-feminista-monografico-8m/|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live|access-date=2019-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lahaine.org/mundo.php/evocando-el-68-desde-el|title=Evocando el '68 desde el feminismo de la segunda ola|last=lahaine.org|website=La Haine Mundo|language=es|access-date=2019-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425120245/https://www.lahaine.org/mundo.php/evocando-el-68-desde-el|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish feminism went through several waves in the [[Franco era]].

Broadly speaking, there are first-wave feminism taking place from the mid-nineteenth century to 1965, second-wave feminism taking place from 1965 to 1975, and third-wave feminism taking place from 1975 to 2012.&lt;ref name=":422"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mujeresenred.net/spip.php?article447|title=El Movimiento feminista en Salamanca después de la muerte de Franco|last=Díez Balda|first=Mª Antonia|website=mujeres en red|publisher=Universidad de Salamanca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330085239/http://www.mujeresenred.net/spip.php?article447|archive-date=30 March 2019|url-status=live|access-date=2019-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":622"&gt;Nielfa Cristóbal, Gloria.

Each feminist wave has a separate identity, although they get harder to distinguish and define clearly as time goes on, due to debate among activists and scholars. In an Anglospheric feminist context, the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] was characterized by the [[suffragette movement]]s and had the aim of legalizing women voting in public elections.&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves" /&gt; In the same context, [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] is more difficult to comprehensively define, but is thought to have roots in the 1960s. Its focus shifted to social and personal rights, such as [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]], choice over bodily issues, [[sexual liberation]], and resistance to the gendered [[double standard]] in society.&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves" /&gt; There is much debate among Anglosphere academics and activists regarding the true definition of the [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] of feminism. It is most commonly understood as a push by younger generations to create a feminism more centered on inclusivity; privileging the plights of [[queer]] and non-white women in their messaging. American poet [[Natasha Sajé]] has written, "[It] is an amalgamation of many different streams of theorizing—including that of women of colour and younger women disillusioned with what they perceive to make up the body of 'second wave' feminism—in intrinsically different formulations than the theorizing coming from anti-feminists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sajé|first1=Natasha|last2=Saje|first2=Natasha|date=1995|title=Then What Is the Question?|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=21|issue=1|pages=99|doi=10.2307/3178319|issn=0046-3663|jstor=3178319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves" /&gt;

==Ideas==
British journalist [[Kira Cochrane]] and British feminist scholar [[Prudence Bussey-Chamberlain]] describe the fourth wave as focusing on justice for women, particularly opposition to [[sexual harassment]] (including street harassment), [[violence against women]], workplace discrimination and harassment, [[body shaming]], sexist imagery in the media, online misogyny, [[campus sexual assault]] and assault on public transport, and [[rape culture]]. They also say it supports [[intersectionality]], social media activism, and [[online petition]]ing.&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|author-link=Kira Cochrane|date=10 December 2013|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|url-status=live|access-date=14 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314123922/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|archive-date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abrahams-Prospect"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abrahams|first1=Jessica|title=Everything you wanted to know about fourth wave feminism—but were afraid to ask|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/everything-wanted-know-fourth-wave-feminism|work=Prospect|date=14 August 2017|access-date=17 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117132924/https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/everything-wanted-know-fourth-wave-feminism|archive-date=17 November 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bcrw.barnard.edu/wp-content/nfs/reports/NFS8-FemFuture-Online-Revolution-Report-April-15-2013.pdf|title=#FemFuture: Online Revolution|last1=Martin|first1=Courtney E.|last2=Valenti|first2=Vanessa|publisher=Barnard Centre for Research on Women|date=15 April 2013|access-date=8 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526211852/http://bcrw.barnard.edu/wp-content/nfs/reports/NFS8-FemFuture-Online-Revolution-Report-April-15-2013.pdf|archive-date=26 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its essence, Chamberlain writes, is "incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist".{{sfn|Chamberlain|2017|p=115}} Events and organizations involved in fourth-wave feminism include [[Everyday Sexism Project]], [[Kat Banyard|UK Feminista]], [[Reclaim the Night]], [[One Billion Rising]], and "a Lose the Lads' mags protest".&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt; 

Books associated with the fourth wave include: 
* ''[[Men Explain Things to Me]]'' (2014) by American writer [[Rebecca Solnit]] (notably, a 2008 essay also called ''Men Explain Things to Me,'' reprinted in the book, gave rise to the term ''[[mansplaining]]'')
* ''[[The Vagenda]]'' (2014) by British writers [[Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett]] and [[Holly Baxter]] (based on their online UJ feminist magazine, ''[[The Vagenda]]'', launched in 2012)
* ''Sex Object: A Memoir'' (2016) by American writer [[Jessica Valenti]]
* ''Everyday Sexism'' (2016) by British writer [[Laura Bates]] (based on Bates' [[Everyday Sexism Project]]){{sfn|Bates|2014}}

Cosslett and Baxter's book aims to debunk stereotypes of femininity promoted by mainstream women's press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vagendamagazine.com/about|title=Letter from the Editor|publisher=The Vagenda|date=19 January 2012|access-date=3 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527012815/http://vagendamagazine.com/about/|archive-date=27 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates, a British feminist writer, created the Everyday Sexism Project on 16 April 2012 as an online forum where women could post their experiences of everyday harassment.&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead24Jan2016"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aitkenhead|first=Decca|author-link=Decca Aitkenhead|title=Laura Bates Interview: 'Two Years Ago, I Didn't Know What Feminism Meant'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/laura-bates-interview-everyday-sexism|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 January 2014|access-date=14 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207012945/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/24/laura-bates-interview-everyday-sexism|archive-date=7 February 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-wave feminists began introducing the concept of [[male privilege]] in their writings in the 1990s, and fourth-wave feminists continue to discuss it in academia and on social media.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism and Men|last=van der Gaag|first=Nikki|date=2014|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=9781780329130|location=London|oclc=886112252}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Peggy McIntosh]] was one of the first feminists to describe the phenomenon of privilege in 1988, calling it (in regards to white privilege) "an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools, and blank checks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED355141.pdf?utm#page=43|title=White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack|last=Mcintosh|first=Peggy|date=July 1989|work=Peace and Freedom Magazine|access-date=March 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402042758/https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED355141.pdf?utm#page=43|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourth-wave feminists have taken action to reduce and combat this "knapsack" by raising awareness of privileged and unprivileged groups. [[Straight ally|Alliance]] is greatly encouraged by these feminists, who believe that males and other privileged groups can still take action for social change within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Systems of privilege: intersections, awareness, and applications|last=Case|first=Kim A.|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|oclc=799010636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London author [[Nikki van der Gaag]] discusses the damaging effects of raising young boys with privilege, citing the Consultative Group on Early Child Care and Development, "a tendency to privilege boys [...] does not teach teach boys responsibility, nor clarify what will be expected from them".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Fourth-wave feminists have begun promoting solutions to avoid these issues, such as raising children as [[gender neutral]]. Professor of Neuroscience at Chicago Medical School [[Lise Eliot]], points out that infants and growing children are so impressionable that any small differences in raising the child can lead to large personality differences over time, resulting in reinforced gender stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pink brain, blue brain: how small differences grow into troublesome gaps—and what we can do about it|last=Eliot|first=Lise|date=2010|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=9780547391557|location=Boston|oclc=837684360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-wave feminists have argued that reinforced [[Gender role|gender stereotypes]] create pressure for men to be breadwinners, as opposed to women, who feel obligated to take on the role of homemakers. Feminists argue that these pressures to conform socially can cause [[gender discrimination]] in the workplace and more widely in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ganesh|first1=Sarlaksha|last2=Ganesh|first2=Mangadu Paramasivam|date=2014-05-27|title=Effects of masculinity–femininity on quality of work life|journal=Gender in Management|volume=29|issue=4|pages=229–253|doi=10.1108/gm-07-2013-0085|issn=1754-2413}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pew Research]], a majority of women working in male-dominated workplaces believe that sexual harassment is a problem in their industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/07/women-in-majority-male-workplaces-report-higher-rates-of-gender-discrimination/|title=Gender discrimination more common for women in mostly male workplaces|website=Pew Research Center|access-date=2019-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402031653/https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/07/women-in-majority-male-workplaces-report-higher-rates-of-gender-discrimination/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the importance of social media in "creating and sustaining feminist community"&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves" /&gt; is an increasingly popular idea, "diversity and creativity continue to characterize feminist activism" around the world in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves" /&gt; Communities around the globe witnessed the reflections of "the current, Internet-based fourth wave" feminism and investigated the difference of it.&lt;ref name="Phillips 930–943" /&gt; Moreover, the increasing social power of fourth-wave feminist movements prioritise these issues for elected governments, encouraging them to engage with the "new and young feminisms" of the modern day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Jonathan|last2=Aune|first2=Kristin|date=2015-07-04|title=Feminism Resurgent?

For instance, in [[Canada]], after the #MeToo hashtag started trending in October 2017, hundreds of people began to credit fourth-wave feminists with the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/metoo-movement-in-canada|title=#MeToo Movement in Canada|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2019-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401174416/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/metoo-movement-in-canada|archive-date=1 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hashtag, #AndNow, became popular in Canada due to the support of Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]]. #AndNow supported discussing the solution to sexual harassment or abuse in the workplace to help people fight for equity between all people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In [[India]], there have been several movements or protests with large numbers of women, which have changed the perspective of many in the nation regarding femininity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These include the 2003 [[Blank Noise|Blank Noise Project]], the 2009 [[Pink Chaddi Campaign|Pink Chaddi]] (underwear) movement, the 2011 [[SlutWalk]] protest, the 2015 [[Pinjra Tod]] (Break the Cage) movement and the 2017 [[Bekhauf Azadi]] (Freedom without Fear) March. Indian social discourse started to focus on long-term and deep-rooted issues, such as gender inequality, sexual violence, child marriage, sex-selective abortions, and dowry-related violence. Many believe it led to the questioning of women's freedoms, choices, and desires in society.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The influence and power of the campaign made the government expand the legal definition of rape, introduced "harsher punishment for rapists, criminalizing stalking and voyeurism",&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; showed "a new kind of Indian femininity that was comfortable with her modernity and sexuality"&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and demonstrates the rise of fourth-wave feminism in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/stopthisshame-girlsatdhaba-whyloiter-and-more-womens-fight-against-sexual-harassment-didnt-start-with-metoo-105711|title=#StopThisShame, #GirlsAtDhaba, #WhyLoiter and more: women's fight against sexual harassment didn't start with #MeToo|last=Kurian|first=Alka|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2019-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421142926/http://theconversation.com/stopthisshame-girlsatdhaba-whyloiter-and-more-womens-fight-against-sexual-harassment-didnt-start-with-metoo-105711|archive-date=21 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social media==
While previous waves of feminism have encountered such obstacles as rigid sociopolitical structures and a lack of available communication channels,&lt;ref name="Schuller-2018"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schuller, Kyla|title=The Biopolitics of Feeling: Race, Sex, and Science in the Nineteenth Century|date=2018|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822372356|oclc=1050035724}}&lt;/ref&gt; fourth-wave feminists harness [[digital media]] as a far-reaching platform on which to connect, share perspectives, create a broader view of experienced oppression, and critique past feminist waves.&lt;ref name="Baer-2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baer|first=Hester|date=2016-01-02|title=Redoing feminism: digital activism, body politics, and neoliberalism|journal=Feminist Media Studies|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=17–34|doi=10.1080/14680777.2015.1093070|issn=1468-0777|s2cid=146135612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves" /&gt;&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"/&gt;

[[Kira Cochrane]] has argued that fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology" and characterized particularly by the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]], and blogs such as [[Feministing]] to challenge [[misogyny]].&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon-2009"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|url-status=live|access-date=16 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716184154/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|archive-date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zerbisias-2016"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016172423/https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|archive-date=16 October 2015|access-date=21 April 2016|website=NOW Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social-media activism can manifest as Twitter threads critiquing perceived [[transphobia]] in the media&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Parry|first=Diana C.|title=Feminisms in Leisure Studies|pages=1–12|year=2018|chapter=Fourth wave feminism|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781315108476-1|isbn=9781315108476}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in so-called "hashtag feminism" campaigns, notably [[Me Too movement|#MeToo]],&lt;ref name="Cosboy-Ghomeshi-MeToo" /&gt; [[YesAllWomen|#YesAllWomen]], [[Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping##BringBackOurGirls movement and protests|#bringbackourgirls]], #NotYourAsianSidekick and [[Black Twitter##SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen|#SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen]].{{cn|date=August 2021}} Girlgaze, launched by [[Amanda de Cadenet]], is an online multi-sided platform that directly connects businesses, companies and brands with women and non-binary creative talent,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=girlgaze.com|url=https://girlgaze.com|url-status=live|website=Girlgaze}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting the need for diversity, inclusion and representation across the creative industry.

Artistic endeavors include ''[[Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight)|Mattress Performance]]'' and ''[[10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Discourse surrounding the topic of [[Social privilege|privilege]] is common among fourth-wave feminists, who argue that members of traditionally dominant social groups should acknowledge their societal privilege and use it to empower and advocate for members of marginalized groups.&lt;ref name="Maclaran-2015" /&gt;

==Criticism==
One criticism of fourth-wave feminism is that it depends on technology. [[Ragna Rök Jóns (person)|Ragna Rök Jóns]] argued that "[t]he key problem that this '4th Wave' will face will be the disproportionate access to and ownership of digital media devices." The fourth wave is left with the "inherent [[classism]] and [[ableism]]" created by giving the greatest voice to those who can afford and use technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bluestockingsmag.com/2013/08/19/is-the-4th-wave-of-feminism-digital/|title=Is the '4th Wave' of Feminism Digital?|last=Jóns|first=Ragna Rök|website=Bluestockings Magazine|date=19 August 2013|access-date=21 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327113106/http://bluestockingsmag.com/2013/08/19/is-the-4th-wave-of-feminism-digital/|archive-date=27 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the growth of social media in regions plagued by pervasive social injustice remains slow.&lt;ref name="PSA"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Munro|first=Ealasaid|date=September 2013|title=Feminism: A Fourth Wave?|journal=Political Insight|volume=4|issue=2|pages=22–25|doi=10.1111/2041-9066.12021|s2cid=142990260}} Republished as {{Cite web|last=Munro|first=Ealasaid|date=5 September 2013|title=Feminism: A fourth wave?|url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/feminism-fourth-wave|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181202070519/https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/feminism-fourth-wave|archive-date=2 December 2018|access-date=1 December 2018|website=The Political Studies Association}} / {{Cite web|title=Feminism: A fourth wave? {{!}} The Political Studies Association (PSA)|url=https://www.psa.ac.uk/psa/news/feminism-fourth-wave|access-date=2020-06-27|website=Feminism: A fourth wave? {{!}} The Political Studies Association (PSA)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that efforts by large corporations such as [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] to capitalize on the movement through activist advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/avidan/2017/05/11/dove-invented-femvertising-but-its-latest-stunt-didnt-wash-with-consumers/|title=Dove Invented 'Femvertising' But Its Latest Stunt Didn't Wash With Consumers|last=Dan|first=Avi|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421142925/https://www.forbes.com/sites/avidan/2017/05/11/dove-invented-femvertising-but-its-latest-stunt-didnt-wash-with-consumers/|archive-date=21 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be inimical to fourth-wave feminism, which tends to be critical of capitalism as an economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annis|first=Ashley Hartman|date=Winter 2016|title=Which way is feminism leaning? A critique of Sandberg's 'Feminist Manifesto'|url=https://www.library.wisc.edu/gwslibrarian/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2016/07/FC_3712_Lean-In-Out.pdf|journal=Feminist Collections: A Quarterly of Women's Studies Resources|volume=37|issue=1–2|pages=3–5|via=GenderWatch|access-date=2 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909212417/https://www.library.wisc.edu/gwslibrarian/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2016/07/FC_3712_Lean-In-Out.pdf|archive-date=9 September 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative critique of fourth-wave feminism is that when women believe that the world is set against them through social systems such as [[patriarchy]], they will abandon all efforts instead of competing with men as equals. Author Joanna Williams writes in ''[[The American Conservative]]'' that fourth-wave feminism encourages women to "call upon external helpmates, like the state, and ugly identity politics that push good men away". Williams also associates the movement with the "[[regressive left]]", claiming fourth-wave feminists are authoritarian and illiberal by dictating acceptable ideologies and policing the speech of men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/fourth-wave-feminismwhy-no-one-escapes/|title=Fourth Wave Feminism: Why No One Escapes|last=Williams|first=Joanna|website=The American Conservative|access-date=2019-04-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402031653/https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/fourth-wave-feminismwhy-no-one-escapes/|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued{{by whom?|date=July 2020}} that when people participate in Internet activism, they may not feel the need to do anything else to help the effort. This type of activism is addressed in feminist punk band [[Le Tigre]]'s 2001 song "[[Get Off the Internet]]", from before social media came into the picture. Later, in 2015, [[Alex Guardado]] asserted in an article on Twitter activism for NewUniversity.org that after contributing their say, people just "continue on with their day, liking other posts or retweeting". Some may think of themselves as activists while never bothering to attend a rally or extend their message beyond their Twitter fan base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newuniversity.org/2015/03/opinion/hashtag-activism-the-benefits-and-limitations-of-activism/|title=Hashtag Activism: The Benefits and Limitations of #Activism|last=Guardado|first=Alex|date=3 March 2015|work=New University|publisher=University of California, Irvine|access-date=21 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503053133/http://www.newuniversity.org/2015/03/opinion/hashtag-activism-the-benefits-and-limitations-of-activism/|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; While various feminist campaigns have spread via social media, the term [[slacktivism]] was coined to describe the mass media users who may speak out on their online platform but do little else to stimulate social action outside of their online platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guillard|first=Julianne|date=2016-07-28|title=Is feminism trending? Pedagogical approaches to countering (Sl)activism|journal=Gender and Education|volume=28|issue=5|pages=609–626|doi=10.1080/09540253.2015.1123227|s2cid=148497865|issn=0954-0253}}&lt;/ref&gt; This forms part of a greater dialogue surrounding the roles and requirements of activism in an age where communities operate almost as equally online as they do face-to-face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kaun|first1=Anne|last2=Uldam|first2=Julie|date=2017-09-19|title=Digital activism: After the hype|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=20|issue=6|pages=2099–2106|doi=10.1177/1461444817731924|s2cid=206729225|issn=1461-4448|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:sh:diva-33458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Simpkins of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' argued in 2014 that fourth-wave feminism had created a hostile, ''[[Mean Girls]]''–like atmosphere, in which women are more likely to tear each other down. "I've actually never once been belittled and attacked by a man for believing in the cause of feminism ... but women are just about lining up to take a whack at the shoddy piñata of my personal tastes and opinions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jennifer-simpkins/feminism-fourth-wave-became-mean-girls_b_4616597.html|title='You Can't Sit with Us!'&amp;nbsp;– How Fourth-Wave Feminism Became 'Mean Girls'|last=Simpkins|first=Jennifer|date=20 January 2014|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=21 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510080539/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/jennifer-simpkins/feminism-fourth-wave-became-mean-girls_b_4616597.html|archive-date=10 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; British scholar [[Ealasaid Munro]] says that the [[call-out culture]] of fourth-wave feminism risks marginalizing and separating people who could serve better as allies over minor disagreements.&lt;ref name="PSA"/&gt;

Women and their gendered issues are not uniform and many variations in issues are a result of related issues such as race, sexuality, and class, and Munro also provides the critique that mainstream feminism is focused on the struggle of middle-class white women.&lt;ref name="PSA" /&gt; Social campaigns that cast celebrities as the face of the movement, such as the [[Me Too movement]], have been criticized, because celebrities often represent the privileged sectors of society, which in turn negate the efforts to expand upon the [[intersectionality]] of feminism.&lt;ref name="Looft-2017"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Looft|first=Ruxandra|date=2017-11-02|title=#girlgaze: photography, fourth wave feminism, and social media advocacy|journal=Continuum|volume=31|issue=6|pages=892–902|doi=10.1080/10304312.2017.1370539|issn=1030-4312|s2cid=148881977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wave narrative itself is criticised due to perceptions that it is only inclusive of western feminist movements&lt;ref name="Evans-Critical-Waves" /&gt; and that the fourth wave itself takes place in the global north, often neglecting the struggle of women in other regions.&lt;ref name="Phillips 930–943"/&gt;

Other critiques of fourth-wave feminism include its lack of clear evidence in most cases of social media use. Along with this, some argue that though all issues should be dealt with, smaller issues must not be inflated to a higher level by the feminist movement. One example of this is [[Matt Damon]]'s response to the Harvey Weinstein case, "I do believe that there is a spectrum of behaviour, right? [...] There's a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?" Social media also can be seen as ineffective as it brings down "bogeyman" individuals rather than, "invent[ing] a different language or logic that can excise or alter the structures of oppression" as [[Sarah K. Burgess (person)|Sarah K. Burgess]] describes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Sarah K.|date=2018|title=Between the Desire for Law and the Law of Desire: #MeToo and the Cost of Telling the Truth Today|journal=Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric|volume=51|issue=4|pages=342–367|doi=10.5325/philrhet.51.4.0342|jstor=10.5325/philrhet.51.4.0342|s2cid=149835737|issn=0031-8213}}&lt;/ref&gt;
