[[Jennifer Baumgardner]] identifies fourth-wave feminism as starting in 2008 and continuing into the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/baumgardner2011.html|title = Is There a Fourth Wave?

Fourth wave feminism is often associated with online feminism, especially using [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]] and other forms of [[social media]] to discuss, uplift, and activate [[gender equality]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bcrw.barnard.edu/wp-content/nfs/reports/NFS8-FemFuture-Online-Revolution-Report-April-15-2013.pdf|title = #FEMFUTURE: ONLINE REVOLUTION|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet has created a ‘call-out’ culture, in which [[sexism]] or [[misogyny]] can be ‘called out’ and challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|title = Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|last = Zerbisias|first = Antonia|date = 16 September 2015|work = NOW|access-date = 11 November 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This culture is indicative of the continuing influence of the third wave, with its focus on micropolitics and challenging sexism and misogyny insofar as they appear in everyday rhetoric, advertising, film, television and literature, the media, and so on.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Feminism: A fourth wave? {{!}} The Political Studies Association (PSA)|url = https://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/feminism-fourth-wave|website = www.psa.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This online feminism aspect of the fourth wave has impacted how companies market to women so that they are not "called out" for sexism in their marketing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.packagingnews.co.uk/features/comment/soapbox/how-to-package-brands-for-the-fourth-wave-of-feminism-alex-hamilton-28-10-2015|title = How to Package Brands for the Fourth Wave of Feminism|last = Hamilton|first = Alex|date = 28 October 2015|work = Packaging News|access-date = 11 November 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides online feminism, the fourth-wave has been associated with the increase focus on intersectionality, including the repudiation of [[trans-exclusionary radical feminism]] and a focus on solidarity with other social justice movements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other aspects of fourth wave feminism include individuals who are uncomfortable with the word "feminism" itself, due to the "assumptions of a gender binary and exclusionary subtext: 'for women only,'" writes Martha Rampton, director of the [[Centre for Gender Equality|Center for Gender Equality]] at [[Pacific University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.pacificu.edu/about-us/news-events/three-waves-feminism-now-fourth|title = The Three Waves of Feminism: Now a Fourth?|last = Rampton|first = Martha|date = 25 October 2015|work = Pacific University Oregon|access-date = 11 November 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
