While the term is usually used to describe wrongful acts of [[government]], oppression is rarely limited solely to government action. Oppression is most commonly felt and expressed by a widespread, if unconscious, assumption that a certain class of people are inferior.

Oppression is often used to mean a certain group is being ''kept down'' by [[justice|unjust]] use of [[force]] or [[authority]] and has been referred to as "systematic oppression". See: [[domination]] and [[imperialism]].

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the concept of [[Human Rights]] in general were designed to eradicate oppression by giving a clear articulation of what limits should be placed on the power of any entity to control an individual or group of people.

A [[hierarchy of oppression]] is a ranking or [[hierarchy]] of [[oppression]]s according to arbitrariness and cruelty or according to the negative effects on oppressed communities. Hierarchies of oppression are generally discredited though widespread and often unstated.

==Examples of oppression==
* [[racism]]
* [[totalitarianism]]
* [[sexism]]
* [[heterosexism]]
* [[police oppression]]
* [[censorship]] (government censorship rather)

==See also==
