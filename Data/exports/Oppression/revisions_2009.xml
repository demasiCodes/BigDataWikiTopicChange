[[Image:1904 Russian Tsar-Stop your cruel oppression of the Jews-LOC hh0145s.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Oppression derives from the concept of being weighted down, and is often depicted as such. Here, a [[political cartoon|cartoon]] [[Jew]] labors under the metaphorical oppression of the [[Czarist Russia|Russian]] [[Tsar]]]]

Social '''oppression''' has in recent times been an [[epiphenomenon]] of various types of social dysfunction, whereby discrimination against an identified group is stimulated, encouraged and reinforced by way of promoting antagonism towards the [[Other]]. The term itself is derived, in a direct experiential sense, from the sensation of being pushed or ''lifted up'' by a greatly superior force.

Oppression is the exercise of authority or power in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner.  It can also be defined as an act or instance of oppressing, the state of being oppressed, and the feeling of being heavily burdened, mentally or physically, by troubles, adverse conditions, and anxiety. 

==Systematic oppression==
[[Anarchism|Anarchists]] and other forms of [[libertarianism|libertarian]], at either end of the [[political spectrum]], argue that [[police]] and [[law]] themselves are oppression. The term ''oppression'' is primarily used in such instances to refer to the subordination of a given group or social category by [[justice|unjust]] use of [[force]], [[authority]], or societal [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] in order to achieve the effects noted above. When institutionalized, formally or informally, it may achieve the dimension of ''systematic oppression''. Oppression is customarily experienced as a consequence of, and expressed in, the form of a prevailing, if unconscious, assumption that the given target is in some way inferior. Oppression is rarely limited solely to formal [[government]] action: an individual may be the particular focus of oppression or persecution and in such circumstances have no group membership in which to share, and thus maybe mitigate, the burden of [[ostracism]].

In [[psychology]], racism, sexism and other prejudices are often studied as individual beliefs which, although not necessarily oppressive in themselves, can lead to oppression if they are codified in law or become parts of a culture.  By comparison, in [[sociology]], these prejudices are often studied as being institutionalized systems of oppression in some societies.  In sociology, the tools of oppression include a progression of denigration, [[dehumanization]], and [[demonization]]; which often generate [[scapegoating]], which is used to justify [[aggression]] against targeted groups and individuals.

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the concept of [[Human Rights]] in general were designed to limit oppression by giving a clear articulation of what fundamental freedoms any system should allow to all of the people over whom it has power.

When oppression is systematized through coercion, threats of violence, or violence by government agencies or non-government paramilitiaries with a political motive, it is often called [[Political repression]]. More subtle forms of political oppression/repression can be produced by [[blacklisting]] or individualized investigations such as happened during [[McCarthyism]] in the United States. 

Transnational systems of oppression include [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]], and [[totalitarianism]], and can generate a [[resistance movement]] to challenge the oppressive status quo.

==Internalized oppression==
In [[sociology]] and [[psychology]], internalized oppression is the manner in which an oppressed group comes to use against itself the methods of the oppressor. For example, sometimes members of marginalized groups hold an oppressive view toward their own group, or start to believe in negative stereotypes of themselves.

For example, internalized racism is when members of Group A believe that the stereotypes of Group A are true and may believe that they are less intelligent or academically inferior to other groups of people. 

Any social group can internalize prejudice.

==Indirect oppression==
Indirect oppression is oppression that is effected by psychological attack, situational constraints or other indirect means. It has been a popular tactic practiced in single power{{what}}, power monopoly or other authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.

==Resistance==
Several movements have arisen that specifically aim to oppose, analyse and counter oppression in general; examples include [[Liberation Theology]] in the Christian world, and [[Re-evaluation Counseling|Re-evaluation Counselling]] in the psychotherapuetic arena. Modern-day groups that actively oppose oppression include Ligali, a British African organization headed by civil rights activist [[Toyin Agbetu]].
