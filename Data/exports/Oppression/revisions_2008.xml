'''Oppression''' is the act of using power to empower and/or privilege a group at the expense of disempowering, marginalizing, silencing, and subordinating another group. Oppression does not need established organizational support; it can be rendered on a much smaller individual scale.   It is particularly closely associated with [[nationalism]] and derived social systems, where in identity is built by antagonism to the other. The term itself derives from the idea of being "weighted down."

==Systematic oppression==
The most famous type of oppression in society is the legal system. Anarchists argue that police and [[law]] itself is oppression. The term oppression is primarily used to describe how a certain group is being subordinated by [[justice|unjust]] use of [[force]], [[authority]], or societal [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] in order to privilege another group. When this is institutionalized formally or informally in a society, it is referred to as "systematic oppression". Oppression is most commonly felt and expressed by a widespread, if unconscious, assumption that a certain group of people are inferior. Oppression is rarely limited solely to government action. Individuals can be victims of oppression, and in this case have no group membership to share their burden of being ostracized.

In [[psychology]], racism, sexism and other prejudices are often studied as individual beliefs which, although not necessarily oppressive in themselves, can lead to oppression if they are codified in law or become parts of a culture.  By comparison, in [[sociology]], these prejudices are often studied as being institutionalized systems of oppression in some societies.  In sociology, the tools of oppression include a progression of denigration, [[dehumanization]], and [[demonization]]; which often generate [[scapegoating]], which is used to justify [[aggression]] against targeted groups and individuals.

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the concept of [[Human Rights]] in general were designed to challenge oppression by giving a clear articulation of what limits should be placed on the power of any entity to unfairly control an individual or group of people.

When oppression is systematized through coercion, threats of violence, or violence by government agencies or non-government paramilitiaries with a political motive, it is often called [[Political repression]]. More subtle forms of political oppression/repression can be produced by [[blacklisting]] or individualized investigations such as happened during [[McCarthyism]] in the United States. 

Transnational systems of oppression include [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]], and [[totalitarianism]], and can generate a [[resistance movement]] to challenge the oppressive status quo.

==Note: Hierarchy has multiple definitions; some structures which can be defined as hierarchial, such as a representative democracy or a republic, may not necessarily be seen as oppressive, since the upper ranks are representatives and may be prevented from acting in a repressive way by the ability to recall them or vote them out. The 'imperfectness' of representative democracy however, particularly in the face of dominant interest groups and a media that imperfectly conveys information, means that the oppressiveness or not of a democratic government can be perceived very differently by different people.

==Internalized oppression==
In [[sociology]] and [[psychology]], internalized oppression is the manner in which an oppressed group comes to use against itself the methods of the oppressor. For example, sometimes members of marginalized groups hold an oppressive view toward their own group, or start to believe in negative stereotypes of themselves.

For example, internalized racism is when members of Group A believe that the stereotypes of Group A are true and may believe that they are less intelligent or academically inferior to other groups of people. 

Any social group can internalize prejudice.

==Indirect oppression==
Indirect oppression is oppression that is effected by psychological attack, situational constraints or other indirect means. It has been a popular tactic practiced in single power, power monopoly or other authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.

==Resistance==
Several movements have arisen that specifically aim to oppose, analyse and counter oppression in general; examples include [[Liberation Theology]] in the Christian world, and [[Re-evaluation Counseling|Re-evaluation Counselling]] in the psychotherapuetic arena.
