[[File:1904 Russian Tsar-Stop your cruel oppression of the Jews-LOC hh0145s.jpg|thumb|Oppression derives from the concept of being weighted down, and is often depicted as such. Here, a [[political cartoon]] shows a [[Jew]] laboring under the metaphorical oppression of the [[Czarist Russia|Russian]] [[Tsar]]]]

'''Oppression''' is the exercise of authority or power in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aolsvc.merriam-webster.aol.com/dictionary/oppression definition from Merriam Webster Online].&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also be defined as an act or instance of oppressing, the state of being oppressed, and the feeling of being heavily burdened, mentally or physically, by troubles, adverse conditions or people, and anxiety.

==Social oppression==
Social oppression is the socially supported mistreatment and exploitation of a group, category, or team of people or individual.

==Institutionalised oppression==
"Institutional Oppression occurs when established laws, customs, and practices systematically reflect and produce inequities based on one’s membership in targeted social identity groups. If oppressive consequences accrue to institutional laws, customs, or
practices, the institution is oppressive whether or not the individuals maintaining those practices have oppressive intentions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcc.edu/resources/illumination/documents/institutionalized-oppression-definitions.pdf |title=Definition from pcc.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systematic oppression==
[[Police]] and [[law]] themselves are often examples of systematic oppression. The term ''oppression'' in such instances to refer to the subordination of a given group or social category by [[justice|unjust]] use of [[force]], [[authority]], or societal [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] in order to achieve indoctrination. Through institutionalization, formally or informally, it achieves the dimension of ''systematic oppression''. Oppression is customarily experienced as a consequence of, and expressed in, the form of a prevailing, if unconscious, assumption that the given target is in some way inferior. Oppression is rarely limited solely to formal [[government]] action: an individual may be the particular focus of oppression or persecution and in such circumstances have no group membership in which to share, and thus maybe mitigate, the burden of [[ostracism]].

In [[psychology]], racism, sexism and other prejudices are often studied as individual beliefs which, although not necessarily oppressive in themselves, can lead to oppression if they are codified in law or become parts of a culture. By comparison, in [[sociology]], these prejudices are often studied as being institutionalized systems of oppression in some societies. In sociology, the tools of oppression include a progression of denigration, [[dehumanization]], and [[demonization]]; which often generate [[scapegoating]], which is used to justify [[aggression]] against targeted groups and individuals.

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the concept of "[[human rights]]" in general were designed to limit oppression by giving a clear articulation of what fundamental freedoms any system should allow to all of the people over whom it has power.

When oppression is systematized through coercion, threats of violence, or violence by government agencies or non-government paramilitaries with a political motive, it is often called [[political repression]]. More subtle forms of [[political oppression]]/repression can be produced by [[blacklisting]] or individualized investigations.

Transnational systems of governance that can often be oppressive include [[colonialism]], [[dictatorship]], [[imperialism]], [[absolute monarchy]] and [[totalitarianism]], and can generate a [[resistance movement]] to challenge the oppressive status quo.

==Resistance==
Several movements have arisen that specifically aim to oppose, analyse and counter oppression in general; examples include [[Liberation Theology]] in the Christian world, and [[Re-evaluation Counseling|Re-evaluation Counselling]] in the psychotherapeutic arena. Modern-day groups that actively oppose oppression include Ligali, a British African organization headed by civil rights activist [[Toyin Agbetu]].
