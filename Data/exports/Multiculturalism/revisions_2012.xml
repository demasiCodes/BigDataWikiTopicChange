'''Multiculturalism''' relates to communities containing multiple [[culture]]s. The term is used in two broad ways, either descriptively or normatively.&lt;ref name="Heywood2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Heywood|title=Key concepts in politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aiz8xT-iinmf8C&amp;pg=PA227|date=17 October 2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-23381-5|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a descriptive term, it usually refers to the simple fact of [[cultural diversity]]: it is generally applied to the [[demographics|demographic make-up]] of a specific place, sometime at the organizational level, e.g. [[school]]s, [[business]]es, [[neighbourhood]]s, [[city|cities]], or [[nation]]s. As a normative term, it refers to ideologies or policies that promote this diversity or its institutionalisation; in this sense, multiculturalism is a society “at ease with the rich tapestry of human life and the desire amongst people to express their own identity in the manner they see fit.”&lt;ref name="Bloor2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Bloor|title=The Definitive Guide to Political Ideologies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R-cRCD-QBVYC&amp;pg=PA272|date=February 2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4490-6761-8|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideologies or policies vary widely, including country to country,&lt;ref name="Harper2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas L.

Interactions of cultures provide opportunities for the cultural differences to communicate and interact to create multiculturalism. (Such approaches are also often known as [[interculturalism]].) The second centers on diversity and cultural uniqueness. Cultural isolation can protect the uniqueness of the local culture of a nation or area and also contribute to global cultural diversity.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} A common aspect of many policies following the second approach is that they avoid presenting any specific ethnic, religious, or cultural community [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] as central.&lt;ref name="Cotter2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne-Marie Mooney Cotter|title=Culture clash: an international legal perspective on ethnic discrimination|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0AcvVUevrMYC&amp;pg=PA13|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-1936-5|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiculturalism is often contrasted with the concepts of [[cultural assimilation|assimilationism]] and has been described as a "[[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]]" or "[[cultural mosaic]]" rather than a "[[melting pot]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=TuggI-Ye_AUC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Cultural%20mosaic%20Canada&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|page=31|title=Guide to Western Canada|edition=7th|first1=Ann Carroll|last1= Burgess|first2=Tom |last2=Burgess|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|year=2005|isbn=0-7627-2987-2|accessdate = 2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiculturalism in different national contexts==

The [[Canadian government]] has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada|social importance of immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geography.ryerson.ca/jmaurer/030_108art/030Multiculturalism.pdf|format=PDF|title=Immigration, Multiculturalism and National Identity in Canada|publisher=University of Toronto Department of Political Science|first=Shara|last=Wayland|year=1997|accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] is often refereed to as the origins of modern political awareness of   multiculturalism.&lt;ref name="II2010."&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald L.

Recently, right-of-center governments in several European states—notably the [[Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]]— have reversed the national policy and returned to an official monoculturalism.&lt;ref name = Bissoondath /&gt; A similar reversal is the subject of debate in the United Kingdom, among others, due to evidence of incipient segregation and anxieties over "home-grown" [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workpermit.com/news/2005_04_26/uk/uk_immigration_debate.htm Fact or fiction in the great UK immigration debate]. workpermit.com.

Many nation-states in Africa, Asia, and the Americas are culturally diverse, and are 'multicultural' in a [[descriptive]] sense. In some, [[communalism]] is a major political issue. The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multicultural-ist policies in the [[Western world]], but the historical background is different, and the goal may be a mono-cultural or [[Monoethnicity|mono-ethnic]] [[nation-building]] - for instance in the Malaysian government's attempt to create a 'Malaysian race' by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]]: ''[http://www.economist.com/surveys/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1677228 The changing of the guard]'', April 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Bois]] and [[Alain Locke]] developed concepts of cultural pluralism, from which emerged what we understand today as multiculturalism. In ''Pluralistic Universe'' (1909), William James espoused the idea of a "[[plural society]]."  James saw pluralism as "crucial to the formation of philosophical and social [[humanism]] to help build a better, more egalitarian society.&lt;ref name=Boening&gt;{{cite news

The educational approach to multiculturalism has since spread to the grade school system, as school systems try to rework their curricula to introduce students to diversity earlier—often on the grounds that it is important for minority students to see themselves represented in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Volk2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terese M.

Historically, Europe has always been a mixture of Latin, Slavic, Germanic, Uralic, Celtic, Hellenic, Illyrian, Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Hebraic, Christian, Muslim and other belief systems; although the continent was supposedly unified by the super-position of Imperial Roman Christianity, it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age.&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert C. Ostergren|author2=Mathias Le Bossé|title=The Europeans: A Geography of People, Culture, and Environment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y-1fwix23zMC&amp;pg=PA226|date=7 March 2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-384-6|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the ideology of [[nationalism]] transformed the way Europeans thought about the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011"/&gt; Existing states were broken up and new ones created; the new [[nation-states]] were founded on the principle that each [[nation]] is entitled to its own [[sovereignty]] and to engender, protect, and preserve its own unique culture and history. Unity, under this ideology, is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation-state—unity of descent, unity of culture, unity of language, and often unity of religion. The nation-state constitutes a culturally [[wiktionary:Homogeneity|homogeneous]] society, although some national movements recognized regional differences.

Where cultural unity was insufficient, it was encouraged and enforced by the state.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; The 19th-century nation-states developed an array of policies—the most important was compulsory [[primary education]] in the [[national language]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guntram Henrik Herb, David H. Kaplan|title=Nations and Nationalism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2UoQ-ueHjdEC&amp;pg=PA522|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-907-8|page=522|date=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language itself was often standardized by a linguistic academy, and regional languages were ignored or suppressed. Some nation-states pursued violent policies of [[cultural assimilation]] and even [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;

Some European Union countries have introduced policies for "social cohesion", "integration", and (sometimes) "assimilation". The policies include:
*compulsory courses and/or tests on [[historiography and nationalism|national history]], on the [[constitution]] and the [[legal system]] (e.g., the computer-based test for individuals seeking naturalization in the UK named [[Life in the United Kingdom test]])
*introduction of an official national history, such as the national [[Western canon|canon]] defined for the Netherlands by the [[Frits van Oostrom|van Oostrom]] Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entoen.nu/ |title=Official Web site |publisher=Entoen.nu |date= |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion of that history (e.g., by exhibitions about [[Folk hero|national heroes]])
*tests designed to elicit "unacceptable" values. In [[Baden-Württemberg]] immigrants are asked what they would do if their son says he is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]. (The desired answer is that they would accept it).&lt;ref&gt;BBC report at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4655240.stm News.BBC.co.uk], full list of questions in German at [http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2006/01/04/a0154 TAZ.de]&lt;/ref&gt;
*prohibitions on [[hijab|Islamic dress]]&amp;nbsp;— especially the [[niqab]] (often misnamed as [[burqa]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/nov/11/religion.uk Netherlands moves toward total ban on Muslim veils]'', Guardian, November 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries have instituted policies which encourage cultural separation. The concept of “[[Cultural exception]]” proposed by France in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations in 1993 was an example of a measure aimed at protecting local cultures.&lt;ref name="GraberNenova2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Beat Graber|author2=Mira Burri Nenova|title=Intellectual property and traditional cultural expressions in a digital environment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gK6OI0hrANsC&amp;pg=PA87|date=30 November 2008|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84720-921-4|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore unlike some other [[Nazi Germany]] allies or German-occupied countries excluding [[Denmark]], Bulgaria managed to save its entire 48,000-strong Jewish population during World War II from deportation to [[concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;A description of the book and some reviews can be found on the website of Princeton Univ.

In 1984 an underground organization called «National Liberation Movement of the Turks in Bulgaria» was formed in Bulgaria which headed the Turkish community's opposition movement.

There are more than 700 living languages spoken in Indonesia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=indonesia |title=Ethnologue report for Indonesia |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although predominantly Muslim the country also has large Christian and Hindu populations. Indonesia's national motto, "Bhinneka tunggal ika" ("Unity in Diversity" lit. "many, yet one"), articulates the diversity that shapes the country. Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government [[transmigration program]]s or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions. Soon after the fourth Indonesian President, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] came into power in 1999, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to improve race relationships.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Japan===
{{main|Ethnic issues in Japan}}
Japanese society, with its ideology of homogeneity, has traditionally rejected any need to recognize ethnic differences in Japan, even as such claims have been rejected by such ethnic minorities as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abe fine with 'homogeneous' remark|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070227a9.html|publisher=Kyodo News|date=2007-02-27|accessdate=2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Japanese Minister [[Taro Aso]] has called Japan a “one race” nation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?nn20051018a7.htm Aso says Japan is nation of 'one race']".

===Malaysia===
{{Main|Ketuanan Melayu}}
[[Malaysia]] is a multiethnic country, with [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] making up the majority, close to 52% of the population. About 24.6% of the population are [[Chinese Malaysian|Malaysians of Chinese descent]]. [[Indian Malaysian|Malaysians of Indian descent]] comprise about 7% of the population. The remaining 10% comprises:
* Native [[East Malaysia]]ns, namely [[Bajau]], [[Bidayuh]], [[Dusun]], [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Kadazan]], [[Melanau]], [[Orang Ulu]], [[Sarawakian Malay]]s, etc.
* Other native tribes of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], such as the [[Orang Asli]] and Siamese people, and
* Non-native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia such as the [[Chettiar]]s, the [[Peranakan]] and the Portuguese.

The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] or NEP serves as a form of affirmative action (see [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6237328.stm Malaysia fury at EU envoy remarks], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes structural changes in various aspects of life from education to economic to social integration. Established after the [[May 13 Incident|May 13 racial riots]] of 1969, it sought to address the significant imbalance in the economic sphere where the minority [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] population had substantial control over commercial activity in the country.

The [[Malay Peninsula]] has a long history of international trade contacts, influencing its ethnic and religious composition. Predominantly [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] before the 18th century, the ethnic composition changed dramatically when the British introduced new industries, and imported Chinese and Indian labor. Several regions in the then [[British Malaya]] such as [[Penang]], [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]] became Chinese dominated. Until the riots 1969, co-existence between the three ethnicities (and other minor groups) was largely peaceful, although the three main racial groups for the most part lived in separate communities - the Malays in the villages, the Chinese in the urban areas, and the Indians in the towns and plantation. More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of institutionalized discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&amp;catid=198:helen-ang&amp;Itemid=156 |title=Honey, I shrunk the Chinese! |publisher=CPI |date= 09 December 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preceding independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]], a [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] was negotiated as the basis of a new society. The contract as reflected in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution]] states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship, and Malays' special rights are guaranteed. This is often referred to the [[Bumiputra]] policy.

These [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties, who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights. The issue is sometimes related to the controversial [[status of religious freedom in Malaysia]].

===Mauritius===
Multiculturalism has been a characteristic feature of the island of [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref name="LionnetShi2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Françoise Lionnet|author2=Shumei Shi|title=Minor transnationalism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NJKgGEb2jpsC&amp;pg=PA203|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=16 February 2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-3490-3|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauritian society includes people from many different ethnic and religious groups: Hindu, Muslim and [[Indo-Mauritian]]s, [[Mauritian Creole people|Mauritian Creoles]] (of African and [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] descent), Buddhist and Roman Catholic [[Sino-Mauritian]]s and [[Franco-Mauritian]]s (descendants of the original [[French people|French]] colonists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infomauritius.com/ |title=Some facts about Mauritius |publisher=Infomauritius.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
Besides [[English Language|English]], Singapore recognizes three other languages, namely, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] as its official languages, with [[Malay language|Malay]] being the national language. Besides being a [[multilingualism|multilingual]] country, Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by these three ethnic communities.

During the British colonial rule, there are areas which are enclaves containing a large population of certain ethnic groups exist in areas such as [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]], [[Geylang]] and [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]] in Singapore. Presently &lt;sup&gt;(2010)&lt;/sup&gt;, remnants of the colonial ethnic concentration still exists but housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) In [[Housing and Development Board|Housing Development Boards of Singapore website]] Retrieved on Nov 18, 2010 from  [http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10296p.nsf/PressReleases/C515273FA068DD58482576DD00169155?OpenDocument ''Policy Changes To Support An Inclusive And Cohesive Home'']&lt;/ref&gt; The current Indian/Others ethnic limits are 10% and 13%, the limits for Malays are 22% and 25%, the limits for Chinese are 84% and 87% for the maximum ethnic limits for a neighborhood and a block respectively.

===South Korea===
[[South Korea]] is among the world's most ethnically homogeneous nations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ Korea's ethnic nationalism is a source of both pride and prejudice, according to Gi-Wook Shin]". The Korea Herald. August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do not share such features are often rejected by the Korean society or face discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/MonoPaper3-13.html The Life Instability of Intermarried Japanese Women in Korea]", Eung-Ryul Kim (Korea University and University of Southern California, The Center for Multiethnic and Transnational Studies)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the word "multiculturalism" is increasingly heard in South Korea. In 2007, Han Geon-Soo, Professor of Cultural Anthropology at [[Kangwon National University]], published an article entitled "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", noting: "As the increase of foreign migrants in Korea transforms a single-ethnic homogenous Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one, Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement." He argued, however, that "the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in Korea" lacked "the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society".&lt;ref&gt;Han Geon-Soo, "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", ''Korea Journal'', Vol.47 No.4, Winter 2007, pp.32-63&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued:
:''"Korea no longer has to decide whether it wants to become a multicultural society. It made that decision years ago – perhaps unconsciously – when it decided to be a full participant in the emerging global economy. It confirmed that decision when it decided to actively recruit foreign migrants to meet the economic and demographic needs of a fast-growing society. Korea is faced by a different decision today: what type of multicultural society does it want to be?"''&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Castles, [http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf "Will Labour Migration lead to a Multicultural Society in Korea?", Global Human Resources Forum 2007 / International Migration Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Korea Times]]'' suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/10/123_57884.html "Multiculturalism Likely to Prevail in Korea"], Lee Hyo-sik, ''Korea Times'', December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''[[JoongAng Daily]]'' reported: "Media in Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism. With more than one million foreigners in Korea, 2 percent of the population comes from other cultures." It added:
:''"If you stay too long, Koreans become uncomfortable with you. [...] Having a 2 percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea’s greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad. Multiculturalism will introduce contrasting views and challenge existing assumptions. While it will undermine the homogeneity, it will enrich Koreans with a better understanding of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925120 "Multiculturalism in Korea"], ''JoongAng Daily'', August 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many debates still take place in discussing whether Korea really is a muticultural society or not, it is a mutual agreement that Korea has probably entered a stage of multiculturalism and has moved away from its homogenous identity. It is a notified fact that around 35~40% of Korean man in the rural area outside Seoul are engaged with wives from different countries. According to the Dongponews, an online media that connects migrants and immigrants of Korea, the number of foreigners residing in Korea have reached 1.43 million by 2012, and is likely to increase more and more, reaching to the scale that cannot be undermined. More than that, Korea is going through a serious stage of low birthrate, leading to an aging society in shortage of labor forces. Another big changing factor is that Korea already has multi-ethnic, multi-cultural families appearing in great numbers, as one in every ten marriage is between a Korean and a foreigner, and in the rural side this portion is greater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dongponews.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=21266 Is ROK a multicultural society?] Dongpo News. 2012-05-18.  Retrieved 2012-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt; As such change takes place in such short period of time, it can be understood that many conflicts arise among different groups of people; the immigrants, government, and the rest of the members in Korean society. Recently a lot of media attention is given to these people; documentaries on the lives of wives and their children are often shown, as well as talk shows that portrays struggles and conflicts these people go through such as Love in Asia; a talk show hosting foreign wives, sharing their experience of marriage and family life, broadcased by the national broadcasting channel, KBS. Although whether these channels of media provide the right source of direction to the public is debatable, it is factually true that many Koreans nowadays do recognize the change that the society is going through due to these media attention. Government policies have also changed very recently; a lot of welfare programs and extracurricular activities are launched under the name of "multicultural policy." The policy is quite recent phenomenon and therefore its effects and counter effects need to be assessed in many different ways. Further studies and development in this area is obviously required, as this is a very rapid social change to Koreans and their society.

===United Arab Emirates===
Although [[Arabic]] is the official language of the country, [[English language|English]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Tagalog]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and many other languages are widely spoken and understood. The UAE host expatriate workers from over 150 countries with majority coming from [[India]], [[Philippines]], [[Iran]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Pakistan]] and [[China]]. Regardless of being an Islamic state, the UAE has widely accepted and respect all other religions with permission to have their temples or church. [[Dubai]] and [[Abu Dhabi]] are an emerging multi cultural and touristic cities that also hosts most of the country's multi-cultural population. The local population make up less than 20%.

==Support for multiculturalism==
Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society, that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/22/multiculturalism-blame-culture-segregation |title=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |location=London |first=Antony |last=Lerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes.

Historically, support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II, in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the "human rights revolution", in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and [[ethnic cleansing]] became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the [[Holocaust]]; with the collapse of the [[Colonial empire|European colonial system]], as colonized nations in Africa and [[Imperialism in Asia|Asia]] successfully [[African independence movements|fought for their independence]] and pointed out the racist underpinnings of the colonial system; and, in the United States in particular, with the rise of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which criticized ideals of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo-American standards and which led to the development of academic [[ethnic studies]] programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Wessendorf, ''The multiculturalism backlash: European discourses, policies and practices'', p.35; accessed through Google Books, 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Gorski, [http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/papers/edchange_history.html "A Brief History of Multicultural Education"], EdChange.org, November 1999; accessed 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As this history shows, multiculturalism in Western countries was seen as a useful set of strategies to combat racism, to protect minority communities of all types, and to undo policies that had prevented minorities from having full access to the opportunities for freedom and equality promised by the [[liberalism]] that has been the hallmark of Western societies since the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
[[File:Diversity of youth in Oslo Norway.jpg|thumb|Teenagers of various backgrounds in Oslo, [[Norway]].]]
C. James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it "uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history, particularly the histories of women and minorities [...and] promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten.&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. James Trotman|title=Multiculturalism: roots and realities|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ht8UKlutUaMC&amp;pg=PR9|accessdate=29 January 2012|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34002-3|pages=9=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By closing gaps, by raising consciousness about the past, multiculturalism tries to restore a sense of wholeness in a [[postmodern]] era that fragments human life and thought."&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"/&gt;

[[Tariq Modood]] argues that in the early years of the 21st Century, multiculturalism "is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less", since it is "the form of integration" that (1) best fits the ideal of [[egalitarianism]], (2) has "the best chance of succeeding" in the "post-[[9/11]], post [[7/7]]" world, and (3) has remained "moderate [and] pragmatic".&lt;ref name="Modood2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tariq Modood|title=Multiculturalism: a civic idea|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hlEMZuPhpWQC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-3288-9|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhikhu Parekh]] counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities "demanding special rights" and to see it as promoting a "thinly veiled racis[m]". Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact "not about minorities" but "is about the proper terms of relationship between different cultural communities", which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., "the principles of justice" must not come from only one of the cultures but must come "through an open and equal dialogue between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parekh|first=Bhikhu C.|title=Rethinking multiculturalism: cultural diversity and political theory|year=2002|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-00995-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to multiculturalism==
{{Main|Criticism of multiculturalism}}

Critics of multiculturalism often debate whether the multicultural ideal of benignly co-existing cultures that interrelate and influence one another, and yet remain distinct, is sustainable, paradoxical, or even desirable.&lt;ref name="Nagle2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Nagle|title=Multiculturalism's double bind: creating inclusivity, [[cosmopolitanism]] and difference|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zqMCc37dW1kC&amp;pg=PA129|date=23 September 2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-7607-2|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rajaee2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Farhang Rajaee|title=Globalization on trial: the human condition and the information civilization|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZyAt3T1V4EcC&amp;pg=PT97|date=May 2000|publisher=IDRC|isbn=978-0-88936-909-2|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SandercockAttili2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leonie Sandercock|author2=Giovanni Attili|author3=Val Cavers|coauthors=Paula Carr|title=Where strangers become neighbours: integrating immigrants in Vancouver, Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TmlGzr4s0uMC&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9034-9|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that [[Nation states]], who would previously have been synonymous with a distinctive cultural identity of their own, lose out to enforced multiculturalism and that this ultimately erodes the host nations' distinct culture.&lt;ref name="Report attacks multiculturalism"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4295318.stm |title=Report attacks multiculturalism |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard professor of political science [[Robert D. Putnam]] conducted a nearly decade long study how multiculturalism affects social trust.&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"&gt;Putnam, Robert D., "E Pluribus Unum: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-first Century -- The 2006 Johan Skytte Prize," ''Scandinavian Political Studies'' 30 (2), June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust.  People in diverse communities "don’t trust the local mayor, they don’t trust the local paper, they don’t trust other people and they don’t trust institutions," writes Putnam.&lt;ref&gt;Sailer, Steve, [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/jan/15/00007/ "Fragmented Future,"] ''American Conservative'', Jan. 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us.&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ethologist [[Frank Salter]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism.  For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens.  Case studies of the United States, Africa and South-East Asia find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure.  Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnies {{sic}}.  A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogenous cities.&lt;ref&gt;Salter, Frank, ''On Genetic Interests'', pg.146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dick Lamm]], former three-term Democratic governor of the US state of [[Colorado]], wrote in his essay "I have a plan to destroy America":

:"Diverse peoples worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other - that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent."&lt;ref&gt;Richard D. Lamm, 2005, [http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/lamm.asp I have a plan to destroy America], accessed 12 January 2011, Snopes.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand (Aotearoa), which is officially bi-cultural, multiculturalism has been seen as a threat to Maori, and possibly an attempt by the New Zealand Government to undermine Maori demands for self determination.  http://alt.sagepub.com/content/33/1/29.abstract
