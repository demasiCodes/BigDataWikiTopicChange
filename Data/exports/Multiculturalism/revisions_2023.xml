The term '''multiculturalism''' has a range of meanings within the contexts of [[sociology]], [[political philosophy]], and colloquial use. In [[sociology]] and in everyday usage, it is a synonym for "[[Pluralism (political theory)|ethnic pluralism]]", with the two terms often used interchangeably, and for [[cultural pluralism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/9780470373699.speced1627 |chapter=Pluralism, Cultural |title=Encyclopedia of Special Education |year=2008 |pages=1591–1592 |isbn=978-0-470-37369-9 |editor1-last=Reynolds |editor1-first=Cecil R. |editor2-last=Fletcher-Janzen |editor2-first=Elaine }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which various ethnic and cultural groups exist in a single society. It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such as [[New York City]] or [[London]]) or a single country within which they do (such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]], aboriginal or [[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] ethnic group and settler-descended ethnic groups are often the focus.&lt;ref name="metafizika journal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gasimova|first1=Narmina|date=2022-12-15 |title=Multiculturalism as the main philosophical concept in the social development of modern society|url=http://metafizikajurnali.az/storage/images/site/files/Metafizika-20/Metafizika.Vol.5%2CNo.4%2CSerial.20%2Cpp.77-87.pdf |journal=[[Metafizika (journal)|Metafizika]] |language=az |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=77–87 |issn=2616-6879 |eissn=2617-751X |oclc=1117709579 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221110181145/https://metafizikajurnali.az/storage/images/site/files/Metafizika-20/Metafizika.Vol.5,No.4,Serial.20,pp.77-87.pdf |archive-date=2022-11-10 |access-date=2022-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled [[immigration]]) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. [[French Canadians|French Canada]] and [[English Canadians|English Canada]]). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal [[Human migration|migration]] to and from different jurisdictions around the world.

In reference to political science, multiculturalism can be defined as a state's capacity to effectively and efficiently deal with cultural plurality within its sovereign borders. Multiculturalism as a political philosophy involves [[Diversity ideologies|ideologies]] and policies which vary widely.&lt;ref name="Harper2011"&gt;{{cite book|author= Thomas L.

===History===
States that embody multicultural ideals have arguably existed since ancient times. The [[Achaemenid Empire]] founded by [[Cyrus the Great]] followed a policy of incorporating and tolerating various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Menek |first1=İbrahim Halil |title=A HISTORICAL EXAMPLE OF MULTICULTURALISM: ACHAEMENID EMPIRE MULTICULTURALISM |journal=Gaziantep Üniversitesi İktisadi ve İdari Bilimler Fakültesi Dergisi |date=26 May 2020 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=118–138 |url=https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/gauniibf/issue/54503/626711 |language=en |issn=2651-267X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A historical example of multiculturalism was the [[Habsburg monarchy]], which had broken up in 1918 and under whose roof many different ethnic, linguistic and religious groups lived together. The Habsburg rule was mired in controversy, including events such as the [[Siculicidium|mass murder committed against Székelys by the Habsburg army]] in 1764 and the destruction of [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Churches and Monasteries in [[Transylvania]] by Adolf Nikolaus von Buccow. &lt;ref&gt;Georges Castellan, A History of the Romanians, Boulder: East European Monographs, 1989, p. 109. ISBN 0880331542&lt;/ref&gt; Both events had happened during the rule of [[Maria Theresa]]. Today's topical issues such as social and cultural differentiation, multilingualism, competing identity offers or multiple cultural identities have already shaped the scientific theories of many thinkers of this multi-ethnic empire.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Griesser "Denkanstöße aus der Multikulti-Monarchie" in: Standard, 3 July 2012; Pieter M. Judson "The Habsburg Empire. A New History" (Harvard 2016); Christopher Clark "The Sleepwalkers" (New York 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; After the First World War, ethnic minorities were disadvantaged, forced to emigrate or even murdered in most regions in the area of the former Habsburg monarchy due to the prevailing nationalism at the time. In many areas, these ethnic mosaics no longer exist today. The ethnic mix of that time can only be experienced in a few areas, such as in the former Habsburg port city of [[Trieste]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Engelhorn "Wie Wien mit Meersicht: Ein Tag in der Hafenstadt Triest" In: NZZ 15 February 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[political philosophy]] of multiculturalism, ideas are focused on the ways in which societies are either believed to or should, respond to cultural and Christian differences. It is often associated with "identity politics", "the politics of difference", and "the politics of recognition". It is also a matter of economic interests and [[Power (social and political)|political power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiculturalism/ Multiculturalism] – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as [[African American]]s and the [[LGBT]] community, with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, [[indigenous peoples]] and even people with disabilities. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate.

Most debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group's culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a [[melting pot]] or non-multicultural societies.

The term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western [[nation-state]]s, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="ZarateLevy2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geneviève Zarate|author2=Danielle Levy|author3=Claire Kramsch|title=Handbook of Multilingualism and Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYL4_6SvxewC&amp;pg=PA377|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Archives contemporaines|isbn=978-2-8130-0039-2|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nation-states in Africa, Asia, and the Americas are culturally diverse and are 'multicultural' in a [[descriptive]] sense. In some, [[Communalism (South Asia)|ethnic communalism]] is a major political issue. The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multiculturalist policies in the Western world, but the historical background is different, and the goal may be a mono-cultural or [[Monoethnicity|mono-ethnic]] [[nation-building]] – for instance in the Malaysian government's attempt to create a 'Malaysian race' by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]]: ''[http://www.economist.com/surveys/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1677228 The changing of the guard]'', 3 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society, that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/22/multiculturalism-blame-culture-segregation |title=Guardian.co.uk |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 March 2010 |access-date=10 December 2010 |location=London |first=Antony |last=Lerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes.

Historically, support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II, in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the "human rights revolution", in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and [[ethnic cleansing]] became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the [[Holocaust]]; with the collapse of the [[Colonial empire|European colonial system]], as colonized nations in Africa and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]] successfully [[African independence movements|fought for their independence]] and pointed out the discriminatory underpinnings of the colonial system; and, in the United States in particular, with the rise of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which criticized ideals of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo-American standards and which led to the development of academic [[ethnic studies]] programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Wessendorf, ''The multiculturalism backlash: European discourses, policies and practices'', p. 35; accessed through Google Books, 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Gorski, [http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/papers/edchange_history.html "A Brief History of Multicultural Education"], EdChange.org, November 1999; accessed 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As this history shows, multiculturalism in Western countries was seen to combat racism, to protect minority communities of all types, and to undo policies that had prevented minorities from having full access to the opportunities for freedom and equality promised by the [[liberalism]] that has been the hallmark of Western societies since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The [[contact hypothesis]] in sociology is a well-documented phenomenon in which cooperative interactions with those from a different group than one's own reduce prejudice and inter-group hostility.

[[Will Kymlicka]] argues for "group differentiated rights", that help both religious and cultural minorities operate within the larger state as a whole, without impinging on the rights of the larger society. He bases this on his opinion that human rights fall short in protecting the rights of minorities, as the state has no stake in protecting the minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1093/0198290918.003.0006 |chapter=Justice and Minority Rights |title=Multicultural Citizenship |year=1996 |last1=Kymlicka |first1=Will |pages=107–130 |isbn=9780198290919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

C. James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it "uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history, particularly the histories of women and minorities [...and] promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten.&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. James Trotman|title=Multiculturalism: roots and realities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ht8UKlutUaMC&amp;pg=PR9|access-date=29 January 2012|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34002-3|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By closing gaps, by raising consciousness about the past, multiculturalism tries to restore a sense of wholeness in a [[postmodern]] era that fragments human life and thought."&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"/&gt;

[[Tariq Modood]] argues that in the early years of the 21st century, multiculturalism "is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less", since it is "the form of integration" that (1) best fits the ideal of [[egalitarianism]], (2) has "the best chance of succeeding" in the "post-[[9/11]], post [[7/7]]" world, and (3) has remained "moderate [and] pragmatic".&lt;ref name="Modood2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tariq Modood|title=Multiculturalism: a civic idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlEMZuPhpWQC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-3288-9|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhikhu Parekh]] counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities "demanding special rights" and to see these as promoting a "thinly veiled racis[m]". Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact "not about minorities" but "is about the proper terms of the relationship between different cultural communities", which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., "the principles of justice" must not come from only one of the cultures but must come "through an open and equal dialogue between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parekh|first=Bhikhu C.|title=Rethinking multiculturalism: cultural diversity and political theory|year=2002|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-00995-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balibar characterizes criticisms of multiculturalism as "differentialist racism", which he describes as a covert form of racism that does not purport ethnic superiority as much as it asserts stereotypes of perceived "incompatibility of life-styles and traditions".&lt;ref name="Gunew 2004 80"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunew|first=Sneja|title=Haunted Nations: The colonial dimensions of multiculturalisms|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=11 New Fetter Lane, London EC4P 4EE|isbn=978-0-415-28483-7|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of multiculturalism often debate whether the multicultural ideal of benignly co-existing cultures that interrelate and influence one another, and yet remain distinct, is sustainable, paradoxical, or even desirable.&lt;ref name="Nagle2009"&gt;{{cite book|last = Nagle|first = John|title=Multiculturalism's double bind: creating inclusivity, cosmopolitanism and difference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqMCc37dW1kC&amp;pg=PA129|date=23 September 2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-7607-2|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rajaee2000"&gt;{{cite book|last = Rajaee |first = Farhang |title=Globalization on trial: the human condition and the information civilization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyAt3T1V4EcC&amp;pg=PT97|date=May 2000|publisher=IDRC |isbn= 9780889369092 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SandercockAttili2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Sandercock |first1 =Leonie |last2 = Attili |first2 = Giovanni |last3 = Cavers |first3 = Val |last4 = Carr |first4 = Paula |title=Where strangers become neighbours: integrating immigrants in Vancouver, Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmlGzr4s0uMC&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9034-9|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that [[nation states]], who would previously have been synonymous with a distinctive cultural identity of their own, lose out to enforced multiculturalism and that this ultimately erodes the host nations' distinct culture.&lt;ref name="Report attacks multiculturalism"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4295318.stm |title=Report attacks multiculturalism |work = [[BBC News]] |date=30 September 2005 |access-date=10 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Song views cultures as historically shaped entities by its members, and that they lack boundaries due to globalization, thereby making them stronger than others might assume.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice, Gender, and the Politics of Multiculturalism|last=Song|first=Sarah|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-511-49035-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to argue against the notion of special rights as she feels cultures are mutually constructive, and are shaped by the dominant culture. Brian Barry advocates a difference-blind approach to culture in the political realm and he rejects group-based rights as antithetical to the universalist liberal project, which he views as based on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Barry]], Culture and Equality ([[Polity Press]], 2001), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Moller Okin]], a feminist professor of political philosophy, argued in 1999, in "Is multiculturalism bad for women?", that the principle that all cultures are equal means that the equal rights of women in particular are sometimes severely violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bostonreview.net/forum/susan-moller-okin-multiculturalism-bad-women|title=Is Multiculturalism Bad For Women?|date=1 October 1997|website=Boston Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard professor of political science [[Robert D. Putnam]] conducted a nearly decade-long study on how multiculturalism affects social trust.&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Putnam |first = Robert D. |author-link = Robert D.

People in diverse communities "don't trust the local mayor, they don't trust the local paper, they don't trust other people and they don't trust institutions," writes Putnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Sailer |first = Steve |author-link = Steve Sailer |title = Fragmented future |url = http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/jan/15/00007/ |work = [[The American Conservative]] |publisher = Jon Basil Utley |date = 15 January 2007 |access-date = 19 November 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604174328/http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/jan/15/00007/ |archive-date = 4 June 2011 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that, "[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it's not just that we don't trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don't trust people who do not look like us".&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007" /&gt; Putnam has also stated, however, that "this allergy to diversity tends to diminish and to go away... I think in the long run we'll all be better."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Michel, "[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12802663 Political Scientist: Does Diversity Really Work?]" Tell Me More, NPR.

He asserted that his "extensive research and experience confirm the substantial benefits of diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity, to our society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/robert-putnam-says-his-research-was-twisted/30357|title=Harvard Sociologist Says His Research Was 'Twisted'|last=Berlett|first=Tom|date=15 August 2012|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|access-date=28 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101091923/https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/robert-putnam-says-his-research-was-twisted/30357|archive-date=1 January 2020|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethnologist]] Frank Salter writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism. For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens. Case studies of the United States, Africa and South-East Asia find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure. Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnies {{sic}}. A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogeneous cities.&lt;ref&gt;Salter, Frank, ''On Genetic Interests'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dick Lamm]], former three-term Democratic governor of the US state of [[Colorado]], argued that "diverse peoples worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other—that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Lamm |first = Richard D. |title = I have a plan to destroy America |url = http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/lamm.asp |website = Snopes.com |date = 2005 |access-date = 12 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American classicist [[Victor Davis Hanson]] used the perceived differences in "rationality" between Moctezuma and Cortés to argue that Western culture was superior to every culture in the entire world, which thus led him to reject multiculturalism as a false doctrine that placed all cultures on an equal footing.&lt;ref name="Hanson, Victor Davis 2001. p. 205"&gt;Hanson, Victor Davis ''Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise to Western Power'', New York: Random House, 2001. p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Zealand]] ([[Aotearoa]]), which is officially bi-cultural, multiculturalism has been seen as a threat to the [[Māori people|Māori]] as an attempt by the New Zealand Government to undermine Māori demands for [[self-determination]] and encourage assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Jay T. |title=Indigeneity's Challenges to the White Settler-State: Creating a Thirdspace for Dynamic Citizenship |journal=Alternatives: Global, Local, Political |date=January 2008 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=29–52 |doi=10.1177/030437540803300103 |s2cid=145192448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
[[File:Mexico City 335.jpg|thumb|[[Teotihuacan]]]]
[[Mexico]] has historically always been a multicultural country. After the betrayal of [[Hernán Cortés]] to the Aztecs, the Spanish conquered the [[Aztec Empire]] and colonized indigenous people. They influenced the indigenous religion, politics, culture and ethnicity.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} The Spanish opened schools in which they taught [[Christianity]], and the [[Spanish language]] eventually surpassed indigenous languages, making it the most spoken language in Mexico. Mestizo was also born from the conquest, which meant being half-Indigenous and half-Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Page |first=Index |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1932-ethnic-diversity-in-mexico |title=Ethnic diversity in Mexico : Mexico Travel |publisher=Mexconnect.com |date=20 May 2011 |access-date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mexico City]] has recently been integrating rapidly, doing much better than many cities in a sample conducted by the Intercultural Cities Index (being the only non-European city, alongside [[Montreal]], on the index).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/culture/cities/index/Mexico_en.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – Mexico City PR rev[1&amp;#93;-1.doc |access-date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico is an ethnically diverse country with a population composed of approximately 123 million in 2017. There is a wide variety of ethnic groups, the major group being [[Mestizo]]s followed by [[White Mexicans]] and [[Indigenous Mexicans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investigacionyciencia.es/revistas/investigacion-y-ciencia/matemticas-del-planeta-tierra-585/el-impacto-del-mestizaje-en-mxico-11442|title=El impacto del mestizaje en México|work=Investigación y Ciencia|access-date=25 July 2018|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other ethnic groups such as [[Arab Mexicans]], [[Afro-Mexicans]] and [[Asian Mexicans]].

From the year 2000 to 2010, the number of people in Mexico that were born in another country doubled, reaching a total of 961,121 people, mostly coming from Guatemala and the United States.&lt;ref name=IO_1&gt;{{cite web| title=Informativo oportuno (Spanish text)| url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/inegi/contenidos/espanol/prensa/contenidos/Articulos/sociodemograficas/nacidosenotropais.pdf| url-status=dead| date=May 2011| volume=1| issue=2| access-date=13 November 2023| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427100913/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/inegi/contenidos/espanol/prensa/contenidos/Articulos/sociodemograficas/nacidosenotropais.pdf| archive-date=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico is quickly becoming a [[melting pot]], with many immigrants coming into the country. It is considered to be a [[cradle of civilization]], which influences their multiculturalism and diversity, by having different civilizations influence them. A distinguishable trait of Mexico's culture is the [[mestizaje]] of its people, which caused the combination of Spanish influence, their indigenous roots while also adapting the culture traditions from their immigrants.

=== Peru ===
[[Peru]] is an exemplary country of multiculturalism, in 2016 the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática|INEI]] reported a total population of 31 million people. They share their borders with Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Bolivia, and have welcomed many immigrants into their country creating a diverse community.

Peru is the home to [[Amerindians]] but after the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish Conquest]], the Spanish brought African, and Asian peoples as slaves to Peru creating a mix of ethnic groups. After slavery was no longer permitted in Peru, African-Peruvians and Asian-Peruvians have contributed to Peruvian culture in many ways. Today, Amerindians make up 45% of the population, [[Mestizo]]s 37%, [[White people|white]] 15% and 3% is composed by [[Black people|black]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.countryreports.org/country/Peru/population.htm|title=Peru population.

Continuous mass immigration was a feature of the United States economy and society since the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Isaacs2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Katherine Isaacs|title=Immigration and emigration in historical perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5asNot0c5kwC&amp;pg=PA38|year=2007|publisher=Edizioni Plus|isbn=978-88-8492-498-8|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absorption of the stream of immigrants became, in itself, a prominent feature of America's [[national myth]]. The idea of the [[melting pot]] is a [[metaphor]] that implies that all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Israel. ''The Melting Pot'', 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; The melting pot theory implied that each individual immigrant, and each group of immigrants, assimilated into American society at their own pace.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people – a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs... This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Jay]], ''First American Supreme Court Chief Justice'', [[Federalist No. 2|Federalist Paper No. 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a [[philosophy]], multiculturalism began as part of the [[pragmatism]] movement at the end of the 19th century in [[Europe]] and the United States, then as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political]] and [[cultural pluralism]] at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="CaputiFoster2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Caputi|author2=Heather Foster|author3=Linda L.

Philosophers, psychologists and historians and early sociologists such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[George Santayana]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[John Dewey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[Alain Locke]] developed concepts of cultural pluralism, from which emerged what we understand today as multiculturalism. In ''Pluralistic Universe'' (1909), William James espoused the idea of a "[[plural society]]". James saw pluralism as "crucial to the formation of philosophical and social [[humanism]] to help build a better, more egalitarian society.&lt;ref name=Boening&gt;{{cite news |last=Boening |first=Astrid B. |title=Euro-Islam&amp;nbsp;– A Constructivist Idea or a Concept of the English School? |newspaper=European Union Miami Analysis (EUMA) |volume=4

The educational approach to multiculturalism has since spread to the [[grade school]] system, as school systems try to rework their curricula to introduce students to diversity earlier – often on the grounds that it is important for minority students to see themselves represented in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Volk2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terese M.

According to a 2000 analysis of [[domestic terrorism in the United States]], "A distinctive feature of American terrorism is the ideological diversity of perpetrators.

Historically, Europe has always been a mixture of Latin, Slavic, Germanic, Uralic, Celtic, Hellenic, Illyrian, Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Jewish, Christian, Muslim and other belief systems; although the continent was supposedly unified by the super-position of Imperial Roman Christianity, it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age.&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert C. Ostergren|author2=Mathias Le Bossé|title=The Europeans: A Geography of People, Culture, and Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-1fwix23zMC&amp;pg=PA226|date=7 March 2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-384-6|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, the ideology of [[nationalism]] transformed the way Europeans thought about the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011" /&gt; Existing states were broken up and new ones created; the new [[nation-states]] were founded on the principle that each [[nation]] is entitled to its own [[sovereignty]] and to engender, protect, and preserve its own unique culture and history. Unity, under this ideology, is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation-state; unity of descent, unity of culture, unity of language, and often unity of religion. The nation-state constitutes a culturally [[wikt:Homogeneity|homogeneous]] society, although some national movements recognised regional differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conversi|first=Daniele|date=2007|title=Homogenisation, nationalism and war: Should we still read Ernest Gellner?|journal=Nations and Nationalism|volume=13|issue=3|pages=371–394|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8129.2007.00292.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where cultural unity was insufficient, it was encouraged and enforced by the state.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt; The nineteenth century nation-states developed an array of policies – the most important was compulsory [[primary education]] in the [[national language]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Guntram Henrik Herb |author2=David H. Kaplan |title=Nations and Nationalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UoQ-ueHjdEC&amp;pg=PA522|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-907-8|page=522|date=22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language itself was often standardised by a linguistic academy, and regional languages were ignored or suppressed. Some nation-states pursued violent policies of [[cultural assimilation]] and even [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;

Some countries in the European Union have introduced policies for "social cohesion", "integration", and (sometimes) "assimilation". The policies include:

* Compulsory courses and/or tests on [[historiography and nationalism|national history]], on the [[constitution]] and the [[legal system]] (e.g., the computer-based test for individuals seeking naturalisation in the UK named [[Life in the United Kingdom test]])
* Introduction of an official national history, such as the national [[Canon of the Netherlands|canon]] defined for the [[Netherlands]] by the [[Frits van Oostrom|van Oostrom]] Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entoen.nu/ |title=Official Web site |publisher=Entoen.nu |access-date=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion of that history (e.g., by exhibitions about [[Folk hero|national heroes]])
* Tests designed to elicit "unacceptable" values. In [[Baden-Württemberg]], immigrants are asked what they would do if their son says he is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] (the desired answer is that they would accept it&lt;ref&gt;BBC report at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4655240.stm News.BBC.co.uk], full list of questions in German at [http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2006/01/04/a0154 TAZ.de]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Other countries have instituted policies which encourage cultural separation.&lt;ref name="ReitzBreton2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeffrey G.

Furthermore, unlike some other [[Nazi Germany]] allies or German-occupied countries excluding [[Denmark]], Bulgaria managed to save its entire 48,000-strong Jewish population during World War II from deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tzvetan |last=Todorov |title=The Fragility of Goodness: Why Bulgaria's Jews Survived the Holocaust |translator=Arthur Denner |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7026.html |isbn=9780691115641 |access-date=31 December 2011 |archive-date=9 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709092623/http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7026.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levi |first=Primo |title= Beyond Hitler's Grasp|publisher=Adams Media |year= 2001  |isbn=978-1580625418}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr Marinova-Christidi, the main reason for the efforts of Bulgarian people to save their Jewish population during WWII is that within the region, they "co-existed for centuries with other religions" – giving it a unique multicultural and multiethnic history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leadel.Net |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=200216 |title=Exclusive video: 'Restoring the crown to former glory' | newspaper=The Jerusalem Post &amp;#124; Jpost.com |publisher=Jpost.com |access-date=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{Further|Immigration to France}}
After the end of World War II in  1945, immigration significantly increased. During the period of reconstruction, France lacked the labour to do so, and as a result; the French Government was eager to recruit immigrants coming from all over Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia.

Although there was a presence of, [[Vietnamese people in France|Vietnamese in France]] since the late-nineteenth century (mostly students and workers), a wave of Vietnamese migrated after 1954. These migrants consisted of those who were loyal to the colonial government and those married to French colonists. Following the [[partition of Vietnam]], students and professionals from [[South Vietnam]] continued to arrive in France. Although many initially returned to the country after a few years, as the [[Vietnam War]] situation worsened, a majority decided to remain in France and brought their families over as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eglasie.mepasie.org/divers-horizons/1995-10-16-la-diaspora-vietnamienne-en-france-un-cas La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000103/http://eglasie.mepasie.org/divers-horizons/1995-10-16-la-diaspora-vietnamienne-en-france-un-cas |date=3 December 2013}} (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

This period also saw a significant wave of immigrants from [[Algeria]]. As the [[Algerian War]] started in 1954, there were already 200,000 Algerian immigrants in France.&lt;ref name="histoire-immigration.fr"&gt;"Le film: deux siècles d'histoire de l'immigration en France." http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/histoire-de-l-immigration/le-film {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102185749/http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/histoire-de-l-immigration/le-film |date=2 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the tension between the Algerians and the French, these immigrants were no longer welcome. This conflict between the two sides led to the [[Paris massacre of 1961|Paris Massacre]] of 17 October 1961, when the police used force against an Algerian demonstration on the streets of Paris. After the war, after Algeria gained its independence, the free circulation between France and Algeria was once again allowed, and the number of Algerian immigrants started to increase drastically. From 1962-75, the Algerian immigrant population increased from 350,000 to 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;"En 1962, lors de l'Indépendance, ils sont 350 000. En 1975 les émigrants algériens sont 710 000 et constituent le deuxième groupe d'étrangers après les Portugais." "De 1945 à 1975." {{cite web |url=http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/dix-themes-pour-connaitre-deux-siecles-d-histoire-de-l-immigration/emigrer/de-1945-a-1975 |title=De 1945 à 1975 &amp;#124; Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration |access-date=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912030132/http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/dix-themes-pour-connaitre-deux-siecles-d-histoire-de-l-immigration/emigrer/de-1945-a-1975 |archive-date=12 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these immigrants were known as the "[[harki]]s", and the others were known as the "[[Pied-Noir|pieds-noirs]]". The "harkis" were Algerians who supported the French during the Algerian War; once the war was over, they were deeply resented by other Algerians, and thus had to flee to France. The "pieds-noirs" were European settlers who moved to Algeria, but migrated back to France since 1962 when Algeria declared independence.

According to Erik Bleich, multiculturalism in France faced stiff resistance in the educational sector, especially regarding recent Muslim arrivals from Algeria. Gatekeepers often warned that multiculturalism was a threat to the historic basis of French culture.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Bleich,. "From international ideas to domestic policies: Educational multiculturalism in England and France." ''Comparative Politics'' (1998): 81-100 [http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/251954/original/from_intl_ideas_to_domestic_policies.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeremy Jennings finds three positions among elites regarding the question of reconciling traditional French Republican principles with multiculturalism. The traditionalists refuse to make any concessions and instead insist on clinging to the historic republican principles of [[Secularism in France|"laïcité"]] and the secular state in which religion and ethnicity are always ignored. In the middle are modernising republicans who uphold republicanism but also accept some elements of cultural pluralism. Finally there are multiculturalist republicans who envision a pluralist conception of French identity and seek an appreciation of the positive values brought to France by the minority cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Jennings, "Citizenship, Republicanism and Multiculturalism in Contemporary France," ''British Journal of Political Science'' (2000) 30#4 575-597.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major attack on multiculturalism came in [[Stasi Commission|Stasi Report]] of 2003 which denounces "Islamism" as deeply opposed to the mainstream interpretations of French culture. It is portrayed as a dangerous political agenda that will create a major obstacle for Muslims to comply with [[Secularism in France|French secularism or "laïcité "]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer A. Selby, "Islam in France reconfigured: Republican Islam in the 2010 Gerin report." ''Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs'' 31.3 (2011): 383-398.&lt;/ref&gt;  Murat Akan, however, argues that the Stasi Report and the new regulations against the [[hijab]] and religious symbols in the schools must be set against gestures toward multiculturalism, such as the creation of Muslim schools under contract with the government.&lt;ref&gt;Murat Akan, "Laïcité and multiculturalism: the Stasi Report in context," ''British Journal of Sociology'' (2009) 60#2 pp 237-256 [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Murat-Akan/publication/26260531_Laicite_and_multiculturalism_The_Stasi_Report_in_context/links/5e7c8990a6fdcc139c0486a1/Laicite-and-multiculturalism-The-Stasi-Report-in-context.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;

This policy subsequently gave way to more assimilationist policies in the 1990s and post-electoral surveys uniformly showed from 1994 onwards that a majority preferred that immigrants assimilated rather than retained the culture of their country of origin.&lt;ref name="Wessendorf2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Damhuis|first=Koen|date=2019|title="The biggest problem in the Netherlands": Understanding the Party for Freedom's politicization of Islam|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-biggest-problem-in-the-netherlands-understanding-the-party-for-freedoms-politicization-of-islam/|access-date=28 February 2021|website=Brookings|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States and the murders of [[Pim Fortuyn]] (in 2002) and [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] (in 2004) there was increased political debate on the role of multiculturalism in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ModoodTriandafyllidou2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tariq Modood|author2=Anna Triandafyllidou|author3-link=Ricard Zapata-Barrero|author3=Ricard Zapata-Barrero|title=Multiculturalism, Muslims and citizenship: a European approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7OAAV5eEmy4C&amp;pg=PA27|date=6 April 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-35515-5|page=27|author1-link=Tariq Modood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
Since Antiquity, Romania has hosted many religious and ethnic groups, including Roma people, Hungarians, Germans, Turks, Greeks, Tatars, Slovaks, Serbs, Jews and others. Unfortunately, during the WW2 and the Communism, most of these ethnic groups choose to emigrate to other countries. However, since 1990s, Romania has expected a growing number of immigrants and refugees, most of them from the Arab World, Asia or Africa. Immigration is expected to increase in the future, as large numbers of Romanian workers leave the country and are being replaced by foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ziare.com/actual/social/10-14-2008/imigrantii-in-romania-nu-se-bucura-de-drepturile-care-li-s-ar-cuveni-434535 |title=Imigrantii in Romania nu se bucura de drepturile care li s-ar cuveni |publisher=Ziare.com |access-date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ziare.com/actual/diaspora/07-14-2009/le-monde-romania-noua-destinatie-a-imigrantilor-818911 |title=Le Monde: Romania, noua destinatie a imigrantilor |publisher=Ziare.com |date=13 July 2009 |access-date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Denmark a liberal-conservative coalition government with the support of the [[Danish People's Party]] which instituted less pluralistic policy, more geared towards [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2018 study found that increases in local ethnic diversity in Denmark caused "rightward shifts in election outcomes by shifting electoral support away from traditional "big government" left‐wing parties and towards anti‐immigrant nationalist parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harmon |first1=Nikolaj A. |title=Immigration, Ethnic Diversity, and Political Outcomes: Evidence from Denmark |journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics |date=October 2018 |volume=120 |issue=4 |pages=1043–1074 |doi=10.1111/sjoe.12239 |s2cid=54936991 |url=http://www.econ.ku.dk/nharmon/docs/harmon2013immigration.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For decades, Danish immigration policy was built upon the belief that, with support, immigrants and their descendants would eventually reach the same levels of education as Danes. In a 2019 report, the [[Danish Immigration Service]] and the [[Ministry of Education (Denmark)|Ministry of Education]] found this to be false. The report found that, while the second-generation immigrants without a [[Western world|Western]] background do better than their parents, the same is not true for third-generation immigrants. One of the reasons given was that second-generation immigrants may marry someone from their country of origin, which may cause Danish not to be spoken at home, which would put the children at a disadvantage in school. Thereby, the process of integrating has to start from the beginning for each generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.berlingske.dk/content/item/1329273|title=Opråb fra ministre: Problemer med integration af børn af ikkevestlige indvandrere|date=16 December 2018|website=[[Berlingske]].dk|language=da|access-date=29 January 2019|quote=Danmarks integrationspolitik har i årtier været bygget op om troen på, at med den rette hjælp vil indvandrere og deres efterkommerne generation for generation falde til.

The [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] has named the reduction of high levels of immigration from non-European countries one of their goals:

Sweden has from the early 1970s experienced a greater share of non-Western immigration than the other Scandinavian countries, which consequently have placed multiculturalism on the political agenda for a longer period of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sweden was the first country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism in Europe. On 14 May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the [[social democracy|social democratic]] government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dagenssamhalle.se/nyhet/dags-att-begrava-det-multikulturella-projektet-31651|title=Dags att begrava det multikulturella projektet|publisher=Dagens sahmälle|language=Swedish|date=17 February 2017|access-date=13 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies. Despite the anti-multiculturalist protestations of the [[Sweden Democrats]], multiculturalism remains official policy in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The multicultural moment: the history of the idea and politics of multiculturalism in Sweden in comparative, transnational and biographical context, 1964–1975|last=Wickström|first=Mats|publisher=Åbo Akademi|year=2015|isbn=978-952-12-3133-9|url=http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe201501071068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study which involved questionnaires sent to 5,000 people, showed that less than a quarter of the respondents (23%) wanted to live in areas characterised by cultural, ethnic and social diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svd.se/svenskar-vill-ha-inhagnat-boende|title=Svenskar vill ha inhägnat boende {{!}} SvD|last=TT|work=SvD.se|access-date=14 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322170850/http://www.svd.se/svenskar-vill-ha-inhagnat-boende|archive-date=22 March 2016|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study published by [[Gävle University College]] showed that 38% of the population never interacted with anyone from Africa and 20% never interacted with any non-Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.hig.se/download/18.4db66897149b264e1ba4df24/1417115797086/mangfald.pdf|title=Mångfaldsbarometern 2014|publisher=Gävle University College|date=October 2014|pages=7–8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621094211/https://www.hig.se/download/18.4db66897149b264e1ba4df24/1417115797086/mangfald.pdf|archive-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that while physical distance to the country of origin, also religion and other cultural expressions are significant for the perception of cultural familiarity. In general, peoples with [[Christianity]] as the dominant religion were perceived to be culturally closer than peoples from Muslim countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2017 study by [[Lund University]] also found that social trust was lower among people in regions with high levels of past non-Nordic immigration than among people in regions with low levels of past immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McShane|first1=Karl|date=2017|title=Getting used to diversity?

===Russian Federation===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Russia|Russian nationality law}}The idea of multiculturalism in Russia is closely linked to the territory and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] concept of "[[National delimitation in the Soviet Union|nationality]]". The Federation is divided into a series of [[Republics of Russia|republics]] where each ethnic group has preponderance in deciding the laws that affect that republic. A distinction is then made between ''Rossiyane'' (Russian citizens) and ''Russkie'' ([[Russians|ethnic Russians]]).

Each people within their territories has the right to practice their customs and traditions and even to impose their own laws, as is the case in [[Chechnya]], as long as they do not violate federal and constitutional laws of the [[Russian Federation]].

==== Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Castes (OBC) ====
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are constitutionally recognized terms in India and constitute approximately 25% of the Indian population. Moreover more than 40 percent of India's population belongs to the Other Backward Castes as per the National Sample Survey Office or the NSSO which is a government organization for conducting surveys in India. So the total size of the lower castes in India is estimated to be around 70 percent of the country's population whereas the upper caste make up around 18 percent of the population. It has also been noted that a person of the upper caste generally tends to be fairer in skin whereas the lower caste tend to be darker. These groups have been provided with reservations that constitutionally guarantee them representation in governmental institutions, a mandate suggested by the Mandal Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basavaraju|first=C.|date=Summer 2009|journal=Journal of the Indian Law Institute|volume=51|issue=2|pages=267–274|jstor=43953443|title=Reservation Under the Constitution of India: Issues and Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian constitution also provides SC's and ST's with protective measures that ensure equality, which is the main issue faced by members of both communities. However, while scheduled castes have turned into important political communities that the state concerns itself about, scheduled tribes continue to be politically marginalized.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government [[transmigration program]]s or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions. The Javanese for example, moved from their traditional homeland in Java to the other parts of the archipelago. The expansion of the Javanese and their influence throughout Indonesia has raised the issue of [[Javanization]], although [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]], Madurese, [[Bugis]] and Makassar people, as a result of their ''merantau'' (migrating) culture are also quite widely distributed throughout the Indonesian archipelago, while [[Chinese Indonesian]]s can be found in most urban areas. Because of [[urbanization]], major Indonesian cities such as [[Greater Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], [[Bandung]], [[Palembang]], [[Medan]] and [[Makassar]] have attracted large numbers of Indonesians from various ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. Jakarta in particular has almost all Indonesian ethnic groups represented.

However, this transmigration program and close interactions between people of different cultural backgrounds caused socio-cultural problems, as the inter-ethnics interactions have not always been conducted harmoniously. After the [[Post-Suharto era|fall of Suharto]] in 1998 into the 2000s, numbers of inter-ethnic and inter-religious clashes erupted in Indonesia. Like the clashes between native [[Dayak people|Dayak]] tribes against [[Madurese people|Madurese]] transmigrants in [[Kalimantan]] during [[Sambas riots]] in 1999&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=28 February 2001|title=Indonesia: The Violence in Central Kalimantan (Borneo)|url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/borneo0228.htm|access-date=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sampit conflict]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="flashpoint"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=28 June 2004|access-date=13 August 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3811219.stm|title=Indonesia flashpoints: Kalimantan}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also clashes between Muslims and Christians, such as [[Poso riots|violence erupted in Poso]] between 1998 and into 2000,&lt;ref name="BBC flashpoints"&gt;{{cite news| work = BBC News| date = 28 June 2004| title = Indonesia flashpoints: Sulawesi| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3812737.stm| access-date = 13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maluku sectarian conflict|violences in Maluku]] between 1999 and into 2002.&lt;ref name="timedirty"&gt;{{cite news|last=Elegant|first=Simon|title=Indonesia's Dirty Little Holy War|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,187655,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423064855/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,187655,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 April 2010|access-date=31 March 2011|newspaper=Time|date=17 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Indonesia today still struggles and has managed to maintain unity and inter-cultural harmony, through a national adherence of pro-pluralism policy of Pancasila; promoted and enforced by the government and its people.

[[Chinese Indonesians]] are the largest foreign-origin minority that has resided in Indonesia for generations. Despite centuries of acculturation with native Indonesians, because of their disproportionate influence on Indonesian economy, and alleged question of national loyalty, Chinese Indonesians have suffered [[Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians|discrimination]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|date=25 November 2016|title=Jakarta's violent identity crisis: behind the vilification of Chinese-Indonesians|url=http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/nov/25/jakarta-chinese-indonesians-governor-ahok|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20220213050845/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/nov/25/jakarta-chinese-indonesians-governor-ahok%23comments|archive-date=13 February 2022|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|access-date=13 February 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Suharto]] ''Orde Baru'' or New Order adopted a forced [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] policy; which indicated that Chinese cultural elements were unacceptable.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=24}} Chinese Indonesians were forced to adopt [[Chinese Indonesian surname|Indonesian-sounding names]], and the use of Chinese culture and language was banned.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The violence targeting Chinese Indonesians erupted during [[Fall of Suharto#Riots of 13–14 May|riots in 1998.]] As the looting and destruction took place, a number of Chinese Indonesians, as well as looters, were killed. The Chinese Indonesians were treated as the scapegoat of [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], a result of ongoing discrimination and segregation policies enforced during Suharto's New Order regime. Soon after the fourth Indonesian President, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] came into power in 1999, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to promote acceptance and to improve inter-racial relationships, such as abolishing the ban on Chinese culture; allowing Chinese traditions to be practised freely.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main|Ketuanan Melayu|Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Demographics of Malaysia}}
[[Malaysia]] is a multiethnic country, with [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] making up the majority, close to 58% of the population. About 25% of the population are [[Chinese Malaysian|Malaysians of Chinese descent]]. [[Indian Malaysian|Malaysians of Indian descent]] comprise about 7% of the population. The remaining 10% comprises:
* Native [[East Malaysia]]ns, namely [[Bajau]], [[Bruneian Malay people|Bruneian]], [[Bidayuh]], [[Dusun]], [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Kadazan]], [[Kedayan]], [[Melanau]], [[Orang Ulu]], [[Sarawakian Malay]]s, etc.
* Other native tribes of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], such as the [[Orang Asli]] and Siamese people, and
* Non-native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia such as the [[Chettiar]]s, the [[Peranakan]] and the Portuguese.

The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] or NEP serves as a form of "racial equalization" in the view of the Malay-controlled government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6237328.stm Malaysia fury at EU envoy remarks], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes structural changes in various aspects of life from education to economic to social integration. Established after the [[13 May Incident|13 May racial riots]] of 1969, it sought to address the "significant imbalance" in the economic sphere where the minority especially the  [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] population had substantial control over commercial activity in the country. Critics of this policy has called it synonymous to racial discrimination and synonymous to [[Apartheid (crime)#Malaysia|Apartheid]].

The [[Malay Peninsula]] has a long history of international trade contacts, influencing its ethnic and religious composition. Predominantly [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] before the 18th century, the ethnic composition changed dramatically when the British introduced new industries, and imported Chinese and Indian labor. Several regions in the then [[British Malaya]] such as [[Penang]], [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]] became Chinese dominated. Until the riots 1969, co-existence between the three ethnicities (and other minor groups) was largely peaceful, although the three main racial groups for the most part lived in separate communities – the Malays in the villages, the Chinese in the urban areas, and the Indians in the towns and plantation. More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of [[institutionalized discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Treena Becker|date=16 August 2016|title=Racism drove me from Malaysia.

Preceding independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]], a [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] was negotiated as the basis of a new society. The contract as reflected in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution]] states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship, and Malays' special rights are guaranteed. This is often referred to the [[Bumiputra]] policy.

These [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties, who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights. The issue is sometimes related to the controversial [[status of religious freedom in Malaysia]].

===Singapore===
[[File:Woodlands Town Park East, Singapore, looking north towards Marsiling Rise.jpg|thumb|right|High density public housing in Singapore, which are a common sight in the country, consists of different ethnic groups living together.]]
{{Main|Immigration to Singapore}}
Due to historical immigration trends, [[Singapore]] has a Chinese majority population with significant minority populations of [[Malay people|Malays]] and Indians (predominantly [[Tamil people|Tamils]]). Other prominent smaller groups include [[Peranakans]], [[Eurasians in Singapore|Eurasians]], [[Ethnic groups of Europe|Europeans]], [[Americans]], and [[Canadians]]. Besides [[English language|English]], Singapore recognizes three other languages—[[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. English was established as the medium of instruction in schools during the 1960s and 1970s and is the language of trade and government while the other three languages are taught as second languages ("mother tongues"). Besides being a [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] country, Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by the three main ethnic communities.

Under the [[Raffles Plan of Singapore]], the city was divided into ethnic enclaves such as [[Geylang]], [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]], and [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]]. Housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy, which ensures an even ethnic distribution throughout Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.)

Today, such ethnic enclaves has mostly been eliminated, due to the contemporary Singapore's government policy to encourage further ethnic integration between the different [[Demographics of Singapore|races of Singapore]]. A prominent example is its public housing system. Unlike other countries, public housing is not ostracised by a wide majority of the population and its government, and acts as a necessary and vital measure to provide immaculate and safe housing surrounded by [[Amenity|public amenities]] at affordable prices, especially during its rapid development and industrialisation in the early years of independence.&lt;ref name="LKS"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lim Kim San: a builder of Singapore |date=2009 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |location=Singapore |isbn=978-9812309280}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also meant to foster [[Group cohesiveness|social cohesion]] between the [[social class]]es and races of Singapore, and prevent neglected areas or districts and [[ethnic enclaves]] from developing – known as the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethnic Integration Policy and SPR Quota - Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB)|url=http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/resale/ethnic-integration-policy-and-spr-quota|website=Housing and Development Board (HDB)|access-date=11 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is considered a unique part of Singaporean culture, being commonly associated with the country.&lt;ref name="SGCUL"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/11-things-you-should-know-about-singaporean-culture/ |title=11 Things You Should Know About Singaporean Culture |last=Kaur |first=Tarra |website=theculturetrip.com |publisher=Culture Trip |access-date=11 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
{{Main|Immigration to South Korea}}
[[South Korea]] remains a relatively homogenous country ethnically, linguistically, and culturally.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ Korea's ethnic nationalism is a source of both pride and prejudice, according to Gi-Wook Shin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720053258/http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802 |date=20 July 2011 }}". The Korea Herald. 2 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners, expatriates, and immigrants are often rejected by the mainstream South Korean society and face discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/19991013000846/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/MonoPaper3-13.html The Life Instability of Intermarried Japanese Women in Korea]" (1999), Eung-Ryul Kim (Korea University and University of Southern California, The Center for Multiethnic and Transnational Studies)&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen as a result of World War II where the first noteworthy wave of multiculturalism between American servicemen and Korean women occurred. South Korea has been long regarded as an ethnic homogeneous country, therefore, the rise in mixed-race children was seen as a new phenomenon. Before the 1990s, the term ''honhyeol'' was commonly used to identify multiracial individuals in Korea – primarily in relation to the children of Korean women and American servicemen;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chung |first=Erin Aeran |title=Immigration Incorporation in East Asian Democracies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; this common term strengthened the association of multiracial people with a sense of alienation, rather than promoting cultural diversity within Korea. Not only did this term effectively discriminate against mixed-race Koreans but it also made a clear distinction between native Koreans and mixed-race Koreans.

Han Geon-Soo 2007 notes the increased use of the word "multiculturalism" in South Korea: "As the increase of foreign migrants in [South] Korea transforms a single-ethnic homogeneous [South] Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one, [the South] Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement." He argued, however, that "the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in [South] Korea" lacked "the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Han |first1=Geon-Soo |title=Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea? |journal=Korea Journal |date=December 2007 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=32–31 |doi=10.25024/KJ.2007.47.4.32 |s2cid=151038291 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued:
:"Korea no longer has to decide whether it wants to become a multicultural society. It made that decision years ago – perhaps unconsciously – when it decided to be a full participant in the emerging global economy. It confirmed that decision when it decided to actively recruit foreign migrants to meet the economic and demographic needs of a fast-growing society. Korea is faced by a different decision today: what type of multicultural society does it want to be?"&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Castles, [http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf "Will Labour Migration lead to a Multicultural Society in Korea?", Global Human Resources Forum 2007 / International Migration Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725111757/http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Korea Times]]'' suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/10/123_57884.html "Multiculturalism Likely to Prevail in Korea"], Lee Hyo-sik, ''Korea Times'', 24 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, an opinion editorial written by Peter Underwood for the ''[[JoongAng Ilbo]]'' stated: "Media in [South] Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism. With more than one million foreigners in [South] Korea, 2 percent of the population comes from other cultures." He further opined:
:"If you stay too long, Koreans become uncomfortable with you. [...] Having a two percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea's greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad. Multiculturalism will introduce contrasting views and challenge existing assumptions. While it will undermine the homogeneity, it will enrich Koreans with a better understanding of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Underwood |first=Peter |date=26 August 2010 |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925120 |title=Multiculturalism in Korea |work=JoongAng Ilbo |location=South Korea |access-date=2 September 2010 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902022520/http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925120 |archive-date=2 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, results from the Korean Identity Survey suggested that government programs promoting multiculturalism had seen some success with over 60% of Koreans supporting the idea a multicultural society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Palmer |first1=James |last2=Park |first2=Ga-Yong |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/07/16/south-koreans-learn-to-love-the-other-multiculturalism/ |title=South Koreans Learn to Love the Other: How to manufacture multiculturalism |access-date=3 December 2019 |newspaper=Foreign Policy |date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same poll in 2015 showed that support of a multicultural society had dropped to 49.7% suggesting a possible return to ethnic exclusivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denney |first=Steven |url=https://sinonk.com/2016/10/28/south-korean-identity-the-return-of-ethnic-exclusivism/ |title=South Korean Identity: The Return of Ethnic Exclusivism |access-date=4 December 2019 |journal=Sino-NK |date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===
{{Main|Immigration to Turkey}}
[[Turkey]] is a country that borders both Europe and Asia. It is home to several ethnic groups including Armenian, Assyrian, Greek, Jewish, Kurdish, Arab, and Turkish. There are cultural influences dating back to ancient Hellenic, Semitic and Iranian civilizations which diffused and mingled in myriad ways over a period of centuries.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rauf |first1=Imam Feisal Abdul |title=MULTICULTURALISMS: Western, Muslim and Future |journal=CrossCurrents |date=2005 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=100–105 |jstor=24461190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been an increase of diversity acceptance in Turkey, mainly because there was fear of losing values of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman past]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaya |first=Ayhan |chapter=Multiculturalism and Minorities in Turkey |date=2013 |title=Challenging Multiculturalism |pages=297–316 |series=European Models of Diversity |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-6457-3 |jstor=10.3366/j.ctt20q22fw.20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==
===Cameroon===
Officially known as the Republic of Cameroon, [[Cameroon]] is found in [[central Africa]] consisting of a diverse geographical and cultural area that makes it one of the most diverse countries known today. Ranging from mountains, deserts, and rainforests, to coast-lands and savanna grasslands, its diverse geography makes a large diverse population possible. This diverse geography resembles Africa as a whole and due to this, many people commonly label Cameroon as "Africa in Miniature".&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/cameroon/|title=The World Factbook – Central Intelligence Agency|website=cia.gov|language=en|access-date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mbenda |first1=Huguette Gaelle Ngassa |last2=Awasthi |first2=Gauri |last3=Singh |first3=Poonam K |last4=Gouado |first4=Inocent |last5=Das |first5=Aparup |title=Does malaria epidemiology project Cameroon as 'Africa in miniature'? |journal=Journal of Biosciences |date=September 2014 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=727–738 |doi=10.1007/s12038-014-9451-y |pmid=25116627 |s2cid=17219470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Demographics and official languages ====
Before Cameroon's independence, it was under British and French colonial rule from 1916-1961.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Upon gaining [[sovereignty]], a major colonial influence was evident, having both English and French become the national language to roughly 25,000,000 Cameroonian residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/|title=World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations|website=esa.un.org|access-date=26 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919061238/https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/|archive-date=19 September 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Asanga Fon |first1=Nguh Nwei |title=Can Bilingualism Survive in Cameroon? |pages=260–275 |conference=The Future of Humanities, Education and Creative Industries |date=October 2017 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338146687 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these two major languages, a new language consisting of a mixture of French, English, and [[Cameroonian Pidgin English|Pidgin]] known as [[Camfranglais|Frananglais]] gained popularity among Cameroonian residents.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newuh.blog/2012/12/13/cameroon-africa-in-miniature-in-what-sense/|title=Cameroon: Africa in Miniature – In what Sense?|date=13 December 2012|work=KINGSLEY SHETEH'S BLOG|access-date=26 July 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indigenous languages ====
Although these three languages are the most common in Cameroon, there are still approximately 273 [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] languages being spoken throughout the country, making it not only culturally diverse but linguistically as well.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CM|title=Cameroon|website=Ethnologue|access-date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who speak these indigenous languages are people from [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], Sudanic, [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]], [[Wodaabe]] (or [[Mbororo]]) and even primitive hunter-gatherer groups known as [[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Cameroon|title=Cameroon {{!}} Culture, History, &amp; People|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=26 July 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iwgia.org/en/cameroon|title=Cameroon|website=iwgia.org|language=en-gb|access-date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indigenous peoples' rights ====
Although native to Cameroonian land, they faced constant discrimination much like other indigenous groups around the world. The United Nations General Assembly ([[United Nations General Assembly|UNGA]]) adopted the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ([[UNDRIP]]) in 2007. What this allowed was the protection of land and resource rights and prevented others from [[wiktionary:Exploitation|exploiting]] or violating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samuel |first1=Nguiffo |last2=Amougou |first2=Victor Amougou |last3=Schwartz |first3=Brendan |last4=Cotula |first4=Lorenzo |title=Indigenous peoples' land rights in Cameroon: progress to date and possible futures |date=December 2017 |publisher=International Institute for Environment and Development |url=https://pubs.iied.org/17448IIED |jstor=resrep16706 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a group of indigenous Baka and Bagyeli groups united to form Gbabandi. Gbabandi allowed these indigenous groups to have a form of representation and a declared list of requirements that people of Cameroon had to abide by. Among these requirements were guaranteed land rights, peoples' consent to the usage of their sacred land, traditional chiefs and the ability to participate in "local, regional, and national levels" of political and economic matters. As a result, this established a sense of justice and acknowledgment among indigenous groups in Cameroon and posed for future battles for indigenous peoples' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/rights-land-natural-resources/news-article/2017/declaration-land-rights-gbabandi-platform-cameroon|title=Declaration on land rights from the Gbabandi Platform, Cameroon {{!}} Forest Peoples Programme|website=forestpeoples.org|language=en|access-date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
[[New Zealand]] is a [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] Oceanic country that adopted its multicultural policies post World War II. The country used to have immigration policies similar to Australia's [[White Australia Policy]], and The United States [[Immigration Act of 1924]],&lt;ref&gt;Socidad Peruana de Medicina Intensiva (SOPEMI) (2000). ''Trends in international migration: continuous reporting system on migration''. [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. pp. 276–278.&lt;/ref&gt; but it would later follow suit with Australia and Canada in the 1970s and adopt similar multicultural policies. The relaxation of migration led to an influx of new migration to New Zealand in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/history-of-immigration|title=History of immigration – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Jock (11 August 2015).

Ministry for Culture and Heritage. July 2010. Retrieved 19 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The revitalization in the Māori language led to its immersion in schools and television broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11670518|title=John Drinnan: 'Maori' will remain in the name Maori Television|last=@Zagzigger2|first=John Drinnan John Drinnan is the Media writer for the New Zealand Herald jdrinnan@xtra co nz|date=7 July 2016|work=NZ Herald|access-date=16 July 2018|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the New Zealand government opened an Office of Ethnic Affairs to advise its local governments on the advancement of ethnic diversity and affairs of its multicultural communities.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[List of dual place names in New Zealand|Many landmarks]] on the island have both their Māori and English names officially recognized.

The latter majority are [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]] whose ancestors arrived less than four thousand years ago.
