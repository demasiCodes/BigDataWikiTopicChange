The term '''multiculturalism''' has a range of meanings within the contexts of [[sociology]], of [[political philosophy]], and of colloquial use. In sociology and in everyday usage, it is a synonym for "[[Pluralism (political theory)|ethnic pluralism]]", with the two terms often used interchangeably, for example, a [[cultural pluralism]] in which various ethnic groups collaborate and enter into a dialogue with one another without having to sacrifice their particular identities. It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such as [[New York City]]) or a single country within which they do (such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an aboriginal or [[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] ethnic group and foreigner ethnic groups are often the focus.

In reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled [[immigration]]) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. [[French Canada]] and [[English Canada]]). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal [[human migration|migration]] to and from different jurisdictions around the world (for example, [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] by Angles, Saxons and Jutes in the 5th century or the colonization of the Americas by Europeans, Africans and Asians since the 16th century).

Multiculturalism that promotes maintaining the distinctiveness of multiple cultures is often contrasted{{by whom|date=September 2018}} to other [[settler|settlement]] policies such as [[social integration]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[racial segregation]]. Multiculturalism has been described as a "[[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]]" and as a "[[cultural mosaic]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TuggI-Ye_AUC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Cultural%20mosaic%20Canada&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |page= 31|title= Guide to Western Canada|edition= 7th|first1= Ann Carroll|last1= Burgess|first2= Tom |last2= Burgess|publisher= Globe Pequot Press|year= 2005|isbn= 0-7627-2987-2|accessdate = 2011-01-16}} {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - in contrast to a [[melting pot]].&lt;ref&gt;

Two different and seemingly inconsistent strategies have developed through different government policies and strategies. The first focuses on interaction and communication between different cultures; this approach is also often known{{by whom|date=September 2018}} as [[interculturalism]].

==Prevalence==
In the [[political philosophy]] of multiculturalism, ideas are focused on the ways in which societies are either believed to or should, respond to cultural and religious differences. It is often associated with "identity politics", "the politics of difference", and "the politics of recognition". It is also a matter of economic interests and [[Power (social and political)|political power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiculturalism/ Multiculturalism] – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as [[African American]]s, [[LGBT]], with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, [[indigenous peoples]] and even the disabled. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate.

Most debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group's culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a [[melting pot]] or non-multicultural societies.

The term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western [[nation-state]]s, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="ZarateLevy2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geneviève Zarate|author2=Danielle Levy|author3=Claire Kramsch|title=Handbook of Multilingualism and Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYL4_6SvxewC&amp;pg=PA377|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Archives contemporaines|isbn=978-2-8130-0039-2|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nation-states in Africa, Asia, and the Americas are culturally diverse and are 'multicultural' in a [[descriptive]] sense. In some, [[communalism]] is a major political issue. The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multiculturalist policies in the Western world, but the historical background is different, and the goal may be a mono-cultural or [[Monoethnicity|mono-ethnic]] [[nation-building]] – for instance in the Malaysian government's attempt to create a 'Malaysian race' by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]]: ''[http://www.economist.com/surveys/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1677228 The changing of the guard]'', April 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society, that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/22/multiculturalism-blame-culture-segregation |title=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |location=London |first=Antony |last=Lerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes.

Historically, support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II, in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the "human rights revolution", in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and [[ethnic cleansing]] became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the [[Holocaust]]; with the collapse of the [[Colonial empire|European colonial system]], as colonized nations in Africa and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]] successfully [[African independence movements|fought for their independence]] and pointed out the discriminatory underpinnings of the colonial system; and, in the United States in particular, with the rise of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which criticized ideals of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo-American standards and which led to the development of academic [[ethnic studies]] programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Wessendorf, ''The multiculturalism backlash: European discourses, policies and practices'', p. 35; accessed through Google Books, 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Gorski, [http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/papers/edchange_history.html "A Brief History of Multicultural Education"], EdChange.org, November 1999; accessed 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As this history shows, multiculturalism in Western countries was seen to combat racism, to protect minority communities of all types, and to undo policies that had prevented minorities from having full access to the opportunities for freedom and equality promised by the [[liberalism]] that has been the hallmark of Western societies since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The [[contact hypothesis]] in sociology is a well documented phenomenon in which cooperative interactions with those from a different group than one's own reduce prejudice and inter-group hostility.

C. James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it "uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history, particularly the histories of women and minorities [...and] promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten.&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. James Trotman|title=Multiculturalism: roots and realities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ht8UKlutUaMC&amp;pg=PR9|accessdate=29 January 2012|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34002-3|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By closing gaps, by raising consciousness about the past, multiculturalism tries to restore a sense of wholeness in a [[postmodern]] era that fragments human life and thought."&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"/&gt;

[[Tariq Modood]] argues that in the early years of the 21st century, multiculturalism "is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less", since it is "the form of integration" that (1) best fits the ideal of [[egalitarianism]], (2) has "the best chance of succeeding" in the "post-[[9/11]], post [[7/7]]" world, and (3) has remained "moderate [and] pragmatic".&lt;ref name="Modood2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tariq Modood|title=Multiculturalism: a civic idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlEMZuPhpWQC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-3288-9|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhikhu Parekh]] counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities "demanding special rights" and to see it as promoting a "thinly veiled racis[m]". Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact "not about minorities" but "is about the proper terms of relationship between different cultural communities", which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., "the principles of justice" must not come from only one of the cultures but must come "through an open and equal dialogue between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parekh|first=Bhikhu C.|title=Rethinking multiculturalism: cultural diversity and political theory|year=2002|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-00995-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Criticism of multiculturalism}}
Critics of multiculturalism often debate whether the multicultural ideal of benignly co-existing cultures that interrelate and influence one another, and yet remain distinct, is sustainable, paradoxical, or even desirable.&lt;ref name="Nagle2009"&gt;{{cite book|last = Nagle|first = John|title=Multiculturalism's double bind: creating inclusivity, cosmopolitanism and difference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqMCc37dW1kC&amp;pg=PA129|date=23 September 2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9780754676072|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rajaee2000"&gt;{{cite book|last = Rajaee |first = Farhang |title=Globalization on trial: the human condition and the information civilization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyAt3T1V4EcC&amp;pg=PT97|date=May 2000|publisher=IDRC |isbn= 9780889369092 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SandercockAttili2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Sandercock |first1 =Leonie |last2 = Attili |first2 = Giovanni |last3 = Cavers |first3 = Val |last4 = Carr |first4 = Paula |title=Where strangers become neighbours: integrating immigrants in Vancouver, Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmlGzr4s0uMC&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402090349|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that [[nation states]], who would previously have been synonymous with a distinctive cultural identity of their own, lose out to enforced multiculturalism and that this ultimately erodes the host nations' distinct culture.&lt;ref name="Report attacks multiculturalism"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4295318.stm |title=Report attacks multiculturalism |work = [[BBC news]] |publisher=|date=30 September 2005 |accessdate=10 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard professor of political science [[Robert D. Putnam]] conducted a nearly decade-long study on how multiculturalism affects social trust.&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Putnam |first = Robert D. |author-link = Robert D.

People in diverse communities "don’t trust the local mayor, they don’t trust the local paper, they don’t trust other people and they don’t trust institutions," writes Putnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last =Sailer |first = Steve |author-link = Steve Sailer |title = Fragmented future |url = http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/jan/15/00007/ |work = [[The American Conservative]] |publisher = Jon Basil Utley |date = January 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us".&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Putnam has also stated, however, that "this allergy to diversity tends to diminish and to go away... I think in the long run we'll all be better."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Michel, "[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12802663 Political Scientist: Does Diversity Really Work?]" Tell Me More, NPR.

[[Ethnologist]] [[Frank Salter]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism. For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens. Case studies of the United States, Africa and South-East Asia find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure. Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnies {{sic}}. A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogeneous cities.&lt;ref&gt;Salter, Frank, ''On Genetic Interests'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dick Lamm]], former three-term Democratic governor of the US state of [[Colorado]], wrote in his essay "I have a plan to destroy America":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Diverse peoples worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other—that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Lamm |first = Richard D. |title = I have a plan to destroy America |url = http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/lamm.asp |website = Snopes.com |date = 2005 |access-date = 12 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of conservative historians used the religion of the Mexica, better known as the Aztecs as an example of what they see as the flaws of multiculturalism. The Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]] cited the accounts of his fellow Australian historian [[Inga Clendinnen]] of the festival of [[Ochpaniztli]] where to honor the Maize Lord a young woman was sacrificed by ripping out her heart so the crops might grow:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, still in darkness, silence, and urgent haste, her body was flayed, and a naked priest, a 'very strong man, very powerful, very tall', struggled into the wet skin, with its slack breasts and pouched genitalia: a double nakedness of layered, ambiguous sexuality. The skin of one thigh was reserved to be fashioned into a face-mask for the man impersonating Centeotl, Young Lord Maize Cob, the son of Toci.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga ''Aztecs: An Interpretation'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995. p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Windschuttle argued that the gruesome religion of the Aztecs that required that dozens of young people be sacrificed and eaten every day so that the sun might rise the next day and hundreds of people sacrificed for major holidays as proving that multiculturalism is a facile doctrine that requires Westerners to respect Aztec religion as equal to any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;Windshuttle, Keith ''The Killing of History How Literary Critics and Social Theorists Are Murdering Our Past'',  San Francisco: Encounter Books, 1997. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The American classicist [[Victor Davis Hanson]] used the perceived differences in "rationality" between Moctezuma and Cortés to argue that Western culture was superior to every culture in the entire world, which thus led him to reject multiculturalism as a false doctrine that placed all cultures on an equal footing.&lt;ref name="Hanson, Victor Davis 2001. p. 205"&gt;Hanson, Victor Davis ''Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise to Western Power'', New York: Random House, 2001. p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;
    
In [[New Zealand]] ([[Aotearoa]]), which is officially bi-cultural, multiculturalism has been seen as a threat to the [[Māori people|Maori]], and possibly an attempt by the New Zealand Government to undermine Maori demands for self determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Johnson |first = Jay T. |title = Indigeneity's challenges to the White Settler-State: creating a thirdspace for dynamic citizenship |journal = [[Alternatives: Global, Local, Political]] |volume = 33 |issue = 1 |pages = 29–52 |doi = 10.1177/030437540803300103 |date = January 2008 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
[[File:Mexico City 335.jpg|thumb|Mexico City]]
[[Mexico]] has historically always been a multicultural country. After the betrayal of [[Hernán Cortés|Hernan Cortes]] to the Aztecs, the Spanish conquered the [[Aztec Empire]] and colonized indigenous people. They influenced the indigenous' religion, politics, culture and ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mexico1539.blogspot.com/2008/10/consecuencias-de-la-conquista-de-mexico.html|title=mas alla de la historia: Consecuencias de la conquista de mexico|last=México|first=Conquista De|date=2008-10-29|website=mas alla de la historia|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish opened schools in which they taught [[Christianity]], and the Spanish language which it eventually surpassed the indigenous dialects and languages, making it the most spoken language in Mexico. Mestizo was also born from the conquest, which meant being half-Indigenous and half-Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Page |first=Index |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1932-ethnic-diversity-in-mexico |title=Ethnic diversity in Mexico : Mexico Travel |publisher=Mexconnect.com |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's world "Mestizo" has become an umbrella term to those that are non-indigenous, which would include Asian Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022220348/http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-10-22|title=Wayback Machine|date=2013-10-22|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered to be a [[cradle of civilization]], which influences their multiculturalism and diversity, by having different civilizations influence them. A distinguishable trait of Mexico's culture is the [[mestizaje]] of its people, which caused the combination of Spanish influence, their indigenous roots while also adapting the culture traditions from their immigrants.

=== Peru ===
[[Peru]] is an exemplary country of multiculturalism, in 2016 the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática|INEI]] reported a total population of 31 million people. They share their borders with Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil and Bolivia, and have welcomed many immigrants into their country creating a diverse community.

Peru is the home to [[Amerindians]] but after the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish Conquest]], the Spanish brought African, and Asian people as slaves to Peru creating a mix of ethnic groups. After slavery was no longer permitted in Peru, African-Peruvians and Asian-Peruvians have contributed to Peruvian culture in many ways. Today, Amerindians make up 45% of the population, [[mestizo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s 37%, [[White people|white]] 15% and 3% is composed by [[Black people|Black]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.countryreports.org/country/Peru/population.htm|title=Peru population.

Which attracted Italians, Portuguese, French and German people in look for some [[guano]] for their crops.

In the United States, multiculturalism is not clearly established in policy at the federal level, but ethnic diversity is common in both rural and urban areas.

Continuous mass immigration was a feature of the United States economy and society since the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Isaacs2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Katherine Isaacs|title=Immigration and emigration in historical perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5asNot0c5kwC&amp;pg=PA38|year=2007|publisher=Edizioni Plus|isbn=978-88-8492-498-8|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absorption of the stream of immigrants became, in itself, a prominent feature of America's [[national myth]]. The idea of the [[melting pot]] is a [[metaphor]] that implies that all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Israel. ''The Melting Pot,'' 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; The melting pot theory implied that each individual immigrant, and each group of immigrants, assimilated into American society at their own pace. This is different than multiculturalism as defined above, which does not include complete assimilation and integration.&lt;ref name="Suárez-OrozcoSuárez-Orozco2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcelo M. Suárez-Orozco|author2=Carola Suárez-Orozco|title=The new immigration: an interdisciplinary reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a05uTxwIC4EC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-94916-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Americanized (and often stereotypical) version of the original nation's cuisine, and its holidays, survived.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The melting pot tradition co-exists with a belief in national unity, dating from the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American founding fathers]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people – a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs... This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Jay]], ''First American Supreme Court Chief Justice'', [[Federalist No. 2|Federalist Paper No. 2]]'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a [[philosophy]], multiculturalism began as part of the [[pragmatism]] movement at the end of the nineteenth century in [[Europe]] and the United States, then as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political]] and [[cultural pluralism]] at the turn of the twentieth.&lt;ref name="CaputiFoster2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Caputi|author2=Heather Foster|author3=Linda L.

Philosophers, psychologists and historians and early sociologists such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[George Santayana]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[John Dewey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[Alain Locke]] developed concepts of cultural pluralism, from which emerged what we understand today as multiculturalism. In ''Pluralistic Universe'' (1909), William James espoused the idea of a "[[plural society]]." James saw pluralism as "crucial to the formation of philosophical and social [[humanism]] to help build a better, more egalitarian society.&lt;ref name=Boening&gt;{{cite news |last=Boening |first=Astrid B. |title=Euro-Islam&amp;nbsp;– A Constructivist Idea or a Concept of the English School? |newspaper=European Union Miami Analysis (EUMA) |location= |volume=4

The educational approach to multiculturalism has since spread to the [[grade school]] system, as school systems try to rework their curricula to introduce students to diversity earlier – often on the grounds that it is important for minority students to see themselves represented in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Volk2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terese M.

The [[European Union]] is facing unprecedented demographic changes (an aging population, low birth rates, changing family structures and migration). According to the European Commission, it is important, both at EU and national level, to review and adapt existing policies. Following a public debate, a 2006 EU policy paper identified five key policy responses to manage demographic change, among them receiving and integrating migrants into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=502&amp;langId=en|title=Demographic analysis|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Europe has always been a mixture of Latin, Slavic, Germanic, Uralic, Celtic, Hellenic, Illyrian, Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Jewish, Christian, Muslim and other belief systems; although the continent was supposedly unified by the super-position of Imperial Roman Christianity, it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age.&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert C. Ostergren|author2=Mathias Le Bossé|title=The Europeans: A Geography of People, Culture, and Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-1fwix23zMC&amp;pg=PA226|date=7 March 2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-384-6|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, the ideology of [[nationalism]] transformed the way Europeans thought about the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011" /&gt; Existing states were broken up and new ones created; the new [[nation-states]] were founded on the principle that each [[nation]] is entitled to its own [[sovereignty]] and to engender, protect, and preserve its own unique culture and history. Unity, under this ideology, is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation-state; unity of descent, unity of culture, unity of language, and often unity of religion. The nation-state constitutes a culturally [[wikt:Homogeneity|homogeneous]] society, although some national movements recognised regional differences.

Where cultural unity was insufficient, it was encouraged and enforced by the state.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt; The nineteenth century nation-states developed an array of policies – the most important was compulsory [[primary education]] in the [[national language]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Guntram Henrik Herb |author2=David H. Kaplan |title=Nations and Nationalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UoQ-ueHjdEC&amp;pg=PA522|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-907-8|page=522|date=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language itself was often standardised by a linguistic academy, and regional languages were ignored or suppressed. Some nation-states pursued violent policies of [[cultural assimilation]] and even [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;

Some countries in the European Union have introduced policies for "social cohesion", "integration", and (sometimes) "assimilation". The policies include:

* Compulsory courses and/or tests on [[historiography and nationalism|national history]], on the [[constitution]] and the [[legal system]] (e.g., the computer-based test for individuals seeking naturalisation in the UK named [[Life in the United Kingdom test]])
* Introduction of an official national history, such as the national [[Canon of Dutch Literature|canon]] defined for the [[Netherlands]] by the [[Frits van Oostrom|van Oostrom]] Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entoen.nu/ |title=Official Web site |publisher=Entoen.nu |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion of that history (e.g., by exhibitions about [[Folk hero|national heroes]])
* Tests designed to elicit "unacceptable" values. In [[Baden-Württemberg]], immigrants are asked what they would do if their son says he is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] (the desired answer is that they would accept it&lt;ref&gt;BBC report at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4655240.stm News.BBC.co.uk], full list of questions in German at [http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2006/01/04/a0154 TAZ.de]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Other countries have instituted policies which encourage cultural separation.&lt;ref name="ReitzBreton2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeffrey G.

Sweden was the first country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism in Europe. In May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the [[social democracy|social democratic]] government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation. The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies. Despite the anti-multiculturalist protestations of the [[Sweden Democrats]], multiculturalism remains official policy in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The multicultural moment: the history of the idea and politics of multiculturalism in Sweden in comparative, transnational and biographical context, 1964–1975|last=Wickström|first=Mats|publisher=Åbo Akademi|year=2015|isbn=978-952-12-3133-9|location=http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe201501071068|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study which involved questionnaires sent to 5,000 people, showed that less than a quarter of the respondents (23%) wanted to live in areas characterised by cultural, ethnic and social diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svd.se/svenskar-vill-ha-inhagnat-boende|title=Svenskar vill ha inhägnat boende {{!}} SvD|last=TT|first=|date=|work=SvD.se|access-date=2018-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322170850/http://www.svd.se/svenskar-vill-ha-inhagnat-boende|archive-date=22 March 2016|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study published by [[Gävle University College]] showed that 38% of the population never interacted with anyone from Africa and 20% never interacted with any non-Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.hig.se/download/18.4db66897149b264e1ba4df24/1417115797086/mangfald.pdf|title=Mångfaldsbarometern 2014|last=|first=|publisher=Gävle University College|year=October 2014|isbn=|location=|pages=7–8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621094211/https://www.hig.se/download/18.4db66897149b264e1ba4df24/1417115797086/mangfald.pdf|archive-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that while physical distance to the country of origin, also religion and other cultural expressions are significant for the perception of cultural familiarity. In general, peoples with [[Christianity]] as the dominant religion were perceived to be culturally closer than peoples from Muslim countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2017 study by [[Lund University]] also found that social trust was lower among people in regions with high levels of past non-Nordic immigration than among people in regions with low levels of past immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McShane|first1=Karl|date=2017|title=Getting used to diversity?

===Indonesia===
{{further|Bhinneka Tunggal Ika|Demographics of Indonesia|Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Culture of Indonesia}}
[[Cultural pluralism|Pluralism]], [[Unity in diversity|diversity]] and multiculturalism is a daily fact of life in [[Indonesia]]. There are over [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|300 ethnic groups]] in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Kuoni – Far East, A world of difference. p. 88. Published 1999 by Kuoni Travel &amp; JPM Publications&lt;/ref&gt; 95% of those are of [[Native Indonesians|Native Indonesian]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Pribumi |work= Encyclopedia of Modern Asia |publisher= Macmillan Reference USA |url= http://www.bookrags.com/research/pribumi-ema-05/ |accessdate= 2006-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Javanese people|Javanese]] are the largest ethnic group in Indonesia who make up nearly 42% of the total population.&lt;ref name="ISAS"&gt;{{cite book | publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies| title =Indonesia's Population: Ethnicity and Religion in a Changing Political Landscape| year =2003 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] are the next largest groups in the country.&lt;ref name="ISAS" /&gt; There are also more than [[Languages of Indonesia|700 living languages spoken in Indonesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=indonesia |title=Ethnologue report for Indonesia |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although predominantly [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] the country also has large [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christian]] and [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]] populations.

Indonesia's national motto, ''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]'' ("Unity in Diversity" lit. "many, yet one") enshrined in [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] the national ideology, articulates the diversity that shapes the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Geography of Indonesia | publisher=Indonesia.go.id | url=http://www.indonesia.go.id/en/indonesia-glance/geography-indonesia|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government nurtures and promotes the diversity of Indonesian local culture; adopting a pluralist approach.

Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government [[transmigration program]]s or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions. The Javanese for example, moved from their traditional homeland in Java to the other parts of the archipelago. The expansion of the Javanese and their influence throughout Indonesia has raised the issue of [[Javanization]], although [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]], Madurese, [[Bugis]] and Makassar people, as a result of their ''merantau'' (migrating) culture are also quite widely distributed throughout the Indonesian archipelago, while [[Chinese Indonesian]]s can be found in most urban areas. Because of [[urbanization]], major Indonesian cities such as [[Greater Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], [[Bandung]], [[Palembang]], [[Medan]] and [[Makassar]] have attracted large numbers of Indonesians from various ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. Jakarta in particular has almost all Indonesian ethnic groups represented.

However, this transmigration program and close interactions between people of different cultural backgrounds caused socio-cultural problems, as the inter-ethnics interactions have not always been conducted harmoniously. After the [[Post-Suharto era|fall of Suharto]] in 1998 into the 2000s, numbers of inter-ethnic and inter-religious clashes erupted in Indonesia. Like the clashes between native [[Dayak people|Dayak]] tribes against [[Madurese people|Madurese]] transmigrants in [[Kalimantan]] during [[Sambas riots]] in 1999&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=February 28, 2001|title=Indonesia: The Violence in Central Kalimantan (Borneo)|url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/borneo0228.htm|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sampit conflict]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="flashpoint"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=June 28, 2004|accessdate=2008-08-13|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3811219.stm|title=Indonesia flashpoints: Kalimantan}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also clashes between Muslims and Christians, such as [[Poso riots|violence erupted in Poso]] between 1998 and into 2000,&lt;ref name="BBC flashpoints"&gt;{{cite web| publisher = BBC News| date = 28 June 2004| title = Indonesia flashpoints: Sulawesi| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3812737.stm| accessdate = 13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maluku sectarian conflict|violences in Maluku]] between 1999 and into 2002.&lt;ref name="timedirty"&gt;{{cite news|last=Elegant|first=Simon|title=Indonesia's Dirty Little Holy War|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,187655,00.html|accessdate=31 March 2011|newspaper=Time|date=17 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Indonesia today still struggles and has managed to maintain unity and inter-cultural harmony, through a national adherence of pro-pluralism policy of Pancasila; promoted and enforced by the government and its people.

[[Chinese Indonesians]] are the largest foreign-origin minority that has resided in Indonesia for generations. Despite centuries of acculturation with native Indonesians, because of their disproportionate influence on Indonesian economy, and alleged question of national loyalty, Chinese Indonesians have suffered [[Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians|discrimination]]. The [[Suharto]] ''Orde Baru'' or New Order adopted a forced [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] policy; which indicated that Chinese cultural elements were unacceptable.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=24}} Chinese Indonesians were forced to adopt [[Chinese Indonesian surname|Indonesian-sounding names]], and the use of Chinese culture and language was banned. The violence targeting Chinese Indonesians erupted during [[Fall of Suharto#Riots of 13–14 May|riots in 1998.]] As the looting and destruction took place, a number of Chinese Indonesians, as well as looters, were killed. The Chinese Indonesians were treated as the scapegoat of [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], a result of ongoing discrimination and segregation policies enforced during Suharto's New Order regime. Soon after the fourth Indonesian President, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] came into power in 1999, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to promote acceptance and to improve inter-racial relationships, such as abolishing the ban on Chinese culture; allowing Chinese traditions to be practised freely. Two years later President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] declared that the [[Chinese New Year]] (''{{lang|id|Imlek}}'') would be marked as a [[Public holidays in Indonesia|national holiday]] from 2003.{{sfn|Setiono|2003|p=1099}} Today, Chinese Indonesians enjoy the same rights as other Indonesians.

===Japan===
{{main|Ethnic issues in Japan}}
[[File:One Ainu man and bear.JPG|thumb|An [[Ainu people|Ainu]] man, circa 1930]]
Japanese society, with its ideology of homogeneity, has traditionally rejected any need to recognize ethnic differences in Japan, even as such claims have been rejected by such ethnic minorities as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abe fine with 'homogeneous' remark|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/02/27/national/abe-fine-with-homogeneous-remark/#.U9KWz4BdWwE|work=Japan Times|date=2007-02-27|accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, former Japanese Prime Minister and current Japanese Deputy Prime Minister [[Taro Aso]] described Japan as a "one civilization, one language, one culture and one race" nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2005/10/18/national/aso-says-japan-is-nation-of-one-race/#.U9KXSIBdWwE |title=Aso says Japan is nation of 'one race' |work=Japan Times |date=October 18, 2005 |accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are "International Society" NPOs funded by local governments throughout Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tokyo-international.org/ |title=International Societies in Japan |publisher=Tokyo-international.org |accessdate=2010-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226025402/http://www.tokyo-international.org/ |archivedate=2012-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Harvard University]] professor [[Theodore Bestor]], Japan does look very homogeneous from a distant perspective, but in fact there are a number of very significant minority groups – ethnically different minority groups – in Japan today, such as the already mentioned [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/at/contemp_japan/cjp_society_02.html |title=Contemporary Japan: Japanese Society |publisher=Asian Topics, [[Columbia University]] |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kazakhstan===
Kazakhstan is among the most multicultural countries in Eurasia, with sizeable populations of ethnic Kazakhs, Russians, Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Uighurs, Tatars, Germans and more.&lt;ref name="historykz"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marmontova|first1=T.V.|title=Interethnic relations in the Republic of Kazakhstan in the light of multicultural theories|url=http://e-history.kz/en/contents/view/2125|publisher=e-history.kz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan is one of a few countries in post-Soviet territories that managed to avoid interethnic clashes and conflicts in the period of USSR’s final crisis and its eventual breakup.&lt;ref name="DND"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan –The Heaven of interfaith and interethnic harmony|url=http://www.dnd.com.pk/kazakhstan-heaven-interfaith-interethnic-harmony/84030|publisher=Dispatch News Desk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Kazakhstan created the [[Assembly of People of Kazakhstan]], an advisory body designed to represent the country's ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kazakhstan's unique Assembly of People maintains ethnic harmony|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Analysis/Outside-View/2015/05/04/Opinion-Kazakhstans-unique-Assembly-of-People-maintains-ethnic-harmony/5051430316093/|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main|Ketuanan Melayu|Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Demographics of Malaysia|Culture of Malaysia}}
[[Malaysia]] is a multiethnic country, with [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] making up the majority, close to 58% of the population. About 25% of the population are [[Chinese Malaysian|Malaysians of Chinese descent]]. [[Indian Malaysian|Malaysians of Indian descent]] comprise about 7% of the population. The remaining 10% comprises:
* Native [[East Malaysia]]ns, namely [[Bajau]], [[Bruneian Malay people|Bruneian]], [[Bidayuh]], [[Dusun]], [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Kadazan]], [[Kedayan]], [[Melanau]], [[Orang Ulu]], [[Sarawakian Malay]]s, etc.
* Other native tribes of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], such as the [[Orang Asli]] and Siamese people, and
* Non-native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia such as the [[Chettiar]]s, the [[Peranakan]] and the Portuguese.

The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] or NEP serves as a form of racial equalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6237328.stm Malaysia fury at EU envoy remarks], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes structural changes in various aspects of life from education to economic to social integration. Established after the [[13 May Incident|13 May racial riots]] of 1969, it sought to address the significant imbalance in the economic sphere where the minority [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] population had substantial control over commercial activity in the country.

The [[Malay Peninsula]] has a long history of international trade contacts, influencing its ethnic and religious composition. Predominantly [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] before the 18th century, the ethnic composition changed dramatically when the British introduced new industries, and imported Chinese and Indian labor. Several regions in the then [[British Malaya]] such as [[Penang]], [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]] became Chinese dominated. Until the riots 1969, co-existence between the three ethnicities (and other minor groups) was largely peaceful, although the three main racial groups for the most part lived in separate communities – the Malays in the villages, the Chinese in the urban areas, and the Indians in the towns and plantation. More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of [[institutionalized discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&amp;catid=198:helen-ang&amp;Itemid=156 |title=Honey, I shrunk the Chinese! |publisher=CPI |date=9 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525132129/http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&amp;catid=198:helen-ang&amp;Itemid=156 |archivedate=25 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preceding independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]], a [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] was negotiated as the basis of a new society. The contract as reflected in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution]] states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship, and Malays' special rights are guaranteed. This is often referred to the [[Bumiputra]] policy.

These [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties, who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights. The issue is sometimes related to the controversial [[status of religious freedom in Malaysia]].

===Singapore===
Because of immigration, [[Singapore]] has a Chinese majority population with significant minority populations of [[Malay people|Malays]] and Indians (predominantly [[Tamil people|Tamils]]). Other prominent smaller groups include [[Peranakans]] and [[Eurasians in Singapore|Eurasians]]. Besides [[English Language|English]], Singapore recognizes three other languages—[[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. English was established as the medium of instruction in schools during the 1960s and 1970s and is the language of trade and government while the other three languages are taught as second languages ("mother tongues"). Besides being a [[multilingualism|multilingual]] country, Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by the three main ethnic communities.

During British colonial rule, ethnic enclaves such as [[Geylang]], [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]], and [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]] were enforced. Presently &lt;sup&gt;(2010)&lt;/sup&gt;, remnants of colonial ethnic concentration still exist but housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy, which ensures an even ethnic distribution throughout Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) In [[Housing and Development Board|Housing Development Boards of Singapore website]]. Retrieved: November 18, 2010 from [http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10296p.nsf/PressReleases/C515273FA068DD58482576DD00169155?OpenDocument ''Policy Changes To Support An Inclusive And Cohesive Home''].&lt;/ref&gt; A similar policy exists in politics as all [[Group Representation Constituency|Group Representation Constituencies]] are required to field at least one candidate from an ethnic minority.

===South Korea===
[[South Korea]] remains a relatively homogenous country ethnically, linguistically, and culturally.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ Korea's ethnic nationalism is a source of both pride and prejudice, according to Gi-Wook Shin]". The Korea Herald. August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners, expatriates, and immigrants are often rejected by the mainstream South Korean society and face discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/19991013000846/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/MonoPaper3-13.html The Life Instability of Intermarried Japanese Women in Korea]" (1999), Eung-Ryul Kim (Korea University and University of Southern California, The Center for Multiethnic and Transnational Studies)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the word "multiculturalism" is increasingly heard in South Korea. In 2007, Han Geon-Soo, Professor of Cultural Anthropology at [[Kangwon National University]], published an article entitled "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", noting: "As the increase of foreign migrants in [South] Korea transforms a single-ethnic homogeneous [South] Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one, [the South] Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement." He argued, however, that "the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in [South] Korea" lacked "the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society".&lt;ref&gt;Han Geon-Soo, "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", ''Korea Journal'', Vol. 47 No. 4, Winter 2007, pp. 32–63&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued:
:"Korea no longer has to decide whether it wants to become a multicultural society. It made that decision years ago – perhaps unconsciously – when it decided to be a full participant in the emerging global economy. It confirmed that decision when it decided to actively recruit foreign migrants to meet the economic and demographic needs of a fast-growing society. Korea is faced by a different decision today: what type of multicultural society does it want to be?"&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Castles, [http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf "Will Labour Migration lead to a Multicultural Society in Korea?", Global Human Resources Forum 2007 / International Migration Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725111757/http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Korea Times]]'' suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/10/123_57884.html "Multiculturalism Likely to Prevail in Korea"], Lee Hyo-sik, ''Korea Times'', December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, an opinion editorial written by Peter Underwood for the ''[[JoongAng Ilbo]]'' stated: "Media in [South] Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism. With more than one million foreigners in [South] Korea, 2 percent of the population comes from other cultures." He further opined:
:"If you stay too long, Koreans become uncomfortable with you. [...] Having a two percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea’s greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad. Multiculturalism will introduce contrasting views and challenge existing assumptions.

[[Turkey]] is a country that borders both Europe and Asia, therefore placing it as the multicultural intersection for Eurasia – thus including people of Armenian, Jewish, Kurds, Arabs, Turks, and Persians decent. This entail influence of Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim influence leaving Turkey to be a multicultural country based on location.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauf|first=Imam Feisal Abdul|date=2005|title=MULTICULTURALISMS: Western, Muslim and Future|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24461190|journal=CrossCurrents|volume=55|issue=1|pages=100–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years there has been an increase of diversity acceptance in Turkey, mainly because there was fear of losing values of the non-existent [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kaya|first=Ayhan|title=Multiculturalism and Minorities in Turkey|date=2013|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt20q22fw.20|work=Challenging Multiculturalism|pages=297–316|series=European Models of Diversity|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|doi=10.3366/j.ctt20q22fw.20#page_scan_tab_contents|isbn=9780748664573|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just after the turn of the century, Turkey has embraced its multicultural location and has even began to influence other countries. With Turkey having roots of Islam they have been provided a path for Islam to be accepted into neighboring countries in Europe.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== South Africa ===
South Africa is the fifth-most populous country and one of the most developed countries in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-10-most-populated-countries-in-africa.html|title=The 10 Most Populated Countries in Africa|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa also officially recognises 11 languages including English, making it third behind Bolivia and India in most official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf|title=Census 2011 Census in Brief|last=|first=|date=2015-05-13|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513171240/http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf|archive-date=2015-05-13|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three most common languages are Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans. Though South Africa's cultural traditions may decline as it becomes more and more Westernised, it is still known for its diverse culture.

===Cameroon===
Officially known as the Republic of Cameroon, [[Cameroon]] is found in [[central Africa]] consisting of a diverse geographical and cultural area that makes it one of the most diverse countries known today. Ranging from mountains, deserts, and rainforests, to coast-lands and savanna grasslands, its diverse geography makes a large diverse population possible. This diverse geography resembles Africa as a whole and due to this, most people commonly label Cameroon as “Africa in Miniature”.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cm.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbenda|first=Huguette Gaelle Ngassa|last2=Awasthi|first2=Gauri|last3=Singh|first3=Poonam K|last4=Gouado|first4=Inocent|last5=Das|first5=Aparup|date=2014-07-16|title=Does malaria epidemiology project Cameroon as ‘Africa in miniature’?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12038-014-9451-y|journal=Journal of Biosciences|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=727–738|doi=10.1007/s12038-014-9451-y|issn=0250-5991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americas

==== Demographics and Official Languages ====
Before Cameroon’s independence, it was under British and French colonial rule from 1916-1961.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Upon gaining [[sovereignty]], a major colonial influence was evident, having both English and French become the national language to roughly 25,000,000 Cameroonian residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/|title=World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations|website=esa.un.org|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muhidin_Mulalic/publication/325217271_Perceptions_of_Turkish_Cultural_Diplomacy_in_Bosnia-Herzegovina/links/5afe90e8458515e9a5765501/Perceptions-of-Turkish-Cultural-Diplomacy-in-Bosnia-Herzegovina.pdf#page=261|title=Can Bilingualism Survive in Cameroon?|last=Asanga Fon|first=Nguh Nwei|date=2018-07-26|website=Research Gate|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these two major languages, a new language consisting of a mixture of French, English, and [[Cameroonian Pidgin English|Pidgin]] known as [[Camfranglais|Frananglais]] gained popularity among Cameroonian residents.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newuh.blog/2012/12/13/cameroon-africa-in-miniature-in-what-sense/|title=Cameroon: Africa in Miniature – In what Sense?|date=2012-12-13|work=KINGSLEY SHETEH'S BLOG|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indigenous Languages ====
Although these three languages are the most common in Cameroon, there are still approximately 273 [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] languages being spoken throughout the country, making it not only culturally diverse but linguistically as well.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CM|title=Cameroon|last=|first=|date=|website=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who speak these indigenous languages are people from [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], Sudanic, [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]], [[Wodaabe]] (or [[Mbororo]]) and even primitive hunter-gatherer groups known as [[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Cameroon|title=Cameroon {{!}} Culture, History, &amp; People|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iwgia.org/en/cameroon|title=Cameroon|website=www.iwgia.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indigenous Peoples' Rights ====
Although native to Cameroonian land, they faced constant discrimination much like other indigenous groups around the world. The United Nations General Assembly ([[United Nations General Assembly|UNGA]]) adopted the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ([[UNDRIP]]) in 2007. What this allowed was the protection of land and resource rights and prevented others from [[wiktionary:Exploitation|exploiting]] or violating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-12-01|title=Indigenous peoples’ land rights in Cameroon: progress to date and possible futures|url=http://pubs.iied.org/17448IIED/|journal=Briefing|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a group of indigenous Baka and Bagyeli groups united to form Gbabandi. Gbabandi allowed these indigenous groups to have a form of representation and a declared list of requirements that people of Cameroon had to abide by. Among these requirements were guaranteed land rights, peoples' consent to the usage of their sacred land, traditional chiefs and the ability to participate in "local, regional, and national levels" of political and economic matters. As a result, this established a sense of justice and acknowledgment among indigenous groups in Cameroon and posed for future battles for indigenous peoples' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/rights-land-natural-resources/news-article/2017/declaration-land-rights-gbabandi-platform-cameroon|title=Declaration on land rights from the Gbabandi Platform, Cameroon {{!}} Forest Peoples Programme|website=www.forestpeoples.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morocco ===
[[Morocco]] is located in Northern Africa near the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which then connects to Europe. Morocco is a prime location for a multiculturalism, as it has much influence by neighbouring countries. Morocco has been invaded and colonised by many countries throughout the centuries, which means that they have experienced an influence of many cultures. Some of these invaders include the [[French people|French]], the [[Spaniards]], the [[Arabs]], and several more countries.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This has led to the country becoming not only multicultural, but also multilingual. Officially the language of Morocco is [[Arabic]], but throughout the country many people speak, French, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Arabic, and most recently acknowledging [[Berber languages|Berber]] as a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ennaji|first=Moha|date=2014|title=Recognizing the Berber Language in Morocco: A Step for Democratization|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43773631|journal=Georgetown Journal of International Affairs|volume=15|issue=2|pages=93–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much outside influence of multiculturalism in Morocco, but they have embraced these cultures.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=1f327fa4-9836-4bc5-995e-327ca3017228@pdc-v-sessmgr05&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=54652194&amp;db=a9h|title=Multiculturalism, Gender and Political Participation in Morocco: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Multiculturalism in Australia}}
The next country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism after Canada was Australia, a country with similar immigration situations and similar policies, for example the formation of the [[Special Broadcasting Service]].&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/research/_pdf/poa-2008.pdf |title=IMMI.gov.au |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government retains multiculturalism in policy, and as a defining aspect of Australia today.&lt;ref name="Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="policy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Team to Build a Stronger Australia|url=http://www.liberal.org.au/latest-news/2013/09/16/hon-tony-abbott-mp-press-release-team-build-stronger-australia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106010039/http://www.liberal.org.au/latest-news/2013/09/16/hon-tony-abbott-mp-press-release-team-build-stronger-australia|archivedate=2013-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
[[New Zealand]] is a [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] Oceanic country that adopted its multicultural policies post World War II. The country used to have immigration policies similar to Australia's [[White Australia Policy]],&lt;ref&gt;Socidad Peruana de Medicina Intensiva (SOPEMI) (2000). ''Trends in international migration: continuous reporting system on migration''. [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. pp. 276–278.&lt;/ref&gt; but it would later follow suit with Australia in the 1970s and adopt similar multicultural policies. The relaxation of migration led to an influx of new migration to New Zealand in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/history-of-immigration|title=History of immigration – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Jock (11 August 2015).
