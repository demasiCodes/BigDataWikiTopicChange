'''Multiculturalism''' is the cultural diversity of communities within a given society and the policies that promote this diversity. As a descriptive term, multiculturalism is the simple fact of [[cultural diversity]] and the [[demographics|demographic make-up]] of a specific place, sometimes at the organizational level, e.g., [[school]]s, [[business]]es, [[neighborhood]]s, [[city|cities]], or [[nation]]s. As a prescriptive term, multiculturalism encourages ideologies and policies that promote this diversity or its institutionalization. In this sense, multiculturalism is a society “at ease with the rich tapestry of human life and the desire amongst people to express their own identity in the manner they see fit.”&lt;ref name="Bloor2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Bloor|title=The Definitive Guide to Political Ideologies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R-cRCD-QBVYC&amp;pg=PA272|date=February 2010|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4490-6761-8|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main different and seemingly inconsistent strategies have developed through different government policies and strategies. The first focuses on interaction and communication between different cultures. Interactions of cultures provide opportunities for the cultural differences to communicate and interact to create multiculturalism. This approach is also often known as [[interculturalism]]. The second centers on diversity and cultural uniqueness. Cultural isolation can protect the uniqueness of the local culture of a nation or area and also contribute to global cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="Marsh1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Marsh|title=Key concepts for understanding curriculum: Perspectives|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YbseHEgTa3wC&amp;pg=PA121|year=1997|publisher=Falmer Press|isbn=978-0-7507-0587-5|pages=121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth J.

Multiculturalism is often contrasted with the concepts of [[cultural assimilation|assimilationism]] and has been described as a "[[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]]" or "[[cultural mosaic]]" rather than a "[[melting pot]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=TuggI-Ye_AUC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Cultural%20mosaic%20Canada&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|page=31|title=Guide to Western Canada|edition=7th|first1=Ann Carroll|last1= Burgess|first2=Tom |last2=Burgess|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|year=2005|isbn=0-7627-2987-2|accessdate = 2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In different countries==

Multiculturalism centers on the thought in [[political philosophy]] about the way to respond to cultural and religious differences. It is closely associated with “identity politics,” “the politics of difference,” and “the politics of recognition.” It is also a matter of economic interests and [[Power (social and political)|political power]]. (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Despite the fact that multiculturalism has mainly been used as a term to define disadvantaged groups, including [[African American]]s, women, [[LGBT|gays and lesbians]], and the disabled, many theorists tend to focus their arguments on immigrants who are ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, and [[indigenous peoples]].

Multiculturalism can refer to a demographic fact, a particular set of philosophical ideas, or a specific orientation by government or institutions toward a diverse population. Most of the debate over multiculturalism centers around whether or not public multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. Recognition in the context of multicultural education is a demand not just for recognition of aspects of a group's actual culture but also for the history of group subordination and its entire experience.

The term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western [[nation-state]]s, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="ZarateLevy2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geneviève Zarate|author2=Danielle Levy|author3=Claire Kramsch|title=Handbook of Multilingualism and Multiculturalism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DYL4_6SvxewC&amp;pg=PA377|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Archives contemporaines|isbn=978-2-8130-0039-2|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian government]] has often been described as the instigator of multicultural ideology because of its public emphasis on the [[Economic impact of immigration to Canada|social importance of immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geography.ryerson.ca/jmaurer/030_108art/030Multiculturalism.pdf|format=PDF|title=Immigration, Multiculturalism and National Identity in Canada|publisher=University of Toronto Department of Political Science|first=Shara|last=Wayland|year=1997|accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] is often referred to as the origins of modern political awareness of multiculturalism.&lt;ref name="II2010."&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald L.

Many nation-states in Africa, Asia, and the Americas are culturally diverse, and are 'multicultural' in a [[descriptive]] sense. In some, [[communalism]] is a major political issue. The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multicultural-ist policies in the [[Western world]], but the historical background is different, and the goal may be a mono-cultural or [[Monoethnicity|mono-ethnic]] [[nation-building]] - for instance in the Malaysian government's attempt to create a 'Malaysian race' by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]]: ''[http://www.economist.com/surveys/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1677228 The changing of the guard]'', April 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism after Canada was Australia, a country with similar immigration situations and similar policies, for example the formation of the [[Special Broadcasting Service]].&lt;ref name="immi.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/research/_pdf/poa-2008.pdf |title=IMMI.gov.au |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian government retains multiculturalism in policy, and as a defining aspect of Australia today.&lt;ref name="Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The European Union is facing unprecedented demographic changes (an ageing population, low birth rates, changing family structures and migration). According to the European Commission, it is important, both at EU and national level, to review and adapt existing policies. Following a public debate, a 2006 EU policy paper identified five key policy responses to manage demographic change, among them receiving and integrating migrants into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=502&amp;langId=en Demographic analysis Employment, Social Affairs &amp; Inclusion European Commission.

Historically, Europe has always been a mixture of Latin, Slavic, Germanic, Uralic, Celtic, Hellenic, Illyrian, Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Hebraic, Christian, Muslim and other belief systems; although the continent was supposedly unified by the super-position of Imperial Roman Christianity, it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age.&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert C.

In the 19th century, the ideology of [[nationalism]] transformed the way Europeans thought about the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011"/&gt; Existing states were broken up and new ones created; the new [[nation-states]] were founded on the principle that each [[nation]] is entitled to its own [[sovereignty]] and to engender, protect, and preserve its own unique culture and history. Unity, under this ideology, is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation-state—unity of descent, unity of culture, unity of language, and often unity of religion. The nation-state constitutes a culturally [[wiktionary:Homogeneity|homogeneous]] society, although some national movements recognized regional differences.

Where cultural unity was insufficient, it was encouraged and enforced by the state.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; The 19th-century nation-states developed an array of policies—the most important was compulsory [[primary education]] in the [[national language]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guntram Henrik Herb, David H.

Some nation-states pursued violent policies of [[cultural assimilation]] and even [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;

Some European Union countries have introduced policies for "social cohesion", "integration", and (sometimes) "assimilation". The policies include:
*compulsory courses and/or tests on [[historiography and nationalism|national history]], on the [[constitution]] and the [[legal system]] (e.g., the computer-based test for individuals seeking naturalization in the UK named [[Life in the United Kingdom test]])
*introduction of an official national history, such as the national [[Western canon|canon]] defined for the Netherlands by the [[Frits van Oostrom|van Oostrom]] Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entoen.nu/ |title=Official Web site |publisher=Entoen.nu |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion of that history (e.g., by exhibitions about [[Folk hero|national heroes]])
*tests designed to elicit "unacceptable" values. In [[Baden-Württemberg]] immigrants are asked what they would do if their son says he is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]. (The desired answer is that they would accept it).&lt;ref&gt;BBC report at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4655240.stm News.BBC.co.uk], full list of questions in German at [http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2006/01/04/a0154 TAZ.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries have instituted policies which encourage cultural separation. The concept of “[[Cultural exception]]” proposed by France in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations in 1993 was an example of a measure aimed at protecting local cultures.&lt;ref name="GraberNenova2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Beat Graber|author2=Mira Burri Nenova|title=Intellectual property and traditional cultural expressions in a digital environment|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gK6OI0hrANsC&amp;pg=PA87|date=30 November 2008|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84720-921-4|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[India]] is culturally, linguistically, religiously and to a certain extent, ethnically, one of the most diverse if not the most diverse country in the world. According to the [[1961 Census of India]], there are 1652 indigenous languages in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageinindia.com/aug2002/indianmothertongues1961aug2002.html |title=Language in India |publisher=Language in India |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[culture of India]] has been shaped by its [[History of India|long history]], [[Geography of India|unique geography]] and [[Demographics of India|diverse demography]]. [[Languages of India|India's languages]], [[Religion in India|religions]], [[Dance in India|dance]], music, architecture and customs differ from place to place within the country, but nevertheless possess a commonality. The culture of India is an amalgamation of these diverse [[Subculture|sub-cultures]] spread all over the [[Indian subcontinent]] and traditions that are several millennia old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''multiculturalism'' is not much used in India. Within Indian culture, the term ''unity in diversity'' is more commonly used.

Religiously, the [[Hindus]] form the majority, followed by the Muslims. The statistics are: [[Hindu]] (80.5%), [[Muslim]] (13.4%), [[Christian]] (2.3%), [[Sikh]] (2.1%), [[Buddhist]], [[Bahá'í Faith in India|Bahá'í]], [[Jain]], [[Jew]] and [[Parsi people|Parsi]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/ |title=Indian Census |publisher=Censusindia.gov.in |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically, the two main language families in India are [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] (a branch of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]]. In India's northeast, people speaking [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] group of languages such as [[Manipuri language|Manipuri]] (Meitei-lon)  recognized by the Indian constitution and [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] languages are commonly found. India (officially) follows a three-language policy. [[Hindi]] (spoken in the form of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]) is the official federal language, [[Indian English|English]] has the federal status of associate/subsidiary official language and each state has its own state official language (in the Hindi ''[[sprachraum]]'', this reduces to bilingualism). Further, India does not have any national language.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Republic of India]]'s state boundaries are largely drawn based on linguistic groups; this decision led to the preservation and continuation of local ethno-linguistic sub-cultures, except for the Hindi ''sprachraum'' which is itself divided into many states. Thus, most states differ from one another in [[languages of India|language]], [[culture of India|culture]], [[Indian cuisine|cuisine]], [[Clothing in India|clothing]], [[Indian literature|literary style]], [[architecture of India|architecture]], [[music of India|music]] and festivities.

Largest population of non-Indian religions, such as [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Zoroastrianism]] resides in India.

In India, secularism means equal treatment of all religions.

He even argued that since Europe itself is no more homogeneous hence West should also follow the principled distance model which on one hand respects the diversity and at the same time empowers the state to interfere in case of any discrimination in the name of religion.&lt;ref name="Rajeev"&gt;

Indonesia's national motto, ''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]'' ("Unity in Diversity" lit. "many, yet one") enshrined in [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] national ideology, articulates the diversity that shapes the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Geography of Indonesia | publisher=Indonesia.go.id | url=http://www.indonesia.go.id/en/indonesia-glance/geography-indonesia|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government nurture and promote the diversity of Indonesian local culture and adopting pluralism approach.

Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government [[transmigration program]]s or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions. The Javanese for example, had reside out of their traditional homeland in Java to the rest of the archipelago. The expansion of Javanese and their influences throughout Indonesia had risen the [[Javanization]] issues. While [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]], [[Madurese people|Madurese]], [[Bugis]] and Makassar people through their ''merantau'' (migrating) culture also quite widely distributed throughout Indonesian archipelago. [[Chinese Indonesian]]s can be found in most of urban areas. Because of [[urbanization]], major Indonesian cities such as [[Greater Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], [[Bandung]], [[Palembang]], [[Medan]] and [[Makassar]] has attracted large numbers of Indonesians from various ethnics, cultural and religious background. Jakarta in particular, has almost all of Indonesian multi-ethnics represented.

However, this transmigration program and close interactions between people of different cultural backgrounds might caused socio-cultural problems, as the inter-ethnics interactions might not always conducted harmoniously. After the [[Post-Suharto era|fall of Suharto]] in 1998 into the 2000s, there were numbers of inter-ethnics and inter-religions clashes erupted in Indonesia.

Despite centuries of acculturation with native Indonesians, because of their disproportionately influence on Indonesian economy, and alleged question of national loyalty, Chinese Indonesian had suffered [[Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians|discriminations]]. The [[Suharto]]'s New Order adopted a forced [[assimilation]] policy; which indicated that Chinese cultural elements were unacceptable.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=24}} Chinese Indonesians were forced to adopt [[Chinese Indonesian surname|native Indonesians sounding names]], and the government was banned Chinese culture and language. The violence targeting Chinese Indonesian erupted during [[Fall of Suharto#Riots of 13–14 May|riots in 1998]] as the looting and destructions took place, numbers of Chinese Indonesians as well as looters were died. The Chinese Indonesians were treated as the scapegoat of [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], and it was the result of ongoing discrimination and segregation policy enforced during Suharto's New Order regime. Soon after the fourth Indonesian President, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] came into power in 1999, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to promote acceptance and to improve inter-racial relationships, such as abolished the ban on Chinese culture and allowed Chinese traditions to be practised freely. Two years later President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] declared that the [[Chinese New Year]] (''{{lang|id|Imlek}}'') would be marked as a [[Public holidays in Indonesia|national holiday]] from 2003.{{sfn|Setiono|2003|p=1099}} Today, Chinese Indonesians enjoy equal rights as the rest of Indonesians.

===Japan===
{{main|Ethnic issues in Japan}}
[[Image:One Ainu man and bear.JPG|thumb|An [[Ainu people|Ainu]] man, circa 1930]]

Japanese society, with its ideology of homogeneity, has traditionally rejected any need to recognize ethnic differences in Japan, even as such claims have been rejected by such ethnic minorities as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abe fine with 'homogeneous' remark|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/02/27/national/abe-fine-with-homogeneous-remark/#.U9KWz4BdWwE|work=Japan Times|date=2007-02-27|accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, former Japanese Minister [[Taro Aso]] described Japan as a "one race" nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2005/10/18/national/aso-says-japan-is-nation-of-one-race/#.U9KXSIBdWwE |title=Aso says Japan is nation of 'one race' |work=Japan Times |date=October 18, 2005 |accessdate=2014-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are "International Society" NPOs funded by local governments throughout Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyo-international.org/ |title=International Societies in Japan |publisher=Tokyo-international.org |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harvard University professor Theodore Bestor, Japan does look very homogeneous from a distant perspective, but in fact there are a number of very significant minority groups — ethnically different minority groups — in Japan today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/at/contemp_japan/cjp_society_02.html |title=Contemporary Japan: Japanese Society |publisher=Asian Topics, [[Columbia University]] |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
{{Main|Ketuanan Melayu}}
[[Malaysia]] is a multiethnic country, with [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] making up the majority, close to 52% of the population. About 24.6% of the population are [[Chinese Malaysian|Malaysians of Chinese descent]]. [[Indian Malaysian|Malaysians of Indian descent]] comprise about 7% of the population. The remaining 10% comprises:
* Native [[East Malaysia]]ns, namely [[Bajau]], [[Bruneian Malay people|Bruneian]], [[Bidayuh]], [[Dusun]], [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Kadazan]], [[Kedayan]], [[Melanau]], [[Orang Ulu]], [[Sarawakian Malay]]s, etc.
* Other native tribes of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], such as the [[Orang Asli]] and Siamese people, and
* Non-native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia such as the [[Chettiar]]s, the [[Peranakan]] and the Portuguese.

The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] or NEP serves as a form of affirmative action (see [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6237328.stm Malaysia fury at EU envoy remarks], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes structural changes in various aspects of life from education to economic to social integration. Established after the [[13 May Incident|13 May racial riots]] of 1969, it sought to address the significant imbalance in the economic sphere where the minority [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] population had substantial control over commercial activity in the country.

The [[Malay Peninsula]] has a long history of international trade contacts, influencing its ethnic and religious composition. Predominantly [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] before the 18th century, the ethnic composition changed dramatically when the British introduced new industries, and imported Chinese and Indian labor. Several regions in the then [[British Malaya]] such as [[Penang]], [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]] became Chinese dominated. Until the riots 1969, co-existence between the three ethnicities (and other minor groups) was largely peaceful, although the three main racial groups for the most part lived in separate communities - the Malays in the villages, the Chinese in the urban areas, and the Indians in the towns and plantation. More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of [[institutionalized discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&amp;catid=198:helen-ang&amp;Itemid=156 |title=Honey, I shrunk the Chinese! |publisher=CPI |date= 9 December 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preceding independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]], a [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] was negotiated as the basis of a new society. The contract as reflected in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution]] states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship, and Malays' special rights are guaranteed. This is often referred to the [[Bumiputra]] policy.

These [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties, who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights. The issue is sometimes related to the controversial [[status of religious freedom in Malaysia]].

===Mauritius===
Multiculturalism has been a characteristic feature of the island of [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref name="LionnetShi2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Françoise Lionnet|author2=Shumei Shi|title=Minor transnationalism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NJKgGEb2jpsC&amp;pg=PA203|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=16 February 2005|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-3490-3|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauritian society includes people from many different ethnic and religious groups: Hindu, Muslim and [[Indo-Mauritian]]s, [[Mauritian Creole people|Mauritian Creoles]] (of African and [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] descent), Buddhist and Roman Catholic [[Sino-Mauritian]]s and [[Franco-Mauritian]]s (descendants of the original [[French people|French]] colonists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infomauritius.com/ |title=Some facts about Mauritius |publisher=Infomauritius.com |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
Mexico has historically always been a multicultural country, with people of ethnic groups including those of indigenous background, various European backgrounds, Africans, and a small Asian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Page |first=Index |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1932-ethnic-diversity-in-mexico |title=Ethnic diversity in Mexico : Mexico Travel |publisher=Mexconnect.com |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico City]] has recently been integrating rapidly, doing much better than many cities in a sample conducted by the Intercultural Cities Index (being the only non-European city, alongside [[Montreal]], on the index).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/culture/cities/index/Mexico_en.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Mexico City PR rev[1&amp;#93;-1.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
The [[Philippines]] ranks 8th among 240 countries in terms of ethnic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;YEOH Kok Kheng, [http://www.fep.um.edu.my/working%20papers/2001/FEA-WP-2001-003.pdf Towards an Index of Ethnic Fractionalization], Table 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its several [[ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnic groups]], the Philippines has 10 major distinct groups mainly the [[Bicolano people|Bicolano]], [[Ibanag people|Ibanag]], [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]], [[Moro (ethnic group)|Moro]], [[Pangasinense people|Pangasinan]], [[Sambal people|Sambal]], [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] and [[Visayan]]. The Philippines also has several [[Indigenous peoples of the Philippines|aboriginal]] stocks such as the [[Bajau|Badjao]], [[Igorot]], [[Lumad]], [[Mangyan]] and [[Negrito]]. The country also has considerable communities of [[American settlement in the Philippines|American]], [[Arab settlement in the Philippines|Arabic]], [[Chinese Filipinos|Chinese]], [[Indians in the Philippines|Indian]], and [[Filipinos of Spanish descent|Hispanic]] descent, and other ethnicities from other countries. The Philippine government has various programs supporting and preserving the nation's ethnic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2794.htm |title=State.gov |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there have been many threats to the maintenance of interethnic solidarity in the country. Aside from economic and political dissatisfaction touting the capital as ''[[Imperial Manila|imperialist]]'' mostly among [[Visayans]] and [[Mindanao]]ans of the south, there have been longstanding concerns regarding the promulgation of the [[national language]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]]. Amidst Filipino being heralded as the national language of the Philippines according to the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 National Constitution]], many groups specifically from [[Cebuano language|Cebuano-speaking]] [[regions of the Philippines|regions]] resisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smolicz, J. J. |author2=Nical, I. |author3=Secombe, M. J. |year=2003 |title=Assimilation or pluralism? Changing policies for minority languages education in Australia and the Philippines |url=http://www.linguapax.org/congres/Tallers/article13_ang.html |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that the said Filipino is no different from [[Tagalog]] although being justified by the regulating institution, [[Commission on the Filipino Language|Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino]], as a different language that unites all peoples of the Philippines because of the significant difference in [[lexicon]] from its Tagalog base. Such enforcement of a national language based solely upon one language being spoken by one of the many ethnic groups in the country was seen as a form of ethnic marginalization and bias toward the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] who have long enjoyed residence and proximity within the political and economic center, Manila. This was also seen as an injustice since a larger portion of the population speaks [[Visayan languages]] more than [[Tagalog]] during the time the national language was decided. Because of such disparities, there have been issues regarding discrimination particularly toward [[Visayans]] whose [[Visayan languages|languages]] and cultures were seen as inferior if not unsophisticated. One recent example was the [[Cinema of the Philippines|Filipino movie]] entitled ''[[Sakal, Sakali, Saklolo]]'' whereby one scene openly denigrates the use of Visayan as it was seen as "un-Filipino."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/74336/showbiz/pimentel-slams-slur-in-sakal-sakali-saklolo |title=Pimentel slams slur in Sakal, Sakali, Saklolo |date=27 December 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[politics of the Philippines|Filipino politicians]] have aired their criticism toward this act of intolerance; however, there had been no concrete actions done to resolve the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pep.ph/news/15906/politicians-slam-sakal-sakali-saklolo-for-ethnic-slur |title=Politicians slam "Sakal, Sakali, Saklolo" for ethnic slur |date=29 December 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there had been no ethnic-based incidents of [[armed conflict|aggression]] between many [[Christian]] and [[Igorot|animist]] groups, [[religion]] still plays a role in further fractionating Philippine society. The enduring [[islamic insurgency in the Philippines|war in Mindanao]] is one of the most prominent examples of religious conflicts pestering the economically frail southern Philippines. Since the 1899 [[Moro Rebellion]], Muslim groups across [[Mindanao]] have bolstered armed offensives against [[American Colonisation of the Philippines|foreign colonizers]] due to aspirations of [[self-determination]]. However, these efforts have failed resulting to the annexation of [[Moro people|Islamic regions]] particularly the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] to the Philippines.

===Singapore===
Besides [[English Language|English]], Singapore recognizes three other languages, namely, [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malay language|Malay]] as its official languages, with [[English language|English]] being the national language. Besides being a [[multilingualism|multilingual]] country, Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by these three ethnic communities.

During the British colonial rule, there are areas which are enclaves containing a large population of certain ethnic groups exist in areas such as [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]], [[Geylang]] and [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]] in Singapore. Presently &lt;sup&gt;(2010)&lt;/sup&gt;, remnants of the colonial ethnic concentration still exists but housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) In [[Housing and Development Board|Housing Development Boards of Singapore website]] Retrieved on Nov 18, 2010 from  [http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10296p.nsf/PressReleases/C515273FA068DD58482576DD00169155?OpenDocument ''Policy Changes To Support An Inclusive And Cohesive Home'']&lt;/ref&gt; The current Indian/Others ethnic limits are 10% and 13%, the limits for Malays are 22% and 25%, the limits for Chinese are 84% and 87% for the maximum ethnic limits for a neighborhood and a block respectively.

===South Korea===
[[File:G20 protests Seoul - VOA - Rally1.jpg|thumb|People in [[Seoul]], South Korea]]
[[South Korea]] remains a relatively homogenous country ethnically and racially.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ Korea's ethnic nationalism is a source of both pride and prejudice, according to Gi-Wook Shin]". The Korea Herald. August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners and immigrants are often rejected by the Korean society or face discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/MonoPaper3-13.html The Life Instability of Intermarried Japanese Women in Korea]", Eung-Ryul Kim (Korea University and University of Southern California, The Center for Multiethnic and Transnational Studies)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the word "multiculturalism" is increasingly heard in South Korea. In 2007, Han Geon-Soo, Professor of Cultural Anthropology at [[Kangwon National University]], published an article entitled "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", noting: "As the increase of foreign migrants in Korea transforms a single-ethnic homogeneous Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one, Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement." He argued, however, that "the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in Korea" lacked "the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society".&lt;ref&gt;Han Geon-Soo, "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", ''Korea Journal'', Vol.47 No.4, Winter 2007, pp.32-63&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued:
:''"Korea no longer has to decide whether it wants to become a multicultural society. It made that decision years ago – perhaps unconsciously – when it decided to be a full participant in the emerging global economy. It confirmed that decision when it decided to actively recruit foreign migrants to meet the economic and demographic needs of a fast-growing society. Korea is faced by a different decision today: what type of multicultural society does it want to be?"''&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Castles, [http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf "Will Labour Migration lead to a Multicultural Society in Korea?", Global Human Resources Forum 2007 / International Migration Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Korea Times]]'' suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/10/123_57884.html "Multiculturalism Likely to Prevail in Korea"], Lee Hyo-sik, ''Korea Times'', December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, ''[[JoongAng Daily]]'' reported: "Media in Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism. With more than one million foreigners in Korea, 2 percent of the population comes from other cultures." It added:
:''"If you stay too long, Koreans become uncomfortable with you. [...] Having a 2 percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea’s greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad. Multiculturalism will introduce contrasting views and challenge existing assumptions. While it will undermine the homogeneity, it will enrich Koreans with a better understanding of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925120 "Multiculturalism in Korea"], ''JoongAng Daily'', August 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many debates still take place as to whether Korea really is a multicultural society or not, it is generally agreed{{by whom|date=December 2013}} that Korea has probably entered a stage of multiculturalism and has moved away from its homogeneous identity. Around 35~40% of Korean men in the rural area outside Seoul are engaged with wives from different countries. According to the Dongponews, an online media that connects migrants and immigrants of Korea, the number of foreigners residing in Korea reached 1.43 million by 2012, and is likely to increase more and more, reaching to the scale that cannot be undermined. More than that, Korea is going through a serious stage of low birthrate, leading to an aging society in shortage of labor forces. Another big changing factor is that Korea already has multi-ethnic, multi-cultural families appearing in great numbers, as one in every ten marriage is between a Korean and a foreigner, and in the rural side this portion is greater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dongponews.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=21266 Is ROK a multicultural society?] Dongpo News. 2012-05-18.  Retrieved 2012-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt; As such change takes place in such short period of time, it can be understood that many conflicts arise among different groups of people; the immigrants, government, and the rest of Korean society. Recently{{when|date=December 2013}} a lot of media attention is given to these people; documentaries on the lives of wives and their children are often shown, as well as talk shows that portray struggles and conflicts these people go through such as Love in Asia; a talk show hosting foreign wives, sharing their experience of marriage and family life, broadcast by the national broadcasting channel, KBS. Many Koreans nowadays do recognize the change that the society is going through due to these media attention. Government policies have also changed very recently; a lot of welfare programs and extracurricular activities are launched under the name of "multicultural policy." The policy is quite recent phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===United Arab Emirates===
Although [[Arabic]] is the official language of the country, [[English language|English]], [[Malayalam]], [[Hindi]], [[Urdu]], [[Tagalog]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and many other languages are widely spoken and understood, particularly in the main cities of [[Dubai]] and [[Abu Dhabi]]. The [[UAE]] hosts expatriate workers from 200 countries, with a majority coming from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Despite being an Islamic state, the UAE has widely accepted all other religions, granting them permission to have their temples or churches. Foreigners make up about 85% of the population. However, the UAE does not have an open immigration policy and Emirati citizens form a largely homogeneous Arab society; all foreigners reside in the country as temporary workers.

In the United States, multiculturalism is not clearly established in policy at the federal level, but ethnic diversity is common in both rural and urban areas; see [[Race and ethnicity in the United States]].

Continuous mass immigration was a feature of the United States economy and society since the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Isaacs2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Katherine Isaacs|title=Immigration and emigration in historical perspective|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5asNot0c5kwC&amp;pg=PA38|year=2007|publisher=Edizioni Plus|isbn=978-88-8492-498-8|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absorption of the stream of immigrants became, in itself, a prominent feature of America's [[national myth]]. The idea of the [[Melting pot]] is a [[metaphor]] that implies that all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Israel. ''The Melting Pot,'' 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; The Melting Pot implied that each individual immigrant, and each group of immigrants, assimilated into American society at their own pace which, as defined above, is not multiculturalism as this is opposed to assimilation and integration.&lt;ref name="Suárez-OrozcoSuárez-Orozco2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcelo M.

The Melting Pot tradition co-exists with a belief in national unity, dating from the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American founding fathers]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people&amp;nbsp;— a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs... This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Jay]], ''First American Supreme Court Chief Justice'', [[Federalist No. 2|Federalist Paper No. 2]]'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a [[philosophy]], multiculturalism began as part of the [[pragmatism]] movement at the end of the nineteenth century in [[Europe]] and the United States, then as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political]] and [[cultural pluralism]] at the turn of the twentieth.&lt;ref name="CaputiFoster2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Caputi|author2=Heather Foster|author3=Linda L.

Philosophers, psychologists and historians and early sociologists such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[George Santayana]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[John Dewey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[Alain Locke]] developed concepts of cultural pluralism, from which emerged what we understand today as multiculturalism. In ''Pluralistic Universe'' (1909), William James espoused the idea of a "[[plural society]]."  James saw pluralism as "crucial to the formation of philosophical and social [[humanism]] to help build a better, more egalitarian society.&lt;ref name=Boening&gt;{{cite news

The educational approach to multiculturalism has since spread to the [[grade school]] system, as school systems try to rework their curricula to introduce students to diversity earlier—often on the grounds that it is important for minority students to see themselves represented in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Volk2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terese M.

Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society, that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/mar/22/multiculturalism-blame-culture-segregation |title=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |location=London |first=Antony |last=Lerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes.

Historically, support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II, in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the "human rights revolution", in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and [[ethnic cleansing]] became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the [[Holocaust]]; with the collapse of the [[Colonial empire|European colonial system]], as colonized nations in Africa and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]] successfully [[African independence movements|fought for their independence]] and pointed out the discriminatory underpinnings of the colonial system; and, in the United States in particular, with the rise of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which criticized ideals of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo-American standards and which led to the development of academic [[ethnic studies]] programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Wessendorf, ''The multiculturalism backlash: European discourses, policies and practices'', p.35; accessed through Google Books, 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Gorski, [http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/papers/edchange_history.html "A Brief History of Multicultural Education"], EdChange.org, November 1999; accessed 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As this history shows, multiculturalism in Western countries was seen as a useful set of strategies to combat racism, to protect minority communities of all types, and to undo policies that had prevented minorities from having full access to the opportunities for freedom and equality promised by the [[liberalism]] that has been the hallmark of Western societies since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The [[contact hypothesis]] in sociology is a well documented phenomenon in which cooperative interactions with those from a different group than one's own reduce prejudice and inter-group hostility.

C. James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it "uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history, particularly the histories of women and minorities [...and] promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten.&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. James Trotman|title=Multiculturalism: roots and realities|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ht8UKlutUaMC&amp;pg=PR9|accessdate=29 January 2012|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34002-3|pages=9=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By closing gaps, by raising consciousness about the past, multiculturalism tries to restore a sense of wholeness in a [[postmodern]] era that fragments human life and thought."&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"/&gt;

[[Tariq Modood]] argues that in the early years of the 21st century, multiculturalism "is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less", since it is "the form of integration" that (1) best fits the ideal of [[egalitarianism]], (2) has "the best chance of succeeding" in the "post-[[9/11]], post [[7/7]]" world, and (3) has remained "moderate [and] pragmatic".&lt;ref name="Modood2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tariq Modood|title=Multiculturalism: a civic idea|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hlEMZuPhpWQC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-3288-9|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhikhu Parekh]] counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities "demanding special rights" and to see it as promoting a "thinly veiled racis[m]". Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact "not about minorities" but "is about the proper terms of relationship between different cultural communities", which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., "the principles of justice" must not come from only one of the cultures but must come "through an open and equal dialogue between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parekh|first=Bhikhu C.|title=Rethinking multiculturalism: cultural diversity and political theory|year=2002|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-00995-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Criticism of multiculturalism}}

Critics of multiculturalism often debate whether the multicultural ideal of benignly co-existing cultures that interrelate and influence one another, and yet remain distinct, is sustainable, paradoxical, or even desirable.&lt;ref name="Nagle2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Nagle|title=Multiculturalism's double bind: creating inclusivity, cosmopolitanism and difference|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zqMCc37dW1kC&amp;pg=PA129|date=23 September 2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-7607-2|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rajaee2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Farhang Rajaee|title=Globalization on trial: the human condition and the information civilization|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZyAt3T1V4EcC&amp;pg=PT97|date=May 2000|publisher=IDRC|isbn=978-0-88936-909-2|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SandercockAttili2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leonie Sandercock|author2=Giovanni Attili|author3=Val Cavers|coauthors=Paula Carr|title=Where strangers become neighbours: integrating immigrants in Vancouver, Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TmlGzr4s0uMC&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9034-9|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that [[Nation states]], who would previously have been synonymous with a distinctive cultural identity of their own, lose out to enforced multiculturalism and that this ultimately erodes the host nations' distinct culture.&lt;ref name="Report attacks multiculturalism"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4295318.stm |title=Report attacks multiculturalism |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-09-30 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard professor of political science [[Robert D. Putnam]] conducted a nearly decade long study how multiculturalism affects social trust.&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"&gt;Putnam, Robert D., "E Pluribus Unum: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-first Century -- The 2006 Johan Skytte Prize," ''Scandinavian Political Studies'' 30 (2), June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust.  People in diverse communities "don’t trust the local mayor, they don’t trust the local paper, they don’t trust other people and they don’t trust institutions," writes Putnam.&lt;ref&gt;Sailer, Steve, [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/jan/15/00007/ "Fragmented Future,"] ''American Conservative'', Jan. 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us.&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ethologist [[Frank Salter]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism.  For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens.  Case studies of the United States, Africa and South-East Asia find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure.  Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnies {{sic}}.  A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogeneous cities.&lt;ref&gt;Salter, Frank, ''On Genetic Interests'', pg.146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dick Lamm]], former three-term Democratic governor of the US state of [[Colorado]], wrote in his essay "I have a plan to destroy America":

:"Diverse peoples worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other - that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent."&lt;ref&gt;Richard D. Lamm, 2005, [http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/lamm.asp I have a plan to destroy America], accessed 12 January 2011, Snopes.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Balibar characterizes criticisms of multiculturalism as “differentialist racism", which he describes as a covert form of racism that does not purport ethnic superiority as much as it asserts stereotypes of perceived “incompatibility of life-styles and traditions”.&lt;ref name="Gunew 2004 80"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunew|first=Sneja|title=Haunted Nations: The colonial dimensions of multiculturalisms|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=11 New Fetter Lane, London EC4P 4EE|isbn=0-415-28483-X|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Zealand]] ([[Aotearoa]]), which is officially bi-cultural, multiculturalism has been seen as a threat to the [[Māori people|Maori]], and possibly an attempt by the New Zealand Government to undermine Maori demands for self determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/030437540803300103|title=Indigeneity's Challenges to the White Settler-State: Creating a Thirdspace for Dynamic Citizenship|year=2008|last1=Johnson|first1=J.
