In legal cases alleging discrimination, "sex" is usually preferred as the determining factor rather than "gender", because it refers to biology rather than socially constructed [[norm (sociology)|norms]] which are more open to interpretation and dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Render: 2006 at p102&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg explains that although gender and sex are separate concepts, they are interlinked in that gender discrimination often results from stereotypes based on what is expected of members of each sex.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg (1999 at p271)&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''J.E.B. v. Ala. ex rel. T.B.'', [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] distinguished sex and gender

{{quote|The word ‘gender’ has acquired the new and useful connotation of cultural or attitudinal characteristics (as opposed to physical characteristics) distinctive to the sexes. That is to say, gender is to sex as feminine is to female and masculine is to male.&lt;ref&gt;''J.E.B. v. Ala. ex rel. T.B.'', 114 S. Ct. 1419, 1436 n.1 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, biologically "male" privilege is only one of many [[power structure]]s that may exist within a given society,&lt;ref name="Foucault1976"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel  |title=The History of Sexuality, Volume I|year=1976, Reissued 1990.|publisher=Vintage|isbn=0-679-72469-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and levels/manifestations of male privilege differ both between disparate societies as well as in different contexts within the same society. The term "male privilege" does not apply to a solitary occurrence of the use of power, but rather describes one of many systemic power structures that are interdependent and interlinked throughout societies and cultures.&lt;ref name="Narayan"/&gt;

== Determining male privilege ==
In 2005, the [[Geneva]]-based [[World Economic Forum]] published a study entitled Women’s Empowerment: Measuring the Gender Gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lopez-Claros|first=Augusto |title= Women's Empowerment: Measuring the Global Gender Gap|url=http://www.weforum.org/pdf/Global_Competitiveness_Reports/Reports/gender_gap.pdf|accessdate=11 July 2010|coauthors=Saadia Zahidi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using five critical areas, this study quantified the achievements that women in fifty-eight different countries have attained compared to their male counterparts. The five criteria defined by the study were: &lt;br /&gt;
# '''economic participation''' representing the principle 'equal remuneration for equal work';
# '''economic opportunity''' through access to the general labour market rather than low-paid, unskilled jobs;
# '''[[political]] empowerment''' reflecting the extent to which women are represented in decision-making structures;
# '''[[educational]] attainment''' including access to education at all levels; and
# over-all '''health and well-being''' including access to [[reproductive]] [[healthcare]].
The report also provides “...rare information on issues such as [[childcare]] availability and cost, the impact of [[maternity]] laws on the hiring of women, the prevalence of [[private sector]] employment of women and wage inequality.”

Rankings varied widely between the various criteria but, overall, the highest scoring (most gender equal) ten countries were as follows:
#[[Sweden]]
#[[Norway]]
#[[Iceland]]
#[[Denmark]]
#[[Finland]]
#[[New Zealand]]
#[[Canada]]
#[[United Kingdom]]
#[[Germany]]
#[[Australia]]

The bottom scoring (least gender equal) ten countries in the study were:&lt;br /&gt;
49 [[Venezuela]]&lt;br /&gt;
50 [[Greece]]&lt;br /&gt;
51 [[Brazil]]&lt;br /&gt;
52 [[Mexico]]&lt;br /&gt;
53 [[India]]&lt;br /&gt;
54 [[Korea]]&lt;br /&gt;
55 [[Jordan]]&lt;br /&gt;
56 [[Pakistan]]&lt;br /&gt;
57 [[Turkey]]&lt;br /&gt;
58 [[Egypt]]

== Cultural factors regarding male privilege ==
{{POV|date=September 2008}}
In every aspect of modern life in [[politics]], the [[law]], the [[Church (building)|church]]es, the [[business]] world, the [[school]]s, and the [[family]], the issue of sexual (sometimes gender) discrimination has grown in significance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} A core assumption is that [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and sexual behaviour are natural outcomes, a simple result of [[genetics]] or biology. An alternative view is that sexuality is a [[social]] construction, where men and women are nurtured and encouraged to become appropriate members of the [[Social environment|ambient]] society, as decided by the majority. These assigned [[gender roles]] carry with them packages of [[rights]] and duties, depending on whether the individual is [[male]] or [[female]]. Baer&lt;ref name = Baer/&gt;, for example, analyzed gender roles in the U.S.A and suggested that one of the factors slowing down progress towards greater equality has been the low number of women in the higher judicial ranks. Without effective input at a senior level to correct for male bias, she felt that historical attitudes towards women's physiology limits them in their choice of career, their intellectual maturity, their credibility and their ability to be effective contributors to the advancement of human society.&lt;ref name = Baer/&gt; An early example is found in ''[[Muller v. Oregon]]'' 208 U.S. 412 (1908), where Brewer J. said:
"That woman's physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence is obvious. This is especially true when the burdens of motherhood are upon her. Even when they are not, by abundant testimony of the medical fraternity continuance for a long time on her feet at work, repeating this from day to day, tends to injurious effects upon the body, and as healthy mothers are essential to vigorous offspring, the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race."

Sex- or gender-based differentiation manifests itself differently in different cultural contexts. For example, it is evidenced by the [[glass ceiling]] and the [[wage gap]] in Western cultures,&lt;ref name="Blau kane"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blau|first=Francine|coauthors=Kahn, Lawrence|title=Rising Wage Inequality and the U.S. Gender Gap|journal= American Economic Review|year=1994|volume=84|pages=23–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[genital mutilation]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noharmm.org/home.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[dowry]]-related violence in Asian cultures,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/jul2001/ind-j04.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Human_trafficking#Human_trafficking_and_sexual_exploitation|sexually exploitative trafficking]] of women and young girls.

== Compensating for male privilege ==
Compensation for male privilege takes place in a difficult and ever-changing territory. Most Western countries have enacted [[laws]] intended to mitigate the disparity between men and women, including laws which prohibit retaliation ( e.g. Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 (No FEAR) in the U.S.) although these laws have not produced a consistent outcome.

In general, many women fear the ramifications of taking formal action to address perceived sexual bias.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The practical adverse consequences include loss of work, difficulties in finding a new position, and gaining a reputation as a difficult employee. Because social contacts are very important in the business world, and disapproval from both male and female colleagues can be so strong, many women refrain from litigating problems that arise in an [[social environment|environment]] of male privilege, such as [[sexual harassment]] and [[favouritism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Add to this the fact that the courts in many countries are male-dominated and the result is that only a few of the more obvious abuses of male privilege are subjected to effective scrutiny and remedial action.&lt;ref name = Baer&gt;{{cite book|last=Baer|first=Judith A|title=Women in American Law: The Struggle Toward Equality from the New Deal to the Present. |year=1991, Reissued 1996|publisher=Holmes &amp; Meier Publishing|isbn=0-8419-1365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2010}}

The disparity between male and female rights in some countries makes murder or ritualised rape an acceptable male response to specified female behaviour and, often, similar male behaviour. Even in countries that formally enact laws to criminalise [[Honor killings|honour killings]], they are rarely prosecuted. For example, [[Human Rights Watch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Burney|first=Samya |title=Crime or custom?: violence against women in Pakistan  |year=1999|publisher=Human Rights Watch (Organization)|isbn=1-56432-241-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; quotes the [[Human Rights Commission of Pakistan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State of Human Rights in 1997|year=1997|author=Human Rights Commission of Pakistan|pages=50–51)"}}&lt;/ref&gt; as reporting that: "The practice of summary killing of a woman suspected of an illicit liaison, known as [[karo kari]] in [[Sindh]] and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], is known to occur in all parts of the country. The Sindh government has reported an annual figure of 300 for such killings. HRCP's own findings reveal that in 1997 there were eighty-six ''karo kari'' killings in [[Larkana]], Sindh, alone."
Stein &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=Dorothy|title="Burning Widows, Burning Brides: The Perils of Daughterhood in India"|journal=Pacific Affairs|year=1988|volume= 61(3) (Autumn)|pages=465–485}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the guarantees against sex discrimination built into the [[India]]n Constitution, but states that "the most extreme forms of brutality towards women have proved stubbornly resistant to all forms of legal and educational attempts to eradicate them. The past few years have seen the continued growth and practice of dowry which was outlawed in the sixties... and finally in the eighties, attempts to re-establish ''[[suttee|sati]]'' as a justifiable practice." Several cases of ''sati'' occur each year, and even when death is avoided, widowhood in high-[[caste]] [[Hindu]] cultures can still have unfortunate consequences by Western standards. In other countries, women are not allowed out in public unless accompanied by a male relative, to drive cars, or to show their faces. Some of these [[regulations]] are based on [[religion|religious]] laws, and some on long-standing [[misogyny]]. In either case, agitation for change in these [[society|societies]] is generally frowned upon. Several [[NGOs]] and women’s groups, however, have been pushing for change within these countries for decades and, in some cases, have achieved and continue to achieve more equitable systems.&lt;ref name="Narayan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Narayan|first=Uma|title=Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third-World Feminism.|year=1997|publisher=London: Routledge|isbn=0-415-91419-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2010}}

==Male privilege in the U.S.==
{{Multiple issues| section =May 2009 | POV = May 2008 | disputed = May 2008}}
[[Image:Income inequity US.png|thumb|400px|This graph shows the income difference between males and females in the US by race. According to 2005 statistics, [[White American]] males made 48% more than [[White American]] females.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau, Personal income forum, Age 25+, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_000.htm|title=US Census Bureau, Personal income forum, Age 25+, 2005|accessdate=2007-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1954, Congress barred  discrimination “...against any individual with respect to . . . terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of [an individual’s] sex.” Blau and Ferber (1992 at p129) report that the [[Male–female income disparity in the United States|female-to-male ratio of earnings]] of full-time employees was moderately stable at 60% for the first seventy years of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;(1992) Blau &amp; Ferber, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, earnings of women who worked full-time had risen to 72% of the average earned by men. It's important to note that these statistics do not take into account differences in experience, skill, occupation, education or hours worked as long as it qualifies as [[full-time work]] and do not represent an accurate measure of [[equal pay for equal work]]. The Federal Glass Ceiling Commission (1995) established by President Bush and Senator Dole found that women remained economically disadvantaged. Per the study, 97% of senior managers in Fortune 1000 corporations were males in 1992. Women held only 3 to 5% of senior level management positions.&lt;ref&gt;(1995) Federal Glass Ceiling Commission&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, women held 46.5% of U.S. jobs, and earned 72% of the salary of their male co-workers (''The Economist'' July 21, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4197626 | work=The Economist | title=The conundrum of the glass ceiling | date=2005-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Neumark et al. (1995) and other studies have found major continuing discrimination in recruitment practices,&lt;ref&gt;(1995) Neumark et al.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the professions, Wood, et al. (1993) found major disparities in pay for equal work.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, et al. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (1995) similarly found that, within educational categories, the economic status of women fell short. The average woman with a masters degree earned the same amount as the average man with an associate degree.&lt;ref&gt;(1995) Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts and Congress have permitted the use of statistical evidence where discrimination or "manifest imbalance" is alleged, to establish a ''prima facie'' case of unlawful discrimination. Such evidence then shifts the [[burden of proof]] to the employer to explain the disparity or otherwise demonstrate that the disparity is not the result of discrimination. Critics of this results based analysis claim that it equates equal opportunity with equal results.  Similarly, ''Johnson v. Transportation Agency'' 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a "manifest imbalance" demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories. Such an affirmative plan is valid so long as it is temporary and does not unnecessarily restrict rights of male or non-minority employees or create an absolute barrier to their advancement. However, few plans have been adopted and the enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation to correct for male privilege generally is patchy.&lt;ref&gt;(2003) MacKinnon&lt;/ref&gt;

Lugones (2003) emphasises that racial discrimination aggravates sexual discrimination because it imposes a false identity (more pernicious than a mere stereotype) on women. U.S. culture adopts "whiteness" as the "unmarked", non-racial norm, and establishes different classes of non-white with varying degrees of additional prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;(2003) Lugones&lt;/ref&gt;  The case of ''Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.'', 523 US 75 (1998) should be noted because it applied Title VII to same-sex sexual harassment with the unanimous finding that Title VII bars all forms of discrimination "because of" sex. Such discrimination, whether motivated by sexual desire or not, is actionable so long at it places its victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the victim's gender. Now, ''Smith v. City of Salem''  378 F.3d 566 (6th Cir. 2004) has extended protection to the transgendered, and also broadened the interpretation of the statutory criterion "sex" to include "gender."&lt;ref&gt;(2005 Chow)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Against the notion of 'male privilege'==
The existence of male privilege is not universally accepted. Critics state that women are more privileged than men, or that women are also privileged, but in different ways to men.

Men's rights activist Herb Goldberg&lt;ref name="goldberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Herb|title=The Hazards of Being Male- surviving the Myth of Masculine Privilege|year= 1976|publisher=Wellness Institute, Inc|isbn=1-58741-013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;, for example, claimed in 1976 that "the myth that the male is culturally favoured ...is clung to, despite the fact that every critical statistic in the area of longevity, disease, suicide, crime, accidents, childhood emotional disorders, alcoholism, and drug addiction shows a disproportionately higher male rate." He sees males as "oppressed by the cultural pressures that have denied him his feelings, by the mythology of the woman and the distorted and self destructive way he sees and relates to her, by the urgency for him to 'act like a man' which blocks his ability to respond ... both emotionally and physiologically, and by a generalized self hate that causes him to [not] feel comfortable ... when he lives for joy and for personal growth."

[[Conservative]] activist [[Phyllis Schlafly]] and conservative commentator [[Ann Coulter]] have argued in the course of their campaign against the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] that “of all the classes of people who have ever lived, the American woman is the most privileged. We have the most rights and rewards, and the fewest duties.” &lt;ref name = "frederica"&gt;{{cite book | last = Schlafly, Phyllis and Ann Coulter |title = Feminist Fantasies | publisher = Dallas: Spence Publishing Co | date = 2003 |id = ISBN 1890626465 | url = http://www.frederica.com/writings/phyllis-schlafly.html| accessdate = 2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, they point to the traditionally nonreciprocal obligation on husbands to financially provide for their wives, legal privileges granted to female employees that men do not have, and women's immunity from [[conscription]] into military service.&lt;ref name = "frederica" /&gt;

[[Warren Farrell]]’s book, ''[[The Myth of Male Power]]'', which Farrell has himself described as “a 500-page debunking of the myth of men as a privileged class” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Svoboda| first = J. Steven | title = An Interview with Warren Farrell | date = 12 June 2008| url = http://warrenfarrell.info/media/an-interview-with-warren-farrell| accessdate = 2008-10-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell points to the over-representation of men among groups such as the [[homeless]], [[suicides]], [[alcoholics]], the victims of [[violent crime]] and [[Convict|prisoners]]. He argues that men disproportionately occupy the most dangerous and unpleasant occupations and that “if a man feels obligated to take a job he likes less so he can be paid more money that someone else spends while he dies seven years earlier, well, that's not power.” &lt;ref name = farrellint&gt;{{cite web| last = Macchietto  | first = John | title = Interview with Warren Farrell | url = http://digilander.libero.it/uomini/farrel.htm| accessdate = 2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, he points to spheres of [[discrimination]] against men in such spheres as the [[military draft]], [[family law]] and the [[criminal justice system]]. Far from being privileged, he argues that policies such as [[conscription]], the [[women and children first (saying)|women and children first]] rule and the over-representation of men among the most dangerous occupations illustrate men’s status as ‘the disposable sex’.&lt;ref name = farrellint/&gt;

In those countries with [[military service]], the majority operate voluntary enlistment for both men and women, but in those countries with [[conscription]], the majority exempt women from compulsory service. In 2000, Sweden considered a measure to require women to perform compulsory military service along with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Equality may mean Army service in Sweden |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2000/0419/p17s1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Israel, Jewish and Druze females are required to perform 21 months of compulsory military service while their male counterparts are required to perform 36 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA World Factbook- Field Listing: Military service age and obligation|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2024.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
