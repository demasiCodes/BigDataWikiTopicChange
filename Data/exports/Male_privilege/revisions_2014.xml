'''Male privilege''' is a term for social, economic, and political advantages or rights that are made available to [[men]] solely on the basis of their [[sex]]. A man's access to these benefits may also depend on other characteristics such as [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[sexual orientation]] and [[social class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Phillips |first1= Debby A. |authorlink1= |last2= Phillips |first2= John R. |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Jodi |editor1-last= O'Brien |editor1-link= |others= |title= Encyclopedia of Gender and Society |url= |edition= |series= |volume= Volume Two |year= 2009 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications]] |location= Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn= 978-1-4129-0916-7 |page= |pages= 683&amp;ndash;684 |chapter= Privilege, Male |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Coston |first1= Bethany M. |last2= Kimmel |first2= Michael |year= 2012 |title= Seeing Privilege Where It Isn't: Marginalized Masculinities and the Intersectionality of Privilege |journal= Journal of Social Issues |volume= 68 |issue= 1 |pages= 97&amp;ndash;111 |publisher= |doi= 10.1111/j.1540-4560.2011.01738.x |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4560.2011.01738.x/full |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= McIntosh |first1= Peggy |authorlink1= Peggy McIntosh |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Michael |editor1-last= Kimmel |editor1-link= Michael Kimmel |editor2-first= Abby L. |editor2-last= Ferber |others= |title= Privilege: A Reader |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= 2003 |publisher= [[Westview Press]] |location= Boulder, Colorado |isbn= 978-0-8133-4056-2 |page= |pages= 3&amp;ndash;25 |chapter= White Privilege and Male Privilege |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male privilege is often examined with the concept of [[patriarchy]].

== Terminology ==
In legal cases alleging discrimination, "sex" is usually preferred as the determining factor rather than "gender", because it refers to biology rather than socially constructed [[norm (sociology)|norms]] which are more open to interpretation and dispute.{{better source|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Render, Meredith. (2006) "Misogyny, Androgyny, and Sexual Harassment: Sex Discrimination in a Gender-Deconstructed World". ''Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender''. Vol. 29(1) (Winter). pp99–150.
p102&lt;/ref&gt; In "Defining Male and Female: Intersexuality and the Collision Between Law and Biology", Julie Greenberg explains that although gender and sex are separate concepts, they are interlinked in that gender discrimination often results from stereotypes based on what is expected of members of each sex.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Julie A. (1999). "Defining Male and Female: Intersexuality and the Collision Between Law and Biology". ''Arizona Law Review''. Vol. 41. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.]]'', [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] distinguishes sex and gender:

{{quote|The word ‘gender’ has acquired the new and useful connotation of cultural or attitudinal characteristics (as opposed to physical characteristics) distinctive to the sexes. That is to say, gender is to sex as feminine is to female and masculine is to male.&lt;ref&gt;''J.E.B. v. Ala. ex rel. T.B.'', 114 S. Ct. 1419, 1436 n.1 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, biologically "male" privilege is only one of many [[Hierarchy|power structures]] that may exist within a given society,&lt;ref name="Foucault1976"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel |title=The History of Sexuality, Volume I|year=1976, Reissued 1990.|publisher=Vintage|isbn=0-679-72469-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and levels/manifestations of male privilege differ among both similar and disparate societies, as well as in different contexts within the same society {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. The term "male privilege" does not apply to a solitary occurrence of the use of power, but rather describes one of many systemic power structures that are interdependent and interlinked throughout societies and cultures.&lt;ref name="Narayan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Narayan|first=Uma|title=Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third-World Feminism.|year=1997|publisher=London: Routledge|isbn=0-415-91419-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the third-person singular pronoun "[[he]]" is used as a sex-indefinite, [[generic antecedent|generic]] form for all people (e.g., "anyone can do it if he tries") whereas the use of "she" to refer to people in general is not allowed.&lt;ref name=wildman/&gt;&lt;ref name=bwh/&gt;&lt;ref name=kleinman/&gt; Masculine generics were first introduced by [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive grammarians]] in the 19th century who argued that "he" was the only correct sex-indefinite referent.&lt;ref name=henley/&gt;&lt;ref name=bodine/&gt;&lt;ref name=hegarty/&gt; Prior to that, singular "they" and "he or she" had been widely used in written and spoken English.&lt;ref name=henley/&gt;&lt;ref name=bodine/&gt;&lt;ref name=hegarty/&gt; In 1850 a special [[Interpretation Act 1850|Act of Parliament]] was passed that legally proscribed singular "they" and "he or she" in favor of "he".&lt;ref name=henley&gt;{{Cite book |last= Henley |first= N.

Reasons given for preferring sons to daughters include sons' role in religious family rites, which daughters are not permitted to perform, and the belief that sons are permanent members of the birth family whereas daughters belong to their husband's family after marriage in accordance with [[Patrilocal residence|patrilocal]] tradition. Other reasons include [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] customs whereby only sons can carry on the family name, the obligation to pay [[dowry]] to a daughter's husband or his family, and the expectation that sons will support their birth parents financially while it is regarded as undesirable or shameful to receive financial support from daughters.&lt;ref name=lai-wan/&gt;&lt;ref name=singh/&gt;
