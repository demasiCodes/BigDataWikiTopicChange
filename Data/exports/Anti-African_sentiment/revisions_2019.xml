'''Afrophobia''' is a perceived fear of the cultures and peoples of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africa]], as well as the [[African diaspora]] &lt;ref name="Pwpa"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kivuto Ndeti |author2=Kenneth R. Gray |author3=Gerard Bennaars |title=The second scramble for Africa: a response &amp; a critical analysis of the challenges facing contempory &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; sub-Saharan Africa|date=1992|publisher=Professors World Peace Academy|isbn=9966835733|page=127|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ScsDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicology==
Primarily a cultural phenomenon, it pertains to the various traditions and peoples of [[Africa]], irrespective of racial origin.&lt;ref name="Pwpa"/&gt; As such, ''Afrophobia'' is distinct from the historical racial phenomenon ''[[negrophobia]]'', which is a contempt for ''[[Negroid|negro]]'' peoples specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Congregational Review, Volume 2|publisher=J.M. Whittemore|page=629|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=LkZKAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of Afrophobia is [[Afrophilia]], which is a love for all things pertaining to Africa.&lt;ref name="Pwpa"/&gt;

==By location==
It has been observed that writing and terminology about racism, including about Afrophobia has been somewhat U.S.-centric.  In 2016, Afrophobia has been used as a term for racism against darker-skinned persons in China. In such usage Afrophobia is an inexact term, because the racism is directed against darker-skinned persons from anywhere, without regard to any connection to Africa. Conversely, Chinese views for lighter-than-average skin are more positive, as reflected in advertising.&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite news|url=http://africanarguments.org/2016/08/12/claims-of-chinas-afrophobia-show-we-need-new-ways-to-think-about-race-and-racism/ |title=Claims of “China’s Afrophobia” show we need new ways to think about race and racism |date=August 12, 2016 |author=Roberto Castillo }} (posted originally at The Conversation, with title [https://theconversation.com/of-washing-powder-afrophobia-and-racism-in-china-60274 Of washing powder, Afrophobia and racism in China], August 11, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
To overcome any perceived "Afrophobia", writer [[Langston Hughes]] suggested that [[European Americans]] must achieve peace of mind and accommodate the uninhibited emotionality of [[African Americans]]. Author [[James Baldwin]] similarly recommended that White Americans could quash any "Afrophobia" on their part by getting in touch with their repressed feelings, empathizing to overcome their "emotionally stunted" lives, and thereby overcome any dislike or fear of African Americans.&lt;ref name="Washington"&gt;{{cite book|date=2001|title=The Ideologies of African American Literature|author =Washington, Robert E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP6DSxXSFhsC|page=272|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Tess Asplund]] made a viral protest against [[Neo-Nazism]] as part of her activism against Afrophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/woman-defied-neo-nazis-sweden-tess-asplund-viral-photograph|title=Woman who defied 300 neo-Nazis at Swedish rally speaks of anger|last=Crouch|first=David|date=2016-05-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsophisticated stereotype==
Some afrophobic sentiment centers around ideas of Africans being unsophisticated. Such perceptions include of Africans lacking a history of civilization, and visual imagery of [[Stereotypes of Africans|such stereotypes include living in mudhuts and carrying spears and other notions indicating their primitiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;Mays, Vickie M.
