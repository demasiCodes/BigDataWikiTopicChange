'''Anti-African sentiment''', '''Afroscepticism''', or '''Afrophobia''' is prejudice, hostility, discrimination, or racism towards [[People of Africa|people]] and [[Culture of Africa|cultures of Africa]] and of the [[African diaspora]].&lt;ref name="Pwpa"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kivuto Ndeti |author2=Kenneth R.

Prejudice against Africans and people of African descent has a long history, dating back to ancient times, although it was especially prominent during the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and the [[Colonial Africa|colonial period]]. Following the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, Africans were often portrayed as uncivilised and primitive, with colonial conquest branded [[civilising mission]]s. Due to the use of [[oral tradition]], and subsequent lack of [[recorded history|written histories]] in most African cultures, African people were portrayed as having no history at all, despite having a [[History of Africa|long, complex, and varied history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Frederick|date=2000|title=Africa's Pasts and Africa's Historians|journal=Canadian Journal of African Studies|volume=34|issue=2|pages=298–336|doi=10.2307/486417|jstor=486417}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, Afrophobia influenced [[Jim Crow laws]] and segregated housing, schools, and public facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Frederick Dennis. "Immigrants in Chains: Afrophobia in American Legal History-The Harlem Debates Part 3." ''Or. L. Rev.'' 76 (1997): 537.&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, it took the form of [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ochonu |first=Moses E. |date=2020-12-31 |title=South African Afrophobia in local and continental contexts |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-modern-african-studies/article/south-african-afrophobia-in-local-and-continental-contexts/41B09403C62C7C16B11DC03F24B1B76F |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |language=en |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=499–519 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X20000543 |issn=0022-278X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been a rise in Afrophobic hate speech and violence in Europe and the United States. This has been attributed to a number of factors, including the growth of the African diaspora in these regions, the increase in refugees and migrants from Africa, and the rise of [[Far-right politics|far-right]] and [[Populism|populist]] political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Michael |first=Lucy |title=Anti-Black Racism: Afrophobia, Exclusion and Global Racisms |date=2017 |work=Critical Perspectives on Hate Crime |pages=275–299 |editor-last=Haynes |editor-first=Amanda |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1057/978-1-137-52667-0_15 |access-date=2024-10-15 |place=London |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |language=en |doi=10.1057/978-1-137-52667-0_15 |isbn=978-1-137-52666-3 |editor2-last=Schweppe |editor2-first=Jennifer |editor3-last=Taylor |editor3-first=Seamus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2017-08-16 |title=US racism on the rise, UN experts warn in wake of Charlottesville violence |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2017/08/us-racism-rise-un-experts-warn-wake-charlottesville-violence |access-date=2024-10-15 |website=UN Human Rights Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent (WGEPAD) told the Human Rights Council that the human rights situation of Africans and people of African descent remained an urgent concern, citing racist violence, [[police brutality]] and killings, and systemic racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2022-10-02 |title=Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent to the Human Rights Council: the Human Rights Situation of Persons of African Descent Remains an Urgent Concern |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/working-group-experts-people-african-descent-human-rights-council-human |access-date=2024-08-14 |website=United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that year, WGEPAD had recommended the term Afrophobia be used to describe "the unique and specific form of racial discrimination affecting people of African descent and African Diaspora".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2017-02-27 |title=Statement to the media by the United Nations’ Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, on the conclusion of its official visit to Germany, 20-27 February 2017 |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2017/02/statement-media-united-nations-working-group-experts-people-african-descent |access-date=2024-08-14 |website=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
''Anti-African sentiment'' is prejudice or discrimination towards any of the various traditions and peoples of [[Africa]] for their perceived Africanness.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Koenane, M.L.J. and Maphunye, K.J., 2015. Afrophobia, moral and political disguises: Sepa leholo ke la moeti. ''Td: The Journal for Transdisciplinary Research in Southern Africa'', ''11''(4), pp.83-98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pwpa"/&gt; It is distinct from, but may overlap with, [[Anti-Black sentiment|''anti-Black racism'']] or ''Negrophobia'', which is contempt specifically for [[Black people#Africa|Black people of African descent]]'','' excluding other Africans such as [[White Africans of European ancestry|white Africans]] or [[North Africa|North Africans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Congregational Review, Volume 2|year=1862|publisher=J.M. Whittemore|page=629|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkZKAAAAMAAJ|access-date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Afrophobia'' may be used to describe both anti-Black racism and anti-African sentiment more broadly.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Privot, M., 2014.

=== Afrophobia ===
{{Excerpt|Anti-Black racism#Afrophobia}}The opposite of Afrophobia is [[Afrophilia]], which is a love for all things pertaining to Africa.&lt;ref name="Pwpa" /&gt;

=== Afroscepticism ===
''Anti-African sentiment'' and ''Afroscepticism'' are comparable terms to [[anti-Europeanism]] and [[Euroscepticism]]. Afroscepticism is positioned as an opposition to ''Africanity'' (the idea of a shared [[Culture of Africa|African culture]]), [[Africanization|''Africanisation'']], or ''[[Afrocentrism]]'', often seen as facets of [[Pan-Africanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Oloruntoba-Oju, T., 2014.

''Journal of Philosophy of Education'', ''57''(4-5), pp.781-790.&lt;/ref&gt; Afroscepticism may include embracing [[Afro-pessimism (Africa)|Afropessimism]], and rejecting traditional African practices or "African Indigenous Knowledge Systems".&lt;ref&gt;Gbogi, T., 2022.

It has been observed that writing and terminology about racism, including about Afrophobia, has been somewhat centered on the US.{{cn|date=January 2024}} In 2016, "Afrophobia" has been used as a term for racism against darker-skinned persons in China. In such usage, that is an inexact term because the racism is directed against darker-skinned persons from anywhere, without regard to any connection to Africa. Conversely, Chinese views for lighter-than-average skin are more positive, as is reflected in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://africanarguments.org/2016/08/12/claims-of-chinas-afrophobia-show-we-need-new-ways-to-think-about-race-and-racism/ |title=Claims of "China's Afrophobia" show we need new ways to think about race and racism |date=August 12, 2016 |author=Roberto Castillo}} (posted originally at The Conversation, with the title [https://theconversation.com/of-washing-powder-afrophobia-and-racism-in-china-60274 Of washing powder, Afrophobia and racism in China], August 11, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic discipline of [[history]] arrived with the discovery and [[colonisation of Africa]] and involved the study of Africa and its history by European academics and historians.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manning|first=Patrick|date=2013|title=African and World Historiography|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=54|issue=3|pages=319–330|issn=0021-8537|jstor=43305130|doi=10.1017/S0021853713000753|s2cid=33615987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to [[Scramble for Africa|colonisation]] in the 19th century, most African societies used [[oral tradition]] to record their [[History of Africa|history]], including in cases where they had [[Writing systems of Africa|developed]] or had access to a [[Writing systems of Africa|writing script]], resulting in there being little [[recorded history|written history]], and the domination of European powers across the continent meant [[History of Africa|African history]] was written entirely from a European perspective under the pretence of [[White supremacy|Western superiority]] supported by [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=A.D.|date=1978|title=The Earlier Historiography of Colonial Africa|journal=History in Africa|language=en|volume=5|pages=153–167|doi=10.2307/3171484|issn=0361-5413|jstor=3171484|s2cid=162869454 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This predilection stemmed from the perceived technological superiority of European nations and the decentralization of the African continent with no nation being a clear power in the region, as well as a perception of Africans as [[Racism in Africa|racially inferior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The wretched of the earth|author=Fanon, Frantz|others=Philcox, Richard; Sartre, Jean-Paul; Bhabha, Homi K.|isbn=9780802198853|location=New York|oclc=1085905753|date = December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor was the lack of an [[General History of Africa|established body of collective African history]] created in the continent, there being instead a [[Languages of Africa|multitude of different dialects]], [[Cultures of Africa|cultural groups]] and [[List of kingdoms in Africa throughout history|fluctuating nations]] as well as a diverse set of mediums that document history other than [[written word]]. This led to a perception by Europeans that Africa and its people had no recorded history and had little desire to create it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Frederick|date=2000|title=Africa's Pasts and Africa's Historians|journal=Canadian Journal of African Studies|volume=34|issue=2|pages=298–336|doi=10.2307/486417|jstor=486417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotypes of Africa==
{{Excerpt|Stereotypes of Africa}}
==Activism==
To overcome any perceived "Afrophobia", writer [[Langston Hughes]] suggested that [[European Americans]] must achieve peace of mind and accommodate the uninhibited emotionality of [[African Americans]].{{cn|date=January 2024}} Author [[James Baldwin]] similarly recommended that White Americans could quash any "Afrophobia" on their part by getting in touch with their repressed feelings, empathizing to overcome their "emotionally stunted" lives, and thereby overcome any dislike or fear of African Americans.&lt;ref name="Washington"&gt;{{cite book|date=2001|title=The Ideologies of African American Literature|author =Washington, Robert E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP6DSxXSFhsC|page=272|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|isbn=9780742509504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally established in 1998 by "approximately 150" organisations from across the [[European Union]], the [[European Network Against Racism]] (ENAR) aimed to combat "racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism — the accepted categories of the [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] struggle at that time". However, Afrophobia wasn't specifically named as a focus of the network until 2011, at the behest of Black civil rights activists.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2016, [[Tess Asplund]] made a viral protest against [[Neo-Nazism]] as part of her activism against Afrophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/woman-defied-neo-nazis-sweden-tess-asplund-viral-photograph|title=Woman who defied 300 neo-Nazis at Swedish rally speaks of anger|last=Crouch|first=David|date=2016-05-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In academia==
Some Afrophobic sentiments are based on the belief that Africans are unsophisticated. Such perceptions include the belief that Africans lack a history of [[civilization]], and visual imagery of such [[stereotypes of Africans|stereotypes perpetuate the notion that Africans]] still live in mud huts and carry spears, along with other notions that indicate their primitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mays |first1=Vickie M. |title=The Black American and psychotherapy: The dilemma. |journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training |date=1985 |volume=22 |issue=2S |pages=379–388 |doi=10.1037/h0085518}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ngonidzashe |last1=Marongwe |first2=Munyaradzi |last2=Mawere |chapter=Violence, Identity and Politics of Belonging: The April 2015 Afrophobic Attacks in South Africa and the Emergence of Some Discourses |pages=89–116 |chapter-url=https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1878812 |editor1-last=Munyaradzi |editor1-first=Mawere |editor2-last=Ngonidzashe |editor2-first=Marongwe |title=Violence, Politics and Conflict Management in Africa: Envisioning Transformation, Peace and Unity in the Twenty-First Century |date=2016 |publisher=Langaa RPCIG |isbn=978-9956-763-54-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrophobia in academia may also occur through by oversight with regards to lacking deconstruction in mediums such as African art forms, omitting historical African polities in world cartography, or promoting a eurocentric viewpoint by ignoring historic African contributions to world civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skinner |first1=Ryan Thomas |title=Walking, talking, remembering: an Afro-Swedish critique of being-in-the-world |journal=African and Black Diaspora |date=24 April 2018 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1080/17528631.2018.1467747 |s2cid=149746823 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
