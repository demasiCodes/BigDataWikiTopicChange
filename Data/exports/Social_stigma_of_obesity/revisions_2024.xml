'''Social stigma of obesity''' is [[bias]] or [[discrimination|discriminatory]] behaviors targeted at [[overweight]] and [[obese]] individuals because of their weight and high [[body fat percentage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puhl RM, Brownell KD | title = Psychosocial origins of obesity stigma: toward changing a powerful and pervasive bias | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 213–227 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14649372 | doi = 10.1046/j.1467-789X.2003.00122.x | author-link2 = Kelly D.

Anti-fat bias refers to [[prejudice|prejudicial]] assumptions that are based on an assessment of a person as being overweight or obese. It is also known as '''"fat shaming"''' or '''"fatphobia"'''. Anti-fat bias can be found in many facets of society,&lt;ref name="PuhlBrownell" /&gt; and [[fat acceptance movement|fat activists]] commonly cite examples of [[mass media]] and [[popular culture]] that pervade this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=UFM&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahern AL, Bennett KM, Hetherington MM | title = Internalization of the ultra-thin ideal: positive implicit associations with underweight fashion models are associated with drive for thinness in young women | journal = Eating Disorders | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 294–307 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18568920 | doi = 10.1080/10640260802115852 | s2cid = 2473526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkins N, Richards PS, Granley HM, Stein DM | title = The impact of exposure to the thin-ideal media image on women | journal = Eating Disorders | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–50 | year = 2004 | pmid = 16864303 | doi = 10.1080/10640260490267751 | s2cid = 28802161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Weight-related stigma can be characterized by the following aspects: 
* An individual does not have to be overweight or obese to experience weight-related stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carr D, Friedman MA | title = Is obesity stigmatizing? Body weight, perceived discrimination, and psychological well-being in the United States | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–259 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16259147 | doi = 10.1177/002214650504600303 | s2cid = 8396227 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.407.990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Studies have indicated that experiencing weight stigma reinforces lifestyle behaviors that contribute to obesity.&lt;ref name="Puhl" /&gt;
* Individuals who are overweight or obese tend to devalue their own in-group and prefer the out-group (i.e. thinner individuals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Latner JD, O'Brien KS, Durso LE, Brinkman LA, MacDonald T | title = Weighing obesity stigma: the relative strength of different forms of bias | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 32 | issue = 7 | pages = 1145–1152 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18414421 | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2008.53 | s2cid = 23678067 | doi-access =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
In the US, self-reported incidents of weight-based [[discrimination]] increased from 1995 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andreyeva T, Puhl RM, Brownell KD | title = Changes in perceived weight discrimination among Americans, 1995-1996 through 2004-2006 | journal = Obesity | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 1129–1134 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18356847 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2008.35 | s2cid = 15323829 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.175.3676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Individuals who are subjected to weight-related stigma appear to be rated more negatively{{How|date=November 2024}} when compared with other groups, such as [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]] and those with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].&lt;ref name="Vartanian_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vartanian LR, Smyth JM | title = Primum non nocere: obesity stigma and public health | journal = Journal of Bioethical Inquiry | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–57 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23288439 | doi = 10.1007/s11673-012-9412-9 | s2cid = 8752139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-fat bias has been observed in groups hoping to become physical education instructors. In a study published in 2007, a group of 344 psychology or [[physical education]] majors at a New Zealand University were compared, and it was found that the prospective physical education teachers were more likely to display implicit anti-fat attitudes than the psychology majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Brien KS, Hunter JA, Banks M | title = Implicit anti-fat bias in physical educators: physical attributes, ideology and socialization | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 308–314 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 16733526 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0803398 | s2cid = 22804583 | doi-access =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies have found that [[Health Care Providers|health care providers]] frequently have explicit and/or implicit biases against overweight people, and it has been found that overweight patients may receive lower quality care as a result of their weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phelan SM, Burgess DJ, Yeazel MW, Hellerstedt WL, Griffin JM, van Ryn M | title = Impact of weight bias and stigma on quality of care and outcomes for patients with obesity | journal = Obesity Reviews | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 319–326 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25752756 | pmc = 4381543 | doi = 10.1111/obr.12266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical professionals who [[Bariatrics|specialize in the treatment of obesity]] have been found to have strong negative associations toward obese individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teachman BA, Brownell KD | title = Implicit anti-fat bias among health professionals: is anyone immune? | journal = International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders | volume = 25 | issue = 10 | pages = 1525–1531 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11673776 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0801745 | s2cid = 8831521 | doi-access =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stress from obesity-related stigma may also cause negative health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Muennig2008" /&gt;

A 2004 study in  [[preschool]]-aged children reported a preference for average-sized children over overweight children as friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Musher-Eizenman DR, Holub SC, Miller AB, Goldstein SE, Edwards-Leeper L | title = Body size stigmatization in preschool children: the role of control attributions | journal = Journal of Pediatric Psychology | volume = 29 | issue = 8 | pages = 613–620 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15491983 | doi = 10.1093/jpepsy/jsh063 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overweight individuals often found themselves suffering repercussions in many facets of society, including legal and employment issues later in their life.&lt;ref name="PuhlBrownell"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puhl R, Brownell KD | title = Bias, discrimination, and obesity | journal = Obesity Research | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = 788–805 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11743063 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2001.108 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2010 review of published studies, interventions seeking to reduce prejudice and [[social stigma]] against fat and [[obesity]] are largely ineffective.&lt;ref name="Daníelsdóttir_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daníelsdóttir S, O'Brien KS, Ciao A | title = Anti-fat prejudice reduction: a review of published studies | journal = Obesity Facts | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–58 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20215795 | pmc = 6452150 | doi = 10.1159/000277067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical explanations==
In order to understand weight-biased attitudes, theories have been proposed to explain these biases and the subsequent discrimination they cause.  Christian S. Crandall discusses the "Justification of Stigmatization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Stigma| vauthors = Heatherton TF |publisher=Guilford Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1572309425|location=New York London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also his Social Ideology Perspective draws on traditional North American values of [[self-determination]], individualism, and self-discipline. Based on these values, anti-fat attitudes may derive from directing blame for being overweight towards individuals who are overweight.&lt;ref name=":1b"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Puhl RM, Brownell KD |title=Stigma, discrimination, and obesity.|journal=Eating Disorders and Obesity: A Comprehensive Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[attribution theory]] suggests that attitudes towards obese individuals are dependent on how much control they are perceived to have over their weight.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt;  Throughout the literature, numerous studies have shown support for this theory.  One study conducted a multinational examination of weight bias across four countries (Canada, United States, Iceland, and Australia) with comparable obesity rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puhl RM, Latner JD, O'Brien K, Luedicke J, Danielsdottir S, Forhan M | title = A multinational examination of weight bias: predictors of anti-fat attitudes across four countries | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 39 | issue = 7 | pages = 1166–1173 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25809827 | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2015.32 | s2cid = 7917104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study found that attributions of behavioral causes of obesity were associated with greater weight bias. Similarly, viewing obesity as being caused by a lack of willpower was also associated with greater weight bias. There appears to be a decrease in weight bias when weight is attributed to factors that are less within the individual's control, or when individuals are perceived as trying to lose weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beames JR, Black MJ, Vartanian LR | title = Prejudice toward individuals with obesity: Evidence for a pro-effort bias | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology. Applied | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 184–195 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 26866441 | doi = 10.1037/xap0000079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, evidence also exists showing that biases against obese individuals also include disgust towards them, which can persist regardless of if one knows that obesity is not caused by obese individuals' actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vartanian LR | title = Disgust and perceived control in attitudes toward obese people | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 1302–1307 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20195287 | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2010.45 | s2cid = 12304822 | doi-access =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fatphobia does not generally refer to a fear of obese people, but rather a socially constructed phenomenon of particular prevalence in the western world.&lt;ref name = "Scheper-Hughes_1987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheper-Hughes N, Lock MM |title=The Mindful Body: A Prolegomenon to Future Work in Medical Anthropology |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=1987 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=8 |publisher=Wiley, American Anthropological Association|doi=10.1525/maq.1987.1.1.02a00020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People, often said to be living in the west, value healthy and strong bodies that prioritize agility, endurance and fertility&lt;ref name = "Scheper-Hughes_1987" /&gt; - with focus on achievement and individual responsibility.&lt;ref name="Trainer_2022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trainer S, SturtzSreetharan C, Wutich A, Brewis A, Hardin J | title = Fat Is All My Fault: Globalized Metathemes of Body Self-blame | journal = Medical Anthropology Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–26 | date = March 2022 | pmid = 35051296 | doi = 10.1111/maq.12687 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do such bodies associate the western world with similar ideals, but Lloyd deMause suggests the 'fitness/toughness craze' may also reflect preparations for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = deMause L |title=Reagan's America |date=1984 |publisher=New York: Creative Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The overabundace of high caloric, depleted of nutrients and other essential vitamins and minerals and food options more common in the western hemisphere is often associated with people who are against fat phobia.  
The 'fattening huts' of young girls in Nigeria however, represent beauty, marriageability and money – a direct reflection of the value of economic resource and food.&lt;ref name = "Brown_1991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown PJ | title = Culture and the evolution of obesity | journal = Human Nature | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–57 | date = March 1991 | pmid = 24222189 | doi = 10.1007/BF02692180 | publisher = New York: Emory University | s2cid = 37346271 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There, fatness is a welcome sign of health, prosperity and maternity - linked to self-worth and sexuality also.&lt;ref name = "Brown_1991" /&gt;

Fatphobia does not fear 'fat' but prejudice, discrimination, exclusion and preventable disease too - fears directly attributable to the myriad of social, political, historical, economic and cultural processes at work (that do not similarly exist in other cultures).&lt;ref name = "Brown_1991" /&gt; In this way, fatphobia is a culturally-derived phenomenon influencing relationships to food as well to the female form. Trends in 'blame, shame and stigma'&lt;ref name="Trainer_2022" /&gt; have contributed to fat positivity and 'health at every size' movements, that create digital 'safe spaces' for activism and radical fat acceptance that seek to resist/shift such powerful cultural perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kost C, Jamie K | title = "It has literally been a lifesaver": the role of "knowing kinship" in supporting fat women to navigate medical fatphobia. | journal = Fat Studies | date = May 2023 | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 311–324 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group | doi = 10.1080/21604851.2022.2041295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also encompasses those whose [[body shape]] is found to be unacceptable when compared to modern society's perception of the ideal body type (although still within the normal or overweight [[body mass index]] (BMI) range).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0027966 | vauthors = Lerner R, Gellert E |year=1969 |title=Body build identification, preference and aversion in children|journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=1|issue=5 |pages=456–462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fat-shaming is fairly common in the United States, even though most adult Americans are overweight.

Anti-fat bias can be moderated by giving a mitigating context to the individual's appearance of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teachman BA, Gapinski KD, Brownell KD, Rawlins M, Jeyaram S | title = Demonstrations of implicit anti-fat bias: the impact of providing causal information and evoking empathy | journal = Health Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 68–78 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12558204 | doi = 10.1037/0278-6133.22.1.68 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.457.4126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when told an individual was obese because of "[[overeating]]" and "[[Sedentary lifestyle|lack of exercise]]", a higher implicit bias was found among study participants than those not provided with context.  When the group was told that "[[Genetics of obesity|genetics]]" was to blame, they did not exhibit a lowered implicit bias after the explanation.

Anti-fat bias is not a strictly Western cultural phenomenon. Instances of implicit anti-fat bias have been found across several cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crandall CS, D'Anello S, Sakalli N, Lazarus E, Nejtardt GW, Feather NT |year=2001 |title=An attribution-model of prejudice: Anti-fat attitudes in six nations|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=27 |issue=1|pages=30–37 |doi=10.1177/0146167201271003 |s2cid=145687152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weight discrimination==
Weight stigma is present in multiple settings including healthcare, education, interpersonal situations, multiple media forms and outlets, and across many levels of employment.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt;

===In the media===
{{see also|Obesity social stigma in television}}
Media, in general, overrepresents underweight individuals and underrepresents overweight individuals. One-third of women in television are classified as underweight, while only 5% of the general population falls into that category.&lt;ref name="Himes_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Himes SM, Thompson JK | title = Fat stigmatization in television shows and movies: a content analysis | journal = Obesity | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 712–718 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17372322 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2007.635 | s2cid = 33277701 | doi-access =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a study on over a thousand major television characters from 2003 identified 14% of female characters and 24% of male characters to be overweight, despite the real-world percentages being more than double those reported numbers.&lt;ref name="Averill_2017"&gt;{{Cite web| vauthors = Averill L |date=August 2017|title=Fattitude The Movie: Theory and Praxis of Creating a Documentary that Examines Fat Representation and Fat Social Justice |url=https://fau.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fau%3A37996/datastream/OBJ/view/Fattitude_The_Movie__Theory_and_Praxis_of_Creating_a_Documentary_that_Examines_Fat_Representation_and_Fat_Social_Justice.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenberg BS, Eastin M, Hofschire L, Lachlan K, Brownell KD | title = Portrayals of overweight and obese individuals on commercial television | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = 8 | pages = 1342–1348 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12893625 | pmc = 1447967 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.93.8.1342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when overweight people are included in television, they often play minor, stereotyped roles. Nearly two thirds of the most popular children's movies contain negative portrayals of fat people, stereotyping them to be unintelligent, lazy, and evil.&lt;ref name="Averill_2017" /&gt; Fat television characters are more commonly seen eating and are less likely to be involved in romantic relationships compared to average weight television characters.&lt;ref name="Himes_2007" /&gt; Male characters are less commonly portrayed as having close friendships.&lt;ref name="Averill_2017" /&gt;

In 2007, another analysis sampled 135 scenes featuring overweight individuals from popular television programs and movies are coded for anti-fat humor. The majority of anti-fat humor found was verbal and directed at the individual in their presence.&lt;ref name="Himes_2007" /&gt; Additionally, a relationship was found between audience laughter and a male character poking fun at a female character's body, but that same relationship wasn't there when it was a female character ridiculing a fat male.&lt;ref name="Himes_2007" /&gt;

There is a great deal of empirical research to support the idea of [[thin ideal]] media, or the idea that the media tends to glorify and focus on thin actors and actresses, models, and other public figures while avoiding the use of overweight individuals.

Puhl et al. (2009) also reviewed how in entertainment, news reporting, and advertising, media is a particularly potent source of weight stigma. News reports have blamed individuals who are overweight and obese for various societal issues including prices of fuel, global temperature trends, and precipitating weight gain among their peers.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt; The news media repeatedly engages in the "Headless Fatties" phenomenon, coined by [[Charlotte Cooper (author)|Charlotte Cooper]], in which images and videos only depict overweight individuals as bodies by cropping out their heads. This objectification happens in 72% of all news reports on obesity.&lt;ref name="Averill_2017" /&gt;

The [[University of California, Los Angeles]], conducted a study that analyzed scientific research on weight and the news reports on such research. They looked for disparities in language, the cited causes of obesity, and proposed solution. News stories were more likely than the scientific articles to use dramatized language, words such as epidemic, crisis, war, and terrorism, and were more likely to cite individual behaviors as the causes and solutions to obesity, ignoring the systemic issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Saguy AC, Almeling R |date=2008|title=Fat in the Fire? Science, the News Media, and the "Obesity Epidemic"|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20110247|journal=Sociological Forum|volume=23|issue=1|pages=53–83|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.00399.x-i1|jstor=20110247|issn=0884-8971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, prominent nationally syndicated columnist [[Michael Kinsley]] (founding editor of ''Slate'' magazine) wrote, "New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]] cannot be president: He is just too fat ... why should Christie's weight be more than we can bear in a president? Why should it even be a legitimate issue if he runs? One reason is that a presidential candidate should be judged on behavior and character ... Perhaps Christie is the one to help us get our national appetites under control. But it would help if he got his own under control first."&lt;ref name="Kinsley"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-30/requiem-for-a-governor-before-he-s-in-the-ring-michael-kinsley.html| vauthors = Kinsley M |date=September 29, 2011|title=Requiem for a Governor Before He's in the Ring: Michael Kinsley|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|publisher=[[Bloomberg View]]|access-date=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Christie responded on October 4, 2011, stating "The people who pretend to be serious commentators who wrote about this are among the most ignorant I've ever heard in my life.

In 2013, [[Haley Morris-Cafiero]]'s photography project "Wait Watchers", in which she photographed the reactions to her presence by random passers-by, went viral.  ''New York'' magazine wrote, "The frequency with which Morris-Cafiero succeeds at documenting passersby's visible disdain for her body seems pretty depressing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/11/photographer-who-captures-fat-shaming-on-film.html|title=The Photographer Who Captures Fat-Shaming on Camera| vauthors = Schwiegershausen E |work=[[New York (magazine)|The Cut]]|date=November 19, 2014|access-date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In education===
In regards to more direct weight bias, obese individuals were 40–50% more likely to report a perception of major discrimination compared to those of average weight across a multitude of settings.&lt;ref name="Carr_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carr D, Friedman MA | title = Is obesity stigmatizing?

Puhl and colleagues (2009) concluded from their review of weight stigma in education that current trends indicate students with obesity face barriers to educational success at every level of education.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt; Reviewed research demonstrates that educators, particularly physical education teachers, report antifat attitudes toward their students with obesity, which may undermine educational achievement.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt; Importantly, the education disparities for students with obesity appear to be strongest for students attending schools where obesity is not the norm. Several studies have evidenced that in environments such as these, students with obesity face greater educational disadvantages and are less likely to attend college, an effect that is particularly strong among women.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt; Moreover, weight stigma in educational settings also affects interpersonal relationships (see "Interpersonal situations" below).&lt;ref name=":4b" /&gt;

===In employment===
Studies suggest that obese individuals are less likely to be hired and once hired, have greater termination rates than average weight individuals.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vartanian_2013" /&gt;  Specifically, a national survey found that obese individuals were 26% more likely not to be hired, not receive a promotion, or to be fired compared to average weight persons.&lt;ref name="Carr_2005" /&gt;  Such outcomes may be a result of employers viewing them as less agreeable, less competent and lazier than average weight individuals.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vartanian_2013" /&gt;

Weight stigma can lead to difficulty obtaining a job, worse job placement, lower wages and compensation, unjustified denial of promotions, harsher discipline, unfair job termination, and commonplace derogatory jokes and comments from coworkers and supervisors.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt; In their review, Rebecca M. Puhl et al. find that employees with obesity report their weight as the most influential factor contributing to losing their job.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt; Another review by Giel and colleagues (2010) found that certain stereotypes about employees with obesity are highly endorsed by employers and supervisors, in particular that they have poorer job performance and that they lack interpersonal skills, motivation, and self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giel KE, Thiel A, Teufel M, Mayer J, Zipfel S | title = Weight bias in work settings - a qualitative review | journal = Obesity Facts | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–40 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20215793 | pmc = 6452122 | doi = 10.1159/000276992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In politics===
[[File:Chris Christie by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|250px|New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]] is a politician who was subjected to weight-related discrimination during his political career.&lt;ref name="Kinsley" /&gt;]]
A study by [[Michigan State University]] researchers shows evidence that overweight political candidates tend to receive fewer votes than their thinner opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Weight bias plagues U. S. elections |url=https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2014/weight-bias-plagues-us-elections/ |access-date=7 February 2021 |agency=MSUToday |publisher=Michigan State University |date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers analyzed data from the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Senate elections. Using a previously established scientific method, research assistants determined from color photos whether the candidates in 126 primary and general elections were of normal weight, overweight, or obese.

Both obese men and women were often less likely to get on the ballot in the first place. When it came to merely being overweight, women were seen underrepresented on the ballot, though men were not. This is consistent with previous research showing slightly overweight men tend not to experience the same discrimination as slightly overweight women.

However, when it came to the voting, both male and female candidates, whether obese or simply overweight, tend to get a lower share of the vote total than their more slender opponents. Some politicians have resorted to extreme weight loss measures, including surgery, to increase their elect-ability to political office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140519160753.htm|title=Weight bias plagues U.S. elections, study finds|website=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In healthcare===
Medical professionals may be more likely to view obese individuals in negative terms (such as annoying or undisciplined), have less patience with obese individuals, and assume non-compliance with their treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hebl MR, Xu J | title = Weighing the care: physicians' reactions to the size of a patient | journal = International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders | volume = 25 | issue = 8 | pages = 1246–1252 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11477511 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ijo.0801681 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, these individuals may receive poorer care compared to average weight people.

In their 2009 review, Puhl and colleagues found that many studies provide evidence supporting the notion that health professionals (including doctors, nurses, medical students, fitness professional, and dietitians) consistently endorse negative stereotypes about patients with obesity, in particular ascribing to them culpability for their weight status.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt; Weight stigma in the healthcare settings leads to impaired patient-provider communication, poorer doctor-patient relationships, poorer medical care and treatment (for example doctors spending less time with patients), and avoidance of the healthcare system all together on the part of the patient.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt; However, it is important to point out that the evidence that has been reviewed thus far comes primarily from self-report studies. Therefore, Puhl and colleagues concluded that research examining actual health outcomes is needed.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt; Overall, the impact of weight stigma in healthcare has become so problematic that many scholars have suggested that obesity-prevention programs should make minimizing stigma a priority.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacLean L, Edwards N, Garrard M, Sims-Jones N, Clinton K, Ashley L | title = Obesity, stigma and public health planning | journal = Health Promotion International | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 88–93 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19131400 | doi = 10.1093/heapro/dan041 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpersonal situations===
Although a less studied topic than employment and healthcare, several studies reviewed by Puhl and colleagues (2009) provide evidence that overweight and obese women in particular face weight stigma from many interpersonal sources including family, friends, and romantic partners.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt; Another recent review by Puhl and Suh (2015) also documented that in school settings weight-based bullying is one of the most prevalent types of harassment reported by parents, teachers, and students.&lt;ref name="Janssen_2004" /&gt; Experiencing interpersonal weight stigma is related to myriad negative physical and mental health consequences (see "[[#Mental health and psychological consequences|Mental health and psychological consequences]]" below).

In a 2017 study, results showed that 89% of obese adults had been bullied by romantic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Influence of Experienced and Internalized Weight Stigma and Coping on Weight Loss Outcomes among Adults | vauthors = Lenz EM |date=2017 |url=https://opencommons.uconn.edu/dissertations/1556 |journal=Doctoral Dissertations |access-date=2021-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| vauthors = Hobbes M |title=Everything You Know About Obesity Is Wrong|url=https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/everything-you-know-about-obesity-is-wrong/|access-date=2021-09-14|website=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both adults and children with obesity, several reviews of the literature have found that across a variety of studies, there is a consistent relationship between experiencing weight stigma and many negative mental and physical health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1b" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Papadopoulos S, Brennan L | title = Correlates of weight stigma in adults with overweight and obesity: A systematic literature review | journal = Obesity | volume = 23 | issue = 9 | pages = 1743–1760 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26260279 | doi = 10.1002/oby.21187 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puhl R, Suh Y | title = Health Consequences of Weight Stigma: Implications for Obesity Prevention and Treatment | journal = Current Obesity Reports | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 182–190 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26627213 | doi = 10.1007/s13679-015-0153-z | s2cid = 24953213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5c"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puhl R, Suh Y | title = Stigma and eating and weight disorders | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 552 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25652251 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-015-0552-6 | s2cid = 207338325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These will be discussed separately in the sections below, although physical and mental health consequences are often intertwined, in particular those related to eating disorders.

Papadopoulos and Brennan (2015) recently found that across many reviewed studies of weight loss treatment-seeking adults,&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt; relationships emerged between experiencing weight stigma and both BMI and difficulty losing weight.  However the findings are somewhat mixed. They also report evidence that experiencing weight stigma is related to poor medication adherence. Among weight loss treatment-seeking adults, experiencing weight stigma might exacerbate weight- and health-related quality of life issues.&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt; This review along with reviews by Vartanian and Smyth (2013) and Puhl and Suh (2015) have also found that across several studies and in both adults and children, experiencing weight stigma is related to decreased exercise behavior overall, as well as decreased motivation to exercise, decreased exercise [[self-efficacy]], and increased food craving and tendency to overeat.&lt;ref name=":1b" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janssen_2004" /&gt; These effects of weight stigma on exercise and physical activity emerge independent of body mass index, suggesting that weight stigma becomes a unique barrier to physical activity outside of barriers that may be associated with obesity in particular. Finally, across many studies, Puhl and Suh (2015) also found that experiencing weight stigma is related to many physiological consequences as well, including increased [[blood pressure]], augmented [[Glucocorticoid receptor|cortisol]] reactivity, elevated [[oxidative stress]], impaired glycemic control/elevated [[Glycated hemoglobin|HbA&lt;sub&gt;1c&lt;/sub&gt;]], and increased systemic [[inflammation]],&lt;ref name="Janssen_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5c" /&gt; all of which have notable consequences for physical health and disease.

=== Mental health and psychological consequences ===
Broadly speaking, experiencing weight stigma is associated with psychological distress. There are many negative effects connected to anti-fat bias, the most prominent being that societal bias against fat is ineffective at treating obesity, and leads to long-lasting body image issues, eating disorders, suicide, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Gavin GC |title=What's Wrong With 'Fat Shaming?'|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wiring-the-mind/201501/whats-wrong-fat-shaming|website=psychologytoday.com|publisher=Psychology Today|access-date=7 November 2017|date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papadopoulos's 2015 review of the literature found that across several studies, this distress can manifest in [[anxiety]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], lowered [[self-esteem]], and [[substance use disorder]]s, both in weight loss treatment-seeking individuals as well as community samples.&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt; Many empirical reviews have found that weight stigma has clear consequences for individuals suffering from eating and weight disorders (including [[anorexia nervosa]], [[bulimia nervosa]], and [[binge eating disorder]]), as it plays a unique role, over and above other risk factors, in perpetuating disordered eating psychopathology.&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janssen_2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5c" /&gt; These results have emerged in both adult and adolescent, as well as in male and female samples.

== Policy ==
Over the past few decades, many scholars{{who|date=October 2021}} have identified weight stigma as a long-standing form of social stigma and one of the last remaining socially acceptable forms of prejudice.&lt;ref name="Jovančević Jović p=003329412110051"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jovančević A, Jović M | title = The Relation Between Anti-Fat Stereotypes and Anti-Fat Prejudices: The Role of Gender as a Moderator | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 125 | issue = 3 | pages = 1687–1713 | date = June 2022 | pmid = 33789533 | doi = 10.1177/00332941211005123 | publisher = SAGE Publications | s2cid = 232481900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows then that individuals who are targets because of overweight and obesity, still face uniquely socially acceptable discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puhl R, Brownell KD | title = Bias, discrimination, and obesity | journal = Obesity Research | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = 788–805 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11743063 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2001.108 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stunkard AJ, Sørensen TI | title = Obesity and socioeconomic status--a complex relation | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 329 | issue = 14 | pages = 1036–1037 | date = September 1993 | pmid = 8366906 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199309303291411 | author-link1 = Albert Stunkard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil rights legislation such as [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits discrimination based on race and several other domains, but weight is not included in this act. At the local level, only one state in the US ([[Michigan]]) has policy in place for prohibiting weight-related employment discrimination and very few local municipalities have human rights ordinances in place to protect individuals of large body size.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tehran, Elizabeth E. (2005). Legal theory on weight discrimination. In K. Brownell, R. Puhl, M. Schwartz, &amp; L. Rudd (Eds.), ''Weight bias: nature, consequences, and'' remedies'' (pp. 195–211). New York, NY.''&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, localities that have passed legislation explicitly prohibiting weight-based discrimination include the state of Michigan; San Francisco and Santa Cruz in California; Washington, DC; Urbana, Illinois; Binghamton, New York; New York City, New York (in employment, housing, and public accommodations),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/364-23/mayor-adams-signs-legislation-prohibit-height-weight-discrimination-employment-housing-|title=Mayor Adams Signs Legislation To Prohibit Height Or Weight Discrimination In Employment, Housing, An|date=May 26, 2023|website=The official website of the City of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Madison, Wisconsin. Typically, the only of type of legislation that overweight and obese individuals can cite in lawsuits is related to disability. For example, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] is one such avenue, but as Puhl et al. (2009) report, it is difficult for many individuals with obesity to qualify as disabled according to the criteria included in this statute.&lt;ref name="Puhl_2009" /&gt; Few cases have been successful and most of these successes have occurred since 2009, after Congress passed the [[ADA Amendments Act of 2008]], which expanded the definitions of disability to include "severe obesity" (but not moderate obesity, overweight or underweight) as an impairment. However, in 2012, the US [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) successfully settled 2 cases for employees who were terminated from their jobs because their employers regarded them to be disabled based on their obesity and their severe obesity was now a covered disability under the new amendment. Despite these few recent successes, not all weight discrimination occurs in the context of disability or perceived disability, and legal remedies that can directly address weight discrimination as a legitimate social injustice remain absent.&lt;ref name=:Puhl2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puhl RM, Latner JD, O'Brien KS, Luedicke J, Danielsdottir S, Salas XR | title = Potential Policies and Laws to Prohibit Weight Discrimination: Public Views from 4 Countries | journal = The Milbank Quarterly | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 691–731 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26626983 | pmc = 4678937 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0009.12162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public health ==
The existing literature largely does not support the notion that weight stigma might encourage weight loss; as cited above, experiencing weight stigma (both interpersonally as well as exposure to stigmatizing media campaigns) is consistently related to a lack of motivation to exercise and a propensity to overeat.&lt;ref name=":1b" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Janssen_2004" /&gt; In a 2010 review examining whether weight stigma is an appropriate public health tool for treating and preventing overweight and obesity, Puhl and Heuer concluded that stigmatizing individuals with obesity is detrimental in three important ways: (1) it threatens actual physical health, (2) it perpetuates health disparities, and (3) it actually undermines obesity treatment and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref name="Puhl"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Puhl RM, Heuer CA | title = Obesity stigma: important considerations for public health | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 100 | issue = 6 | pages = 1019–1028 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20075322 | pmc = 2866597 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2009.159491 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this, another recent review of the consequences of experiencing weight stigma, this one conducted by Puhl and Suh (2015), concluded that considering the myriad negative physical and mental health consequences associated with experiencing weight stigma, it should be a target, instead of a tool, in obesity prevention and treatment.&lt;ref name="Janssen_2004" /&gt; These authors further recommend that a necessary first step in reducing weight stigma is raising broader awareness of its negative consequences.&lt;ref name="Janssen_2004" /&gt;

== Race ==
With higher representation of black people being categorized as overweight by the BMI, the social stigma of obesity disproportionately affects black people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ogden CL, Carroll MD, Kit BK, Flegal KM | title = Prevalence of childhood and adult obesity in the United States, 2011-2012 | journal = JAMA | volume = 311 | issue = 8 | pages = 806–814 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24570244 | pmc = 4770258 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2014.732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80% of African American women are categorized as overweight using the Body Mass Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hart EA, Sbrocco T, Carter MM | title = Ethnic Identity and Implicit Anti-fat Bias: Similarities and Differences between African American and Caucasian Women | journal = Ethnicity &amp; Disease | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–76 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26843798 | pmc = 4738857 | doi = 10.18865/ed.26.1.69 | doi-broken-date = 1 November 2024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Sabrina Strings writes, in her book ''[[Fearing the Black Body]]'', about the historical ways in which fatphobia emerged out of an attempt by white people to distance themselves from black people. In 1751, [[Denis Diderot]] published the ''Encyclopédie'', which was the first publications to claim that black people were "fond of gluttony."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | vauthors = Strings S, Johnson A |title=Fearing the Black Body |date=2020 |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1251720412 |publisher=Tantor Media, Inc |oclc=1251720412 |access-date=2022-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, French aristocrat [[Arthur de Gobineau]] claimed, about black people, that their "gluttonous nature to be one of their more base characteristics."&lt;ref name="Strings_2019"&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Strings S |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1050457278 |title=Fearing the black body : the racial origins of fat phobia |date=2019 |isbn=978-1-4798-8675-3 |location=New York | publisher = New York University Press |oclc=1050457278}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, [[Charles Davenport]] founded the [[Eugenics Record Office|Eugenic Record Office]], and he claimed that "obesity was a vile condition to be avoided. It was, moreover, racially inherited."&lt;ref name="Strings_2019" /&gt; [[Eugenics]] sentiment toward black people regarding their size was prevalent.

Black bodies are already stigmatized, which can result in violence when interacting with the social stigma of obesity. In a 2017 article published in the [[African American Review]], one author cited the killing of [[Killing of Eric Garner|Eric Garner]] as an example of this, as some excuses for using excessive force on Garner were his size, as he was an overweight man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2017-06-22 |title=Unvictimizable: Toward a Fat Black Disability Studies. |url=https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&amp;sw=w&amp;issn=10624783&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA675550747&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;linkaccess=abs |journal=African American Review |language=English |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=105–123|doi=10.1353/afa.2017.0016 |s2cid=149222407 | vauthors = Mollow A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article explains how [[ableism]], fatphobia, and racism interact to form a "double bind" in which violence is excused because fatness is already causing inherent injury, but necessary because the size of a large black person is a threat.

Nonetheless, results additionally demonstrated that different racial groups had differing ways of internalizing and coping with weight and health-related stigmas, which as a result heightened health risks.{{clarify|reason=unclear if having a difference between two groups means that both groups have heightened health risks, and unclear what the specific health risks are|date=May 2022}} Results revealed that white women and men reported higher weight bias internalization in comparison to black women and men. Additionally, Hispanic women demonstrated to cope with weight stigma via disordered eating patterns more than black and white women. The results of this research article highlighted the importance of needing to increase research and policy attention to addressing weight and health-related stigma as an issue regarding prevention and treatment for obesity in order to consequently decrease weight-driven inequalities in communities and differing groups, primarily focused on race and gender.

=== Fat acceptance movement and organizations===
{{main|Fat acceptance movement}}

The fat acceptance social movement in the USA emerged in the 1960s to highlight and counter  social stigma and discrimination faced in a range of domains. Besides its political role, for example in the form of [[Anti-fatphobia NGOs in the United States|anti-discrimination NGOs]] and activism, the fat acceptance movement also constitutes a subculture which acts as a social group for its members.&lt;ref name="Rothblum and Sondra Solovay 2009 xi"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wann M | veditors = Rothblum E, Solovay S |title=The Fat Studies Reader |chapter=Foreword: Fat Studies: An Invitation to Revolution |year=2009 |publisher=New York University Press |isbn=9780814776407 |page=xi |url=https://archive.org/details/fatstudiesreader0000roth |url-access=registration |access-date=14 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language and identity ===
The fat acceptance movement often uses the adjective "fat" and neologisms like "[[wikt:infinifat|infinifat]]" as a [[reclaimed word]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zoller |first1=Charlotte |title=What Terms Like "Superfat" and "Small Fat" Mean, and How They Are Used |url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/superfat-small-fat-how-they-are-used |publisher=Teenvogue |access-date=27 August 2008 |date=6 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferences regarding terminology and descriptions vary, however, with common disagreements revolving around which words to use (e.g. "fat", "overweight", "obese"/"obesity", "of size"), the use of [[person-first language]] (e.g. "a person with obesity"), the use of medicalized terminology, and the avoidance of stigma.

====Person-first language====
[[Person-first language]], which emerged from some [[disability advocacy]] groups, has the ostensible goal of treating a person independently of a trait. However, it also has the consequence of treating that trait as "toxic" abnormality which should be "fixed" to achieve normalcy, and which due to its inherent negativity must be talked about in a special, careful way, rather than used as a simple "benign" descriptor.&lt;ref name="Meadows 1527"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meadows A, Daníelsdóttir S | title = What's in a Word? On Weight Stigma and Terminology | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 7 | pages = 1527 | date = 2016-10-05 | pmid = 27761122 | pmc = 5051141 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01527 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics believe that because such a formulation necessarily begins from the assumption that there is something wrong with being overweight, it contributes to further stigma.&lt;ref name="Meadows 1527"/&gt; Furthermore, person-first language can contribute to the [[medicalization]] of obesity, as this is the language commonly used when referring to disease. This may explain why person-first language is favored more often by those working in the obesity field (and therefore seeking medical "fixes") than by other groups. Advocacy groups have criticized a top-down approach whereby proponents of person-first language claim to speak for all, whereas in reality it is not the preferred terminology of many in the fat-acceptance movement.&lt;ref name="Meadows 1527"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=NAAFA |title=ASK PEOPLE FIRST About People First Language |url=https://www.prlog.org/12465686-ask-people-first-about-people-first-language.html |website=prlog.org |access-date=27 August 2023 |ref=peoplefirstPR |date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Descriptions and terminology====
Various studies of overweight people seeking [[weight loss]] as well as a semantics study of  terminology used to describe an overweight individual concluded that using the word fat elicits a negative reaction from people already critical of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Brochu PM, Esses VM |date=August 2011 |title=What's in a Name?

"Fat" is the preferred term within the fat acceptance movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | vauthors = Harker Y |date= 2015|title= Fat Rights and Fat Discrimination: An Annotated Bibliography|publisher=CUNY School of Law|url= https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1095&amp;context=cl_pubs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fat activists have reclaimed the term as a neutral descriptor in order to work against the stigma typically associated with the term.&lt;ref name="Meadows 1527"/&gt; In fact, many fat activists will censor the word "obesity" when tweeting or citing it as "ob*sity" due to its pathologizing nature.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}} The word "obesity" directly stems from the Latin word "obesus" which means "that has eaten itself fat".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=obesity {{!}} Etymology, origin and meaning of obesity by etymonline |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/obesity |access-date=2022-04-19 |website=www.etymonline.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fat activists will also use this Latin definition to show stigma in the word "obese" itself, as it places blame on the individual for their state.&lt;ref name="Gordon_2021"&gt;{{Cite web | vauthors = Gordon A |date=2021-05-28 |title='Fat' Isn't a Bad Word—It's Just the Way I Describe My Body |url=https://www.self.com/story/fat-isnt-bad-word |access-date=2022-03-30 |website=SELF |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
