The '''social stigma of obesity''' or '''fatphobia''' has caused difficulties and disadvantages for [[overweight]] and [[obesity|obese]] people. '''Weight stigma''' is similar and has been broadly defined as [[bias]] or [[discrimination|discriminatory]] behaviors targeted at individuals because of their weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Psychosocial origins of obesity stigma: toward changing a powerful and pervasive bias|journal = Obesity Reviews|date = 2003-11-01|issn = 1467-789X|pages = 213–227|volume = 4|issue = 4|doi = 10.1046/j.1467-789X.2003.00122.x|pmid = 14649372|first1 = Rebecca M.|last1 = Puhl|first2 = Kelly D.|last2 = Brownell|s2cid = 31481832|authorlink2=Kelly D.

Anti-fat bias refers to the [[prejudice|prejudicial]] assumption of personality characteristics based on an assessment of a person as being overweight or obese. It is also known as "'''fat shaming'''". [[fat acceptance movement|Fat activists]] allege anti-fat bias can be found in many facets of society,&lt;ref name="PuhlBrownell" /&gt; and blame the media for the pervasiveness of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=UFM&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/10640260802115852| pmid = 18568920| title = Internalization of the Ultra-Thin Ideal: Positive Implicit Associations with Underweight Fashion Models are Associated with Drive for Thinness in Young Women| journal = Eating Disorders| volume = 16| issue = 4| pages = 294–307| year = 2008| last1 = Ahern | first1 = A.

==Prevalence==
Research indicates that self-reported incidents of weight-based [[discrimination]] have increased in the last few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changes in Perceived Weight Discrimination Among Americans, 1995–1996 Through 2004–2006|journal = Obesity|date = 2008-05-01|issn = 1930-739X|pages = 1129–1134|volume = 16|issue = 5|doi = 10.1038/oby.2008.35|pmid = 18356847|first1 = Tatiana|last1 = Andreyeva|first2 = Rebecca M.|last2 = Puhl|first3 = Kelly D.|last3 = Brownell|citeseerx = 10.1.1.175.3676|s2cid = 15323829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who are subjected to weight-related stigma appear to be rated more negatively when compared with other groups, such as [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], and those with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Primum Non Nocere: Obesity Stigma and Public Health|journal = Journal of Bioethical Inquiry|date = 2013-01-04|issn = 1176-7529|pages = 49–57|volume = 10|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11673-012-9412-9|pmid = 23288439|first1 = Lenny R.|last1 = Vartanian|first2 = Joshua M.|last2 = Smyth|s2cid = 8752139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-fat bias has been observed in groups hoping to become physical education instructors. In one study, a group of 344 psychology or [[physical education]] majors at a New Zealand University were compared, and it was found that the prospective physical education teachers were more likely to display implicit anti-fat attitudes than the psychology majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803398|last1=O'Brien|first1=K.S.|first2=J.A.|last2=Hunter|first3=M.|last3=Banks|year=2007

A number of studies have found that health care providers frequently have explicit and/or implicit biases against overweight people, and it has been found that overweight patients may receive lower quality care as a result of their weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phelan|first1=S.

In one study, [[preschool]]-aged children reported a preference for average-sized children over overweight children as friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/jpepsy/jsh063|last1=Musher-Eizenman|first1=D.|first2=S.|last2=Holub|first3=A.|last3=Miller|first4=S.|last4=Goldstein|first5=L.|last5=Edwards-Leeper|year=2004|title=Body size stigmatization in preschool children: The role of control attributions|journal=Journal of Pediatric Psychology|volume=29|issue=8|pages=613–620|pmid=15491983|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of anti-fat bias, overweight individuals often find themselves suffering repercussions in many facets of society, including legal and employment issues later in their life.&lt;ref name="PuhlBrownell"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/oby.2001.108|last1=Puhl|first1=R.|first2=K.|last2=Brownell|year=2001|title=Bias, discrimination, and obesity|journal=Obesity Research|volume=9|issue=12|pages=788–805|pmid=11743063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overweight individuals also find themselves facing issues caused by increased weight such as decreased lifespan, joint problems, and shortness of breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/effects/index.html | title=The Health Effects of Overweight and Obesity &amp;#124; Healthy Weight &amp;#124; CDC| date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2010 review of published studies, interventions seeking to reduce prejudice and [[social stigma]] against fat and [[obesity]] are largely ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Daníelsdóttir S, O’Brien KS, Ciao A.

==Characteristics==
Weight-related stigma can be characterized by the following aspects: 
# An individual does not have to be overweight or obese to experience weight-related stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Carr|first1=Deborah|last2=Friedman|first2=Michael A.|date=2005-09-01|title=Is Obesity Stigmatizing? Body Weight, Perceived Discrimination, and Psychological Well-Being in the United States|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=46|issue=3|pages=244–259|doi=10.1177/002214650504600303|issn=0022-1465|pmid=16259147|citeseerx=10.1.1.407.990|s2cid=8396227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Studies have indicated that experiencing weight stigma reinforces lifestyle behaviors that contribute to obesity.&lt;ref name="Puhl"/&gt;
# Many groups who are subjected to stigmatisation tend to be minorities. Overweight and obese individuals make up the majority of the population in the United States and in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ogden|first1=Cynthia L|last2=Carroll|first2=Margaret D|last3=Kit|first3=Brian K|last4=Flegal|first4=Katherine M|title=Prevalence of childhood and adult obesity in the United States, 2011-2012.|journal=JAMA|date=26 February 2014|volume=311|issue=8|pages=806–14|pmid=24570244|doi=10.1001/jama.2014.732|pmc=4770258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Individuals who are overweight or obese tend to devalue their own in-group and prefer the out-group (i.e. thinner individuals).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Weighing obesity stigma: the relative strength of different forms of bias|journal = International Journal of Obesity|date = 2008-04-15|issn = 0307-0565|pages = 1145–1152|volume = 32|issue = 7|doi = 10.1038/ijo.2008.53|pmid = 18414421|first1 = Janet D.|last1 = Latner|first2 = Kerry S.|last2 = O'Brien|first3 = Laura E.|last3 = Durso|first4 = L. A.|last4 = Brinkman|first5 = T.|last5 = MacDonald|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical explanations==
In order to understand weight-biased attitudes, theories have been proposed to explain the discrimination.  Christian S. Crandall discusses the "Justification of Stigmatization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Stigma|last=Heatherton|first=Todd F.|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1572309425|location=New York London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in his Social Ideology Perspective draws on traditional North American values of self-determination, individualism and self-discipline. Based on these values, anti-fat attitudes may derive from directing blame towards individuals who are overweight.&lt;ref name=":1b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Puhl|first1=R.M.|last2=Brownell|first2=K.D.|title=Stigma, discrimination, and obesity.|journal=Eating Disorders and Obesity: A Comprehensive Handbook|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[attribution theory]] suggests that attitudes towards obese individuals are dependent on how much control they are perceived to have over their weight.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Throughout the literature, numerous studies have shown support for this theory.  One study conducted a multinational examination of weight bias across four countries (Canada, United States, Iceland, and Australia) with comparable obesity rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A multinational examination of weight bias: Predictor of anti-fat attitudes across four countries|journal=International Journal of Obesity|volume=39|issue=7|pages=1166–1173|doi=10.1038/ijo.2015.32 |pmid=25809827|year=2015|last1=Puhl|first1=R. M.|last2=Latner|first2=J. D.|last3=O'Brien|first3=K.|last4=Luedicke|first4=J.|last5=Danielsdottir|first5=S.|last6=Forhan|first6=M.|s2cid=7917104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study found that attributions of behavioral causes of obesity were associated with greater weight bias.  Further, these individuals were more likely to view obesity as being due to a lack of willpower.  There appears to be decreased weight bias when weight was attributed to factors that were less within the individual's control, or when individuals are perceived as trying to lose weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Beames|first1=Joanne R.|last2=Black|first2=Melissa J.|last3=Vartanian|first3=Lenny R.|title=Prejudice toward individuals with obesity: Evidence for a pro-effort bias.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|volume=22|issue=2|pages=184–195|doi=10.1037/xap0000079|pmid=26866441|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trait attribution==
Anti-fat bias leads people to associate individuals who are overweight or obese with negative personality traits such as "lazy", "gluttonous", "stupid", "smelly", "slow", or "unmotivated"{{cn|date=September 2020}}. This bias is not restricted to [[clinically obese]] individuals, but also encompasses those whose [[body shape]] is in some way found unacceptable according to society's modern standards (although still within the normal or [[overweight]] [[Body mass index|BMI]] range).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/h0027966 |last1=Lerner|first1=R. |first2=E.|last2=Gellert |year=1969 |title=Body build identification, preference and aversion in children|journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=1|issue=5 |pages=456–462}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fat-shaming is fairly common in the United States, even though most adult Americans are overweight. ''Huffington Post'' wrote "two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese. Yet overweight and obese individuals are subject to discrimination from employers, healthcare professionals and potential romantic partners".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = LOOK: The Bravest Woman We've Met This Week|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/07/haley-morris-cafiero-photographer-wait-watchers-fat-acceptance-weight-stigma_n_2631439.html |newspaper = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-11-11|date = 2013-02-07 |last1 = Bahadur |first1 = Nina }}{{Unreliable source?|reason=Opinion piece.|date=September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Anti-fat bias can be moderated by giving a mitigating context to the individual's appearance of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.22.1.68 |last1=Teachman|first1=B.A. |first2=K.D.|last2=Gapinski |first3=K.D.|last3=Brownell |first4=M.|last4=Rawlins |first5=S.|last5=Jeyaram |year=2003 |title=Demonstrations of implicit anti-fat bias: The impact of providing causal information and evoking empathy|journal=Health Psychology |volume=22|issue=1 |pages=68–78 |pmid=12558204|citeseerx=10.1.1.457.4126}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when told an individual was obese because of "[[overeating]]" and "[[Sedentary lifestyle|lack of exercise]]", a higher implicit bias was found among study participants than those not provided with context.  When the group was told that "[[Genetics of obesity|genetics]]" was to blame, they did not exhibit a lowered implicit bias after the explanation.

Anti-fat bias is not a strictly Western cultural phenomenon. Instances of implicit anti-fat bias have been found across several cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crandall|first1=C. |first2=S.|last2=D'Anello |first3=N.|last3=Sakalli |first4=E.|last4=Lazarus |first5=G.|last5=Nejtardt |first6=N.|last6=Feather |year=2001 |title=An attribution-model of prejudice: Anti-fat attitudes in six nations|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=27 |issue=1|pages=30–37 |doi=10.1177/0146167201271003 |s2cid=145687152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer research suggests that the stereotypical traits and attributions are [[Post hoc ergo propter hoc|''post hoc'' justifications]] for the expression of prejudice against obese people. That is, a person first experiences involuntary feelings of disgust and aversion when seeing an obese person, and then the person tries to figure out a "rational" reason for these feelings.  The person attributes negative characteristics, such as deciding that obese people are lazy or ignorant, to justify or explain the negative feelings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

Additionally, recent work around physical appearance issues, [[body image]], and anti-fat or obesity prejudice suggests that feelings about one's own appearance may stimulate downward physical comparisons with obese individuals in order to make one feel better about one's own physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Brien | first1 = KS | last2 = Hunter | first2 = JA | last3 = Halberstadt | first3 = J | last4 = Anderson | first4 = J | year = 2007 | title = Body image and explicit and implicit anti-fat attitudes: The mediating role of physical appearance comparisons | url = | journal = Body Image | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 249–256 | doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2007.06.001| pmid = 18089271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Brien | first1 = KS | last2 = Caputi | first2 = P | last3 = Minto | first3 = R | last4 = Peoples | first4 = G | last5 = Hooper | first5 = C | last6 = Kell | first6 = S |display-authors=etal | year = 2009 | title = Upward and Downward Physical Appearance-Related Comparisons: Development of a Measure and Examination of Predictive Qualities | url = | journal = Body Image | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 201–206 | doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2009.03.003| pmid = 19447692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weight discrimination==
Weight stigma is present in multiple settings including healthcare, education, interpersonal situations, multiple media forms and outlets, and across many levels of employment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===In the media===
{{refimprove|date=September 2020}}
Media, in general, underrepresents overweight individuals and when these roles are present, they are often minor, stereotyped roles. They are more commonly seen eating, and are less likely to be involved in a romantic relationship compared to the average weight television character.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The media is often blamed for the strong negative trait associations that society has toward overweight individuals. There is a great deal of empirical research to support the idea of [[The Thin Ideal|Thin Ideal]] media, or the idea that the media tends to glorify and focus on thin actors and actresses, models, and other public figures while avoiding the use of overweight individuals.

Representation of overweight individuals in [[prime time]] programming is not representative of the actual proportion in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2105/AJPH.93.8.1342|last1=Greenberg|first1=B.|first2=M.|last2=Eastin|first3=L.|last3=Hofschire|first4=K.
|last4=Lachlan|first5=K.|last5=Brownell|year=2003|title=Portrayals of Overweight and Obese Individuals on Commercial Television|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=8|pages=1342–1348|pmid=12893625|pmc=1447967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 14% of females and 24% of males featured in the top ten prime-time fictional programs of 2003 were overweight. Those that were shown had few romantic interactions, rarely shared affection with other characters, and were frequently shown consuming food.

In 2007, another analysis sampled 135 scenes featuring overweight individuals from popular television programs and movies and coded for anti-fat humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/oby.2007.635|pmid=17372322|last1=Himes|first1=S.M.|first2=J.K.|last2=Thompson|year=2007|title=Fat stigmatization in television shows and movies: A content analysis|journal=Obesity|volume=15|issue=3|pages=712–719|s2cid=33277701}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of anti-fat humor found was verbal and directed at the individual in their presence.

Puhl et al. (2009) also reviewed how in entertainment, news reporting, and advertising, media is a particularly potent source of weight stigma. News reports have blamed individuals with overweight and obesity for various societal issues including prices of fuel, global temperature trends, and precipitating weight gain among their peers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The literature also documents how in television programs, actors with overweight and obesity are often cast in minor roles, if at all. Programs also often depict them as the targets of teasing and derogation and often portray heavy characters displaying eating behaviors stereotypical to overweight and obesity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This relatively low social status assigned to characters with overweight and obesity in television is also evidenced in children's television, a tendency that perpetuates antifat attitudes among viewers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In terms of media attention for obesity itself, a recent review by Puhl and Suh (2015) revealed that obesity-related media campaigns that used stigmatizing messages, in fact, undermine motivations and intentions to pursue healthy eating and exercise behaviors.&lt;ref name=":4b" /&gt;

On September 29, 2011, prominent nationally syndicated columnist [[Michael Kinsley]] (founding editor of ''Slate'' magazine) wrote, "New Jersey Governor Chris Christie cannot be president: He is just too fat ... why should Christie's weight be more than we can bear in a president? Why should it even be a legitimate issue if he runs? One reason is that a presidential candidate should be judged on behavior and character ... Perhaps Christie is the one to help us get our national appetites under control. But it would help if he got his own under control first."&lt;ref name="Kinsley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-30/requiem-for-a-governor-before-he-s-in-the-ring-michael-kinsley.html|first=Michael|last=Kinsley|date=September 29, 2011|title=Requiem for a Governor Before He's in the Ring: Michael Kinsley|publisher=[[Bloomberg View]]|accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Christie responded on October 4, 2011, stating "The people who pretend to be serious commentators who wrote about this are among the most ignorant I've ever heard in my life. To say that, because you’re overweight, you are therefore undisciplined—you know, I don't think undisciplined people get to achieve great positions in our society, so that kind of stuff is just ignorant."&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/us/politics/christie-says-jokes-are-ok-but-not-political-debate-on-weight.html|first=Chris|last=Christie|date=October 4, 2011|title=Pundits Pack Meaner Punch Than Comedians' Fat Jokes|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Haley Morris-Cafiero]]'s photography project "Wait Watchers", in which she photographed the reactions to her presence by random passers-by, went viral.  ''New York'' magazine wrote, "The frequency with which Morris-Cafiero succeeds at documenting passersby's visible disdain for her body seems pretty depressing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/11/photographer-who-captures-fat-shaming-on-film.html|title=The Photographer Who Captures Fat-Shaming on Camera|last=Schwiegershausen|first=Erica|work=[[New York (magazine)|The Cut]]|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that especially young adults and adolescents experience weight stigma on social media. For example, a study suggests that adolescent patients with obesity experience derogatory comments about weight and visual self-presentation in their online social networks. The study found that this was particularly evident among girls and that it not only referred to presenting their bodies but also included not wanting to present food items associated with obesity such as junk food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Holmberg|first1=Christopher|last2=Berg|first2=Christina|last3=Hillman|first3=Thomas| last4=Lissner|first4=Lauren|last5=Chaplin|first5=John E.|date=2018-10-16|title= Self-presentation in digital media among adolescent patients with obesity: Striving for integrity, risk-reduction, and social recognition|journal=Digital Health|volume=4|pages=205520761880760|doi=10.1177/2055207618807603|pmid=30349733|pmc=6195003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puhl and colleagues (2009) concluded from their review of weight stigma in education that this area still warrants further investigation, but that current trends indicate that students with overweight and obesity face barriers to educational success at every level of education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reviewed research demonstrates that educators, particularly Physical Education teachers, report antifat attitudes toward their students with overweight and obesity, which may undermine educational achievement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Importantly, the education disparities for students with overweight and obesity appear to be strongest for students attending schools where obesity is not the norm. Several studies have evidenced that in environments such as these, students with overweight and obesity face greater educational disadvantages and are less likely to attend college, an effect that is particularly strong among women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, weight stigma in educational settings also affects interpersonal relationships (see "Interpersonal situations" below).&lt;ref name=":4b" /&gt;

===In employment===
{{refimprove|date=September 2020}}
Studies suggest that obese individuals are less likely to be hired and once hired, have greater termination rates than average weight individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Specifically, a national survey found that obese individuals were 26% more likely not to be hired, not receive a promotion, or to be fired compared to average weight persons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Such outcomes may be a result of employers viewing them as less agreeable, less competent and lazier than average weight individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Weight stigma leads to difficulty obtaining a job, worse job placement, lower wages and compensation, unjustified denial of promotions, harsher discipline, unfair job termination, and commonplace derogatory jokes and comments from coworkers and supervisors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In their review, Rebecca M. Puhl et al. find that employees with overweight and obesity report their weight as the most influential factor contributing to losing their job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another review by Giel and colleagues (2010) found that certain stereotypes about employees with overweight and obesity are highly endorsed by employers and supervisors, in particular that they have poorer job performance and that they lack interpersonal skills, motivation, and self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Weight Bias in Work Settings – a Qualitative Review|journal = Obesity Facts|pages = 33–40|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1159/000276992|pmid = 20215793|first1 = Katrin Elisabeth|last1 = Giel|first2 = Ansgar|last2 = Thiel|first3 = Martin|last3 = Teufel|first4 = Jochen|last4 = Mayer|first5 = Stephan|last5 = Zipfel|date = March 2010|pmc = 6452122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In politics===
[[File:Chris Christie by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|250px|New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]] is a politician who may have suffered from weight-related discrimination at times during his political career.]]
A study by [[Michigan State University]] researchers shows evidence that overweight political candidates tend to receive fewer votes than their thinner opponents{{cn|date=September 2020}}. The researchers analyzed data from the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Senate elections. Using a previously established scientific method, research assistants determined from color photos whether the candidates in 126 primary and general elections were of normal weight, overweight, or obese.

Both obese men and women were often less likely to get on the ballot in the first place. When it came to merely being overweight, women were seen underrepresented on the ballot, though men were not. This is consistent with previous research showing men who are slightly heavy tend not to experience the same discrimination as slightly overweight women. {{cn|date=September 2020}}

However, when it came to the voting, both male and female candidates, whether obese or simply overweight, tend to get a lower share of the vote total than their more slender opponents. Some politicians have resorted to extreme weight loss measures, including surgery, to increase their elect-ability to political office.

===In healthcare===
Medical professionals may be more likely to view obese individuals in negative terms such as weak willed, unsuccessful, hopeless, and non-compliant with their treatments {{cn|date=September 2020}}. As such, these individuals may receive poorer care compared to average weight people. Doctors have reported less intervention and an avoidance of weight-related discussion with obese patients.  Additionally, nurses have reported a reluctance to touch obese persons during treatment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  A national survey found that individuals who were overweight reported a three times higher likelihood to be denied medical care than average weight people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Further, health professionals who specialize in obesity showed strong implicit and explicit anti-fat bias as measured by self-report and the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Associations Test]] (IAT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=Marlene B.|last2=Chambliss|first2=Heather O'Neal|last3=Brownell|first3=Kelly D.|last4=Blair|first4=Steven N.|last5=Billington|first5=Charles|date=2003-09-01|title=Weight Bias among Health Professionals Specializing in Obesity|journal=Obesity Research|language=en|volume=11|issue=9|pages=1033–1039|doi=10.1038/oby.2003.142|issn=1550-8528|pmid=12972672}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, such biases were mixed amongst dietitians and nutritionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jung|first1=Franziska U.

In their 2009 review, Puhl and colleagues found that many studies provide evidence supporting the notion that health professionals (including doctors, nurses, medical students, fitness professional, and dietitians) consistently endorse negative stereotypes about patients with overweight and obesity, in particular ascribing to them culpability for their weight status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Weight stigma in the healthcare settings leads to impaired patient-provider communication, poorer doctor-patient relationships, poorer medical care and treatment (for example doctors spending less time with patients), and avoidance of the healthcare system all together on the part of the patient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, it is important to point out that the evidence that has been reviewed thus far comes primarily from self-report studies. Therefore, Puhl and colleagues concluded that research examining actual health outcomes is needed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Overall, the impact of weight stigma in healthcare has become so problematic that many scholars have suggested that obesity-prevention programs should make minimizing stigma a priority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Obesity, stigma and public health planning|url = http://heapro.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/1/88|journal = Health Promotion International|date = 2009-03-01|issn = 0957-4824|pmid = 19131400|pages = 88–93|volume = 24|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/heapro/dan041|first1 = Lynne|last1 = MacLean|first2 = Nancy|last2 = Edwards|first3 = Michael|last3 = Garrard|first4 = Nicki|last4 = Sims-Jones|first5 = Kathryn|last5 = Clinton|first6 = Lisa|last6 = Ashley|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpersonal situations===
{{refimprove|date=September 2020}}
Although a less studied topic than employment and healthcare, several studies reviewed by Puhl and colleagues (2009) provide evidence that overweight and obese women in particular face weight stigma from many interpersonal sources including family, friends, and romantic partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another recent review by Puhl and Suh (2015) also documented that in school settings weight-based bullying is one of the most prevalent types of harassment reported by parents, teachers, and students.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Experiencing interpersonal weight stigma is related to myriad negative physical and mental health consequences (see "[[#Mental health and psychological consequences|Mental health and psychological consequences]]" below).

===In early development===
This external stigmatization and its internalized effects have been examined across different age groups. Overweight and obese children and adolescents experience stigmatization from parents, teachers, and peers.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Puhl|first1=Rebecca M.|last2=Latner|first2=Janet D.|title=Stigma, obesity, and the health of the nation's children.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=133|issue=4|pages=557–580|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.4.557|pmid=17592956|year=2007|citeseerx=10.1.1.175.4474}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer stigmatization, especially, may be difficult for overweight adolescents considering the role of peer support in promoting identity development and self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Janssen|first1=Ian|last2=Craig|first2=Wendy M.|last3=Boyce|first3=William F.|last4=Pickett|first4=William|date=2004-05-01|title=Associations between overweight and obesity with bullying behaviors in school-aged children|journal=Pediatrics|volume=113|issue=5|pages=1187–1194|issn=1098-4275|pmid=15121928|doi=10.1542/peds.113.5.1187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research suggests that negative attitudes about being overweight are even held by overweight and obese children themselves. Specifically, weight bias may become internalized and increases throughout childhood. It then decreases and levels-off during late adolescence and adulthood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Weight-based teasing in childhood and adolescence has been associated with a variety of damages to psychosocial health, including reduced [[self-esteem]] and lower [[self-concept]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Davison|first1=Kirsten Krahnstoever|last2=Birch|first2=Leann Lipps|authorlink2=Leann Birch|title=Processes linking weight status and self-concept among girls from ages 5 to 7 years.|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=38|issue=5|pages=735–748|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.38.5.735|pmid=12220051|pmc=2530914|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher rates of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Associations of weight-based teasing and emotional well-being among adolescents|journal=Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine|volume=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Russell-Mayhew|first1=Shelly|last2=McVey|first2=Gail|last3=Bardick|first3=Angela|last4=Ireland|first4=Alana|date=2012-06-24|title=Mental Health, Wellness, and Childhood Overweight/Obesity|journal=Journal of Obesity|language=en|volume=2012|pages=281801|doi=10.1155/2012/281801|pmid=22778915|pmc=3388583|issn=2090-0708}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Keery|first1=Helene|last2=Boutelle|first2=Kerri|last3=Berg|first3=Patricia van den|last4=Thompson|first4=J.

A survey of 7,266 children aged 11 to 16 conducted by the [[World Health Organization]] reported higher rates of physical victimization (e.g., being shoved) with increasing body mass index among girls. Additionally, these results showed relational victimization (i.e., being excluded or having rumors spread about you) was reported more often at increasing body mass index by both girls and boys.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A separate survey of 7,825 students aged 11 to 17 also noted that, compared to average-weight peers, obese boys and overweight girls were more likely to be victims of bullying. Additionally, obese girls were more likely to be victims and perpetrators of bullying than their peers. Notably, overweight and obese adolescent girls also reported higher rates of smoking, drinking, and marijuana use relative to their normal-weight peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Farhat|first1=Tilda|last2=Iannotti|first2=Ronald J.|last3=Simons-Morton|first3=Bruce G.|title=Overweight, Obesity, Youth, and Health-Risk Behaviors|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=38|issue=3|pages=258–267|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2009.10.038|pmid=20171527|pmc=2826832|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both adults and children with overweight and obesity, several reviews of the literature have found that across a variety of studies, there is a consistent relationship between experiencing weight stigma and many negative mental and physical health outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1b" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Papadopoulos|first1=Stephanie|last2=Brennan|first2=Leah|date=2015-09-01|title=Correlates of weight stigma in adults with overweight and obesity: A systematic literature review|journal=Obesity|volume=23|issue=9|pages=1743–1760|doi=10.1002/oby.21187|pmid=26260279|issn=1930-739X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4b"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Health Consequences of Weight Stigma: Implications for Obesity Prevention and Treatment|journal = Current Obesity Reports|date = 2015-04-01|issn = 2162-4968|pages = 182–190|volume = 4|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s13679-015-0153-z|pmid = 26627213|first1 = Rebecca|last1 = Puhl|first2 = Young|last2 = Suh|s2cid = 24953213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5c"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stigma and Eating and Weight Disorders|journal = Current Psychiatry Reports|date = 2015-02-05|issn = 1523-3812|pages = 552|volume = 17|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s11920-015-0552-6|pmid = 25652251|first1 = Rebecca|last1 = Puhl|first2 = Young|last2 = Suh|s2cid = 207338325}}&lt;/ref&gt; These will be discussed separately in the sections below, although physical and mental health consequences are often intertwined, in particular those related to eating disorders.

Papadopoulos and Brennan (2015) recently found that across many reviewed studies of weight loss treatment-seeking adults,&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt; relationships emerged between experiencing weight stigma and both BMI and difficulty losing weight.  However the findings are somewhat mixed. They also report evidence that experiencing weight stigma is related to poor medication adherence. Among weight loss treatment-seeking adults, experiencing weight stigma might exacerbate weight- and health-related quality of life issues.&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt; This review along with reviews by Vartanian and Smyth (2013) and Puhl and Suh (2015) have also found that across several studies and in both adults and children, experiencing weight stigma is related to decreased exercise behavior overall, as well as decreased motivation to exercise, decreased exercise self-efficacy, and increased food craving and tendency to overeat.&lt;ref name=":1b" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It is important to note that these effects of weight stigma on exercise and physical activity emerge independent of Body Mass Index, suggesting that weight stigma becomes a unique barrier to physical activity outside of barriers that may be associated with overweight and obesity in particular. Finally, across many studies, Puhl and Suh (2015) also found that experiencing weight stigma is related to many physiological consequences as well, including increased [[blood pressure]], augmented [[Glucocorticoid receptor|cortisol]] reactivity, elevated [[oxidative stress]], impaired glycemic control/elevated [[Glycated hemoglobin|HbA&lt;sub&gt;1c&lt;/sub&gt;]], and increased systemic [[inflammation]],&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5c" /&gt; all of which have notable consequences for physical health and disease.

=== Mental health and psychological consequences ===
Broadly speaking, experiencing weight stigma is associated with psychological distress. There are many negative effects connected to anti-fat bias, the most prominent being that societal bias against fat is ineffective at treating obesity, and leads to long-lasting body image issues, eating disorders, suicide, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=S. Gavin|first1=Gabriel C.|title=What's Wrong With 'Fat Shaming?'|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wiring-the-mind/201501/whats-wrong-fat-shaming|website=psychologytoday.com|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=7 November 2017|date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papadopoulos's 2015 review of the literature found that across several studies, this distress can manifest in [[anxiety]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], lowered [[self-esteem]], and [[substance use disorder]]s, both in weight loss treatment-seeking individuals as well as community samples.&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt; Many empirical reviews have found that weight stigma has clear consequences for individuals suffering from eating and weight disorders (including [[Anorexia nervosa|Anorexia Nervosa]], [[Bulimia nervosa|Bulimia Nervosa]], and [[Binge eating disorder|Binge Eating Disorder]]), as it plays a unique role, over and above other risk factors, in perpetuating disordered eating psychopathology.&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5c" /&gt; These results have emerged in both adult and adolescent, as well as in male and female samples. 

== Policy ==
Over the past few decades, many scholars have identified weight stigma as a long-standing form of social stigma and one of the last remaining socially acceptable forms of prejudice.{{cn|date=February 2020}} It follows then that individuals who are targets because of overweight and obesity, still face uniquely socially acceptable discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bias, Discrimination, and Obesity|journal = Obesity Research|date = 2001-12-01|issn = 1550-8528|pages = 788–805|volume = 9|issue = 12|doi = 10.1038/oby.2001.108|first1 = Rebecca|last1 = Puhl|first2 = Kelly D.|last2 = Brownell|pmid=11743063}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Obesity and Socioeconomic Status – A Complex Relation|journal = New England Journal of Medicine|date = 1993-09-30|issn = 0028-4793|pmid = 8366906|pages = 1036–1037|volume = 329|issue = 14|doi = 10.1056/NEJM199309303291411|authorlink1=Albert Stunkard|first1 = Albert J.|last1 = Stunkard|first2 = Thorkild I.A.|last2 = Sorensen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil rights legislation such as [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits discrimination based on race and several other domains, but weight is not included in this act. At the local level, only one state in the US ([[Michigan]]) has policy in place for prohibiting weight-related employment discrimination and very few local municipalities have human rights ordinances in place to protect individuals of large body size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tehran, Elizabeth E. (2005). Legal theory on weight discrimination. In K. Brownell, R. Puhl, M. Schwartz, &amp; L. Rudd (Eds.), ''Weight bias: nature, consequences, and'' remedies'' (pp. 195–211). New York, NY.''&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the only type legislation that overweight and obese individuals can cite in lawsuits is related to disability. For example, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] is one such avenue, but as Puhl et al. (2009) report, it is difficult for many individuals with obesity to qualify as disabled according to the criteria included in this statute.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Public health ==
Although many health policy scholars and public health initiatives have suggested that weight stigma might motivate weight loss{{cn|date=February 2020}}, the evidence from the existing literature largely does not support this notion. As cited above, experiencing weight stigma (both interpersonally as well as exposure to stigmatizing media campaigns) is consistently related to a lack of motivation to exercise and a propensity to overeat.&lt;ref name=":1b" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3b" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In a 2010 review examining whether weight stigma is an appropriate public health tool for treating and preventing overweight and obesity, Puhl and Heuer concluded that stigmatizing individuals with overweight and obesity is detrimental in three important ways: (1) it threatens actual physical health, (2) it perpetuates health disparities, and (3) it actually undermines obesity treatment and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref name="Puhl"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Obesity Stigma: Important Considerations for Public Health|journal = American Journal of Public Health|date = 2010-06-01|issn = 0090-0036|pmc = 2866597|pmid = 20075322|pages = 1019–1028|volume = 100|issue = 6|doi = 10.2105/AJPH.2009.159491|first1 = Rebecca M.|last1 = Puhl|first2 = Chelsea A.|last2 = Heuer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this, another recent review of the consequences of experiencing weight stigma, this one conducted by Puhl and Suh (2015), concluded that considering the myriad negative physical and mental health consequences associated with experiencing weight stigma, it should be a target, instead of a tool, in obesity prevention and treatment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These authors further recommend that a necessary first step in reducing weight stigma is raising broader awareness of its negative consequences.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
