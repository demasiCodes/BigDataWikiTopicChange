'''Blood Quantum Laws'''  or '''Indian Blood Laws''' is an umbrella term that describes  legislation enacted to define membership in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] groups. "Blood quantum" refers to attempts to calculate the degree of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] [[inheritance]] for a given individual. Its use started in 1705 when Virginia adopted laws which made both a person of American race and a person of half-American race ( a "half-blood" in other words) as legally inferior persons. &lt;ref name="ucd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nas.ucdavis.edu/Forbes/Blood_Quantum_II.html|title=THE BLOOD GROWS THINNER :BLOOD QUANTUM, PART 2|author=Professor Jack D.

==Origin of Blood Quantum Law==
The blood quantum law or "Indian Blood law" was a racially motivated law, created by European Americans.&lt;ref name="ucd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nas.ucdavis.edu/Forbes/Blood_Quantum_II.html|title=THE BLOOD GROWS THINNER :BLOOD QUANTUM, PART 2|author=Professor Jack D. Forbes |accessdate=2009-08-07 |date=2008 |publisher=[[University of California|University of California-Davis]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was created during the 18th century, specifically 1705, in Virginia.&lt;ref name="ucd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nas.ucdavis.edu/Forbes/Blood_Quantum_II.html|title=THE BLOOD GROWS THINNER :BLOOD QUANTUM, PART 2|author=Professor Jack D. Forbes |accessdate=2009-08-07 |date=2008 |publisher=[[University of California|University of California-Davis]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Native American tribes did not adopt the use of blood quantum law until the [[United States government|government]] introduced the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]].  Some tribes, such as the [[Navajo Nation]], did not accept the constitution of that law until the 1950s.&lt;ref name="unm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tlj.unm.edu/archives/vol8/8TLJ1LSPRUHAN.pdf|title=THE ORIGINS, CURRENT STATUS, AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF BLOOD QUANTUM AS THE DEFINITION OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE NAVAJO NATION|author=Paul Spruhan|accessdate=2009-08-15 |date=2008 |publisher=Tribal Law Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; The blood quantum laws have greatly reduced the numbers of many Native American tribes, and some tribes are reducing requirements to help increase the native population and in revolt against the racially motivated laws.&lt;ref name="naaa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=5355&amp;page=103|title=Tribal Membership Requirements and the Demography of "Old" and "New" Native Americans

==Problems caused by Blood Quantum Laws==

Many Native People have become used to the idea of "blood quantum".&lt;ref name="ucd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nas.ucdavis.edu/Forbes/Blood_Quantum_II.html|title=THE BLOOD GROWS THINNER :BLOOD QUANTUM, PART 2|author=Professor Jack D.

Children adopted into non-Native families are unable to be federally recognized even when they have a biological parent who is enrolled in a tribe.&lt;ref name="ucd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nas.ucdavis.edu/Forbes/Blood_Quantum_II.html|title=THE BLOOD GROWS THINNER :BLOOD QUANTUM, PART 2|author=Professor Jack D. Forbes |accessdate=2009-08-07 |date=2008 |publisher=[[University of California|University of California-Davis]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, census rolls taken for tribes such as the [[Cherokee]] were incomplete and due to intermarriage, immigration, treaties, or because they were not living within the boundaries of the nation, they would not be recorded on their tribe's rolls.&lt;ref name="chro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allthingscherokee.com/faq_proving.html|title=I Know I'm Cherokee, But How Do I Prove It?|author=Christina Berry|accessdate=2009-09-07 |date=2008 |publisher=All Things Cherokee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood quantum laws also help create racism among tribal members and was used as reasoning by a few members of the [[five civilized tribes]] to practice [[Slavery among Native Americans in the United States|slavery]] as the majority of slave owners were mixed with European ancestry and some believed they were of higher hierarchy over full bloods or those mixed with African American.&lt;ref name="amslav"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_indians_slavery.htm|title=Slavery and Native Americans in British North America and the United States: 1600 to 1865|author= Tony Seybert|accessdate=2009-06-20 |date=2009 |publisher=New York Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williamlkatz.com/Essays/History/AfricansIndians.php|title=Africans and Indians: Only in America|author=William Loren Katz |accessdate=2008-09-20 |year=2008 |publisher=William Loren Katz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems with Genetics===
Many researchers have published articles that caution that genetic ancestry DNA testing has limitations and should not be depended on by individuals to answer all their questions about heritage.&lt;ref name="true2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071018145955.htm|title=Genetic Ancestral Testing Cannot Deliver On Its Promise, Study Warns|author=ScienceDaily|accessdate=2008-10-02 |date=2008 |publisher=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sj"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=3908|title=Deep Roots and Tangled Branches|author=Troy Duster|accessdate=2008-10-02 |date=2008 |publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be the work geneticists did for a PBS series on African Americans called [[African American Lives]], it explained that while most African Americans are racially mixed, they found African-Native American admixture relatively rare.&lt;ref name="African American Lives"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/ahistoricalviewofrace/a/dnaandrace.htm
|title=DNA Testing: review, ''African American Lives'', About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="African American Lives PBS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/aalives/dna/index.html
|title=African American Lives 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Y-chromosome and mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) testing processes for direct line male and female ancestors can fail to pick up many ancestors' heritage.  Some critics thought the PBS series did not sufficiently explain the limitations of DNA testing for assessment of heritage.&lt;ref name="hr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=3908|title=Deep Roots and Tangled Branches|author=Troy Duster|accessdate=2008-10-02 |date=2008 |publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, genetic markers may appear in other populations and testing cannot distinguish among separate Native American tribes. &lt;ref name="genej"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcb.org/publications/briefing_papers/files/identity.html|title=Genetic Markers Not a Valid Test of Native Identity|author=Brett Lee Shelton, J.D. and Jonathan Marks, Ph.D.
|accessdate=2008-10-02 |date=2008 |publisher=Counsel for Responsible Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Many Native American tribes continue to employ blood quantum in their own current tribal laws to determine who is eligible for membership or citizenship in the tribe or Native American nation. These often require a minimum degree of blood relationship and often an ancestor listed in a specific tribal [[census]] from the late 1800s or early 1900s. The [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]] of [[North Carolina]], for example, require an ancestor listed in the 1924 Baker census and a minimum of 1/16 Cherokee blood inherited from their ancestor(s) on that roll. Meanwhile the Western Cherokee require applicants to descend from an ancestor in the 1906 [[Dawes Rolls|Dawes roll]] (direct lineal ancestry), but impose no minimum blood quantum requirement. The [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] require a 5/8 blood quantum, the highest requirement of any U.S. tribe, while the [[Miccosukee]] of [[Florida]], the [[Mississippi]] [[Choctaw]] and the [[St. Croix Band of Chippewa Indians|St. Croix]] [[Chippewa]] of [[Wisconsin]] all require 1/2 "tribal blood quantum." At the other end of the scale, the [[Mashantucket Pequots|Mashantucket]] [[Pequot]] of [[Connecticut]] and the [[Sac and Fox]] of [[Oklahoma]] both require 1/16, whereas the [[Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon]] require a combined minimum of 1/16 from any of a list of several [[Oregon]] indigenous peoples. The [[Navajo Nation]] requires a 1/4 blood quantum.

Some tribes require an unspecified amount of Indian ancestry (known as "lineal descendancy"), while others yet require a specified degree of Indian ancestry but an unspecified share of ancestry from the ancestral tribe or tribes from which the modern tribal entity is derived. Certain modern tribes are actually composed of confederations of original tribal peoples joined into a single modern ethno-political entity. There are also tribes that require a minimum blood degree only for tribal members born "off" (i.e. outside) the nominal [[Indian reservation|reservation]], comparable to the legal principles of ''[[Jus soli]]'' and ''[[Jus sanguinis]]'' in the [[nationality law]]s of modern sovereign states. By far the most common blood quantum requirement among modern American Indian tribes today is either 1/4 blood requirement or  [[lineal descendant|lineal descendancy]].
