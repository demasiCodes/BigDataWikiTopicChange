== Hate speech laws by country ==

=== Australia ===
{{Main|Hate speech laws in Australia}}
[[Australia]]'s hate speech laws vary by jurisdiction, and seek especially to prevent vilification on account of race.

=== Belgium ===
{{Main|Belgian Anti-Racism Law|Belgian Holocaust denial law}}
The [[Belgian Anti-Racism Law]], in full, the ''Law of 30 July 1981 on the Punishment of Certain Acts inspired by Racism or Xenophobia'', is a law against hate speech and [[discrimination]] that the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Federal Parliament]] of [[Belgium]] passed in 1981. It made certain acts motivated by [[racism]] or [[xenophobia]] illegal. It is also known as the ''[[Philippe Moureaux|Moureaux Law]]''.

The Belgian Holocaust denial law, passed on 23 March 1995, bans public [[Holocaust denial]]. Specifically, the law makes it illegal to publicly "deny, play down, justify or approve of the genocide committed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] regime during the [[World War II|Second World War]]." Prosecution is led by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism|Centre for Equal Opportunities]]. The offense is punishable by imprisonment of up to one year and fines of up to [[Euro|€]]2,500.

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], according to the [[Constitution of Brazil|1988 Brazilian Constitution]], [[racism]] is an "Offense with no statute of limitations and no right to bail for the defendant." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u107965.shtml "1988 Constitution made racism a crime with no right to bail"], [[Folha de S.Paulo]], 15 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, Brazil's Supreme Court (STF) ruled that the racism crime law should be applied to homophobia and transphobia as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazil's Supreme Court votes to criminalize homophobia|newspaper=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2019/06/brazils-supreme-court-votes-to-criminalize-homophobia.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Hate speech laws in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], advocating genocide against any "identifiable group" is an indictable offence under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] and it carries a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. There is no minimum sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']], [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-318.html#h-92 RSC 1985, c C-46, s 318], "Advocating Genocide".&lt;/ref&gt;

Publicly inciting hatred against any identifiable group is also an offence. It can be prosecuted either as an indictable offence with a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment, or as a summary conviction offence with a maximum sentence of six months' imprisonment. There are no minimum sentences in either case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-319.html#h-92 RSC 1985, c C-46, s 319] [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-319.html "Public incitement of hatred" and "Wilful promotion of hatred"].&lt;/ref&gt; The offence of publicly inciting hatred makes exceptions for cases of statements of truth, and subjects of public debate and religious doctrine. The landmark judicial decision on the constitutionality of this law was ''[[R v Keegstra]]'' (1990).

An "identifiable group" is defined for both offences as "any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, [[gender identity]] or [[Gender expression|expression]] or mental or physical disability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Criminal Code|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-318.html|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca|publisher=Legislative Services Branch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chile ===
Article 31 of the "Ley sobre Libertades de Opinión e Información y Ejercicio del Periodismo" (statute on freedom of opinion and information and the performance of journalism), punishes with a large fine those who “through any means of social communication makes publications or transmissions intended to promote hatred or hostility towards persons or a group of persons due to their race, sex, religion or nationality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Paúl Díaz|first1=Álvaro|year=2011|title=Alvaro Paúl Díaz, The Criminalization of Hate Speech in Chile in Light of Comparative Case Law (IN SPANISH), Rev. chil. derecho, 2011, vol.38, n.3, pp. 573–609.|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0718-34372011000300007&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Revista Chilena de Derecho|volume=38|issue=3|pages=573–609|doi=10.4067/S0718-34372011000300007|accessdate=10 October 2014|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law has been applied to expressions transmitted via the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Paúl Díaz|first1=Álvaro|year=2011|title=Alvaro Paul Díaz, The Criminalization of Hate Speech in Chile in Light of Comparative Case Law (In Spanish), Rev. chil. derecho, 2011, vol.38, n.3, pp. 573–609.|url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0718-34372011000300007&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Revista Chilena de Derecho|volume=38|issue=3|pages=573–609|doi=10.4067/S0718-34372011000300007|accessdate=10 October 2014|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a rule increasing the penalties for crimes motivated by discriminatory hatred.

=== Croatia ===
The [[Constitution of Croatia|Croatian Constitution]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]], but the Croatian penal code prohibits discrimination and punishes anyone "who based on differences of race, religion, language, political or other belief, wealth, birth, education, social status or other properties, gender, skin color, nationality or ethnicity violates basic human rights and freedoms recognized by the international community."&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:hr:Kazneni zakon#Rasna i druga diskriminacija|Article 174. of Croatian penal code on Croatian Wikisource]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===
[[Denmark]] prohibits hate speech, and defines it as publicly making statements by which a group is [[wiktionary:threaten|threatened]] (''{{lang|da|trues}}''), [[wiktionary:insult|insulted]] (''{{lang|da|forhånes}}'') or [[wiktionary:degrade|degraded]] (''{{lang|da|nedværdiges}}'') due to race, skin colour, national or ethnic origin, faith or sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Danish Penal code, ''Straffeloven'', section 266 B.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
The [[Council of Europe]] sponsored "No Hate Speech"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Hate Speech Movement|url=http://www.nohatespeechmovement.org/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605113819/https://www.nohatespeechmovement.org/|archive-date=5 June 2018|access-date=15 July 2017|website=No Hate Speech Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; movement actively raises awareness about hate speech, in order to help combat the problem. While Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] does not prohibit criminal laws against [[Historical revisionism (political)|revisionism]] such as denial or minimization of [[genocide]]s or [[crimes against humanity]], as interpreted by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR), the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe went further and recommended in 1997 that member governments "take appropriate steps to combat hate speech" under its Recommendation R (97) 20.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, [https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=1658005&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=582600&amp;Usage=2 Recommendation R (97) 20 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on "Hate Speech"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617054457/https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=1658005&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=582600&amp;Usage=2|date=17 June 2012}}, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 30 October 1997, accessed 10 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The ECtHR does not offer an accepted definition for "hate speech" but instead offers only parameters by which prosecutors can decide if the "hate speech" is entitled to the protection of freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharon|first=Alina Dain|date=February 28, 2013|title=A Web of Hate: European, U.S. Laws Clash on Defining and Policing Online Anti-Semitism|work=[[Algemeiner Journal]]|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/02/28/a-web-of-hate-european-u-s-laws-clash-on-defining-and-policing-online-anti-semitism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing awareness of this topic has resulted from educational programs in schools, which has enhanced reporting of hate speech incidences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Mark|title=Activities to tackle Hate speech SecEd Magazine|url=https://www.academia.edu/33555930|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe also created the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]], which has produced country reports and several general policy recommendations, for instance against [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and [[wiktionary:intolerance|intolerance]] against Muslims.

=== Finland ===
There has been considerable debate over the definition of "hate speech" (''vihapuhe'') in the [[Finnish language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=20 September 2011|title=TV2:n Vihaillassa ei päästy yksimielisyyteen vihapuhe-käsitteestä|language=Finnish|work=Helsing Sanomat|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/TV2n+Vihaillassa+ei+p%C3%A4%C3%A4sty+yksimielisyyteen+vihapuhe-k%C3%A4sitteest%C3%A4/1135269482946|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yle-vihailta"&gt;{{cite news|date=21 September 2011|title=Vihapuheen määritelmästä ei yksimielisyyttä|language=Finnish|work=YLE Uutiset|publisher=YLE|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/2011/09/vihapuheen_maaritelmasta_ei_yksimielisyytta_2887780.html|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If "hate speech" is taken to mean ethnic agitation, it is prohibited in [[Finland]] and defined in the section 11 of the penal code, ''War crimes and crimes against humanity'', as published information or as an opinion or other statement that threatens or insults a group because of race, [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]] or conviction, [[sexual orientation]], disability, or a comparable basis. Ethnic agitation is punishable with a fine or up to 2 years in prison, or 4 months to 4 years if aggravated (such as [[incitement to genocide]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Finnish Penal code] ''[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 Rikoslaki]/Strafflagen'' Chapter 11, section 10 Ethnic agitation / Kiihottaminen kansanryhmää vastaan&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics claim that, in political contexts, labeling certain opinions and statements "hate speech" can be used to silence unfavorable or critical opinions and suppress debate. Certain politicians, including Member of Parliament and the leader of the [[Finns Party]] [[Jussi Halla-aho]], consider the term "hate speech" problematic because of the disagreement over its definition.&lt;ref name="yle-vihailta" /&gt;

=== France ===
{{Main|Hate speech laws in France}}
[[France]]'s penal code and press laws prohibit public and private communication that is defamatory or insulting, or that incites discrimination, hatred, or violence against a person or group on account of place of origin, ethnicity or lack thereof, [[nationality]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], specific [[religion]], sex, [[sexual orientation]], or handicap. The law prohibits declarations that justify or deny crimes against humanity—for example, [[the Holocaust]] ([[Gayssot Act]]).&lt;ref&gt;Loi 90-615 du 13 juillet 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2019, [[Laetitia Avia]] proposed a bill to fight hate speech on social media. The Avia law was passed on May 13, 2020. It requires websites to remove content that contains hate speech within 24 hours after publication. Failure to comply is punishable by one year of imprisonment and a fine of up to €15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lutte contre la haine sur internet|language=French|work=Assemblée nationale|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/15/dossiers/lutte_contre_haine_internet|accessdate=29 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 2020, the French Constitutional Council rejected most of the draft law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Rosemain|first=Mathieu|date=2020-06-18|title=France's top court rejects core of law targeting online hate speech|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-tech-regulation-idUSKBN23P32O|access-date=2020-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In [[Germany]], ''[[Volksverhetzung]]'' ("incitement to hatred") is a punishable offense under Section 130 of the ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'' (Germany's criminal code) and can lead to up to five years' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strafgesetzbuch §130 (1)|url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/130.html|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 130 makes it a crime to publicly incite hatred against parts of the population or to call for violent or arbitrary measures against them or to insult, maliciously slur or defame them in a manner violating their (constitutionally protected) human dignity. Thus for instance it is illegal to publicly call certain ethnic groups "maggots" or "freeloaders".&lt;ref&gt;StGB §130 (2) 1. c)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Volksverhetzung'' is punishable in Germany even if committed abroad and even if committed by non-German citizens, if only the incitement of hatred takes effect within German territory, e.g., the [[Sedition|seditious]] sentiment was expressed in German writing or speech and made accessible in Germany (German criminal code's [[Principle of Ubiquity]], Section 9 §1 Alt. 3 and 4 of the Strafgesetzbuch).

On June 30, 2017, Germany approved a bill criminalizing hate speech on social media sites. Among criminalizing hate speech, the law states that social networking sites may be fined up to €50 million (US$56 million) if they persistently fail to remove illegal content within a week, including defamatory "fake news".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jordans|first=Frank|date=30 June 2017|title=Germany passes law against online hate speech|website=ABC News|agency=Associated Press|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/german-parliament-debates-online-hate-speech-law-48368036|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701080800/https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/german-parliament-debates-online-hate-speech-law-48368036|archive-date=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===
[[Panos Kammenos]], the leader of the [[National conservatism|national-conservative]] [[Independent Greeks]] party, encouraged his supporters to [[Lynching|lynch]] the mayor of [[Aristotelis (municipality)|Aristotelis]] in September 2013 during the [[Thessaloniki International Fair]], leading to a criminal prosecution against Kammenos.[https://www.tovima.gr/2013/09/16/politics/eisaggeleas-gia-tin-protropi-se-lintsarisma-toy-xr-paxta/][https://www.tovima.gr/2013/09/17/society/prosfygi-xristoy-paxta-kata-panoy-kammenoy/][https://www.kathimerini.gr/501857/article/epikairothta/politikh/o-ar-pagos-zhtei-arsh-asylias-toy-k-kammenoy][https://www.amna.gr/article/42311/Katatethike-sti-Bouli-to-aitima-arsis-tis-asulias-tou-Panou-Kammenou][https://www.kathimerini.gr/62340/article/epikairothta/politikh/rsh-asylias-kammenoy-kaklamanh-kai-hliopoyloy-apofasise-h-voylh]

=== Iceland ===
In [[Iceland]], the hate speech law is not confined to inciting hatred, as one can see from Article 233 a. in the Icelandic Penal Code, but includes public denigration:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-06-14|title=Iceland's Penal Code|url=https://www.government.is/library/Files/General_Penal_Code_sept.-2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
{{Main|Hate speech laws in India}}
Freedom of speech and expression is protected by article 19 (1) of the constitution of India, but under article 19(2) "reasonable restrictions" can be imposed on freedom of speech and expression in the interest of "the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States, public order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of India|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|archivedate=9 September 2014|accessdate=22 October 2017|website=lawmin.nic.in|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws allow a citizen to seek the punishment of anyone who shows the citizen disrespect "on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste, sexual orientation, gender identity or community or any other ground whatsoever".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.latestlaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/NLUD-Report-on-Hate-Speech-Laws-in-India.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
[[Indonesia]] has been a signatory to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] since 2006, but has not promulgated comprehensive legislation against hate-speech crimes. Calls for a comprehensive anti-hate speech law and associated educational program have followed statements by a leader of a hard-line Islamic organization that Balinese Hindus were mustering forces to protect the "lascivious Miss World pageant" in “a war against Islam" and that "those who fight on the path of Allah are promised heaven". The statements are said to be an example of similar messages intolerance being preached throughout the country by radical clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/opinion/hard-liners-targeting-miss-world-in-bali-shows-need-for-anti-hate-speech-law-in-indonesia/ "Hard-Liners Targeting Miss World in Bali Shows Need for Anti-Hate-Speech Law in Indonesia"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328014111/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/opinion/hard-liners-targeting-miss-world-in-bali-shows-need-for-anti-hate-speech-law-in-indonesia/|date=28 March 2014}}, Johannes Nugroho, ''Jakarta Globe'', 23 September 2013.

=== Ireland ===
The [[Constitution of Ireland]] guarantees [[Irish nationality law|Irish citizens]] the right "to express freely their convictions and opinions"; however, this right is "subject to public order and morality", mass media "shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State", and "publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter is an [[Crime|offence]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of Ireland|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article40_6_1|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 40.6.1°.i|nopp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 made it an offence to make, distribute, or broadcast "threatening, abusive or insulting" words, images, or sounds with intent or likelihood to "stir up hatred", where "hatred" is "against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of [[Irish Travellers|the travelling community]] or sexual orientation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prohibition of Incitement To Hatred Act, 1989|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1989/act/19/enacted/en/index.html|accessdate=7 November 2017|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=especially §§1–4|nopp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
Japan does not have nationally enforced hate speech laws. Japanese law covers threats and slander, but it "does not apply to hate speech against general groups of people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130710p2a00m0na009000c.html "Foreign correspondents share opinions on Japanese hate speech marches"], ''The Mainichi'', 10 July 2013.

Article 4 of the convention sets forth provisions calling for the criminalization of hate speech but the Japanese government has suspended the provisions, saying actions to spread or promote the idea of racial discrimination have not been taken in Japan to such an extent that legal action is necessary. The Foreign Ministry stated in 2013 that this assessment remained unchanged.&lt;ref name="JusticeMinister-10May2013"&gt;[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201305100069 "Justice minister criticizes hate speech in Japan but won't punish offenders"], ''The Asahi Shimbun'', 10 May 2013. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930002641/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201305100069|date=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, following demonstrations, parades, and comments posted on the Internet threatening violence against foreign residents of Japan, especially Koreans, there were concerns that hate speech was a growing problem in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2013/07/10/national/politicians-silent-on-curbing-hate-speech/ "Politicians silent on curbing hate speech"], Eric Johnston, ''Japan Times'', 10 July 2013.

On 7 October 2013, in a rare ruling on racial discrimination against ethnic Koreans, a Japanese court ordered an anti-Korean group, [[Zaitokukai]], to stop "hate speech" protests against a Korean school in [[Kyoto]] and pay the school 12.26 million yen ($126,400 U.S.) in compensation for protests that took place in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24427921 "Japan court in Korean discrimination ruling"], ''BBC News'', 7 October 2013.

The new anti-hate speech local law forbids individuals from using means such as megaphones, signs or flyer distribution in public spaces including parks and roads to air hate speech that discriminates against people from foreign countries, or their descendants. The ordinance does not address hate speech outside public areas and online.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200702/p2a/00m/0na/020000c"Japan's 1st ordinance making hate speech punishable with fines enacted in Kawasaki"]''The Mainichi'', July 2, 2020.

=== Netherlands ===
The Dutch penal code prohibits both insulting a group (article 137c) and inciting hatred, discrimination or violence (article 137d). The definition of the offences as outlined in the penal code is as follows:

* Article 137c: "He who publicly, orally, in writing or graphically, intentionally expresses himself insultingly regarding a group of people because of their race, their religion or their life philosophy, their heterosexual or homosexual orientation or their physical, psychological or mental disability, shall be punished by imprisonment of no more than a year or a monetary penalty of the third category."&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|nl}} [http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/TweedeBoek/TitelV/Artikel137c Dutch penal code – article 137c]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Singapore]] has passed numerous laws that prohibit speech that causes disharmony among various religious groups. The [[Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act]] is an example of such legislation. The Penal Code criminalizes the deliberate promotion by someone of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different racial and religious groups on grounds of race or religion. It also makes it an offence for anyone to deliberately wound the religious or racial feelings of any person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=SCHWEISFURTH|first=THEODOR|title=Germany, Occupation After World War Ii|date=1982|work=Use of Force · War and Neutrality Peace Treaties (A–M)|pages=191–198|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-0-444-86234-1.50071-0|isbn=978-0-444-86234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main|Hate speech laws in the United Kingdom}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], several statutes criminalize hate speech against several categories of people. The statutes forbid communication that is hateful, threatening, or abusive, and targets a person on account of disability, ethnic or national origin, nationality (including citizenship), race, religion, sexual orientation, or skin colour. The penalties for hate speech include fines, imprisonment, or both.&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Criminal Justice Act 2003|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/44/section/146|access-date=2017-01-03|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Order Act 1986|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2236942|website=www.statutelaw.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1994/33/contents|title=Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1998/37/contents|title=Crime and Disorder Act 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/2001/24/contents|title=Amendment to Crime and Disorder Act 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/2006/1/contents|title=Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 (England and Wales)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/2008/4/contents|title=Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Excessive citations inline|date=August 2020}} Legislation against Sectarian hate in Scotland, which is aimed principally at football matches,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} does not criminalise jokes about people's beliefs, nor outlaw "harsh" comment about their religious faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/CurrentCommittees/31384.aspx|accessdate=31 August 2013|publisher=The Scottish Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Hate speech in the United States}}
The United States does not have hate speech laws, since the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has repeatedly ruled that laws criminalizing hate speech violate the guarantee to [[freedom of speech]] contained in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name="volokh"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Volokh|first1=Eugene|date=5 May 2015|title=No, there's no "hate speech" exception to the First Amendment|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/07/no-theres-no-hate-speech-exception-to-the-first-amendment/|accessdate=25 June 2017|website=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several categories of speech that are not protected by the First Amendment, such as speech that calls for imminent violence upon a person or group. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that hate speech that does not fall into one of these categories is constitutionally protected.&lt;ref&gt;Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.S. 443 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matal v. Tam, 582 U.S. ___, (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;{{secondary source needed|date=December 2019}}

Proponents of hate speech legislation in the United States have argued that freedom of speech undermines the 14th Amendment by bolstering an oppressive narrative which demeans equality and the Reconstructive Amendment's purpose of guaranteeing equal protection under the law.&lt;ref&gt;DOWNS, DANIEL M. and GLORIA COWAN.
