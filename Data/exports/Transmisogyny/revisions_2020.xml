'''Transmisogyny''' (sometimes '''trans-misogyny''') is the [[intersectionality|intersection]] of [[transphobia]] and [[misogyny]].&lt;ref name="Arayasirikul"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arayasirikul|first1=Sean|last2=Wilson|first2=Erin C.|title=Spilling the T on Trans-Misogyny and Microaggressions: An Intersectional Oppression and Social Process Among Trans Women|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=66|issue=10|year=2018|pages=1415–1438|issn=0091-8369|doi=10.1080/00918369.2018.1542203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmisogyny includes misogyny, sexism, transphobia, and cissexism toward [[trans women]] and [[transfeminine]] people that may not be experienced by [[cisgender]] women or [[trans men]].&lt;ref name="Nadal2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin L.

The term was coined by [[Julia Serano]] in her 2007 book ''[[Whipping Girl]]''. According to Serano, transmisogyny is an intersectional {{Citation needed|reason=Serrano does not use this term in existing citation|date=September 2020}} form of [[sexism]], based on the interaction between oppositional and traditional sexism. She explained that traditional sexism is "the belief that maleness and [[masculinity]] are superior to femaleness and [[femininity]]," and oppositional sexism is "the belief that female and male are rigid, mutually exclusive categories."&lt;ref name="transmisogyny-primer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Transmisogyny primer|url=http://www.juliaserano.com/av/TransmisogynyPrimer-Serano.pdf|accessdate=10 September 2014|last=Serano|first=Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sexual deceit: the ethics of passing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4OGpJXp_oQC&amp;pg=PA12 |page=12 |year=2013 |first=Kelby |last=Harrison |publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-7706-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Transmisogyny is a central concept in [[transfeminism]] and is commonly referenced in [[intersectionality|intersectional feminist theory]]. That trans women's femaleness (rather than only their femininity) is a source of transmisogyny is denied by certain [[Feminist views on transgender and transsexual people|radical feminists]], who argue that trans women are not female.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, Sheila (2014) ''Gender Hurts'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-53939-5}}, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
In ''Whipping Girl'', Julia Serano writes that the existence of trans women is seen as a threat to a "male-centered gender hierarchy, where it is assumed that men are better than women and that masculinity is superior to femininity."&lt;ref name="whipping-girl" /&gt; [[Gender studies|Gender theorist]] [[Judith Butler]] echoes this assumption, stating that the murder of transgender women is a move to assert "dominance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Do Men Kill Trans Women? Gender Theorist Judith Butler Explains |url = https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/why-do-men-kill-trans-women-gender-theorist-judith-butler-explains|website = Broadly|accessdate = 2015-12-24|language = en-US|date = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trans women are also viewed as threatening the [[heterosexuality]] of [[cisgender]] men. In media, "deceivers" such as Dil, a transgender woman from the 1992 film ''[[The Crying Game]]'', have been observed to evoke outrage and male [[homophobia]] in an audience when it is revealed that they are transgender.&lt;ref name="whipping-girl2"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Serano|first1 = Julia|title = Whipping girl|date = 2007|publisher = Seal Press|location = Berkeley|isbn = 978-1580051545|edition = [Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instances==
===United States===
Transgender women face harsher levels of discrimination than other transgender people. A study on workplace experiences after people receive sex changes found that trans women, on average, lose almost one third of their salary, are respected less, and receive more harassment. At the same time, trans men often experience salary raises and greater authority in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schilt|first=Kristen|last2=Wiswall|first2=Matthew|date=2008|title=Before and After: Gender Transitions, Human Capital, and Workplace Experiences|url=http://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/wiswall/research/schilt_wiswall_transsexual.pdf|journal=The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis &amp; Policy|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Laura Kacere (2014), trans people experience a disproportionately large number of hate crimes, with trans women experiencing the majority of these crimes.&lt;ref name="Everyday Feminism" /&gt; The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (2012) found that police violence is three times higher against transgender people than it is against cisgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs|first=|date=2013|title=A Report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP): Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and HIV-Affected Hate Violence in 2012|url=http://avp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ncavp_2012_hvreport_final.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 17, 2020|website=National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, over half of all anti-LGBTQIA+ homicides were perpetrated against transgender women.&lt;ref name="Everyday Feminism"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/01/transmisogyny/|title=Transmisogyny 101: What It Is and What Can We Do About It|last=Kacere|first=Laura|date=2014-01-27|work=Everyday Feminism|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the majority transmisogyny is directed at trans women of color. The Human Rights Campaign Foundation (2018) reports significant overlaps between the gender identity and race of anti-trans violence victims: of the known homicides of transgender people from 2013 to 2018, approximately 92% were trans women, and approximately 70% were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Human Rights Campaign Foundation|first=|date=2018|title=A National Epidemic: Anti-Transgender Violence in America in 2018|url=https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/AntiTransViolence-2018Report-Final.pdf?_ga=2.173210787.1217551038.1599776030-257225511.1599776030|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 17, 2020|website=Human Rights Campaign Foundation, Public Education &amp; Research Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kacere (2014) also states that 21% of transgender women and 47% of black transgender women have experienced incarceration, rates that are much higher than those for the overall U.S. population.&lt;ref name="Everyday Feminism"/&gt;

===Ecuador===
A study on discrimination of lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, transgender and intersex women in Ecuador found that transgender women "lack protection against discrimination in both law and practice." As a result, trans women have faced violence, sexual abuse, and discrimination in educational, health and workforce institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Almeida |first1=Aline Britto de |last2=Vásquez |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Rodríguez |first3=Mónica |last4=Klein |first4=Guayaquil Dayane |last5=Cordero |first5=Tatiana Mendieta |last6=Varea |first6=Soledad |title=Ecuador: Discrimination of Lesbian, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender and Intersex Women|website=www.semanticscholar.org |date=2008 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5c24/ee5ab5566f25c1d86b5bac31e43867ee1896.pdf|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
{{Further|Blanchard's transsexualism typology}}
Julia Serano in ''Whipping Girl'' pointed out that [[transvestic fetishism]], a disorder listed in the [[DSM-IV]], only mentions cross dressing by men.&lt;ref name="whipping-girl" /&gt; Similarly, ''autogynephilia'' was a recognised disorder in the DSM-IV, but ''autoandrophilia'' was not. The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' was revised in 2013, and transvestic fetishism and gender identity disorder were removed; transvestic disorder and gender dysphoria were the product of the revisions. The other addition to DSM-V regarding gender is transvestic disorder, in which a heterosexual male feels dissociation from his assigned gender because he derives pleasure from dressing in women's apparel.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

== Sexualisation and harassment ==

Julia Serano has stated that many trans women experience an additional layer of misogyny in the form of fetishization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=A manifesto for all: Bisexual trans activist and author Julia Serano wants to make feminism inclusive|last=Bianco|first=Marcie|magazine=[[Curve (magazine)|Curve]]|volume=26|issue= 5|date=September-October 2016|pages=28–29|url=http://www.juliaserano.com/av/CurveInterview16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that, despite [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]], trans women are still commonly perceived as male; however, they are rarely sexualized as such. In the [[Sex industry|porn industry]], whose target audience is primarily heterosexual men, trans women are largely presented as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] rather than "predatory."&lt;ref name="whipping-girl" /&gt; Serano observes that when she is in a social environment where she is known to be transsexual, for example places where she performs [[Spoken word|spoken word poetry]], she receives many more blatantly sexual comments than when in a similar setting where she is assumed to be cissexual.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

According to Serano, the sexualisation of trans women is not solely because transgender women, by nature of their relative rarity, are viewed as "exotic": she notes that trans men are sexualized particularly much even compared to other types of "rare" women.&lt;ref name="whipping-girl" /&gt; In ''Whipping Girl'', Serano writes on what she calls a "predator–prey dichotomy," where "men are invariably viewed as predators and women as prey." Because of this view, trans women are perceived to be luring men by transitioning and "turning [themselves] into sexual objects that no red-blooded man can resist."&lt;ref name="whipping-girl" /&gt;

==Relation to transphobia==
Transmisogyny is a distinct category of transphobia in that transmisogyny mainly focuses on trans women and other transgender individuals who demonstrate femininity, whereas transphobia is a more general term, covering a broader spectrum of prejudice and discrimination towards transsexual and transgender individuals. Julia Serano states in ''Whipping Girl'' that "[w]hen the majority of jokes made at the expense of trans people center on 'men wearing dresses' or 'men who want their penises cut off' that is not transphobia – it is transmisogyny. When the majority of violence and sexual assaults committed against trans people is directed at trans women, that is not transphobia – it is transmisogyny."&lt;ref name="whipping-girl"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Serano|first1=Julia|title=Whipping girl|date=2007|publisher=Seal Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-1580051545|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;
