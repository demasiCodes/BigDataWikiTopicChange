'''Transmisogyny''', otherwise known as '''trans-misogyny''' and '''transphobic misogyny''', is the [[intersectionality|intersection]] of [[transphobia]] and [[misogyny]] as experienced by [[trans women]] and [[transfeminine]] people.&lt;ref name="Nadal2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin L.

Transmisogyny is a central concept in [[transfeminism]] and is commonly referenced in [[intersectionality|intersectional feminist theory]]. In her definition of transmisogyny, Serano does not limit those affected by transmisogyny to individuals who identify as [[transgender]] and includes those who identify as [[drag queens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Serano |first=Julia |title=Outspoken: A Decade of Transgendered Activism and Trans Feminism |publisher=Switch Hitter Press |year=2016 |pages=66–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Framework==
The concept of transmisogyny hinges on two other concepts first described by Serano: traditional sexism and [[oppositional sexism]]. The former is the idea that "maleness and masculinity are superior to femaleness and femininity", while the latter holds male and female as "rigid, mutually exclusive categories". Transmisogyny stems from both these concepts.&lt;ref name="Arayasirikul"/&gt;

In ''Whipping Girl'', Julia Serano writes that the existence of trans women is seen as a threat to a "male-centered [[gender hierarchy]]".&lt;ref name="whipping-girl" /&gt;{{rp|15}} [[Gender theorist]] [[Judith Butler]] echoes this assumption, stating that the murder of transgender women by men is "the most [[Toxic masculinity|toxic form]] that masculinity can take", a way for the killer to assert power over the victim in the instant, in response to the idea of the [[Intrinsic property (philosophy)|intrinsic]] nature of his power (i.e., his masculinity) being threatened. Butler states that trans women have relinquished masculinity, showing that it is possible to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Do Men Kill Trans Women?

===United States===

Transgender women face harsher levels of discrimination than other transgender people. A study on workplace experiences after people receive sex changes found that trans women, on average, lose almost one third of their salary (see [[Gender pay gap in the United States]]), are respected less, and receive more harassment. At the same time, trans men often experience salary raises and greater authority in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schilt |first1=Kristen |last2=Wiswall |first2=Matthew |title=Before and After: Gender Transitions, Human Capital, and Workplace Experiences |journal=The B.E.

According to Laura Kacere (2014), trans people experience a disproportionately large number of hate crimes, with trans women experiencing the majority of these crimes.&lt;ref name="Everyday Feminism" /&gt; The [[National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs]] (2012) found that police violence is three times higher against transgender people than it is against cisgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs|date=2013|title=A Report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP): Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and HIV-Affected Hate Violence in 2012|url=http://avp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ncavp_2012_hvreport_final.pdf|access-date=September 17, 2020|website=National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs|archive-date=11 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111202111/http://avp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ncavp_2012_hvreport_final.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, over half of all anti-LGBTQIA+ homicides were perpetrated against transgender women.&lt;ref name="Everyday Feminism"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://everydayfeminism.com/2014/01/transmisogyny/|title=Transmisogyny 101: What It Is and What Can We Do About It|last=Kacere|first=Laura|date=2014-01-27|work=Everyday Feminism|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US|archive-date=17 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190517112140/https://everydayfeminism.com/2014/01/transmisogyny/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[List of people killed for being transgender]].) In the United States, the majority of transmisogyny is directed at trans women of color. The [[Human Rights Campaign]] Foundation (2018) reports significant overlaps between the gender identity and race of anti-trans violence victims: of the known homicides of transgender people from 2013 to 2018, approximately 92% were trans women, and approximately 70% were black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A National Epidemic: Fatal Anti-Transgender Violence in America |url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/a-national-epidemic-fatal-anti-transgender-violence-in-america-in-2018 |website=HRC |access-date=20 October 2021 |archive-date=20 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211020174223/https://www.hrc.org/resources/a-national-epidemic-fatal-anti-transgender-violence-in-america-in-2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kacere (2014) also states that 21% of transgender women and 47% of black transgender women have experienced incarceration, rates that are much higher than those for the overall U.S. population.&lt;ref name="Everyday Feminism"/&gt;

===Ecuador===
{{See also|LGBT rights in Ecuador}}

A study of discrimination directed against lesbian, bisexual, transsexual, transgender and [[intersex]] women in Ecuador found that transgender women "lack protection against discrimination in both law and practice." As a result, trans women have faced violence, sexual abuse, and discrimination in educational, health and workforce institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Almeida |first1=Aline Britto de |last2=Vásquez |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Rodríguez |first3=Mónica |last4=Klein |first4=Guayaquil Dayane |last5=Cordero |first5=Tatiana Mendieta |last6=Varea |first6=Soledad |date=2008 |title=Ecuador: Discrimination of Lesbian, Bisexual, Transsexual, Transgender and Intersex Women |citeseerx=10.1.1.563.8340 |s2cid=154832726 |url=https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.563.8340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When transgender women are murdered, the victim being a trans woman is still often used as the justification for their murder.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2022-01-13 |title=Moord op transvrouw leidt tot Kamervragen: 'Dit geweld moet stoppen' |url=https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/editienl/artikel/5280842/moord-van-der-valk-transvrouw-geweld-tegen-transpersonen-transgender |access-date=2023-07-05 |website=RTL Nieuws |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Trangender Netwerk Nederland]], at least 14% experience violence or credible threats &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and are abused seven times more often than the average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Lotens |first=Lisa |date=2018-11-20 |title=Transgender personen worden zeven keer vaker mishandeld dan gemiddeld |url=https://www.vice.com/nl/article/439xmj/transgender-personen-geweld |access-date=2023-07-05 |website=Vice |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dinah Bons]] from [[Trans United Europe]], trans women often face harassment, violence, or threats of violence, but it is hard to get accurate statistics on the matter as there is [[Survivorship bias|severe hesitancy to report the crime]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the government is unwilling to track it as a statistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Kamervraag - De moorden op, geweld tegen en zelfdodingen door trans personen in Nederland. |url=https://www.openkamer.org/kamervraag/2022Z00387/ |access-date=2023-07-05 |website=www.openkamer.org |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bons also thinks the media does not cover the yearly murders of trans women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Sexualization and harassment ==
Julia Serano has stated that many trans women experience an additional layer of misogyny in the form of fetishization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=A manifesto for all: Bisexual trans activist and author Julia Serano wants to make feminism inclusive|last=Bianco|first=Marcie|magazine=[[Curve (magazine)|Curve]]|volume=26|issue=5|date=September–October 2016|pages=28–29|url=http://www.juliaserano.com/av/CurveInterview16.pdf|access-date=1 August 2019|archive-date=14 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214161002/http://www.juliaserano.com/av/CurveInterview16.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that, despite [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]], trans women are still commonly perceived as male; however, they are rarely sexualized as such. In the [[Sex industry|porn industry]], whose target audience is primarily heterosexual men, trans women are largely presented as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] rather than "predatory".&lt;ref name="whipping-girl" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2022}}

According to Serano, the sexualisation of trans women is not solely because transgender women, by nature of their relative rarity, are viewed as "exotic": she notes that trans women are sexualized particularly much even compared to other types of "rare" women.&lt;ref name="whipping-girl" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2022}} In ''Whipping Girl'', Serano writes on what she calls a "predator–prey dichotomy" where "men are invariably viewed as predators and women as prey."&lt;ref name="whipping-girl" /&gt;{{rp|255}} Because of this view, trans women are perceived to be luring men by transitioning and "turning [themselves] into sexual objects that no red-blooded man can resist."&lt;ref name="whipping-girl" /&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2022}}

Transmisogynistic violence and harassment directed towards trans feminine individuals is often perpetrated by strangers rather than those known by the victim and oftentimes includes [[catcalling]] and other forms of [[verbal abuse]].&lt;ref name="Stotzer 170–179"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stotzer |first=Rebecca L. |date=2009-05-01 |title=Violence against transgender people: A review of United States data |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178909000202 |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |language=en |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=170–179 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2009.01.006 |issn=1359-1789}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some states have non-discrimination laws protecting transgender individuals, there is no federal law specifically designed to protect those who identify as transgender.&lt;ref name="Stotzer 170–179"/&gt;

==Relation to transphobia==
Transmisogyny is a distinct category of transphobia in that transmisogyny mainly focuses on trans women and other transgender individuals who demonstrate femininity, whereas transphobia is a more general term, covering a broader spectrum of prejudice and discrimination towards transsexual and transgender individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | date = September 13, 2021 | title = How Fake "Experts" Are Driving the Campaign Against Trans People | type = Website | publisher = GenderGP Transgender Services | url = https://www.gendergp.com/why-are-people-transphobic/ | access-date = 6 December 2021 | archive-date = 6 December 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211206173146/https://www.gendergp.com/why-are-people-transphobic/ | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Julia Serano states in ''Whipping Girl'' that "[w]hen the majority of jokes made at the expense of trans people center on 'men wearing dresses' or 'men who want their penises cut off' that is not transphobia – it is transmisogyny. When the majority of violence and sexual assaults committed against trans people is directed at trans women, that is not transphobia – it is transmisogyny."&lt;ref name="whipping-girl"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Serano |first1=Julia |title=Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity |date=2016 |publisher=Basic Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y__cCgAAQBAJ |isbn=978-1-58005-623-6 |oclc=944012152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14–15}}

Serano gives an example of the discrimination that trans feminine individuals experience and how it differs from what she assumes is the experience of a trans masculine individual in a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview,

{{Blockquote|Once in San Francisco I saw a trans woman dressed like an average feminine woman walk past a straight couple on the street. The man turned to the woman and sneered "Did you see all that crap he's wearing?" He was referring to her dress and jewelry and makeup and all that. If a trans man had walked by, they might also have ridiculed him for being transgender. But I doubt very much they would have made fun of his masculine clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Carstensen |first=Caitlyn |date=June 22, 2017 |title=Julia Serano, Transfeminist Thinker Talks Trans-Misogyny |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/us/lgbt-julia-serano-transfeminist-trans-misogyny.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transmisogyny and mental health ==
Negative attitudes and aggression that cisgender people hold towards transgender people can lead to [[microaggression]]s and discrimination. When a trans individual encounters these, it can harm their mental and physical health. Research has shown a significant amount of differences in mental health concerns amongst trans, gender diverse, and [[gender nonconforming]] children compared to other cisgender youth.&lt;ref&gt;SILVA, K. et al. [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968097/ "Policy Attitudes Toward Adolescents Transitioning Gender"]. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology'', [s. l.], v. 69, n. 4, p. 403–415, 2022. {{doi|10.1037/cou0000601}}. {{PMID| 34968097}}. Disponível em: https://search-ebscohost-com.lib-proxy.fullerton.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ssf&amp;AN=161703499&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender-based discrimination and aggression have led to an increase in suicide and suicide attempts among [[trans youth]]. These adverse outcomes do not just arise from their peers, but the discrimination is also a systemic problem, such as school bathroom policies and denied access to hormones. Continued subjection to inequity and prejudice creates an unsafe social environment for transgender people.
