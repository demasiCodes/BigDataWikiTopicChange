The '''Stonewall riots''', also known as the '''Stonewall uprising''', '''Stonewall rebellion''', or simply '''Stonewall''', were a series of protests by members of the [[gay community]]{{refn|group=note|While the community has always included all LGBT people, the one-word unifying term in the 1950s through the early 1980s was ''gay'' (see [[Gay liberation]]). Later ('70s/80s) this was expanded by many groups to ''lesbian and gay'', then by the '90s and '00s to ''lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender'' (LGBT). Also by the late eighties and early nineties, ''[[queer]]'' began to be reclaimed as a one-word alternative to the ever-lengthening string of initials, especially when used by radical political groups.{{sfn|Hoffman|2007|pp=79–81}}

As was common for American gay bars at the time, the Stonewall Inn was owned by the [[American Mafia|Italian-American Mafia]].{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=183}}{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=79–83}}&lt;ref name="AmExpMafia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stonewall Uprising: The Year That Changed America – Why Did the Mafia Own the Bar? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/stonewall-why-did-mafia-own-bar/ |website=American Experience |publisher=PBS |access-date=June 5, 2019 |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn on June&amp;nbsp;28, 1969. Tensions between [[New York City Police]] and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents organized into activist groups demanding the right to live openly regarding their [[sexual orientation]], and without fear of being arrested. The new activist organizations concentrated on confrontational tactics, and within months three newspapers were established to promote rights for [[gay men]] and [[lesbian]]s.

A year after the uprising, to mark the anniversary on June&amp;nbsp;28, 1970, the first [[Pride parade|gay pride marches]] took place in [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], and [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfpride.org/heritage/1970.html |title=Heritage &amp;#124; 1970 Christopher Street Liberation Day Gay-In, San Francisco |publisher=SF Pride |date=June 28, 1970 |access-date=June 28, 2014 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022032242/http://www.sfpride.org/heritage/1970.html |archive-date=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the US and the world.

==Background==
Very few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s; those that did were often run by organized crime groups, due to the illegal nature of gay bars at the time. The [[homophobic]] legal system of the 1950s and 1960s{{refn|group=note|Illinois decriminalized [[sodomy]] in 1961, but at the time of the Stonewall riots every other state criminalized homosexual acts, even between consenting adults acting in private homes. "An adult convicted of the crime of having sex with another consenting adult in the privacy of his or her home could get anywhere from a light fine to five, ten, or twenty years—or even life—in prison. In 1971, twenty states had 'sex psychopath' laws that permitted the detaining of homosexuals for that reason alone. In Pennsylvania and California sex offenders could be committed to a psychiatric institution for life and [in] seven states they could be castrated."{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=15}} Through the 1950s and 1960s, castration, [[emetic]]s, hypnosis, [[electroshock therapy]] and [[lobotomies]] were used by psychiatrists to try to "cure" homosexuals.{{sfn|Katz|1976|pp=81–197}}{{sfn|Adam|1987|p=60}} }}{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=15}} prompted early [[homosexual]] groups in the US to prove gay people could be assimilated into society, and such early groups favored non-confrontational education for homosexuals and [[heterosexual]]s alike. However, the last years of the 1960s saw activity among many social/political movements, including the [[civil rights movement]], the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]]. Such influences served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.

===Homosexuality in 20th-century United States===
{{further|LGBT history in the United States|Lavender scare}}

Following the social upheaval of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], many people in the United States felt a fervent desire to "restore the prewar social order and hold off the forces of change", according to historian [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]].{{sfn|Adam|1987|p=56}} Spurred by the national emphasis on [[anti-communism]], Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] conducted hearings searching for communists in the US government, the [[US Army]], and other government-funded agencies and institutions, leading to a national paranoia. [[Anarchist]]s, [[communist]]s, and other people deemed un-American and subversive were considered security risks. Gay men and lesbians were [[lavender scare|included]] in this list by the [[US State Department]] on the theory that they were susceptible to [[blackmail]]. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by [[Clyde R. Hoey]] noted in a report, "It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons",{{sfn|Edsall|2003|p=277}} and said all of the government's intelligence agencies "are in complete agreement that sex perverts in Government constitute security risks".&lt;ref&gt;David K. Johnson (2004). ''The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government''. University of Chicago Press, pp. 101–102, 114–115 {{ISBN|0226404811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1947 and 1950, 1,700 federal job applications were denied, 4,380 people were discharged from the military, and 420 were fired from their government jobs for being suspected homosexuals.{{sfn|Adam|1987|p=58}}

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and police departments kept lists of known homosexuals and their favored establishments and friends; the [[US Post Office]] kept track of addresses where material pertaining to [[homosexuality]] was mailed.{{sfn|Edsall|2003|p=278}} State and local governments followed suit: bars catering to gay men and lesbians were shut down and their customers were arrested and exposed in newspapers. Cities performed "sweeps" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite-gender clothes and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.{{sfn|Adam|1987|p=59}}

In 1952, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] listed homosexuality in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (''DSM'') as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify the inclusion of the "disorder" as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession.{{sfn|Edsall|2003|p=247}} In 1956, however, the psychologist [[Evelyn Hooker]] performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference.{{sfn|Edsall|2003|p=310}} Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians,{{sfn|Marcus|2002|pp=58–59}} but homosexuality remained in the ''DSM'' until 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drBejRLWkHkC&amp;pg=PA76 |chapter=The Transformation of Mental Disorders in the 1980s: The DSM-III, Managed Care and "Cosmetic Psychopharmacology" |page=76 |title=Medicating Children: ADHD and Pediatric Mental Health |first1=Rick |last1=Mayes |first2=Catherine |last2=Bagwell |first3=Jennifer L. |last3=Erkulwater |publisher=Harvard University Press |date= 2009 |access-date=April 7, 2019 |isbn=978-0-674-03163-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homophile activism===
{{main|Homophile movement}}
In response to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each other to advance the cause of gay men and lesbians and provide opportunities where they could socialize without fear of being arrested. [[Los Angeles]] area homosexuals created the [[Mattachine Society]] in 1950, in the home of communist activist [[Harry Hay]].{{sfn|Marcus|2002|pp=24–25}} Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist "sexual deviants" with legal troubles.{{sfn|Adam|1987|pp=62–63}} Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals.{{sfn|Adam|1987|pp=63–64}}{{sfn|Marcus|2002|pp=42–43}} Soon after, several women in [[San Francisco]] met in their living rooms to form the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) for lesbians.{{sfn|Marcus|2002|p=21}} Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine and urged their members to assimilate into general society.{{sfn|Gallo|2006|pp=1–5, 11}}

One of the first challenges to [[political repression|government repression]] came in 1953. An organization named [[ONE, Inc.]] published a magazine called ''ONE''. The US Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually [[One, Inc. v. Olesen|went to the Supreme Court]], which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.{{sfn|Marcus|2002|pp=47–48}}

[[Homophile movement|Homophile]] organizations—as homosexual groups self-identified in this era—grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. [[Frank Kameny]] founded the Mattachine of [[Washington, D.C.]] He had been fired from the US Army Map Service for being a homosexual and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at [[mental health professional]]s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.{{sfn|Marcus|2002|pp=80–88}}

In 1965, news on [[Cuba]]n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]]. Similar demonstrations were then held also at other government buildings. The purpose was to protest the treatment of gay people in Cuba&lt;ref name=DB&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/fidel-castros-horrific-record-on-gay-rights|title=Fidel Castro's Horrific Record on Gay Rights|date=November 27, 2016|journal=Daily Beast|last1=Kirchick|first1=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jA8l8EYcnHsC&amp;pg=PA76| title = Rethinking the Gay and Lesbian Movement| author = Marc Stein| date = 2012| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0415874106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and US employment discrimination. These pickets shocked many gay people and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB.{{sfn|Marcus|2002|pp=105–108}}&lt;ref name="Blade"&gt;DiGuglielmo, Joey (October 20, 2011).

===Earlier resistance and riots===
{{Main|List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots}}
{{See also|Cooper Do-nuts Riot|Compton's Cafeteria riot}}
On the outer fringes of the few small gay communities were people who challenged gender expectations. They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people who dressed and lived in contrast to their [[sex assigned at birth]], either part or full-time. Contemporaneous nomenclature classified them as [[transvestite]]s and they were the most visible representatives of sexual minorities. They believed the carefully crafted image portrayed by the Mattachine Society and DOB asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal people.&lt;ref name="stryker"&gt;[[Susan Stryker|Stryker, Susan]] (Winter, 2008). "Transgender History, Homonormativity and Disciplinarity". ''Radical History Review'', pp. 145–157.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested for wearing clothing of the opposite gender as a parallel to the struggles of homophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate.

Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people staged a small [[Cooper Donuts Riot|riot at the Cooper Do-nuts]] cafe in Los Angeles in 1959 in response to police harassment.{{sfn|Faderman|Timmons|2006|pp=1–2}} In a larger 1966 event in San Francisco, drag queens, hustlers, and trans women&lt;ref&gt;Devor, Aaron and Ardel Haefele-Thomas (2019). ''Transgender: A Reference Handbook'', p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; were sitting in [[Compton's Cafeteria riot|Compton's Cafeteria]] when the police arrived to arrest people appearing to be physically male who were presenting as women. A riot ensued, with the cafeteria patrons slinging cups, plates, and saucers and breaking the [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|plexiglass]] windows in the front of the restaurant and returning several days later to smash the windows again after they were replaced.&lt;ref name="boyd"&gt;Boyd, Nan Alamilla (2004). "San Francisco" in the ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America'', Ed. Marc Stein. Vol. 3. Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 71–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Susan Stryker]] classifies the Compton's Cafeteria riot as an "act of anti-transgender discrimination, rather than an act of discrimination against sexual orientation" and connects the uprising to the issues of gender, race, and class that were being downplayed by homophile organizations.&lt;ref name="stryker"/&gt; It marked the beginning of [[transgender]] activism in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="boyd"/&gt;

===Greenwich Village===
[[File:Washington square park.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A color photograph of Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village|[[Washington Square Park]] in Greenwich Village]]

The [[Manhattan]] neighborhoods of Greenwich Village and [[Harlem]] were home to sizable gay and lesbian populations after [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], when people who had served in the military took advantage of the opportunity to settle in larger cities. The enclaves of gay men and lesbians, described by a newspaper story as "short-haired women and long-haired men", developed a distinct subculture through the following two decades.{{sfn|Edsall|2003|pp=253–254}} [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] inadvertently benefited gay establishments, as drinking alcohol was pushed underground along with other behaviors considered immoral. New York City passed laws against homosexuality in public and private businesses, but because alcohol was in high demand, [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]] and impromptu drinking establishments were so numerous and temporary that authorities were unable to police them all.{{sfn|Edsall|2003|pp=255–256}} However, police raids continued, resulting in the closure of iconic establishments such as [[Eve's Hangout]] in 1926.&lt;ref name=Gattuso&gt;{{cite web|last=Gattuso|first=Reina|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-was-first-gay-bar|title=The Founder of America's Earliest Lesbian Bar Was Deported for Obscenity|website=[[Atlas Obscura]]|date=September 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social repression of the 1950s resulted in a cultural revolution in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed-mindedness. Of them, [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.{{sfn|Adam|1987|pp=68–69}}

By the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]]. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=29–37}} [[Entrapment]] usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for [[solicitation]]. One story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=46}} Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|pp=116–117}}

The Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly elected mayor [[John Lindsay]] to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City. They had a more difficult time with the [[Alcohol laws of New York|New York State Liquor Authority]] (SLA). While no laws prohibited serving homosexuals, courts allowed the SLA discretion in approving and revoking liquor licenses for businesses that might become "disorderly".&lt;ref name="AmExpMafia"/&gt;{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=48}} Despite the high population of gay men and lesbians who called Greenwich Village home, very few places existed, other than bars, where they were able to congregate openly without being harassed or arrested. In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a "sip-in" at a Greenwich Village bar named [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]], which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Sharyn (June 17, 2008). [http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-06-17/news/before-stonewall/ "Before Stonewall: Remembering that, before the riots, there was a Sip-In"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712032306/http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-06-17/news/before-stonewall/ |date=July 12, 2011 }}. ''The Village Voice''. Retrieved on September 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the bars frequented by gay men and lesbians were owned by gay people. Almost all of them were owned and controlled by [[American Mafia|organized crime]], who treated the regulars poorly, watered down the liquor, and overcharged for drinks. However, they also paid off police to prevent frequent raids.&lt;ref name="AmExpMafia"/&gt;{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=181}}

The Stonewall Inn, located at 51 and 53 [[Christopher Street]], along with several other establishments in the city, was owned by the [[Genovese crime family]].{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=183}}&lt;ref name="AmExpMafia"/&gt; In 1966, three members of the Mafia invested $3,500 to turn the Stonewall Inn into a gay bar, after it had been a restaurant and a nightclub for heterosexuals. Once a week a police officer would collect envelopes of cash as a payoff known as a [[gayola]], as the Stonewall Inn had no [[liquor license]].{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=185}}{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=68}} It had no running water behind the bar—dirty glasses were run through tubs of water and immediately reused.&lt;ref name="AmExpMafia"/&gt;{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=181}} There were no fire exits, and the toilets overran consistently.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=80}} Though the bar was not used for prostitution, drug sales and other black market activities took place. It was the only bar for gay men in New York City where dancing was allowed;{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=182}} dancing was its main draw since its re-opening as a gay club.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=71}}

Visitors to the Stonewall Inn in 1969 were greeted by a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] who inspected them through a peephole in the door. The legal drinking age was 18 and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called "Lily Law", "Alice Blue Gown", or "Betty Badge"{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=187}}), visitors would have to be known by the doorman or 'look gay'. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private "bottle club", but they rarely signed their real names.&lt;ref name="AmExpMafia"/&gt; There were two dance floors in the Stonewall. The interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or [[black light]]s. If police were spotted, regular white lights were turned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=187}} In the rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by "queens"; it was one of two bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though dressed in men's clothing) could go.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=189}} Only a few people in full [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] were allowed in by the bouncers. The customers were "98 percent male" but a few lesbians sometimes came to the bar. Younger homeless adolescent males, who slept in nearby [[Christopher Park]], would often try to get in so customers would buy them drinks.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=188}} The age of the clientele ranged between the upper teens and early thirties and the racial mix was distributed among mainly white, with Black, and Hispanic patrons.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=189}}{{sfn|Deitcher|1995|p=70}} Because of its mix of people, its location, and the attraction of dancing, the Stonewall Inn was known by many as "''the'' gay bar in the city".{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=74}}

Police raids on gay bars were frequent, occurring on average once a month for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to facilitate resuming business as quickly as possible if alcohol was seized.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=183}}&lt;ref name="AmExpMafia"/&gt; Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|pp=192–193}} During a typical raid, the lights were turned on and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their [[Conscription|draft card]]s as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Typically, employees and management of the bars were also arrested.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|pp=192–193}} The period immediately before June&amp;nbsp;28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=124–125}}—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=4}}&lt;ref name="nyt62969"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Eskow |first=Dennis |title=4 Policemen Hurt in 'Village' Raid: Melee Near Sheridan Square Follows Action at Bar |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0DE5DB1639EF3BBC4151DFB0668382679EDE |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 29, 1969 |page=33}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[David Carter (historian)|David Carter]] presents information{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=96–103}} indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].&lt;ref name="AmExpMafia"/&gt; They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently.

===Police raid===

[[File:Stonewall Inn raid sign pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance.]]

Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen entered the bar early that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once ready, the undercover officers called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&amp;nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate.

At 1:20 a.m. on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen in dark suits, two patrol officers in uniform, Detective Charles Smythe, and Deputy Inspector [[Seymour Pine]] arrived at the Stonewall Inn's double doors and announced "Police! We're taking the place!"{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=137}} The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205 people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any people appearing to be physically male and dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those suspected of cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. All parties involved recall that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, started by police who assaulted some of the lesbians by "feeling some of them up inappropriately" while frisking them.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=141}}

{{Quote box |width=30em | align=left |quote=When did you ever see a fag fight back?{{nbsp}}... Now, times were a-changin'. Tuesday night was the last night for bullshit{{nbsp}}... Predominantly, the theme [w]as, "this shit has got to stop!"|salign=right|source=—anonymous Stonewall riots participant{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=143}}}}

The police were to transport the bar's alcohol in patrol wagons. Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15 minutes.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=142}} Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150 people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further.{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=2}}

When the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd—most of whom were homosexual—had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested and they all became very quiet.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=147}} Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, "Gay power!", someone began singing "[[We Shall Overcome]]" and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with "growing and intensive hostility".{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=147–148}} An officer shoved a person in drag, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse. The cop clubbed her over the head, as the crowd began to boo. Author [[Edmund White]], who had been passing by, recalled, "Everyone's restless, angry, and high-spirited. No one has a slogan, no one even has an attitude, but something's brewing."{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=148}} Pennies, then beer bottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that patrons still inside the bar were being beaten.

A scuffle broke out when a woman in handcuffs was escorted from the door of the bar to the waiting police wagon several times. She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as "a typical New York butch" and "a dyke–stone butch", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]] for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=196}} Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown ([[Stormé DeLarverie]] has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary&lt;ref name=Chu&gt;{{cite web|last=Chu |first=Grace |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/77167-an-interview-with-lesbian-stonewall-veteran-storm-delarverie|title=An interview with lesbian Stonewall veteran Stormé DeLarverie |publisher=AfterEllen.com |date=July 26, 2010 |access-date=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Accounts of people who witnessed the scene, including letters and news reports of the woman who fought with police, conflicted. Where witnesses claim one woman who fought her treatment at the hands of the police caused the crowd to become angry, some also remembered several "butch lesbians" had begun to fight back while still in the bar. At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar.{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=152–153}} Craig Rodwell{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=197}} claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: "there was just{{nbsp}}... a flash of group—of mass—anger."}}), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, "Why don't you guys do something?" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon,{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=152}} the crowd became a mob and became violent.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=151}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The night they busted Stonewall | author=Lucian K. Truscott IV | website=Salon | url=http://www.salon.com/2017/06/28/the-night-they-busted-stonewall/ | date=June 28, 2017 |access-date=July 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence breaks out===
The police tried to restrain some of the crowd, knocking a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses).{{refn|group=note|Witness Morty Manford stated, "There's no doubt in my mind that those people were deliberately left unguarded. I assume there was some sort of relationship between the bar management and the local police, so they really didn't want to arrest those people. But they had to at least look like they were doing their jobs."{{sfn|Marcus|2002|p= 128}} }}{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=154}} As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled, "Let's pay them off!"{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=156}} Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted "Pigs!" and "Faggot cops!" Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600 people, grabbed several people, including activist folk singer (and mentor of [[Bob Dylan]]) [[Dave Van Ronk]]—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: "As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me and that's why I stayed in{{nbsp}}... Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another."{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=156}} Van Ronk was the first of thirteen arrested that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|author=Lucian Truscott IV|website=Village Voice |date=July 3, 1969|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/voice_19690703_truscott.html|format=Transcript|access-date=May 24, 2019}} [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/voice1.html page scans]&lt;/ref&gt; Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, [[Howard Smith (director)|Howard Smith]] (a column writer for ''[[The Village Voice]]''), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.

Multiple accounts of the riot assert that there was no pre-existing organization or apparent cause for the demonstration; what ensued was spontaneous.{{refn|name="Garland"|group="note"|In the years since the riots occurred, the death of [[gay icon]] [[Judy Garland]] earlier in the week on June&amp;nbsp;22, 1969 has been attributed as a significant factor in the riots, but no participants in Saturday morning's demonstrations recall Garland's name being discussed. No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot. Only one contemporary account suggested it, an account by a heterosexual person ridiculing the riots.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=260}} Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square and said, "When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing."{{sfn|Deitcher|1995|p=72}}}} Michael Fader explained:{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=160}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place and it was not an organized demonstration{{nbsp}}... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us{{nbsp}}... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The only known photograph from the first night of the riots, taken by freelance photographer Joseph Ambrosini, shows the homeless gay youth who slept in nearby Christopher Park, scuffling with police. Jackie Hormona and [[Tommy Lanigan-Schmidt]] are on the far left.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=162}}&lt;ref name=Who&gt;{{Cite web |last=PBS |date=2010 |title=Who was at Stonewall? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/stonewall-participants/ |access-date=Oct 1, 2022 |website=American Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mattachine Society newsletter a month later offered its explanation of why the riots occurred: "It catered largely to a group of people who are not welcome in, or cannot afford, other places of homosexual social gathering{{nbsp}}... The Stonewall became home to these kids. When it was raided, they fought for it. That and the fact that they had nothing to lose other than the most tolerant and broadminded gay place in town, explains why."{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=13}}

Garbage cans, garbage, bottles, rocks, and bricks were hurled at the building, breaking the windows. Witnesses attest that "flame queens", hustlers, and gay "street kids"—the most outcast people in the gay community—were responsible for the first volley of projectiles, as well as the uprooting of a [[parking meter]] used as a [[battering ram]] on the doors of the Stonewall Inn.{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=163–165}}

The mob lit garbage on fire and stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was ineffective in dispersing the crowd and seemed only to encourage them.{{sfn|Deitcher|1995|p=67}} [[Marsha P. Johnson]] later said that it was the police that had started the fire in the bar.&lt;ref name=MarshaInterview/&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Sylvia Rivera]] reported being handed a [[Molotov cocktail]] and throwing it (there were no eyewitness accounts of Molotov cocktails the first night although many fires were set).{{sfn|Deitcher|1995|p=67}} In 2019, David Carter admitted that this account of Rivera's actions was fabricated and that multiple witnesses over the years, including [[Marsha P. Johnson]], had all agreed that Rivera had not been present at the uprising.&lt;ref name="StonewallMyths"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaytoday.com/interview/070104in.asp|title=David Carter: Historian of The Stonewall Riots|publisher=Gay Today|author=Paul D.

Another Stonewall veteran, [[Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt]], claimed that he wanted Carter to include Rivera "so that young Puerto Rican transgender people on the street would have a role model."&lt;ref name="StonewallMyths"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gaycitynews.com/exploding-the-myths-of-stonewall/ |title=Exploding the Myths of Stonewall |author=Carter, David |date=June 27, 2019 |access-date=June 29, 2019 |archive-date=January 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200125092524/https://www.gaycitynews.com/exploding-the-myths-of-stonewall/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kohler and Rivera had a discussion over whether Kohler would back Rivera's claims to Carter for the book, Rivera asked Kohler to say that Rivera threw a Molotov cocktail. Kohler responded, "Sylvia, you didn't throw a Molotov cocktail!" Rivera continued to bargain with him, asking if he'd say she threw the first brick. He replied, "Sylvia, you didn't throw a brick." The first bottle? He still refused. Finally, Kohler agreed to lie and say Rivera had been there and had at some point thrown ''a'' bottle.&lt;ref name="StonewallMyths"/&gt;}} When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by [[plywood]] by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if he might have to use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt [[Charcoal lighter fluid|lighter fluid]] into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, [[siren (alarm)|sirens]] were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45 minutes.{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=3}} 

When the violence broke out, the women and transmasculine people being held down the street at [[New York Women's House of Detention|The Women's House of Detention]] joined in by chanting, setting fire to their belongings and tossing them into the street below. The historian Hugh Ryan says, "When I would talk to people about Stonewall, they would tell me, that night on Stonewall, we looked to the prison because we saw the women rioting and chanting, "Gay rights, gay rights, gay rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2022-05-10 |title=Before Stonewall: The Women's House of Detention Changed Queer History |url=https://www.advocate.com/books/2022/5/09/hugh-ryan-lgbtq-history-women-house-detention |access-date=2022-05-13 |website=www.advocate.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escalation===
The [[Riot control|Tactical Patrol Force]] (TPF) of the New York City Police Department arrived to free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut and a few others were bruised from being struck by flying debris. [[Bob Kohler]], who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: "I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over{{nbsp}}... The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been because everybody else had rioted{{nbsp}}... but the fairies were not supposed to riot{{nbsp}}... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill."{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=175}} With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, "Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon." His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, "All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously."{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=174}}

The TPF formed a [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] and attempted to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu [[kick line]]s and sang to the tune of "[[Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay]]": "We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair."{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=5}}&lt;ref&gt;Sara Warner (2012). ''Acts of Gaiety: LGBT Performance and the Politics of Pleasure''. p. 17 {{ISBN|0472118536}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some references have the last line as "...{{nbsp}}pubic hairs" instead.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucian Truscott IV|Lucian Truscott]] reported in ''The Village Voice'': "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery in the form of a [[chorus line]] facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay power[-]ites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue."{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=6}} One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, "The police rushed us and that's when I realized this is not a good thing to do, because they got me in the back with a [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]]." Another account stated, "I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [nightsticks] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing{{nbsp}}... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo{{nbsp}}... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line."{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=178}}

[[Craig Rodwell]], owner of the [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop|Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]], reported watching police chase participants through the crooked streets, only to see them appear around the next corner behind the police. Members of the mob stopped cars, overturning one of them to block Christopher Street. [[Jack Nichols (activist)|Jack Nichols]] and [[Lige Clarke]], in their column printed in ''[[Screw (magazine)|Screw]]'', declared that "massive crowds of angry protesters chased [the police] for blocks screaming, 'Catch them!{{'"}}{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=6}}

By 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or gathered nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be "electricity in the air".{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=180}} One commented: "There was a certain beauty in the aftermath of the riot{{nbsp}}... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of people really were gay and, you know, this was our street."{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=181}} Thirteen people had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized,{{refn|group=note|One protester needed stitches to repair a knee broken by a nightstick; another lost two fingers in a car door. Witnesses recollect that some of the most "feminine boys" were beaten badly.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|pp=201–202.}} }} and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn that night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, [[jukebox]]es, and cigarette machines were all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police.{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=3}}{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=202}}

===Second night of rioting===
During the siege of the Stonewall, Craig Rodwell called ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''New York Post'', and the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' to tell them what was happening. All three papers covered the riots; the ''Daily News'' placed coverage on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the [[Students for a Democratic Society]], the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], or triggered by "a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes".{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=4}} All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn. [[Graffiti]] appeared on the walls of the bar, declaring "Drag power", "They invaded our rights", "Support gay power" and "Legalize gay bars", along with accusations of police looting and—regarding the status of the bar—"We are open."{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04EFDB1E3AEE34BC4850DFB0668382679EDE |title=Police Again Rout Village Youths: Outbreak by 400 Follows a Near-Riot Over Raid |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 30, 1969 |page=22}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next night, rioting again surrounded Christopher Street; participants remember differently which night was more frantic or violent. Many of the same people returned from the previous evening—hustlers, street youths, and "queens"—but they were joined by "police provocateurs", curious bystanders, and even tourists.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=184}} Remarkable to many was the sudden exhibition of homosexual affection in public, as described by one witness: "From going to places where you had to knock on a door and speak to someone through a peephole in order to get in. We were just out. We were in the streets."{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=185}}

Thousands of people had gathered in front of the Stonewall, which had opened again, choking Christopher Street until the crowd spilled into adjoining blocks. The throng surrounded buses and cars, harassing the occupants unless they either admitted they were gay or indicated their support for the demonstrators.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=186}} [[Marsha P. Johnson]] was seen climbing a lamppost and dropping a heavy bag onto the hood of a police car, shattering the windshield.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|pp=204–205}} 

As on the previous evening, fires were started in garbage cans throughout the neighborhood. More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Ninth [[Organization of the New York City Police Department#Police precincts|Precinct]]s, but after 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. the TPF arrived again. Kick lines and police chases waxed and waned; when police captured demonstrators, whom the majority of witnesses described as "sissies" or "swishes", the crowd surged to recapture them.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=191}} Again, street battling ensued until 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|pp=204–205}}

Beat poet and longtime Greenwich Village resident Allen Ginsberg lived on Christopher Street and happened upon the jubilant chaos. After he learned of the riot that had occurred the previous evening, he stated, "Gay power! Isn't that great!{{nbsp}}... It's about time we did something to assert ourselves" and visited the open Stonewall Inn for the first time. While walking home, he declared to Lucian Truscott, "You know, the guys there were so beautiful—they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10 years ago."{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=7}}

===Leaflets, press coverage, and more violence===
Activity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday and Tuesday, partly due to rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. Craig Rodwell and his partner [[Fred Sargeant]] took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: "Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars." The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the "intolerable situation".{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=205}}{{sfn|Teal|1971|pp=8–9}}

Not everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. [[Randy Wicker]], who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the "screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals{{nbsp}}... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap."{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=207}} Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a "sleaze joint", as advantageous to the Village.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=206}}

On Wednesday, however, ''The Village Voice'' ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: "forces of faggotry", "limp wrists" and "Sunday fag follies".&lt;ref name="Truscott"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uuwjAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6710,4693&amp;dq=stonewall+inn&amp;hl=en|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|last=Truscott|first=Lucian|date=July 3, 1969|work=The Village Voice|page=1|access-date=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at ''The Village Voice'' reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery. Author Edmund White insists that Smith and Truscott were trying to assert their own heterosexuality by referring to the events and people in derogatory terms.}} A mob descended upon Christopher Street once again and threatened to burn down the offices of ''The Village Voice''. Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, local shops getting looted, and arrests of five people.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|pp=208–209}}{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=203–205}} The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour and were summarized by one witness: "The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression."{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=205}}

==Aftermath==

The feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picket in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], called the [[Annual Reminder]]. Organizers [[Craig Rodwell]], [[Frank Kameny]], [[Randy Wicker]], [[Barbara Gittings]], and [[Kay Lahusen]], who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties and all marched quietly in organized lines.{{sfn|Marcus|2002|pp=105–107}} This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, "None of that! None of that!" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches.{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=216–217}}{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=210}} Participant [[Lilli Vincenz]] remembered, "It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered."{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=216–217}} Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=211}}

[[File:Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner, c1972 (7374381322).jpg|thumb|Gay rights demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a basement classroom at the [[London School of Economics]] on October 13, 1970. The organization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities, leading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972.]]

===Gay Liberation Front===
Although the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, "The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World."{{sfn|LaFrank|1999|p=17}}{{refn|group=note|"Hairpin drop" was [[gay slang]] that meant to drop hints about one's sexual orientation.{{sfn|LaFrank|1999|p=17}}}} When a Mattachine officer suggested an "amicable and sweet" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, "Sweet! ''Bullshit!'' That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play."{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=19}} With a flyer announcing: "Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!",{{sfn|Teal|1971|p=19}} the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use ''gay'' in its name. Previous organizations such as the [[Mattachine Society]], the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB), and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.{{sfn|Clendinen|1999|p=31}}

The rise of militancy became apparent to Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings—who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles—when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, "I'm gay. That's why I'm here."{{sfn|Marcus|2002|p=136}} The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|antiwar]] demonstrators with the ideal that they "could work to restructure American society".{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=216}} They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the [[New York Women's House of Detention|Women's House of Detention]] in support of [[Afeni Shakur]] and other radical [[New Left]] causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=220–221}}

===Gay Activists Alliance===
Within six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called ''Gay''; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city—''The Village Voice''—refused to print the word ''gay'' in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers.{{sfn|Clendinen|1999|p=40}} Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: ''Come Out!'' and ''Gay Power''; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=242}}{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=235}}

GLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=220}} In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA). The GAA was to be more orderly and entirely focused on gay issues. Their constitution began, "We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings."{{sfn|Clendinen|1999|pp=50–51}} The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a [[Zap (action)|zap]]: they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped and mayor John Lindsay was zapped several times—once on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience.{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=245–246}}

Police raids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, deputy inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided and 167 people were arrested. One of them was [[Diego Viñales]], an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be [[deported]] as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} spike fence.{{sfn|Carter|2004|pp=238–239}} The ''New York Daily News'' printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=242}} They also sponsored a letter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and congressman [[Ed Koch]] sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city.{{sfn|Teal|1971|pp=106–108}}

The Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=252}}

===Gay Pride===
{{main|NYC Pride March#Origins}}

Christopher Street Liberation Day, on June 28, 1970, marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in Los Angeles and [[Chicago]], these were the first [[Pride parade|Gay Pride marches]] in US history.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|pp=278–279}}&lt;ref&gt;De la Croix, Sukie (2007). [http://www.chicagofreepress.com/node/1945 "Gay power: A History of Chicago Pride"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729073555/http://www.chicagofreepress.com/node/1945 |date=July 29, 2009 }} ''Chicago Free Press''. Retrieved on June 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Gay Pride marches took place in [[Boston]], [[Dallas]], [[Milwaukee]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[West Berlin]] and [[Stockholm]].{{sfn|LaFrank|1999|p=20}} The [[LGBT Pride March (New York City)|march in New York]] covered 51 blocks, from Christopher Street to [[Central Park]]. The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers.{{sfn|Clendinen|1999|pp=62–64}} ''The New York Times'' reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15 city blocks.&lt;ref name="fosburgh"&gt;Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970). [https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/29/archives/thousands-of-homosexuals-hold-a-protest-rally-in-central-park.html "Thousands of Homosexuals Hold A Protest Rally in Central Park"]. ''The New York Times'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting by ''The Village Voice'' was positive, describing "the out-front resistance that grew out of the police raid on the Stonewall Inn one year ago".{{sfn|LaFrank|1999|p=20}}

{{Quote box |width=30em | align=right |qalign=left |quote=There was little open animosity and some bystanders applauded when a tall, pretty girl carrying a sign "I am a Lesbian" walked by.|salign=right|source=—''The New York Times'' coverage of Gay Liberation Day, 1970&lt;ref name="fosburgh"/&gt;}}

By 1972, the participating cities included [[Atlanta]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Detroit]], Washington, D.C., [[Miami]], [[Minneapolis]], and Philadelphia,&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; as well as San Francisco.

Frank Kameny soon realized the pivotal change brought by the Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different from them. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the US government.{{sfn|Cain|2007|pp=91–92}} Ten people marched with Kameny then and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, "By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there were at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred."{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=251}}

Similar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as "one of the greatest mistakes of his life".{{sfn|Clendinen|1999|p=25}} The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, "stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals".{{sfn|Clendinen|1999|p=25}} Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, "Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement{{nbsp}}... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly, it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale."{{sfn|LaFrank|1999|p=21}} David Carter, in his article "What made Stonewall different", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so significant was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=What made Stonewall Different |journal=The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=11–13 |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-509/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trans organizations ===
According to [[Susan Stryker]]'s book, Transgender History, the Stonewall riots had significant effects on trans rights activism. [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Marsha P. Johnson]] established the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) organization, as they believed that trans people weren't being adequately represented in the Gay Activists Alliance and Gay Liberation Front. They established politicized versions of "houses", which came from Black and Latino queer communities, and became the "mothers of the houses" there. These houses were places that marginalized trans youth could seek shelter in.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Transgender History |publisher=Seal Press. |year=2021 |isbn=9781580056892 |pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides STAR, organizations such as [[Transvestites and Transsexuals]] (TAT) and [[Queens Liberation Front|Queens' Liberation Front]] (QLF) were also established. QLF, which was established by drag queen Lee Brewster and heterosexual transvestite Bunny Eisenhower, marched in Christopher Street Liberation Day and fought against drag erasure and for trans visibility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legacy==
The Stonewall riots are often considered to be the origin or impetus of the [[gay liberation]] movement, and many studies of [[LGBT history]] in the U.S. are divided into pre- and post-Stonewall analyses.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Movements and Memory: The Making of the Stonewall Myth|journal = American Sociological Review|volume = 71|issue = 5|pages = 724–751|jstor = 25472425|last1 = Armstrong|first1 = Elizabeth A.|last2 = Crage|first2 = Suzanna M.|s2cid = 144545934|year = 2006|doi = 10.1177/000312240607100502}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has been criticized by [[History of human sexuality|historians of sexuality]]. Calls for the rights of [[Sexual minorities|gender and sexual minorities]] predate the Stonewall riots,{{refn|group=note|The [[first homosexual movement]] began one hundred years earlier, in Germany}} and there was already the emergence of a gay liberation movement in New York at the time of the riots. The Stonewall riots were not the only time LGBT people organized politically amid attacks on LGBT establishments. However, the event has been said to occupy a unique place in the [[collective memory]] of many LGBT people,&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt; including those outside of the United States,&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Griffiths |first1=Craig |title=The Ambivalence of Gay Liberation: Male Homosexual Politics in 1970s West Germany |date=February 2021 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-886896-5 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nb8cEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it "is marked by an international commemorative ritual – an annual gay pride parade", according to sociologist Elizabeth A. Armstrong.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;

[[File:Stonewall was a riot.jpg|thumb|Banner reading "Stonewall was a riot" pictured during Berlin Pride, 2009]]
Within two years of the Stonewall riots, there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as in Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.{{sfn|Adam|1987|p=82}} People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]]. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place.{{sfn|Marcus|2002|pp=152–155}} Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after [[Barbara Gittings]] exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist [[Jean O'Leary]] protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by [[cross-dressers]] and [[drag queen]]s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Lee Brewster]] jumped on the stage and shouted "You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you and ''these bitches'' tell us to quit being ourselves!"{{sfn|Clendinen|1999|pp=171–172}} Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=236}}

[[File:Stockholm Pride Parade - Anarchist block - 2726504058.jpg|thumb|[[Queer anarchism|Queer anarchists]] at [[Stockholm Pride|Stockholm pride]] with banner reading "Remember Stonewall"]]
O'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain.{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=236}} Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [[Tarrytown, New York|upstate New York]].&lt;ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95&gt;{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275|title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier|time=Repeatedly throughout interview}} September 21, 1995. Accessed July 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; She later returned to the city in the mid-1990s, after the 1992 death of friend [[Marsha P. Johnson]]. Rivera lived on the "gay pier" at the end of Christopher street and advocated for homeless members of the gay community.&lt;ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95/&gt;&lt;ref name=RiveraInterview2&gt;{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275 |title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier |time=14:17}} September 21, 1995. Accessed July 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial disagreements among participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now."{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=236}} "It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?"{{sfn|Marcus|2002|p=156}}

O'Leary was referring to the [[Lavender Menace]], an appellation by [[Second-wave feminism| second-wave feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] based on attempts by members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, [[Rita Mae Brown]] and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.{{sfn|Adam|1987|pp=90–91}}

The growth of [[lesbian feminism]] in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women that they saw in heterosexual men.{{sfn|Faderman|1991|pp=211–212}} The issues most important to gay men—[[entrapment]] and public solicitation—were not shared by lesbians. In 1977, a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what [[Adrienne Rich]] termed "the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars".{{sfn|Faderman|1991|pp=211–212}} Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining, "It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena."{{sfn|Faderman|1991|pp=211–212}}

Throughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the "zap" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). At a conference on [[behavior modification]], during a film demonstrating the use of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to decrease same-sex attraction, [[Morris Kight]] and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of "Torture!" and "Barbarism!"&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|Retter|2003|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20 psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt; When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought [[John E. Fryer]], a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973—in large part due to the efforts of gay activists—the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.{{sfn|Marcus|2002|pp=146–147}}{{sfn|Cain|2007|p=65}}

Gay men and lesbians came together to work in [[grassroots]] political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named [[Save Our Children]] staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida| Miami-Dade County]]. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, that same year, a campaign in California called the [[Briggs Initiative]], designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.{{sfn|Cain|2007|p=275}} Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.{{sfn|Fejes|2008|p=214}} The subsequent 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] was timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the Stonewall riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghaziani|first=Amin|year=2008|title=The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28995-3|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection of prior gay subculture===

The Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior [[LGBT culture|gay and lesbian culture]], such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian [[Martin Duberman]] writes, "The decades preceding Stonewall{{nbsp}}... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland."{{sfn|Duberman|1993|p=xv}} Sociologist [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]] notes, "Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?"{{sfn|Adam|1987|p=93}} In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of [[butch and femme]] that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: "all role playing is sick."{{sfn|Adam|1987|p=94}} Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.{{sfn|Faderman|1991|p=232}} Some women, according to [[Lillian Faderman]], were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.{{sfn|Faderman|1991|pp=210, 266}}

Author Michael Bronski highlights the "attack on pre-Stonewall culture", particularly [[Gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]] for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as "an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men",{{sfn|Bronski|2003|p=16}} have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the notion that the rejection was motivated by political correctness, Bronski writes, "gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past."{{sfn|Bronski|2003|p=12}}

===Lasting impact and recognition===
[[File:Stonewall Inn 5 pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the Stonewall taken recently, showing a smaller plate glass window in a portion of the 1969 building|The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the [[Stonewall Inn]] was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]

The riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of "exploitation and degradation".{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=264}} The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the "ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality".{{sfn|Carter|2004|p=266}} Historian Nicholas Edsall writes:{{sfn|Edsall|2003|p=333}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall, radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and [[Adam Nagourney]] write:{{sfn|Clendinen|1999|p=12}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else{{nbsp}}... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance{{nbsp}}... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historian [[Lillian Faderman]] calls the riots the "shot heard round the world", explaining, "The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they."{{sfn|Faderman|1991|p=195}}

[[Joan Nestle]] co-founded the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] in 1974 and credits "its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets."{{sfn|LaFrank|1999|p=17}} Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall{{nbsp}}... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure{{nbsp}}... Certainly, something special happened on that night in 1969 and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin{{nbsp}}... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.{{sfn|Deitcher|1995|p=74}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The events of the early morning of June 28, 1969, were not the first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966 and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' [[Black Cat Tavern]] in 1967.{{sfn|Witt et al.|1995|p=210}} However, several circumstances were in play that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the [[Lower Manhattan]] raid was a factor: it was across the street from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters an advantage over the police.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt; Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community in the weeks and months after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual [[Gay Pride]] events around the world.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt;

[[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] (officially Stonewall Equality Limited) is an [[LGBT rights]] charity in the United Kingdom, founded in 1989 and named after the [[Stonewall Inn]] because of the Stonewall riots. The [[Stonewall Awards]] is an annual event the charity has held since 2006 to recognize people who have affected the lives of British lesbian, gay, and bisexual people.

The middle of the 1990s was marked by the inclusion of [[Bisexuality|bisexual]]s as a represented group within the gay community, when they successfully sought to be included on the platform of the 1993 [[March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation]]. Transgender people also asked to be included but were not, though trans-inclusive language was added to the march's list of demands.&lt;ref&gt;Schalger, Neil, (ed.) (1997). ''Gay and Lesbian Almanac''. St. James Press. {{ISBN|1-55862-358-2}} pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; The transgender community continued to find itself simultaneously welcome and at odds with the gay community as attitudes about [[non-binary gender|non-binary gender discrimination]] and [[pansexuality|pansexual orientation]] developed and came increasingly into conflict.&lt;ref name="stryker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;Thompson, Kara (2004). "Transsexuals, Transvestites, Transgender People and Cross-Dressers" in ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America'', Ed. Marc Stein. Vol. 3. Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. pp. 203–208.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, New York City celebrated "Stonewall 25" with a march that went past the [[United Nations Headquarters]] and into [[Central Park]]. Estimates put the attendance at 1.1&amp;nbsp;million people.{{sfn|LaFrank|1999|p=22}} [[Sylvia Rivera]] led an alternate march in New York City in 1994 to protest the exclusion of transgender people from the events.&lt;ref name="pride" /&gt; 

Attendance at LGBT Pride events has grown substantially over the decades. Most large cities around the world now have some kind of Pride demonstration; Pride events in some cities mark the largest annual celebration of any kind.&lt;ref name="pride"&gt;"Pride Marches and Parades", in ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender History in America'', Marc Stein, ed. (2004), Charles Scribner's Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing trend towards commercializing marches into parades—with events receiving corporate sponsorship—has caused concern about taking away the autonomy of the original grassroots demonstrations that put inexpensive activism in the hands of individuals.&lt;ref name="pride"/&gt;

[[Frank Rich]] noted in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that no federal legislation exists to protect the rights of gay Americans. An editorial in the ''[[Washington Blade]]'' compared the scruffy, violent activism during and following the Stonewall riots to the lackluster response to failed promises given by President Obama; for being ignored, wealthy LGBT activists reacted by promising to give less money to Democratic causes.&lt;ref&gt;Naff, Kevin (June 26, 2009).

Individual states continue to battle with homophobia. The [[Missouri Senate]] passed a measure its supporters characterize as a religious freedom bill that could change the state's constitution despite Democrats' objections and their 39-hour [[filibuster]]. This bill allows the "protection of certain religious organizations and individuals from being penalized by the state because of their sincere religious beliefs or practices concerning marriage between two persons of the same sex" discriminating against homosexual patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://legiscan.com/MO/research/SJR39/2016|title=Missouri SJR39 {{!}} 2016 {{!}} Regular Session|website=LegiScan|access-date=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama also referenced the Stonewall riots in a call for full equality during his [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|second inaugural address]] on January 21, 2013:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths—that all of us are created equal—is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall{{nbsp}}... Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.&lt;ref name=michelson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Throughout June 2019, [[Stonewall 50 – WorldPride NYC 2019]], produced by [[Heritage of Pride]] in partnership with the [[I Love New York]] program's LGBT division, took place in New York to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising.
