{{main|Pluralism|Multiculturalism}}
'''Cultural pluralism''' exists when all groups within a larger society maintain their unique cultural identities. In a pluralist culture, unique groups not only coexist side by side, but also consider qualities of other groups as traits worth having in the dominant culture.  For example, a community center in the United States may offer classes in Indian [[yoga]], Chinese [[calligraphy]], and Latin [[salsa dancing]].  That city may also house  one or more [[synagogue]]s, [[mosque]]s, [[mandir]]s, [[gurudwara]]s, and/or [[Buddhist temple]]s, as well as several churches of various [[Christian]] denominations.  

The existence of such institutions and practices is possible because the cultural communities responsible for them are protected by law and accepted by the larger society in a pluralist culture.  Cultural pluralism is a necessary consequence of a flourishing and peaceful democratic society, because of its tolerance and respect for cultural and ethnic diversity.

The term cultural pluralism was coined by the American philosopher [[Horace Kallen]].  Another thinker who helped shape this notion include [[Randolph Bourne]].
