'''Cultural pluralism''' is a term used when small groups within a larger society maintain their unique cultural identities. One of the most notable cultural pluralisms is the [[caste system]], which is related to [[Hinduism]]. 

Another example is [[Lebanon]] where 18 different religious communities co-exist on a land of 10,452 km². In a pluralist culture, unique groups not only co-exist side by side, but also consider qualities of other groups as traits worth having in the dominant culture. 

The current [[contemporary art]] world in the 21st century is an example of cultural pluralism. For another example, a community center in the United States may offer classes in Indian [[yoga]], Chinese [[calligraphy]], and Latin [[salsa dancing]]. That community may also have one or more [[synagogue]]s, [[mosque]]s, [[mandir]]s, [[gurudwara]]s, and/or [[Buddhist temple]]s, as well as several churches of various [[Christian]] denominations.

The existence of such institutions and practices are possible if the cultural communities responsible for them are protected by law and/or accepted by the larger society in a pluralist culture. 
  
The idea of cultural pluralism in America has its roots in the [[transcendentalist]] movement and was developed by [[pragmatist]] philosophers such as [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]], and later thinkers such as [[Horace Kallen]] and [[Randolph Bourne]].  One of the most famous articulations of cultural pluralistic ideas can be found in Bourne's 1916 essay "Trans-National America" .&lt;ref&gt;Science Encyclopedia [http://science.jrank.org/pages/10750/Pluralism-Cultural-Pluralism.html Cultural Pluralism] Retrieved on May 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
