As a [[Sociology|sociological]] term, the definition and description of cultural pluralism has evolved over time. It has been described as not only a fact but a societal goal.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Hazard and Madelon Stent, "Cultural Pluralism and Schooling: Some Preliminary Observations," Cultural Pluralism in Education: A Mandate for Change, eds. Madelon Stent, William R. Hazard and Harry N. Revlin (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1973), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pluralist culture ==
In a pluralist culture, groups not only coexist side by side, but also consider qualities of other groups as traits worth having in the dominant culture. Pluralistic societies place strong expectations of [[Social integration|integration]] on members, rather than expectations of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. The existence of such institutions and practices is possible if the cultural communities are accepted by the larger society in a pluralist culture and sometimes require the protection of the law. Often the acceptance of a culture may require that the new or minority culture remove some aspects of their culture which is incompatible with the laws or values of the dominant culture. Some pluralists such as Hamed Kazemzadeh argues that the concept of pluralist culture was prevalent since ancient times. Even the Achaemenid Empire which founded by Cyrus the Great successfully followed a policy of incorporating and tolerating various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/43891648/Pluralism_in_Ideological_Peacebuilding |title= Hamed Kazemzadeh: Pluralism in Ideological Peacebuilding }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Distinction from multiculturalism ==
Cultural pluralism is distinct from [[multiculturalism]], which lacks the requirement of a dominant culture. If the dominant culture is weakened, societies can easily pass from cultural pluralism into multiculturalism without any intentional steps being taken by that society. If communities function separately from each other, or compete with one another, they are not considered culturally pluralistic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1971, the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] referred to cultural pluralism, as opposed to multiculturalism, as the "very essence" of the nation's identity.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons. 8 October 1971. ''Debates, [[28th Canadian Parliament|28th Parliament]], 3rd Session, Volume 8''. Ottawa: [[Library and Archives Canada]]. via  ''"''[http://www.pier21.ca/research/immigration-history/canadian-multiculturalism-policy-1971 Canadian Multicultural Policy 1971]." ''[[Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural pluralism can be practiced at varying degrees by a group or an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Haug, Marie R. 1967. "Social and Cultural Pluralism as a Concept in Social System Analysis." ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' 73(3):294–304. {{JSTOR|2776029}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent example of pluralism is 20th-century [[United States]], in which a dominant culture with strong elements of [[nationalism]], a sporting culture, and an artistic culture contained also smaller groups with their own ethnic, religious, and cultural norms.{{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}  

== History ==
The notion of cultural pluralism in the United States has its roots in the [[transcendentalist movement]], and was developed by [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophers such as [[Horace Kallen]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]]. [[Randolph Bourne]], a later theorist, provided one of the most famous articulations of cultural pluralism through his 1916 essay, "Trans-National America".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://science.jrank.org/pages/10750/Pluralism-Cultural-Pluralism.html Cultural Pluralism]." ''Science Encyclopedia''. Retrieved on 31 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kallen is widely credited as being the originator of the concept of cultural pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;Toll, William. 1997. "Horace M. Kallen: Pluralism and American Jewish Identity." ''[[American Jewish History]]'' 85(1):57–74. {{Doi|10.1353/ajh.1997.0007}}. {{Project MUSE|422}}. [https://web.archive.org/web/20180602122352/http://muse.jhu.edu/article/422 Excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton R. Konvitz|Konvitz, Milton Ridvas]], ed. 1987. ''The Legacy of Horace M. Kallen''. [[Associated University Presses]]. {{ISBN|0-8386-3291-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanday, Peggy R. 1976. ''Anthropology and the Public Interest''. New York: [[Academic Press]]. {{ISBN|0-12-617650-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His 1915 essay in ''[[The Nation]]'', titled "Democracy versus the Melting Pot", was written as an argument against the concept of the '[[Americanization]]' of European immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace Kallen|Kallen, Horace]]. 18-25 February 1915. "Democracy Versus the Melting Pot." ''[[The Nation]]'' 100(2590):190–94, 217–20.&lt;/ref&gt; He coined the term ''cultural pluralism'', itself, in 1924 through his ''Culture and Democracy in the United States''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace Kallen|Kallen, Horace]]. 1924. ''Culture and Democracy in the United States''. New York: [[Boni &amp; Liveright]]. pp. 126–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the concept was further explored by [[Merwin Crawford Young]] in ''The Politics of Cultural Pluralism''. Young's work, in [[African studies]], emphasizes the flexibility of the definition of cultural pluralism within a society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Merwin Crawford Young|Young, Merwin Crawford]]. 1976. ''The Politics of Cultural Pluralism''. [[University of Wisconsin Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; More recent advocates include moral and [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] [[Richard Shweder]].

A 1976 article in the ''Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare'' offered a redefinition of cultural pluralism, described as a social condition in which communities of different cultures live together and function in an open system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[[Antonia Pantoja|Pantoja, Antonia]], Wilhelmina Perry, and Barbara Blourock. 1976. "[https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/jssw/vol4/iss1/11/ Towards the Development of Theory: Cultural Pluralism Redefined]." ''The Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare'' 4(1):11. {{ISSN|0191-5096}}.
