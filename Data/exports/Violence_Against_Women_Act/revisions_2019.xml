The '''Violence Against Women Act of 1994''' ('''VAWA''') was a [[United States federal law]] (Title IV, sec. 40001-40703 of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], {{USBill|103|hr|3355}}) signed as {{USPL|103|322}} by [[US President|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on September 13, 1994 (codified in part at 42 U.S.C. sections 13701 through 14040). The Act provided $1.6 billion toward investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women, imposed automatic and mandatory restitution on those convicted, and allowed civil redress in cases prosecutors chose to leave un-prosecuted. The Act also established the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] within the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

VAWA was cosponsored by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Joe Biden]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Delaware|DE]]) and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Orrin Hatch]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Utah|UT]]) (R-UT) in 1994 and gained support from a broad coalition of advocacy groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/2014_vawa_report.pdf|title=Report: 1 Is Too Many: Twenty Years Fighting Violence Against Women and Girls from The White House|author=|date=|website=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=May 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act passed through [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] with bipartisan support in 1994, clearing the [[United States House of Representatives]] by a vote of 235–195 and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by a vote of 61–38, although the following year House [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] attempted to cut the Act's funding.&lt;ref name="wp-funding"&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Washington Post]] | title = House GOP Budget Cutters Try to Limit Domestic Violence Programs | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/07/15/house-gop-budget-cutters-try-to-limit-domestic-violence-programs/b823092c-17a6-4c8c-9b4c-eb16433682bb/ | first = Kenneth | last = Cooper | accessdate = April 19, 2012 | date = July 15, 1995 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120724235532/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18605326.html?dids=18605326:18605326&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+15%2C+1995&amp;author=Kenneth+J.+Cooper&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=House+GOP+Budget+Cutters+Try+to+Limit+Domestic+Violence+Programs | archivedate = July 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000 [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'', a sharply divided Court struck down the VAWA provision allowing women the right to sue their attackers in federal court. By a 5–4 majority, the Court overturned the provision as exceeding the federal government's powers under the [[Commerce Clause]].&lt;ref name="cnn-scotus"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[CNN]] |title=Supreme Court strikes down Violence Against Women Act |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/05/15/scotus.violence/index.html |first=Charles |last=Bierbauer |date=May 18, 2000 |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213025814/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/05/15/scotus.violence/index.html |archivedate=February 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | first = Linda | last = Greenhouse | authorlink = Linda Greenhouse | title = Women lose right to sue attackers in federal court | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/16/us/supreme-court-court-federalism-women-lose-right-sue-attackers-federal-court.html | date = May 16, 2000 | accessdate = April 19, 2012 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120205202556/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/16/us/supreme-court-court-federalism-women-lose-right-sue-attackers-federal-court.html | archivedate = February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VAWA was reauthorized by bipartisan majorities in Congress in 2000 and again in December 2005. The Act's 2012 renewal was opposed by [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republicans, who objected to extending the Act's protections to [[same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] and to provisions allowing battered [[illegal immigration to the United States|undocumented immigrants]] to claim [[visa (document)|temporary visas]], but it was reauthorized in 2013, after a long legislative battle. As a result of the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019]], the Violence Against Women Act expired on December 21, 2018. It was temporarily reinstated via a short-term spending bill on January 25, 2019, but expired again on February 15, 2019. The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed a bill reauthorizing VAWA in April 2019 and includes new provisions protecting [[transgender]] victims and banning individuals convicted of domestic abuse from purchasing [[firearm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/04/politics/house-passes-violence-against-women-act-reauthorization/index.html|title=House passes reauthorization of Violence Against Women Act|publisher=CNN|date=April 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to reach a bipartisan agreement, [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[Joni Ernst]] (R-IA) and [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA) led months of negotiation talks that came to a halt in November 2019. Senator Joni Ernst has said she plans to introduce a new version of the bill and hopes it will pass in the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/senate-talks-bipartisan-violence-women-act-break|title=Senate talks on crafting bipartisan Violence Against Women Act break down|publisher=RollCall|date=Nov 7, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House version of VAWA, H.R. 1585, currently does not include any federal penalties for [[Female Genital Mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1585/text|title=H.R.1585 - Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019|date=April 10, 2019|publisher=US Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], an estimated 513,000 women and girls in the U.S. are at risk of FGM or have already undergone the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-645|title=FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION/CUTTING:Existing Federal Efforts to Increase Awareness Should Be Improved|date=August 1, 2016|publisher=US GAO}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Independent Women's Forum]] has urged Congress to include provisions enhancing penalties for female genital mutilation as well as funding to combat FGM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iwf.org/FGM-in-VAWA|title=Female Genital Mutilation is Violence Against Women|publisher=IWF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House version also does not include measures to deter honor killings, sex trafficking or forced child marriages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Background==
{{more citations needed section|date=October 2018}}
The [[World Conference on Human Rights]], held in Vienna, Austria, in 1993, and the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in the same year, concluded that civil society and governments have acknowledged that [[domestic violence]] is a public health policy and [[human rights]] concern. In the United States, according to the National Intimate Partner Sexual Violence Survey of 2010 1 in 6 women suffered some kind of [[Sexual violence by intimate partners|sexual violence]] induced by their intimate partner during the course of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Black, M. C. et al. ''[http://www.niwrc.org/sites/default/files/documents/Resources/Stalking-report2010.pdf The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 Summary Report]''. Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Violence Against Women Act was developed and passed as a result of extensive grassroots efforts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Advocates for the battered women's movement included sexual assault advocates, individuals from victim services, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors' offices, the courts, and the private bar. They urged Congress to adopt significant legislation to address domestic and sexual violence [citation needed]. One of the greatest successes of VAWA is its emphasis on a coordinated community response to domestic violence, sex dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; courts, law enforcement, prosecutors, victim services, and the private bar currently work together in a coordinated effort that did not exist before at the state and local levels [citation needed].  VAWA also supports the work of community-based organizations that are engaged in work to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; particularly those groups that provide culturally and linguistically specific services. Additionally, VAWA provides specific support for work with tribes and tribal organizations to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking against Native American women.

Many grant programs authorized in VAWA have been funded by the U.S. Congress. The following grant programs, which are administered primarily through the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] in the U.S. Department of Justice have received appropriations from Congress:

* STOP Grants (State Formula Grants)
* Transitional Housing Grants
* Grants to Encourage Arrest and Enforce Protection Orders
* Court Training and Improvement Grants
* Research on Violence Against Native American Women
* National Tribal [[Sex offender registries in the United States|Sex Offender Registry]]
* Stalker Reduction Database
* Federal Victim Assistants
* Sexual Assault Services Program
* Services for Rural Victims
* Civil Legal Assistance for Victims
* Elder Abuse Grant Program
* Protections and Services for Disabled Victims
* Combating Abuse in Public Housing
* National Resource Center on Workplace Responses
* Violence on College Campuses Grants
* Safe Havens Project
* Engaging Men and Youth in Prevention

==Debate and legal standing==
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had originally expressed concerns about the Act, saying that the increased penalties were rash, that the increased pretrial detention was "repugnant" to the U.S. Constitution, that the mandatory HIV testing of those only charged but not convicted was an infringement of a citizen’s [[right to privacy]], and that the edict for automatic payment of full restitution was non-judicious (see their paper: "Analysis of Major Civil Liberties Abuses in the Crime Bill Conference Report as Passed by the House and the Senate", dated September 29, 1994). In 2005, the ACLU had, however, enthusiastically supported reauthorization of VAWA on the condition that the "unconstitutional DNA provision" be removed. That provision would have allowed law enforcement to take DNA samples from arrestees or even from those who had simply been stopped by police without the permission of a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|url=https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;id=251&amp;page=UserAction |title=Tell Congress to Support the Violence Against Women Act|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051116000141/https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;id=251&amp;page=UserAction|archivedate=November 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU, in its July 27, 2005 'Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197' stated that "VAWA is one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It has dramatically improved the law enforcement response to [[violence against women]] and has provided critical services necessary to support women in their struggle to overcome abusive situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACLU Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197|publisher=ACLU|date=July 27, 2005|url=https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130005/https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|archivedate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some activists opposed the bill. Janice Shaw Crouse, a senior fellow at the conservative, evangelistic Christian [[Concerned Women for America]]'s Beverly LaHaye Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Born Again: The Christian Right Globalized|last=Butler|first=Jennifer S.|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York|pages=39, 46, 120–1|quote=|via=ProQuest eBrary}}&lt;/ref&gt; called the Act a "boondoggle" which "ends up creating a climate of suspicion where all men are feared or viewed as violent and all women are viewed as victims". She described the Act in 2012 as creating a "climate of false accusations, rush to judgment and hidden agendas" and criticized it for failing to address the factors identified by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] as leading to violent, abusive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crouse |first=Janice Shaw |date=March 19, 2012 |title=The Violence Against Women Act Should Outrage Decent People |url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-violence-against-women-act-be-reauthorized/the-violence-against-women-act-should-outrage-decent-people |work=U.S. News and World Report |type=Opinion |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103052355/https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-violence-against-women-act-be-reauthorized/the-violence-against-women-act-should-outrage-decent-people |archivedate=November 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative activist [[Phyllis Schlafly]] denounced VAWA as a tool to "fill feminist coffers" and argued that the Act promoted "divorce, breakup of marriage and [[misandry|hatred of men]]".&lt;ref name="vawa-2012"/&gt;

In 2000, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held part of VAWA unconstitutional on federalism grounds  in ''[[United States v. Morrison]]''. That decision invalidated only the civil remedy provision of VAWA. The provisions providing program funding were unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=529&amp;invol=598 United States v. Morrison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809185406/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=529&amp;invol=598 |date=August 9, 2011 }}, 529 U.S. 598, 627;  "For these reasons, we conclude that Congress' power under § 5 does not extend to the enactment of § 13981.... The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed." (at end of opinion section III)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the reauthorization of VAWA (as HR3402) defined what population benefited under the term of "Underserved Populations" described as " Populations underserved because of geographic location, underserved racial and ethnic populations, populations underserved because of special needs (such as language barriers, disabilities, alienage status, or age) and any other population determined to be underserved by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] or by the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] as appropriate".&lt;ref name="Olivares, Mariela 2014"&gt;Olivares, Mariela. 2014.

In 2011, the law expired.&lt;ref name="USAT021213" /&gt; In 2012 the law was up for reauthorization in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolduan|first=Kate|title=House passes GOP version of Violence Against Women Act renewal|newspaper=CNN|location=Washington|date=May 16, 2012|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/16/politics/gop-violence-against-women/index.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623034529/http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/16/politics/gop-violence-against-women/index.html|archivedate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different versions of the legislation were passed along party lines in the Senate and House, with the Republican-sponsored House version favoring the reduction of services to undocumented immigrants and [[LGBT]] individuals. Another area of contention was the provision of the law giving Native American tribal authorities jurisdiction over sex crimes involving non-Native Americans on tribal lands. By repealing a portion of the 1978 [[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe|Oliphant v. Suquamish]] ruling, such a provision could alter the constitutional balance between federal, state, and tribal power.  Historically Congress has not allowed tribal governments to exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-tribal members. The two bills were pending [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation]], and a final bill did not reach the President's desk before the end of the year, temporarily ending the coverage of the Act after 18 years, as the 112th Congress adjourned.

When a bill reauthorizing the act was introduced in 2012, it was opposed by [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republicans, who objected to extending the Act's protections to [[same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] and to provisions allowing battered foreigners residing in the country illegally to claim [[visa (document)|temporary visas]], also known as [[U visa]]s.&lt;ref name="vawa-2012"&gt;{{cite news | last = Weisman | first = Jonathan | date = March 14, 2012 | title = Women Figure Anew in Senate's Latest Battle | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-divides-senate.html | work = The New York Times | accessdate = April 19, 2012 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120430025641/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-divides-senate.html | archivedate = April 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U visa is restricted to 10,000 applicants annually whereas the number of applicants far exceeds these 10,000 for each fiscal year.&lt;ref name="Olivares, Mariela 2014"/&gt; In order to be considered for the U visa, one of the requirements for immigrant women is that they need to cooperate in the detention of the abuser.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Susan. 2009.

In April 2012, the Senate voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and the House subsequently passed its own measure (omitting provisions of the Senate bill that would protect gays, Native Americans living in reservations, and immigrants who are victims of domestic violence). Reconciliation of the two bills was stymied by procedural measures, leaving the re-authorization in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = New York Times | first = Jennifer | last = Steinhauer | title = THE CAUCUS; G.O.P.

In 2013, the question of jurisdiction over offenses in Native American country continued to be at issue over the question of whether defendants who are not tribal members would be treated fairly by [[tribal court]]s or afforded constitutional guarantees.&lt;ref name=NYT021013&gt;{{cite news|title=Measure to Protect Women Stuck on Tribal Land Issue|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-held-up-by-tribal-land-issue.html|accessdate=February 10, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 10, 2013|author=Jonathan Weisman|quote=If a Native American is raped or assaulted by a non-Indian, she must plead for justice to already overburdened United States attorneys who are often hundreds of miles away.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211132940/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-held-up-by-tribal-land-issue.html|archivedate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 12, 2013, the Senate passed an extension of the Violence Against Women Act by a vote of 78–22.

On February 28, 2013, in a 286–138 vote, the House passed the Senate's all-inclusive version of the bill. House Republicans had previously hoped to pass their own version of the measure—one that substantially weakened the bill's protections for certain categories. The stripped down version, which allowed only limited protection for LGBT and Native Americans, was rejected 257 to 166.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=VAWA victory shows that House GOP needs Democrats |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/28/vawa-victory-shows-that-house-gop-needs-democrats |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301200809/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/28/vawa-victory-shows-that-house-gop-needs-democrats/ |archivedate=March 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The renewed act expanded federal protections to gay, lesbian, and [[transgender]] individuals, Native Americans and immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress sends Violence Against Women Act to Obama|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/02/28/violence-against-women-congress-obama/1953527/?csp=breakingnews|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=February 28, 2013|first1=Catalina|last1=Camia|date=February 28, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108114304/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/02/28/violence-against-women-congress-obama/1953527/?csp=breakingnews|archivedate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LeTrent|first=Sarah|title=Violence Against Women Act shines a light on same-sex abuse|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/14/living/same-sex-domestic-violence-and-vawa|accessdate=May 2, 2013|date=March 14, 2013|work=CNN|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504200357/http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/14/living/same-sex-domestic-violence-and-vawa|archivedate=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ovw/legacy/2014/06/20/faqs-ngc-vawa.pdf|title=Nondiscrimination Grant Condition in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013|website=justice.gov|accessdate=May 6, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329153023/https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ovw/legacy/2014/06/20/faqs-ngc-vawa.pdf|archivedate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] signed the [[Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013]].&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 113-4, 127 Stat. 54 (March 7, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==After passage==

138 House Republicans voted against the version of the act that became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h55|title=S. 47 (113th): Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 -- House Vote #55 -- Feb 28, 2013|website=GovTrack.us|accessdate=May 6, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127204126/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h55|archivedate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several, including [[Steve King]] (R-Iowa), [[Bill Johnson (Ohio politician)|Bill Johnson]] (R-Ohio), [[Tim Walberg]] (R-Michigan), [[Vicky Hartzler]] (R-Missouri), [[Keith Rothfus]] (R-Pennsylvania), and [[Timothy F.

===Reauthorizations===
VAWA was reauthorized by bipartisan majorities in Congress in 2000 (H.R. 1248, Roll Call 415-3), and again in December 2005, and signed by President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=January 5, 2006|title=President Signs H.R. 3402, the "Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005"|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/20060105-3.html|publisher=George W.

On September 12, 2013, at an event marking the 19th anniversary of the bill, Vice President [[Joe Biden]] criticized the Republicans who slowed the passage of the reauthorization of the act as being "this sort of Neanderthal crowd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biden: 'Neanderthal crowd' slowed VAWA renewal|url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/09/biden-neanderthal-crowd-slowed-vawa-renewal-172549.html|publisher=Politico|accessdate=September 17, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916055840/http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/09/biden-neanderthal-crowd-slowed-vawa-renewal-172549.html|archivedate=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2019, the reauthorization act passed in the House by a vote of 263-158. All Democrats voting joined by 33 Republicans voted for passage.

==Persons who were covered under VAWA immigration provisions==
VAWA allowed for the possibility that certain individuals who might not otherwise be eligible for immigration benefits may petition for US permanent residency on the grounds of a close relationship with a US citizen or permanent resident who has been abusing them.  The following persons are eligible to benefit from the immigration provisions of VAWA:
* A wife or husband who has been abused by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident (Green Card holder) spouse. The petition will also cover the petitioner’s children under age 21.
* A child abused by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident parent. The petition can be filed by an abused child or by her parent on the child’s behalf. 
* A parent who has been abused by a U.S. citizen child who is at least 21 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VAWA: VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT|publisher=Givi Kutidze|date=November 2, 2016|url=http://www.us-counsel.com/green-card/vawa-violence-against-women-act/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206032636/http://www.us-counsel.com/green-card/vawa-violence-against-women-act/|archivedate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage of male victims==
Although the title of the Act and the titles of its sections refer to victims of domestic violence as women, the operative text is gender-neutral, providing coverage for male victims as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994|number=H.R. 3355|language=English|date=1994|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr3355/text|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111230817/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr3355/text|archivedate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual organizations have not been successful in using VAWA to provide equal coverage for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franklin|first=Robert|title=VAWA must be reformed for domestic violence rates to come down|publisher=Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.|work=The Hill|date=February 4, 2013|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/280897-vawa-must-be-reformed-for-domestic-violence-rates-to-come-down|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202131901/http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/280897-vawa-must-be-reformed-for-domestic-violence-rates-to-come-down|archivedate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law has twice been amended in attempts to address this situation.
