The '''Violence Against Women Act of 1994''' ('''VAWA''') is a [[United States federal law]] (Title IV of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], {{USBill|103|hr|3355}}) signed by President [[Bill Clinton]] on September{{nbsp}}13, 1994. The Act provided $1.6{{nbsp}}billion toward investigation and the prosecution of [[violence against women|violent crimes against women]], imposed automatic and mandatory restitution on those convicted, and allowed civil redress when prosecutors chose not to prosecute cases. The Act also established the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] within the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].

The bill was introduced by Representative [[Jack Brooks (American politician)|Jack Brooks]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Texas|TX]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=1993-09-10|title=Cosponsors - S.11 - 103rd Congress (1993-1994): Violence Against Women Act of 1993|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/senate-bill/11/cosponsors|access-date=2021-02-04|publisher=www.congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994 and gained support from a broad coalition of advocacy groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= September 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170121000627/https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/2014_vawa_report.pdf |archive-date= January 21, 2017 |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/2014_vawa_report.pdf|via= [[NARA|National Archives]] |publisher= [[whitehouse.gov]] |title=Report: 1 Is Too Many: Twenty Years Fighting Violence Against Women and Girls }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act passed through both houses of the [[U.S. Congress]] with bipartisan support in 1994; however, House [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] attempted to cut the act's funding the following year.&lt;ref name="wp-funding"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | title = House GOP Budget Cutters Try to Limit Domestic Violence Programs | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/07/15/house-gop-budget-cutters-try-to-limit-domestic-violence-programs/b823092c-17a6-4c8c-9b4c-eb16433682bb/ | first = Kenneth | last = Cooper | access-date = April 19, 2012 | date = July 15, 1995 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120724235532/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18605326.html?dids=18605326:18605326&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+15%2C+1995&amp;author=Kenneth+J.+Cooper&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=House+GOP+Budget+Cutters+Try+to+Limit+Domestic+Violence+Programs | archive-date = July 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[United States v.

By a 5–4 majority, the Court overturned the provision as exceeding the federal government's powers under the [[Commerce Clause]].&lt;ref name="cnn-scotus"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[CNN]] |title=Supreme Court strikes down Violence Against Women Act |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/05/15/scotus.violence/index.html |first=Charles |last=Bierbauer |date=May 18, 2000 |access-date=April 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213025814/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/05/15/scotus.violence/index.html |archive-date=February 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = [[The New York Times]] | first = Linda | last = Greenhouse | author-link = Linda Greenhouse | title = Women lose right to sue attackers in federal court | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/16/us/supreme-court-court-federalism-women-lose-right-sue-attackers-federal-court.html | date = May 16, 2000 | access-date = April 19, 2012 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120205202556/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/16/us/supreme-court-court-federalism-women-lose-right-sue-attackers-federal-court.html | archive-date = February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

VAWA was reauthorized by bipartisan majorities in Congress in 2000 and again in December 2005. The Act's 2012 renewal was opposed by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republicans, who objected to extending the Act's protections to [[same-sex couples]] and to provisions allowing battered [[Illegal immigration to the United States|undocumented immigrants]] to claim temporary [[Visa (document)|visas]], but it was reauthorized in 2013 after a long legislative battle. As a result of the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019]], the Act expired on December{{nbsp}}21, 2018. It was temporarily reinstated via a short-term spending bill on January{{nbsp}}25, 2019, but expired again on February{{nbsp}}15, 2019. The [[U.S. House of Representatives]] passed a bill reauthorizing VAWA in April 2019 that includes new provisions protecting [[transgender]] victims and banning individuals convicted of domestic abuse from purchasing [[firearm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/04/politics/house-passes-violence-against-women-act-reauthorization/index.html|title=House passes reauthorization of Violence Against Women Act|publisher=CNN|date=April 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to reach a bipartisan agreement, Senators [[Joni Ernst]] (R-IA) and [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-CA) led months of negotiation talks that came to a halt in November 2019. Senator Ernst said she planned to introduce a new version of the bill, and hoped it would pass in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/senate-talks-bipartisan-violence-women-act-break|title=Senate talks on crafting bipartisan Violence Against Women Act break down|work=[[Roll Call]]|date=Nov 7, 2019|access-date=November 19, 2019|archive-date=January 11, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200111182544/http://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/senate-talks-bipartisan-violence-women-act-break|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=June 2024|reason=5 years ago}} VAWA was reauthorized on March{{nbsp}}15, 2022, by President [[Joe Biden]].{{update inline|date=September 2024}}

==Background==
{{more citations needed section|date=October 2018}}
The [[World Conference on Human Rights]], held in Vienna, Austria, in 1993, and the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in the same year, concluded that civil society and governments have acknowledged that [[domestic violence]] is a public health policy and [[human rights]] concern. In the United States, according to the National Intimate Partner Sexual Violence Survey of 2010, 1 in 6 women suffered some kind of [[Sexual violence by intimate partners|sexual violence]] induced by their intimate partner during the course of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Black, M. C. et al. ''[http://www.niwrc.org/sites/default/files/documents/Resources/Stalking-report2010.pdf The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 Summary Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225230858/https://www.niwrc.org/sites/default/files/documents/Resources/Stalking-report2010.pdf |date=February 25, 2021 }}''. Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as late as 1970–1990, domestic violence was regarded as a private matter and sometimes was ignored by the police. According to Zorza in Criminal Law of Misdemeanor Domestic Violence, 1970–1990, "throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, officers believed and were taught that domestic violence was a private matter, ill suited to public intervention."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Search |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/do/search/?q=author_lname:%22Zorza%22%20author_fname:%22Joan%22&amp;start=0&amp;context=1636526&amp;facet= |access-date=2022-11-27 |website=scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the arrest did not deter and punish abusers. The results of three studies, conducted in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], and [[Milwaukee]], indicated that arrest alone did not deter abusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology {{!}} Northwestern Pritzker School of Law |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/ |access-date=2022-11-27 |website=scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Violence Against Women Act was developed and passed as a result of extensive grassroots efforts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Advocates for the battered women's movement included sexual assault advocates, individuals from victim services, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors' offices, the courts, and the private bar. They urged Congress to adopt significant legislation to address domestic and sexual violence.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The Violence Against Women Act established new offenses and penalties for the violation of a protection order or stalking in which an abuser crossed a state line to injure or harass another, or forced a victim to cross a state line under duress and then physically harmed the victim in the course of a violent crime.

One of the greatest successes of VAWA is its emphasis on a coordinated community response to domestic violence, sex dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; courts, law enforcement, prosecutors, victim services, and the private bar currently work together in a coordinated effort that did not exist before at the state and local levels.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} VAWA also supports the work of community-based organizations which are engaged in work to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, particularly those groups that provide culturally and linguistically specific services. Additionally, VAWA provides specific support for work with tribes and tribal organizations to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking against Native American women. In December 2022, the Violence Against Women Act was amended to include Native Hawaiian survivors of gender-based violence and Native Hawaiian organizations in grant funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/12/native-hawaiian-domestic-violence-survivors-now-eligible-for-federal-funding/|title=Native Hawaiian Domestic Violence Survivors Now Eligible For Federal Funding|first=Alicia|last=Lou|date=December 31, 2022|website=Honolulu Civil Beat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many grant programs authorized in VAWA have been funded by the U.S. Congress. The following grant programs, which are administered primarily through the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] in the U.S. Department of Justice, have received appropriations from Congress:

* STOP Grants (State Formula Grants)
* Transitional Housing Grants
* Grants to Encourage Arrest and Enforce Protection Orders
* Court Training and Improvement Grants
* Research on Violence Against Native American Women
* National Tribal [[Sex offender registries in the United States|Sex Offender Registry]]
* Stalker Reduction Database
* Federal Victim Assistants
* Sexual Assault Services Program
* Services for Rural Victims
* Civil Legal Assistance for Victims
* Elder Abuse Grant Program
* Protections and Services for Disabled Victims
* Combating Abuse in Public Housing
* National Resource Center on Workplace Responses
* Violence on College Campuses Grants
* Safe Havens Project
* Engaging Men and Youth in Prevention

==Debate and legal standing==
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had originally expressed concerns about the Act, saying that the increased penalties were rash, that the increased pretrial detention was "repugnant" to the U.S. Constitution, that the mandatory HIV testing of those only charged but not convicted was an infringement of a citizen's [[right to privacy]], and that the edict for automatic payment of full restitution was non-judicious (see their paper: "Analysis of Major Civil Liberties Abuses in the Crime Bill Conference Report as Passed by the House and the Senate", dated September 29, 1994). In 2005, the ACLU had, however, enthusiastically supported reauthorization of VAWA on the condition that the "unconstitutional DNA provision" be removed. That provision would have allowed law enforcement to take DNA samples from arrestees or from those who had simply been stopped by police without the permission of a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|url=https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;id=251&amp;page=UserAction |title=Tell Congress to Support the Violence Against Women Act|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051116000141/https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;id=251&amp;page=UserAction|archive-date=November 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU, in its July 27, 2005 'Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197' stated that "VAWA is one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It has dramatically improved the law enforcement response to [[violence against women]] and has provided critical services necessary to support women in their struggle to overcome abusive situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACLU Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197|publisher=ACLU|date=July 27, 2005|url=https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130005/https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|archive-date=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some activists opposed the bill. Janice Shaw Crouse, a senior fellow at the Christian [[Concerned Women for America]]'s Beverly LaHaye Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Born Again: The Christian Right Globalized|last=Butler|first=Jennifer S.|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2006|location=New York|pages=39, 46, 120–1|via=ProQuest eBrary}}&lt;/ref&gt; called the Act a "boondoggle" which "ends up creating a climate of suspicion where all men are feared or viewed as violent and all women are viewed as victims". She described the Act in 2012 as creating a "climate of false accusations, rush to judgment and hidden agendas" and criticized it for failing to address the factors identified by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] as leading to violent, abusive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crouse |first=Janice Shaw |date=March 19, 2012 |title=The Violence Against Women Act Should Outrage Decent People |url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-violence-against-women-act-be-reauthorized/the-violence-against-women-act-should-outrage-decent-people |work=U.S. News &amp; World Report |type=Opinion |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103052355/https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-violence-against-women-act-be-reauthorized/the-violence-against-women-act-should-outrage-decent-people |archive-date=November 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative activist [[Phyllis Schlafly]] denounced VAWA as a tool to "fill feminist coffers" and argued that the Act promoted "divorce, breakup of marriage and [[misandry|hatred of men]]".&lt;ref name="vawa-2012"/&gt;

In 2000, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held part of VAWA unconstitutional on federalism grounds in ''[[United States v. Morrison]]''. That decision invalidated only the civil remedy provision of VAWA. The provisions providing program funding were unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=529&amp;invol=598 United States v. Morrison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809185406/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=529&amp;invol=598 |date=August 9, 2011 }}, 529 U.S. 598, 627;  "For these reasons, we conclude that Congress' power under § 5 does not extend to the enactment of § 13981.... The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed." (at end of opinion section III)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the reauthorization of VAWA (as HR3402) defined what population benefited under the term of "Underserved Populations" described as "Populations underserved because of geographic location, underserved racial and ethnic populations, populations underserved because of special needs (such as language barriers, disabilities, alienage status, or age) and any other population determined to be underserved by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] or by the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] as appropriate".&lt;ref name="Olivares, Mariela 2014"&gt;Olivares, Mariela. 2014.

In 2011, the law expired.&lt;ref name="USAT021213" /&gt; In 2012 the law was up for reauthorization in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolduan|first=Kate|title=House passes GOP version of Violence Against Women Act renewal|newspaper=CNN|location=Washington|date=May 16, 2012|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/16/politics/gop-violence-against-women/index.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623034529/http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/16/politics/gop-violence-against-women/index.html|archive-date=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different versions of the legislation were passed along party lines in the Senate and House, with the Republican-sponsored House version favoring the reduction of services to undocumented immigrants and [[LGBT]] individuals. Another area of contention was the provision of the law giving Native American tribal authorities jurisdiction over sex crimes involving non-Native Americans on tribal lands. By repealing a portion of the 1978 [[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe|Oliphant v. Suquamish]] ruling, such a provision could alter the constitutional balance between federal, state, and tribal power.  Historically Congress has not allowed tribal governments to exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-tribal members. The two bills were pending [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation]], and a final bill did not reach the President's desk before the end of the year, temporarily ending the coverage of the Act after 18 years, as the 112th Congress adjourned.

When a bill reauthorizing the act was introduced in 2012, it was opposed by [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republicans, who objected to extending the Act's protections to [[same-sex relationship|same-sex couples]] and to provisions allowing battered foreigners residing in the country illegally to claim [[visa (document)|temporary visas]], also known as [[U visa]]s.&lt;ref name="vawa-2012"&gt;{{cite news | last = Weisman | first = Jonathan | date = March 14, 2012 | title = Women Figure Anew in Senate's Latest Battle | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-divides-senate.html | work = The New York Times | access-date = April 19, 2012 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120430025641/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/15/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-divides-senate.html | archive-date = April 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U visa is restricted to 10,000 applicants annually whereas the number of applicants far exceeds these 10,000 for each fiscal year.&lt;ref name="Olivares, Mariela 2014"/&gt; In order to be considered for the U visa, one of the requirements for immigrant women is that they need to cooperate in the detention of the abuser.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Susan. 2009.

In April 2012, the Senate voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and the House subsequently passed its own measure (omitting provisions of the Senate bill that would protect gays, Native Americans living in reservations, and immigrants who are victims of domestic violence).

In 2013, the question of jurisdiction over offenses in Native American country continued to be at issue over the question of whether defendants who are not tribal members would be treated fairly by [[tribal court]]s or afforded constitutional guarantees.&lt;ref name=NYT021013&gt;{{cite news|title=Measure to Protect Women Stuck on Tribal Land Issue|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-held-up-by-tribal-land-issue.html|access-date=February 10, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 10, 2013|author=Jonathan Weisman|quote=If a Native American is raped or assaulted by a non-Indian, she must plead for justice to already overburdened United States attorneys who are often hundreds of miles away.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211132940/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/us/politics/violence-against-women-act-held-up-by-tribal-land-issue.html|archive-date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2013, in a 286–138 vote, the House passed the Senate's all-inclusive version of the bill. House Republicans had previously hoped to pass their own version of the measure—one that substantially weakened the bill's protections for certain categories. The stripped-down version, which allowed only limited protection for LGBT and Native Americans, was rejected 257 to 166.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=VAWA victory shows that House GOP needs Democrats |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/28/vawa-victory-shows-that-house-gop-needs-democrats |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=February 28, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301200809/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/28/vawa-victory-shows-that-house-gop-needs-democrats/ |archive-date=March 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The renewed act expanded federal protections to gay, lesbian, and [[transgender]] individuals, Native Americans and immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress sends Violence Against Women Act to Obama|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/02/28/violence-against-women-congress-obama/1953527/?csp=breakingnews|publisher=USA Today|access-date=February 28, 2013|first1=Catalina|last1=Camia|date=February 28, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108114304/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/02/28/violence-against-women-congress-obama/1953527/?csp=breakingnews|archive-date=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LeTrent|first=Sarah|title=Violence Against Women Act shines a light on same-sex abuse|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/14/living/same-sex-domestic-violence-and-vawa|access-date=May 2, 2013|date=March 14, 2013|work=CNN|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504200357/http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/14/living/same-sex-domestic-violence-and-vawa|archive-date=May 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ovw/legacy/2014/06/20/faqs-ngc-vawa.pdf|title=Nondiscrimination Grant Condition in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013|website=justice.gov|access-date=May 6, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329153023/https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ovw/legacy/2014/06/20/faqs-ngc-vawa.pdf|archive-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New provisions in the Reauthorization of VAWA 2013 ==
'''Protection for Native Americans:'''

Prior to the 2013 passing of VAWA, Native American women who were the victims of non-Native American assault were not covered by the law. The [[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191 (1978) |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/435/191/ |access-date=2022-11-27 |website=Justia Law |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; case from 1978 was overturned by provisions added to the new VAWA 2013, which also makes it possible for non-Native Americans to be prosecuted in tribal courts for domestic or dating violence perpetrated against Native Americans.

'''Protection of same sex couples:'''

LGBTQ people experience domestic abuse at the same 25%–33% rate as other members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2014-04-09 |title=VAWA 2013 Nondiscrimination Provision: Making Programs Accessible to all Victims of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, Dating Violence, and Stalking |url=https://www.justice.gov/archives/ovw/blog/vawa-2013-nondiscrimination-provision-making-programs-accessible-all-victims-domestic |access-date=2022-11-27 |website=www.justice.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; VAWA 2013 develops programs and laws to protect the rights of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] people who have been the victims of IPV ([[intimate partner violence]]). LGBTQ victims are expressly included in two important VAWA grant programs by the act. It is now against the law for LGBTQ people to be dismissed from shelters or other VAWA-funded services because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, according to a non-discrimination clause in VAWA.

'''Protection of victims of [[human trafficking]]:'''

Each year, 50,000 individuals are reportedly trafficked into the US, according to the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|Trafficking Victims Protection Act]] of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McReynolds |first=MaryAnne |date=2008 |title=The Trafficking Victims Protection Act: Has the Legislation Fall Short of Its Goals? |url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/plyps15&amp;id=33&amp;div=&amp;collection= |journal=Policy Perspectives |volume=15 |pages=33|doi=10.4079/pp.v15i1.4152 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, victims of trafficking experience the same forms of abuse as those who have experienced violence from an intimate partner: [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual violence]], financial control, threats, intimidation, and restriction on freedom of movement.

'''Protection for Immigrant Victims of IPV (intimate partner violence):'''

Neither the number of [[U visa|U Visas]] nor the government's interest in studying crime in immigrant communities increased as a result of VAWA 2013. Based on data provided by [[Migration Policy Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Google Scholar |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Batalova+J++US+in+focus:+Immigrant+women+in+the+United+States+.++Washington,+DC+:++Migration+Policy+Institute+,++2012+ |access-date=2022-11-27 |website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18.9 million (12%) of all women in the United States are immigrants. The number of immigrants who have been victims of IPV is unknown because national studies haven't been conducted to look at this issue in immigrant communities.

==After passage==
A total of 138 House Republicans voted against the version of the act that became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h55|title=S. 47 (113th): Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 -- House Vote #55 -- Feb 28, 2013|publisher=GovTrack.us|access-date=May 6, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127204126/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h55|archive-date=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several, including [[Steve King]] (R-Iowa), [[Bill Johnson (Ohio politician)|Bill Johnson]] (R-Ohio), [[Tim Walberg]] (R-Michigan), [[Vicky Hartzler]] (R-Missouri), [[Keith Rothfus]] (R-Pennsylvania), and [[Timothy F.

===Reauthorizations===
VAWA was reauthorized by bipartisan majorities in Congress in 2000 as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 [https://www.congress.gov/bill/106th-congress/house-bill/3244 (H.R. 3244)], and again in December 2005, and signed by President [[George W.

On September 12, 2013, at an event marking the 19th anniversary of the bill, Vice President [[Joe Biden]] criticized the Republicans who slowed the passage of the reauthorization of the act as being "this sort of Neanderthal crowd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biden: 'Neanderthal crowd' slowed VAWA renewal |url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/09/biden-neanderthal-crowd-slowed-vawa-renewal-172549.html|publisher=Politico|access-date=September 17, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916055840/http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/09/biden-neanderthal-crowd-slowed-vawa-renewal-172549.html |archive-date=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019]], the Violence Against Women Act expired on December 21, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gathright |first=Jenny |date=24 December 2018 | title=Violence Against Women Act Expires Because Of Government Shutdown | url=https://www.npr.org/2018/12/24/679838115/violence-against-women-act-expires-because-of-government-shutdown/ | publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was temporarily reauthorized by a short-term spending bill on January 25, 2019, but expired again on February 15, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet | user=kelsey_snell | first =Kelsey | last= Snell| |number=1088918830343225346 |date= January 25, 2019 | title= ...the short-term spending bill (CR) includes a reauthorization/extension of the Violence Against Women Act per McConnell spox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2019, the reauthorization act passed in the House by a vote of 263–158, this time including closing the [[boyfriend loophole]]. All Democrats voting were joined by 33 Republicans voted for passage. New York Representative [[Elise Stefanik]] said Democrats "...have refused to work with Republicans in a meaningful way," adding, "the House bill will do nothing but 'collect dust' in the GOP-controlled Senate. The bill has indeed been ignored by the Senate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Killough |first=Ashley |date=2019-04-04 |title=House passes reauthorization of Violence Against Women Act {{!}} CNN Politics |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/04/politics/house-passes-violence-against-women-act-reauthorization/index.html |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=CNN |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2019, following the firearm murder of a [[Houston]] police officer on duty by a boyfriend who had been abusive towards his girlfriend, Houston Police Chief [[Art Acevedo]] criticized Senators [[Mitch McConnell]] (R-KY), [[Ted Cruz]] (R-TX) and [[John Cornyn]] (R-TX) for preventing a vote on the VAWA reauthorization.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/houston-police-chief-senate-republicans-gun-violence-vawa/index.html|title=Houston police chief criticizes McConnell and Senate Republicans over guns: 'Whose side are you on?'|first=Chandelis |last=Duster|website=CNN|date=December 9, 2019|access-date=2019-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acevedo said "I don't want to hear about how much they care about lives and the sanctity of lives yet, we all know in law enforcement that one of the biggest reasons that the Senate and Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz and others are not getting into a room and having a conference committee with the House and getting the Violence Against Women's Act (passed) is because the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] doesn't like the fact that we want to take firearms out of the hands of boyfriends that abuse their girlfriends. And who killed our sergeant? A boyfriend abusing his girlfriend. So you're either here for women and children and our daughters and our sisters and our aunts, or you're here for the NRA."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In a follow-up interview with CNN, Acevedo said his criticism of Senators Cruz, Cornyn and McConnell was not political, because "death is not political—you see, death is final."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/politics/houston-police-chief-art-acevedo-republicans/index.html |title=Houston police chief says criticism of GOP lawmakers over guns is 'not political' |department=CNN Politics |last1=Duster|first1=Chandelis|last2=Kafanov|first2=Lucy|date=December 12, 2019|publisher=CNN|language=en-US|access-date=December 12, 2019 |last3=Killough |first3=Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; He challenged Senator Cruz to directly answer whether he supports closing the boyfriend loophole, and said that failing to address it would put the Senators "on the wrong side of history".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Senator Cornyn said that Acevedo was "mistaken" in invoking the VAWA.

On March 15, 2022, President [[Joe Biden]] signed the reauthorization of VAWA into law as part of the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022|Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022]] ([https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471 H.R. 2471]); it is called the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022.

==Programs and services==
{{More citations needed|date=December 2019}}
The Violence Against Women laws provided programs and services, including:
* Federal [[rape shield law]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/vawa_factsheet.pdf Factsheet: The Violence Against Women Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170122104848/https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/vawa_factsheet.pdf |date=January 22, 2017 }} from The [[White House]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Community violence prevention programs.
* Protections for victims who are evicted from their homes because of events related to domestic violence or stalking.
* Funding for victim assistance services, like rape crisis centers and hotlines.
* Programs to meet the needs of immigrant women and women of different races or ethnicities.
* Programs and services for victims with disabilities.

==Restraining orders==
[[File:Temporary Order of Protection.jpg|thumb|[[Domestic Abuse Restraining Order|Restraining order]] granted to a Wisconsin woman against her abuser, noting the nationwide applicability of the order under Full Faith and Credit]]
When a victim is the beneficiary of an order of protection, per VAWA it was generally enforceable nationwide under the terms of [[Full Faith and Credit|full faith and credit]].  Although the order may be granted only in a specific state, full faith and credit requires that it be enforced in other states as though the order was granted in their states.{{UnitedStatesCode|18|2265}}&lt;ref name="bwjp"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Center on Protection Orders and Full Faith and Credit|url=http://www.bwjp.org/our-work/projects/protection-orders.html|work=Protection Orders|publisher=Battered Women's Justice Project|access-date=June 6, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609042211/http://www.bwjp.org/our-work/projects/protection-orders.html|archive-date=June 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the law's restraining orders included the ability to enforce domestic violence protection orders which barred people subject to family violence protection orders from having firearms.&lt;ref name=firearmrestraining /&gt;

==Persons who are covered under VAWA immigration provisions==
VAWA allows for the possibility that certain individuals who might not otherwise be eligible for immigration benefits may petition for US permanent residency on the grounds of a close relationship with a US citizen or permanent resident who has been abusing them. The following persons are eligible to benefit from the immigration provisions of VAWA:
* A wife or husband who has been abused by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident (Green Card holder) spouse. The petition will also cover the petitioner's children under age 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How difficult is it to win a case via VAWA?|publisher=The Mendoza Law Firm|date=January 18, 2023|url=https://mendozafirm.com/how-difficult-is-it-to-win-a-case-via-vawa/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A child abused by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident parent. The petition can be filed by an abused child or by her parent on the child's behalf. 
* A parent who has been abused by a U.S. citizen child who is at least 21 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VAWA: VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT|publisher=Givi Kutidze|date=November 2, 2016|url=http://www.us-counsel.com/green-card/vawa-violence-against-women-act/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206032636/http://www.us-counsel.com/green-card/vawa-violence-against-women-act/|archive-date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 reauthorization added a non-exclusivity provision clarifying that the title should not be construed to prohibit male victims from receiving services under the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005|number=H.R. 3402|language=English|date=2005|article=Sec. 3(b)(8)|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr3402/text|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111230616/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr3402/text|archive-date=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 reauthorization added a non-discrimination provision that prohibits organizations receiving funding under the Act from discriminating on the basis of sex, although the law allows an exception for "sex segregation or sex-specific programming" when it is deemed to be "necessary to the essential operations of a program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title=Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013|number=S. 47|language=English|date=2013|article=Sec. 3(b)(4)|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s47/text|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716093330/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s47/text|archive-date=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Brown, the Founder and Executive Director of the Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men and Women contends that the Act may not be sufficient to ensure equal access to services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saving Our Men - The Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men and Women|publisher=Laws.com|date=June 13, 2013|url=http://criminal.laws.com/criminal-news/saving-our-men-the-domestic-abuse-helpline-for-men-women-36561.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805042108/http://criminal.laws.com/criminal-news/saving-our-men-the-domestic-abuse-helpline-for-men-women-36561.html |archive-date=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== College VAWA Reporting ==
According to the Clery Act, colleges are required to federally report certain categories of crimes, including those covered under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). Among these crimes, the most frequently reported on campuses are stalking, followed by domestic violence, and dating violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=1p21.admin |date=2024-08-23 |title=[New Study] Most Dangerous College Campuses in 2024 |url=https://www.houston-criminalattorney.com/most-dangerous-college-campuses/ |access-date=2024-09-10 |website=Law Office of David A. Breston |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[prison abolition movement]] has been critical of VAWA for its focus on policing, surveillance, and incarceration, particularly mandatory incarceration requirements, and the disproportionate number of people of color who have been arrested and incarcerated using VAWA provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Phifer |first=Hanna |title=The Violence Against Women Act Isn't Enough to Protect Women |url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2022/04/10958454/does-biden-violence-against-women-act-actually-protect-women |access-date=2022-05-28 |website=www.refinery29.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Goodmark |first=Leigh |date=January 2021 |title=Reimagining VAWA: Why Criminalization Is a Failed Policy and What a Non-Carceral VAWA Could Look Like |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077801220949686 |journal=Violence Against Women |language=en |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=84–101 |doi=10.1177/1077801220949686 |pmid=32819221 |s2cid=221219763 |issn=1077-8012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable people who have criticized aspects of the VAWA include [[Victoria Law]], [[Beth Richie]], [[Gina Dent]], [[Olúfẹ́mi O.
