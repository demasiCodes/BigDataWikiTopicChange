The term '''ethnic cleansing''' refers to various policies of forcibly removing people of one
[[ethnic group]].  At one end of the [[political spectrum|spectrum]], it is virtually indistinguishable from forced emigration and [[population transfer]], while at the other it merges with [[deportation]] and [[genocide]].

At the most general level, however, ethnic cleansing can be understood as the forced expulsion of an "undesirable" population from a given territory as a result of religious or ethnic discrimination, political, strategic or ideological considerations, or a combination of these.

Some political commentators avoid use of the term, which they see as a political [[euphemism]] which attempts to apply a word with positive connotations (cleansing) to a morally objectionable act (forced population movement usually achieved through violence). {{fact}}

This is a relatively new [[neologism]], and its scope still varies. In its initial meaning it referred to policies applied by authorities to an undesirable ethnicity. However the term seem to fit well into a linguistic niche, and it is increasingly applied to other types of ethnic [[forced migration]] and [[genocide]].

==Origins of the term==

The term "ethnic cleansing" entered the English lexicon as a [[loan translation]] of the [[Serbian language|Serbian]]/Croatian phrase ''etni&amp;#269;ko &amp;#269;i&amp;#353;&amp;#263;enje'' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/etnit&amp;#643;ko t&amp;#643;i&amp;#643;t&amp;#643;&amp;#690;e&amp;#626;e/}}) (notice that literal translation of the phrase is "ethnic cleaning"). During the [[1990s]] it was used extensively by the media in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in relation to the [[Yugoslav wars]], and appears to have been popularised by the international media some time around [[1992]]. The term may have originated some time before the [[1990s]] in the military doctrine of the former [[Yugoslav People's Army]], which spoke of "cleansing the territory" (''&amp;#269;i&amp;#353;&amp;#263;enje terena'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/t&amp;#643;i&amp;#643;t&amp;#643;&amp;#690;e&amp;#626;e terena/}}) of enemies to take total control of a conquered area. The origins of this doctrine are unclear, but may have been a legacy of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partizan]] era.

This originally applied purely to military enemies, but came to be applied to ethnic groups as well. It was used in this context in Yugoslavia by the [[Serbia]]n media as early as [[1981]], in relation to the policies of the [[Kosovo]] Albanian administration allegedly creating an "ethnically clean territory" (i.e. "cleanly" Albanian) in the province[http://www.siri-us.com/backgrounders/Archives_Kosovo/KLA-Terror-Cleansing.html]. However, this usage had antecedents.

The earliest known usage of it may been in [[May 16]], [[1941]], during the [[Second World War]], by one [[Viktor Gutic|Viktor Guti&amp;#263;]], a commander in the [[Croatia]]n fascist faction the [[Ustase|Usta&amp;#353;e]].
An article in the ''Hrvatska Krajina'' newspaper[http://www.pavelicpapers.com/documents/ndhnews/ndhn0004.html] describing the visit to the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] monastery in [[Petricevac|Petri&amp;#263;evac]] quotes Guti&amp;#263;'s speech:

: ''Every Croat who today solicits for our enemies not only is not a good Croat, but also an opponent and disrupter of the prearranged, well-calculated plan for cleansing ''[&amp;#269;i&amp;#353;&amp;#263;enje]'' our [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] of unwanted elements [...]''

The Usta&amp;#353;e did carry out large-scale ethnic cleansing in their time  in the [[Second World War]]. It is possible that the revival of nationalism in the [[1980s]] reintroduced ethnic cleansing into Yugoslavia's political debate and language.

The term "cleansing" ("cleansing of borders", очистка границ) was used in Soviet documents of early 1930s in reference to the resettlement of [[Poles]] from the 22-km border zone in [[Byelorussian SSR]] and [[Ukrainian SSR]]. The process was repeated on a larger and wider scale in 1939-1941, see [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union]] and [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]. 

A similar term with the same intent was used by the [[Nazi]] administration in [[Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]]. When an area under Nazi control had its entire [[Jew]]ish population removed, whether by driving the population out, by deportation to [[Concentration Camp]]s, and/or [[murder]], the area was declared ''judenrein'' (lit. ''Jew Clean''): ''cleansed of Jews''. (cf. [[racial hygiene]].)

==Ethnic cleansing in history==

Some narratives in the [[Torah]] and other books of the [[Old Testament]]  in the [[Bible]] (also known as the [[Hebrew Bible]] or Tenakh) describing the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] (or [[Israelite]]) conquest of [[Canaan]] (in c. [[13th century BC]] or before) would now be considered descriptions of ethnic cleansing or even [[genocide]]. In several places the Hebrew [[God]] commands the Hebrews to kill every man, woman and child after capturing a city, and sometimes cities also had to be burnt to the ground. It was also standard practice at the time to murder or enslave prisoners of war and their families.

For example, according to the biblical narrative, the people of the [[Canaanite]] village of Ai are massascred by [[Joshua]]'s troops in [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 8:20-25. In one passage detailing the war of "God's vengence" on [[Midian]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 31:1-24). In verses 13-24 [[Moses]] asks the victorious Hebrew troops why they have spared the lives of all the women who had "perverted the sons of Israel" into rejecting God. Moses then orders the Hebrew troops to kill all the male children and women who are not virgins. 

In [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], the story of the [[Pharaoh]]'s attempt to destroy the Israelites living in [[Egypt]] can also be seen as ethnic cleansing.

The [[Assyria]]n Empire regularly deported entire ethnic groups, as did the [[Babylonia]]ns; victims of this policy most famously include the [[Israelites]] of [[Kingdom of Israel|Israel]] in [[722 BC]] and the Israelites of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] in [[586 BC]] (see [[Babylonian captivity of Judah]]).

In some instances, the expulsion of Jews had some features of ethnic cleansing, especially if it were accompanied by violence and were enacted on the whole territory of the state. Jews were expelled from [[England]] ([[1290]]), [[France]] ([[1306]]), [[Hungary]] ([[1349]]&amp;ndash;[[1360]]), [[Provence]] ([[1394]] and [[1490]]), [[Austria]] ([[1421]]), [[Spain]] after the [[Reconquista]], [[Portugal]] (1497), [[Russia]] in [[1724]], and various parts of [[Germany]] at various times. Not all deportations of Jews affected an entire country or lasted for extended periods of time: Jews from [[Krakow]] ([[1494]]) were expelled to suburbs of the city, and Jews were expelled from [[Lithuania]] ([[1491]]) and allowed to return 10 years later.

Spain's large [[Muslim]] minority, inherited from that country's former Islamic kingdoms, was expelled in [[1502]] and [[1609]]&amp;ndash;[[1614]].

[[Gypsies|Roma people]] were expelled from [[France]], [[England]] and other European countries in during the [[16th century]].

In 1929 several hundred Jewish residents of Hebron [[Israel]] were ethnically cleansed and 67 were murdered by their Arab neighbors due to incitement by the Nazi War Criminal Haj-Amin Al Husseini, some managed to escape by hiding with friendly Arab families.

==Colonization-related ethnic cleansing==

During more recent times, ethnic cleansing has often been used during colonisation projects. In [[North America]], [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] settlers ethnically cleansed millions of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], forcibly relocating them to remote and often inhospitable reservation land.  In southern Africa and [[Australia]], [[Indigenous people|native]] tribes were removed from their lands so that they could be replaced by white farmers and settlers.

* The colonization of the [[Americas]] by European powers, particularly [[Spain]] and [[Britain]]. This led to population removals and massacres of the indigenous population, starting in the 15th century and continuing into the 20th.
* The colonization of [[Australia]] by Britain. This led to population removals and massacres of the indigenous population, starting in 1788.  It is important to note that the [[Maori]] were not ethnically cleansed in [[New Zealand]].  Many Maori were dispossessed of ownership of their land, but few were ever forcibly removed, and when this did happen it was mostly as a result of punishment for fighting and losing against colonial troops during the [[New Zealand Land Wars|New Zealand Wars]].
* The invasion of [[Gibraltar]] by Britain in [[1704]] led to an ethnic cleansing of the local [[Andalusian]] population, who were [[San Roque (Cádiz)|expelled from the territory]] in [[1704]]
* The removals and massacres of native populations in the [[African]] colonies of various European powers.
* The concentration of [[Boers]] by Britain during the Second [[Boer War]]

The American and South Pacific instances were disastrous. The native populations fell from millions to thousands in only a few centuries, a combined result of colonization policies and [[epidemic]]s of foreign disease.

==Modern age ethnic cleansing==

The term "ethnic cleansing" has come to mean the displacement or expulsion from a territory of one ethnic group by another. The displacement is usually forcible, though there are examples of voluntary or compensated ethnic cleansing.  

The [[20th century]] has seen numerous cases, particularly in Europe and the Middle East.   

===Older examples===

* In Canada the [[Great Upheaval|Expulsion]] of the [[Acadians]] in [[1755]] from their ancestral lands in [[Nova Scotia]] or [[Acadia]] by the British military because of the [[French and Indian War]].
* In the United States in the 19th Century there were numerous instances of relocation of Native American peoples from their traditional areas to often remote reservations elsewhere in the country, such as the [[Long Walk of the Navajo]] and the [[Trail of Tears]], the forced removal of the [[Cherokee]] tribe that led to the deaths of about 2,000 to 8,000 people.
* Expulsion and cleansing of Turkish, Muslim, and Jewish populations from [[Balkan]]s following the independence of Balkan countries (e.g., [[Serbia]], [[Greece]], [[Bulgaria]]) from [[Ottoman Empire]] from early 1800s to early 1900.
* Cleansing of Muslim populations in [[Northern Caucasus]] by imperial [[Russia]] throughout 19th century. Particularly, expulsion of [[Adyghe|Circassians]] to [[Anatolia]] in [[1864]].

===20th Century instances===
*  The [[1913]] [[Convention of Adrianople]], annexed to the Peace Treaty between [[Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], provided for an exchange of ethnic Turks and Bulgarians in a 15 kilometer strip.  
* The [[Armenian Genocide]] and the [[Greco-Turkish relations#The First World War and after|expulsion of Pontian Greeks]] perpetrated by the [[Young Turks]] during [[1914]]&amp;ndash;[[1922]].
* The [[1919]] [[Treaty of Neuilly]] provided for the reciprocal emigration of ethnic minorities between [[Greece]] and [[Bulgaria]].
* In [[1923]] the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] which ended the [[World War I|First World War]] in the East, as well as post-war hostilities between [[Greece]] and the newly-formed [[Republic of Turkey]], provided for a compulsory exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey.
* The expulsions of [[Jews]] from [[Austria]] after the [[Anschluss]], and deportations of [[Poles]] and Jews from [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany]].
* [[Nazi Germany]] wiping out entire populations of [[Jew]]s and [[Gypsies]] during [[World War II]] (see also [[the Holocaust]]).
* [[Generalplan Ost]], in which the Nazis planned to kill or expel most or all ethnic [[Slavs]] from large regions of [[Eastern Europe]] and replace them with German settlers. 
* The [[German exodus from Eastern Europe]]. Although the exact numbers may never be known, some estimates claim that more than 16 million people had to leave their homes, and that approximately 2 million of those lost their lives during the process.
* The exodus of [[Italy|Italian people]] from [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] after [[World War II]]
*[[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|Systematic deportations of numerous nationalities]] in the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Joseph Stalin]].
* The [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia|ethnic cleansing of Volhynia]] by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] guerrilla groups.
* The expulsion of Poles from [[Zamosc Voivodship]] by Germans in [[1944]].
* The expulsion of 800,000 Poles from [[Warsaw]] to [[concentration camp]]s after defeat of [[Warsaw Uprising]] [[1944]], caused 200,000 deaths. The city of Warsaw, population of one million, was ordered to be completely demolished on the personal order of [[Hitler]]. Approximately 80% of the city was demolished. 
* [[Finns]] evacuated from [[Finnish Karelia]] and other parts occupied by Soviet Union during World War II, leaving behind ethnically clean area. This was voluntary, but they evacuated fearing the Soviet rule and deportations to [[Siberia]] that happened in Soviet Union before to many nationalities, including Finns, see [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]].
* Mass expulsions of [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s from [[Pakistan]] to [[India]], resulting in the complete ethnic cleansing of former West-Pakistan (current Republic of Pakistan), and the mass expulsions of [[Muslim]]s from India to Pakistan, both following the [[partition of india|partition]] of British India in [[1947]].
* Since [[1947]] expulsions of Hindus from both the Pakistani and Indian ruled regions of the disputed territory of [[Kashmir]] by [[Islamist]] militant groups.
* The [[Nakba]], or [[Palestinian exodus]], in which the substantial majority of [[Palestinian]]s (600,000-900,000) in the areas of [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] that became part of [[Israel]] fled or were forcibly deported by Jewish forces during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].
* The flight of Jews from the areas of Palestine occupied by [[Jordan]] and [[Egypt]] during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].
* The [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]] - [[Yemen]], [[Morocco]] and [[Iraq]] during [[1948]]-[[1950]], as well as flights which took place over the following 20 years from [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and other Arab countries.
* The mass deportation of ethnic minorities from their homelands, including [[East Timor]] and [[Western New Guinea|Papua]], by the [[Indonesia]]n government, beginning with Indonesian independence in [[1949]] (and subsequent occupation and annexation of Papua until the present day and of East Timor until 1999).
* The mass expulsions of Greek Cypriots from northern [[Cyprus]] and of Turkish Cypriots from southern Cyprus in [[1974]]-[[1975]].
* The widespread ethnic cleansing accompanying the [[Yugoslav wars]] from [[1991]] to [[1999]], of which the most significant examples occurred in eastern [[Croatia]] and [[Krajina]] ([[1991]]-[[1995]]), in most of [[Bosnia]] ([[1992]]-[[1995]]), and in the [[Albanian]]-dominated breakaway [[Kosovo]] province (of [[Serbia]]) ([[1999]]). Large numbers of [[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Bosniaks]] and [[Albanians]] were forced to flee their homes and expelled.
* The forced displacement of some 800,000 [[Azeri]]s and 300,000 [[Armenian people|Armenians]] during the conflict between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] and the Armenian invasion of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and surrounding areas from [[1988]] to [[1994]].
* The forced displacement of some 300,000 Georgians and other non-Abkhazians from [[Abkhazia]] in [[1993]]. 
* The [[1994]] massacres of [[Tutsis]] by [[Hutus]], known as the [[Rwandan Genocide]]
* The forced resettlement of some 9,000 [[Jew]]ish settlers from the [[Gaza Strip]] and the northern [[West Bank]] by the [[Israel]]i government as part of the [[Israel unilateral disengagement plan|unilateral disengagement plan]] is compared to ethnic cleansing both by the extreme opposition to the act and by more neutral observers.
* Attacks by the [[Janjaweed]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking African [[Muslim]] militias of [[Sudan]] on the non-[[Arab]] [[African]] [[Muslim]] population of [[Darfur]], a region of western Sudan.

==Ethnic cleansing as a military and political tactic==

The purpose of ethnic cleansing is to remove the conditions for potential and actual opposition, whether political, terrorist, guerrilla or military, by physically removing any potentially or actually hostile ethnic communities. Although it has sometimes been motivated by a doctrine that claim an ethnic group is literally "unclean" (as in the case of the Jews of medieval Europe), more usually it has been a rational (if brutal) way of ensuring that total control can be asserted over an area. The campaign in Bosnia in early 1992 was a case in point. The tactic was used by Croatian, Muslim Bosnian and Serbian forces. Ethnic cleansing is often also accompanied by efforts to eradicate all physical traces of the expelled ethnic group, such as by the destruction of cultural artifacts, religious sites and physical records [http://www.rastko.org.yu/kosovo/crucified/default.htm#_catalog]. 

As a tactic, ethnic cleansing has a number of significant advantages and disadvantages. It enables a force to eliminate civilian support for resistance by eliminating the civilians &amp;#8212; in a reversal of [[Mao Zedong]]'s dictum that guerrillas among a civilian population are fish in water, it drains the water. When enforced as part of a political settlement, as happened with the forced resettlement of ethnic Germans to Germany after [[1945]], it can contribute to long-term stability. The large German populations in [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]] had been sources of friction before the Second World War, but this was forcibly resolved. It thus establishes "facts on the ground" - radical demographic changes which can be very hard to reverse.

On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is such a brutal tactic and so often accompanied by large-scale bloodshed that it is widely reviled. It is generally regarded as lying somewhere between [[population transfer]]s and [[genocide]] on a scale of odiousness, and is treated by international law as a [[war crime]].

==Ethnic cleansing as international law crime==

Ethnic cleansing is designated a [[crime against humanity]] in international treaties, such as that which created the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) was set up in a similar spirit, and prosecutes these crimes under more generic names. 

The United Nations' General Assembly condemns "ethnic cleansing" and racial hatred in a [[1992]] resolution [http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r080.htm].

The emergence of ethnic cleansing as a distinct category of war crime has been a somewhat complex process. Each individual element of a programme of ethnic cleansing could be considered as an individual violation of humanitarian law - a killing here, a house-burning there - thus missing the systematic way in which such violations were perpetrated with a single aim in mind. International courts therefore consider individual incidents in the light of a possible pattern of ethnic cleansing. In the Yugoslav case, for instance, the ICTY considers the widespread massacres and abuses of human rights in Bosnia and Kosovo as part of an overall "joint criminal enterprise" to carve out ethnically pure states in the region.

However, many alleged "ethnic cleansings" in the past do not fit the modern definition of "crimes against humanity."  For example, the post-WW2 [[German expulsions]] were sanctioned by the international agreement at [[Potsdam conference]], requiring that the actions proceed humanely.
