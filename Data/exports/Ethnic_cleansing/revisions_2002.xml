an area by force in order to create an ethnically homogenous state.  The term was first used by Serbians
in the Balkans during the 1990's to describe their actions in Bosnia and Kosovo, but quickly acquired a pejorative meaning.  Ethnic cleansing is widely considered a [[crime against humanity]] which is intended to be punished by the [[International Criminal Court]].  Nevertheless, some commentators have pointed out that mass population
transfers can create political situations which are more stable than those involving multi-ethnic states and point to the [[partition of India]] and the post-World War II political situation in Eastern Europe as evidence for
this claim.  Others point out that regarding ethnic cleansing as a crime against humanity raises disturbing
questions about historical events such as the [[German expulsion after World War II]].</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
