'''Ethnic cleansing'''  is the systematic forced removal of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or religious groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, with the intent of making it ethnically [[homogeneous]].&lt;ref&gt;The Cultural Landscape: An Introduction to Human Geography, James M. Rubenstein&lt;/ref&gt; The forces applied may be various forms of [[forced migration]] ([[deportation]], [[population transfer]]), intimidation, as well as [[mass murder]].

Ethnic cleansing is usually accompanied with the efforts to remove physical and cultural evidence of the targeted group in the territory through the destruction of homes, social centers, farms, and infrastructure, and by the desecration of monuments, cemeteries, and places of worship.

Initially used by the perpetrators during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and cited in this context as a euphemism akin to that of the "[[final solution]]", by the 1990s the term gained widespread acceptance in academic discourse in its generic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thum |first1= Gregor |year= 2006–2007 |title= Ethnic Cleansing in Eastern Europe after 1945 |journal= Contemporary European History |volume= 19 |issue=1 |pages= 75–81 |doi=10.1017/S0960777309990257 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic cleansing vs. genocide==

The crimes committed during an ethnic cleansing are similar to those of [[genocides]], but while genocide includes an intent at complete or partial destruction of the target group, ethnic cleansing may involve murder only to the point of mobilizing the target group out of the territory. Hence there may be varied degrees of mass murder in an ethnic cleansing, often subsiding when the target group appears to be leaving the desired territory, while during genocide the mass murder is ubiquitous and constant throughout the process, continuing even while the target group tries to flee.&lt;ref name="SCRes780-Report"&gt;Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 780]] (1992), May 27, 1994 ([http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 S/1994/674]), English page=33, Paragraph 130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethnic%20cleansing|title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic cleansing is not to be confused with [[genocide]]; however, academic discourse considers both as existing in a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups. Ethnic cleansing is similar to forced deportation or population transfer whereas genocide is the intentional murder of part or all of a particular ethnic, religious, or national group.&lt;ref name=Schabas&gt;[Schabas W. A., 2000, Genocide in International Law, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.][https://books.google.com/books?id=pYptuRHDQPgC&amp;printsec=frontcover]&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics consider genocide as a subset of "murderous ethnic cleansing."&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;[Mann M., 2005,The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.][https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Dark+Side+of+Democracy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, these concepts are different, but related; "literally and figuratively, ethnic cleansing bleeds into genocide, as mass murder is committed in order to rid the land of a people."&lt;ref name=MassVio&gt;[Naimark, N. 2007, Theoretical Paper: Ethnic Cleansing, Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence][http://www.massviolence.org/Ethnic-Cleansing]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Final Report of the Commission of Experts established pursuant to [[Security Council Resolution 780]] defined ethnic cleansing as "a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas."&lt;ref name="SCRes780-Report"/&gt; In its previous, first interim report it noted, "[b]ased on the many reports describing the policy and practices conducted in the former [[Yugoslavia]], [that] 'ethnic cleansing' has been carried out by means of murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, [[war rape|rape]] and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, and wanton destruction of property. Those practices constitute crimes against humanity and can be assimilated to specific war crimes. Furthermore, such acts could also fall within the meaning of the Genocide Convention".&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 780]] (1992), May 27, 1994 ([http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 S/1994/674]), English page=33, Paragraph 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The official United Nations definition of ethnic cleansing is "rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or [[intimidation]] to remove from a given area persons of another ethnic or religious group".&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, Robert M. (1996) [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0037-6779(199624)55%3A4%3C727%3ASFGECA%3E2.0.CO;2-Y Schindler's Fate: Genocide, Ethnic Cleansing, and Population Transfers].

As a category, ethnic cleansing encompasses a continuum or spectrum of policies. In the words of [[Andrew Bell-Fialkoff]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]thnic cleansing [...] defies easy definition. At one end it is virtually indistinguishable from forced emigration and population exchange while at the other it merges with [[deportation]] and [[genocide]]. At the most general level, however, ethnic cleansing can be understood as the expulsion of a population from a given territory''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew  Bell-Fialkoff, "[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html A Brief History of Ethnic Cleansing]", Foreign Affairs 72 (3): 110, Summer 1993.

[[Terry Martin (publisher)|Terry Martin]] has defined ethnic cleansing as "the forcible removal of an ethnically defined population from a given territory" and as "occupying the central part of a continuum between genocide on one end and nonviolent pressured ethnic emigration on the other end."&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;Martin, Terry (1998).

In reviewing the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) [[Bosnian Genocide Case]] in the judgement of [[Jorgic v. Germany]] on July 12, 2007 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] quoted from the ICJ ruling on the ''Bosnian Genocide Case'' to draw a distinction between ''ethnic cleansing'' and ''genocide''.
{{quote|The term 'ethnic cleansing' has frequently been employed to refer to the events in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] which are the subject of this case ... [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]] resolution 47/121 referred in its Preamble to 'the abhorrent policy of 'ethnic cleansing', which is a form of genocide', as being carried on in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ... It [''i.e. ethnic cleansing''] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|[Genocide] Convention]], if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area "ethnically homogeneous", nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can as such be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is "to destroy, in whole or in part" a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''[[dolus specialis]]''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. As the [[ICTY]] has observed, while 'there are obvious similarities between a genocidal policy and the policy commonly known as 'ethnic cleansing' ' (''Krstić,'' IT-98-33-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, August 2, 2001, para. 562), yet '[a] clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group. The expulsion of a group or part of a group does not in itself suffice for genocide. |ECHR quoting the ICJ.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=54&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;action=html&amp;highlight=&amp;sessionid=1448788&amp;skin=hudoc-en Jorgic v.

==Origins of the term==
As early as 1914, a [[Carnegie Endowment]] report on the [[Balkan Wars]] points out that village-burning and ethnic cleansing had traditionally accompanied [[Balkan]] wars, regardless of the ethnic group in power. During the Balkan Wars thousands of Albanians were [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|massacred]] during the Serbian occupation of Kosovo, Macedonia and northern and central Albania. However, the term "cleanse" was probably used first in reference to removing ethnic groups from an area by [[Vuk Karadžić]] in describing what happened to the [[Turkish people|Turks]] in Belgrade when the city was captured by the [[Karadjordje]]'s forces in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Judah, Tim |title=The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia |year=1997 |location=New Haven and London |publisher=Yale University Press|page=75 |isbn=0-300-08507-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Konstantin Nenadović]] wrote, in his biography of the famous Serbian leader published in 1883, that after the fighting "the Serbs, in their bitterness (after 500 years of Turkish occupation), slit the throats of the Turks everywhere they found them, sparing neither the wounded, nor the woman, nor the Turkish children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mirko Grmek, Marc Gjidara, Neven Simac|title=Le Nettoyage ethnique: Documents historiques sur une idéologie serbe |year=1993 |location=Paris |language=French|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(June 30, 1941), [[Stevan Moljević]] (a lawyer from [[Banja Luka]] who was also an ideologue of the [[Chetnik]]s), published a booklet with the title "On Our State and Its Borders". Moljević asserted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"One must take advantage of the war conditions and at a suitable moment seize the territory marked on the map, cleanse ''[očistiti]'' it before anybody notices and with strong battalions occupy the key places (...) and the territory surrounding these cities, freed of non-Serb elements. The guilty must be promptly punished and the others deported – the Croats to (significantly amputated) Croatia, the Muslims to [[Turkey]] or perhaps [[Albania]] – while the vacated territory is settled with Serb refugees now located in Serbia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=3025&amp;reportid=169|title=The Moljevic Memorandum|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2009}}&lt;ref name="p. 106"&gt;Nicholas A.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the concept of ethnic cleansing was not restricted to Yugoslavia during this period. The Russian phrase очистка границ (''ochistka granits'' "cleansing of borders") was used in [[Soviet Union]] documents of the early 1930s to refer to the forced resettlement of [[Polish people]] from the 22&amp;nbsp;km [[Border Security Zone of Russia|border zone]] in the [[Byelorussian SSR]] and [[Ukrainian SSR]]. This process was repeated on an even larger and wider scale in 1939–1941, involving many other ethnicities with allegedly external loyalties: see [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union]] and [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt;

Most notoriously, the [[Nazism|Nazi]] administration in Germany under [[Adolf Hitler]] applied a similar term to their systematic replacement of the Jewish people. When an area under Nazi control had its entire Jewish population removed, by driving the population out, by deportation to [[Concentration Camp]]s and/or murder, that area was declared ''[[judenrein]]'' (lit. "Jew Clean"): "cleansed of Jews" (cf. [[racial hygiene]]).

In 1946 [[Königsberg]] was renamed [[Kaliningrad]]. The survivors of the German population were forcibly expelled and the city was repopulated with Soviet citizens.
In the 1990s [[Bosnian war]], ethnic cleansing was a common phenomenon. It typically entailed intimidation, forced expulsion and/or killing of the undesired ethnic group, as well as the destruction or removal of key physical and cultural elements. These included places of worship, cemeteries, works of art and historic buildings. According to numerous ICTY verdicts, both Serb&lt;ref name="ICTY: Radoslav Brđanin judgement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/brdjanin/trialc/judgement/index.htm |title=ICTY: Radoslav Brđanin judgement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120716184230/http://www.un.org/icty/brdjanin/trialc/judgement/index.htm |archivedate=July 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Croat&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/index.htm |title=ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140816072223/http://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/index.htm |archivedate=August 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forces performed ethnic cleansing of their intended territories in order to create ethnically pure states ([[Republika Srpska]] and [[Herzeg-Bosnia]]). Serb forces were also judged to have committed [[Srebrenica genocide|genocide in Srebrenica and Zepa]] at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;ICTY; "Address by ICTY President Theodor Meron, at Potočari Memorial Cemetery" The Hague, June 23, 2004 [http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2004/p860-e.htm] {{wayback|url=http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2004/p860-e.htm |date=20121017124026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the evidence of numerous attacks by Croat forces against Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), the ICTY Trial Chamber concluded in the ''Kordić and Čerkez case'' that by April 1993, the Croat leadership from Bosnia and Herzegovina had a designated plan to [[Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleanse Bosniaks from the Lašva Valley]] in Central Bosnia.

In the same year (1993), ethnic cleansing was also occurring in another country. During the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|Georgian-Abkhaz conflict]], the armed [[Abkhazia|Abkhaz]] [[separatist]] insurgency implemented a campaign of [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing]] against the large population of ethnic Georgians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Without an NEUTRAL expert opinion this sentence is OR.

Gothic Image Publications, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1993, February 1994, Chapter 17.&lt;/ref&gt; This was recognized as ethnic cleansing by [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] conventions, and was also mentioned in [[UN General Assembly Resolution]] GA/10708.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2008/ga10708.doc.htm General Assembly Adopts Resolution Recognizing Right Of Return By Refugees, Internally Displaced Persons To Abkhazia, Georgia&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a tactic, ethnic cleansing has a number of systemic impacts. It enables a force to eliminate civilian support for resistance by eliminating the civilians — recognizing [[Mao Zedong]]'s dictum that guerrillas among a civilian population are fish in water, it removes the fish by draining the water{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. When enforced as part of a political settlement, as happened with the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forced resettlement of ethnic Germans to the new Germany]] after 1945, it can contribute to long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;Judt, Tony. ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals of the large German population in [[Czechoslovakia]] and prewar [[Poland]] had encouraged Nazi [[jingoism]] before the Second World War, but this was forcibly resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Judt ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It thus establishes "[[facts on the ground]]" – radical demographic changes which can be very hard to reverse.

==Ethnic cleansing as a crime under international law==

There is no formal legal definition of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;Ward Ferdinandusse, [http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf The Interaction of National and International Approaches in the Repression of International Crimes], The European Journal of International Law Vol. 15 no.5 (2004), p. 1042, note 7. {{wayback|url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf |date=20080705180121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ethnic cleansing in the broad sense – the forcible deportation of a population – is defined as a crime against humanity under the statutes of both [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm ''Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''], Article 7; [http://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc-e/index.htm ''Updated Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia''], Article 5. {{wayback|url=http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm |date=20121030214344 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gross human-rights violations integral to stricter definitions of ethnic cleansing are treated as separate crimes falling under the definitions for genocide or crimes against humanity of the statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Daphna Shraga and Ralph Zacklin [http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html "The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia"], The European Journal of International Law Vol. 15 no.3 (2004). {{wayback|url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html |date=20070927233818 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Commission of Experts (established pursuant to [[Security Council Resolution 780]]) held that the practices associated with ethnic cleansing "constitute crimes against humanity and can be assimilated to specific war crimes. Furthermore ... such acts could also fall within the meaning of the Genocide Convention." The UN General Assembly condemned "ethnic cleansing" and racial hatred in a 1992 resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r080.htm A/RES/47/80] ""Ethnic cleansing" and racial hatred" United Nations. December 16, 1992. Retrieved on 2006, 09–03&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however situations, such as the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]], where ethnic cleansing has taken place without legal redress (see [[Preussische Treuhand v. Poland|''Preussische Treuhand'' v. Poland]]). [[Timothy V. Waters]] argues that if similar circumstances arise in the future, this precedent would allow the ethnic cleansing of other populations under international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4600&amp;context=expresso Timothy V. Waters, ''On the Legal Construction of Ethnic Cleansing''], Paper 951, 2006, [[University of Mississippi]] School of Law. Retrieved on 2006, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--The emergence of ethnic cleansing as a distinct category of war crime has been a somewhat complex process. Each individual element of a programme of ethnic cleansing could be considered as an individual violation of humanitarian law - a killing here, a house-burning there – thus missing the systematic way in which such violations were perpetrated with a single aim in mind. International courts therefore consider individual incidents in the light of a possible pattern of ethnic cleansing. In the Yugoslav case, for instance, the ICTY considers the widespread massacres and abuses of human rights in Bosnia and Kosovo as part of an overall "joint criminal enterprise" to carve out ethnically pure states in the region.

However, many alleged "ethnic cleansings" in the past do not fit the modern definition of "crimes against humanity."  For example, the post-WW2 [[German expulsions]] were sanctioned by the international agreement at [[Potsdam conference]], requiring that the actions proceed humanely.--&gt;

==Silent ethnic cleansing==
'''Silent ethnic cleansing''' is a term coined in the mid-1990s by some observers of the [[Yugoslav wars]].  Apparently concerned with Western media representations of atrocities committed in the conflict — which generally focused on those perpetrated by the [[Serbs]] — atrocities committed against Serbs were dubbed "silent", on the grounds that they were not receiving adequate coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Krauthammer, Charles: "When Serbs Are 'Cleansed,' Moralists Stay Silent", ''International Herald Tribune'', August 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, the term has been used by other ethnically oriented groups for situations that they perceive to be similar — examples include both sides in [[Ireland]]'s [[The Troubles|Troubles]], and the expulsion of [[Volksdeutsche|ethnic Germans]] from former German territories during and after World War II.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009|reason=needs sources for both alleged examples}}

Some observers,{{Who|date=August 2009}} however, assert that the term should only be used to denote population changes that do not occur as the result of overt violent action, or at least not from more or less organized aggression – the absence of such stressors being the very factor that makes it "silent", although some form of coercion is still used. The United States practiced this during the Indian Wars of the 19th century.

In many cases where accusations of ethnic cleansings have circulated, partisans have fiercely disputed such an interpretation and the details of the events which have been described as ethnic cleansing by academic or legal experts. This often leads to the promotion of vastly different versions of the event in question.

==Criticism of the term==
[[Gregory Stanton]], the founder of [[Genocide Watch]], has criticised the rise of the term and its use for events that he feels should be called "genocide": as "ethnic cleansing" has no legal definition, its media use can detract attention from events that should be prosecuted as genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blum |first=Rony |last2=Stanton |first2=Gregory H. |last3=Sagi |first3=Shira |last4=Richter |first4=Elihu D. |title='Ethnic cleansing' bleaches the atrocities of genocide |journal=European Journal of Public Health |year=2007 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pmid=17513346 |pages=204–209 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckm011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "'Ethnic Cleansing and Genocidal Intent: A Failure of Judicial Interpretation?", Genocide Studies and Prevention 5, 1 (April 2010), Douglas Singleterry&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the term "ethnic cleansing" ({{lang-de|Ethnische Säuberung}}) was named [[Un-word of the year (Germany)|German Un-Word of the Year]] by the ''[[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]]'' due to its euphemistic, inappropriate nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l18/l0/F.html#featuredEntry [[Spiegel Online]]: ''Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!'' (in German).]&lt;/ref&gt;
