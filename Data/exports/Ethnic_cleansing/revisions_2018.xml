'''Ethnic cleansing''' is the systematic forced removal of [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] or racial groups from a given territory by a more powerful ethnic group, often with the intent of making it ethnically [[homogeneous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Rubenstein |title=The Cultural Landscape: An Introduction to Human Geography |publisher=Pearson, |year=2008 |isbn=9780131346819}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} The forces applied may be various forms of [[forced migration]] ([[deportation]], [[population transfer]]), intimidation, as well as [[genocide]] and [[genocidal rape]].

Ethnic cleansing is usually accompanied with efforts to remove physical and cultural evidence of the targeted group in the territory through the destruction of homes, social centers, farms, and infrastructure, and by the desecration of monuments, cemeteries, and places of worship.

Initially used by the perpetrators during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and cited in this context as a euphemism akin to that of Nazi Germany's "[[Final Solution]]", by the 1990s, the term gained widespread acceptance due to journalism and the media's heightened use of the term in its generic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Thum |first1= Gregor |year= 2006–2007 |title= Ethnic Cleansing in Eastern Europe after 1945 |journal= Contemporary European History |volume= 19 |issue=1 |pages= 75–81 |doi=10.1017/S0960777309990257 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
An antecedent to the term is the Greek word ''andrapodismos'' ({{lang-gr|ανδραποδισμός}}; lit. "enslavement"), which was used in ancient texts to describe atrocities that accompanied [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in 335 BC.&lt;ref name="Booth"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Booth|year=2012|title=The Kosovo Tragedy: The Human Rights Dimensions|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1-13633-476-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e4MsBgAAQBAJe|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, regional variants of the term could be found among the Czechs ''(očista)'', the Poles ''(oczyszczanie)'', the French ''(épuration)'' and the Germans ''(Säuberung)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Ther |editor1=Rainer Munz |editor2=Rainer Ohliger |year=2004 |title=Diasporas and Ethnic Migrants: Germany, Israel and Russia in Comparative Perspective |chapter=The Spell of the Homogeneous Nation State: Structural Factors and Agents of Ethnic Cleansing |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-1-13575-938-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEOQAgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} A 1913 [[Carnegie Endowment]] report condemning the actions of all participants in the [[Balkan Wars]] contained various new terms to describe brutalities committed toward ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://balkanologie.revues.org/2365|title=The Two Carnegie Reports: From the Balkan Expedition of 1913 to the Albanian Trip of 1921|first=Nadine|last=Akhund|date=December 31, 2012|publisher=|journal=Balkanologie.

During [[World War II]], the euphemism ''čišćenje terena'' ("cleansing the terrain") was used by the Croatian [[Ustaše]] to describe military actions in which non-Croats were purposely killed or otherwise uprooted from their homes.&lt;ref name="Toal"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toal|first1=Gerard|last2=Dahlman|first2=Carl T.|title=Bosnia Remade: Ethnic Cleansing and Its Reversal|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=2011|isbn= 978-0-19-973036-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1TrvGxJeasC|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viktor Gutić]], a senior Ustaše leader, was one of the first Croatian nationalists on record to use the term as a euphemism for committing atrocities against [[Serbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard |last=West|year=1994|title=Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7867-0332-6|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later used in the internal memorandums of Serbian [[Chetniks]] in reference to a number of retaliatory massacres they committed against [[Bosniaks]] and [[Croats]] between 1941 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edina |last=Becirevic|year=2014|title=Genocide on the River Drina|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn=978-0-3001-9258-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0X4AwAAQBAJ|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian phrase очистка границ (''ochistka granits''; lit. "cleansing of borders") was used in Soviet documents of the early 1930s to refer to the forced resettlement of Polish people from the {{convert|22|km|adj=on}} [[Border Security Zone of Russia|border zone]] in the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian]] and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSRs]]. This process was repeated on an even larger scale in 1939–41, involving many other groups suspected of disloyalty towards the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; During [[The Holocaust]], [[Nazi Germany]] pursued a policy of ensuring that Europe was "cleansed of Jews" ''([[Judenrein]])''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mary |last=Fulbrooke|year=2004|title=A Concise History of Germany|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-52154-071-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFBu8ujJWzkC|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its complete form, the term appeared for the first time in the Romanian language (''purificare etnică'') in an address by Vice Prime Minister [[Mihai Antonescu]] to cabinet members in July 1941. After the beginning of the invasion of the USSR,{{huh?|date=October 2017}} he concluded: “I do not know when the Romanians will have such chance for ethnic cleansing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnopolitical Temptations Reach Southeastern Europe: Wartime Policy Papers of Vasa Čubrilović and Sabin Manuilă|last=Petrovic|first=Vladimir|publisher=CEU Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, the Soviets used the term "ethnic cleansing" to describe the inter-ethnic violence in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].&lt;ref name="Booth"/&gt; At around the same time, the Yugoslav media used it to describe what they alleged was an Albanian nationalist plot to force all Serbs to leave [[Kosovo]]. It was widely popularized by the Western media during the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–95). The first recorded mention of its use in the Western media can be traced back to an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' dated 15 April 1992, in a quote by an anonymous Western diplomat.&lt;ref name="Toal"/&gt;

Synonyms include ''ethnic purification''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Drazen |last=Petrovic |url=http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/5/1/1247.pdf |title=Ethnic Cleansing – An Attempt at Methodology |journal=European Journal of International Law |volume=5 |issue=3 |year=1994 |page=343 |accessdate=May 20, 2006 |quote=In English, reference is also made to 'ethnic purification'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Final Report of the Commission of Experts established pursuant to [[Security Council Resolution 780]] defined ethnic cleansing as "a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas".&lt;ref name="SCRes780-Report-130"&gt;{{cite web |title=Final Report of the Commission of Experts Established Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 780 (1992) |date=May 27, 1994 |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/1994/674 |publisher=United Nations Security Council |format=PDF |page=33 &lt;!--paragraph 130--&gt; |quote=Upon examination of reported information, specific studies and investigations, the Commission confirms its earlier view that 'ethnic cleansing' is a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas.

This purpose appears to be the occupation of territory to the exclusion of the purged group or groups.

The official United Nations definition of ethnic cleansing is "rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or [[intimidation]] to remove from a given area persons of another ethnic or religious group".&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, Robert M. (1996) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2501233 "Schindler's Fate: Genocide, Ethnic Cleansing, and Population Transfers"]. ''[[Slavic Review]]'' 55 (4), 727-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a category, ethnic cleansing encompasses a continuum or spectrum of policies. In the words of [[Andrew Bell-Fialkoff]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]thnic cleansing [...] defies easy definition. At one end it is virtually indistinguishable from forced emigration and population exchange while at the other it merges with deportation and genocide. At the most general level, however, ethnic cleansing can be understood as the expulsion of a population from a given territory''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Bell-Fialkoff, [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html "A Brief History of Ethnic Cleansing"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040203000000/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html |date=February 3, 2004 }}, ''Foreign Affairs'' 72 (3): 110, Summer 1993.

[[Terry Martin (publisher)|Terry Martin]] has defined ethnic cleansing as "the forcible removal of an ethnically defined population from a given territory" and as "occupying the central part of a continuum between genocide on one end and nonviolent pressured ethnic emigration on the other end".&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;Martin, Terry (1998). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/235168 "The Origins of Soviet Ethnic Cleansing"]. ''[[The Journal of Modern History]]'' 70 (4), 813–861. pg. 822&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) [[Bosnian Genocide Case]] in the judgement of [[Jorgic v. Germany]] on July 12, 2007 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] quoted from the ICJ ruling on the ''Bosnian Genocide Case'' to draw a distinction between ''ethnic cleansing'' and ''genocide'':
{{quote|The term 'ethnic cleansing' has frequently been employed to refer to the events in Bosnia and Herzegovina which are the subject of this case ... [UN] General Assembly resolution 47/121 referred in its Preamble to 'the abhorrent policy of "ethnic cleansing", which is a form of genocide', as being carried on in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ... It [i.e., ethnic cleansing] can only be a form of genocide within the meaning of the [Genocide] Convention, if it corresponds to or falls within one of the categories of acts prohibited by Article II of the Convention. Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area "ethnically homogeneous", nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can ''as such'' be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is "to destroy, in whole or in part" a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''dolus specialis''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. As the ICTY has observed, while 'there are obvious similarities between a genocidal policy and the policy commonly known as 'ethnic cleansing' (''Krstić'', IT-98-33-T, Trial Chamber Judgment, 2 August 2001, para. 562), yet '[a] clear distinction must be drawn between physical destruction and mere dissolution of a group. The expulsion of a group or part of a group does not in itself suffice for genocide.' |ECHR quoting the ICJ.&lt;ref&gt;[[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]] [http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-81608 ''Jorgic v. Germany''] §45 citing ''Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro'' ("Case concerning application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide"), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) found under the heading of “intent and ‘ethnic cleansing’” (at § 190)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==As a crime under international law==

There is no international treaty that specifies a specific crime of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ward |last=Ferdinandusse |url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf |title=The Interaction of National and International Approaches in the Repression of International Crimes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705180121/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |journal=The European Journal of International Law |volume=15 |number=5 |year=2004 |p=1042, note 7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ethnic cleansing in the broad sense—the forcible deportation of a population—is defined as a [[crime against humanity]] under the statutes of both [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm "Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113100723/http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm |date=January 13, 2008 }}, Article 7; [https://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc-e/index.htm ''Updated Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia''], Article 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The gross human-rights violations integral to stricter definitions of ethnic cleansing are treated as separate crimes falling under public international law of [[crimes against humanity]] and in certain circumstances [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daphna |last=Shraga |first2=Ralph |last2=Zacklin |url=http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html |title=The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233818/http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |journal=The European Journal of International Law |volume=15 |number=3 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however situations, such as the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]], where ethnic cleansing has taken place without legal redress (see [[Preussische Treuhand v. Poland|''Preussische Treuhand'' v. Poland]]). [[Timothy V. Waters]] argues therefore that similar ethnic cleansing could go unpunished in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy V. Waters, [http://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4600&amp;context=expresso "On the Legal Construction of Ethnic Cleansing"], Paper 951, 2006, [[University of Mississippi]] School of Law. Retrieved on 2006, 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The emergence of ethnic cleansing as a distinct category of war crime has been a somewhat complex process. Each individual element of a programme of ethnic cleansing could be considered as an individual violation of humanitarian law - a killing here, a house-burning there – thus missing the systematic way in which such violations were perpetrated with a single aim in mind. International courts therefore consider individual incidents in the light of a possible pattern of ethnic cleansing. In the Yugoslav case, for instance, the ICTY considers the widespread massacres and abuses of human rights in Bosnia and Kosovo as part of an overall "joint criminal enterprise" to carve out ethnically pure states in the region.

However, many alleged "ethnic cleansings" in the past do not fit the modern definition of "crimes against humanity". For example, the post-WWII [[German expulsions]] were sanctioned by the international agreement at [[Potsdam conference]], requiring that the actions proceed humanely.--&gt;

==Genocide==
[[File:Armenianvictimsassault.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian Genocide]] victims]]
Academic discourse considers both [[genocide]] and ethnic cleansing to exist in a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups. Ethnic cleansing is similar to forced deportation or population transfer whereas genocide is the intentional murder of part or all of a particular ethnic, racial, religious, or national group. While ethnic cleansing and genocide may share the same goal and the acts used to perpetrate both crimes may often resemble each other, ethnic cleansing is intended to displace a persecuted population from a given territory, while genocide is intended to destroy a population.&lt;ref name=Schabas&gt;{{cite book |last=Schabas |first=William |year=2000 |title=Genocide in International Law |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYptuRHDQPgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |pages=199–201 |isbn=9780521787901}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some academics consider genocide as a subset of "murderous ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael |year=2005 |title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Dark+Side+of+Democracy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page=17 |isbn=9780521538541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, these concepts are different, but related, as Norman Naimark writes: "literally and figuratively, ethnic cleansing bleeds into genocide, as mass murder is committed in order to rid the land of a people".&lt;ref name=MassVio&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Naimark |first=Norman |date=4 November 2007 |url=http://www.massviolence.org/Ethnic-Cleansing |title=Theoretical Paper: Ethnic Cleansing |encyclopedia=Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306173512/http://www.massviolence.org/Ethnic-Cleansing |archivedate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William Schabas adds, "Ethnic cleansing is also a warning sign of genocide to come.

In 1946 [[Königsberg]] was renamed [[Kaliningrad]]. The survivors of the German population were forcibly expelled and the city was repopulated with Soviet citizens.

In the 1990s [[Bosnian war]], ethnic cleansing was a common phenomenon. It typically entailed intimidation, forced expulsion and/or killing of the undesired ethnic group, as well as the destruction or removal of key physical and cultural elements. These included places of worship, cemeteries, works of art and historic buildings.

Based on the evidence of numerous attacks by Croat forces against Bosnian Muslims (Bosniaks), the ICTY Trial Chamber concluded in the ''Kordić and Čerkez case'' that by April 1993, the Croat leadership from Bosnia and Herzegovina had a designated plan to ethnically cleanse Bosniaks from the Lašva Valley in Central Bosnia. Dario Kordić, the local political leader, was found to be the instigator of this plan.&lt;ref name="ICTY: Kordić and Čerkez verdict - IV. Attacks on towns and villages: killings - C.

In the same year (1993), ethnic cleansing was also occurring in another country. During the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–93)|Georgian-Abkhaz conflict]], the armed [[Abkhazia|Abkhaz]] [[separatist]] insurgency implemented a campaign of [[Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia|ethnic cleansing]] against the large population of ethnic Georgians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Without an NEUTRAL expert opinion this sentence is OR.

As a tactic, ethnic cleansing has a number of systemic impacts. It enables a force to eliminate civilian support for resistance by eliminating the civilians—recognizing [[Mao Zedong]]'s dictum that guerrillas among a civilian population are fish in water, it removes the fish by draining the water{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. When enforced as part of a political settlement, as happened with the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|forced resettlement of ethnic Germans to the new Germany]] after 1945, it can contribute to long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;Judt, Tony. ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} Some individuals of the large German population in [[Czechoslovakia]] and prewar [[Poland]] had encouraged Nazi [[jingoism]] before the Second World War, but this was forcibly resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Judt ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945'' Penguin Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2016}} It thus establishes "[[facts on the ground]]"—radical demographic changes which can be very hard to reverse.

Silent ethnic cleansing is a term coined in the mid-1990s by some observers of the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. Apparently concerned with Western media representations of atrocities committed in the conflict—which generally focused on those perpetrated by the Serbs—atrocities committed against [[Serbs]] were dubbed "silent" on the grounds that they did not receive adequate coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Krauthammer, Charles: "When Serbs Are 'Cleansed,' Moralists Stay Silent", ''International Herald Tribune'', August 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some incidents in [[Northern Ireland]] and during [[the Troubles]] between Protestants and Catholics were considered to be "ethnic cleansing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jan/10/northernireland.race|title=Racist war of the loyalist street gangs|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis|date=January 10, 2004|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/06/07/news/unionist-react-angrily-to-ira-ethnic-cleansing-plan-550226/|title=Unionists react angrily to IRA ‘ethnic cleansing' border plan|website=The Irish News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included events after the [[Holy Cross dispute]] in 2001 when Protestant paramilitaries were accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing of Catholics in north [[Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1974017.stm|title=Fresh trouble in Belfast|date=May 8, 2002|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/sep/09/northernireland.rosiecowan|title='Ethnic cleansing' claim over Ulster attacks|first=Rosie|last=Cowan|date=September 9, 2002|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases where accusations of ethnic cleansing have circulated, partisans have fiercely disputed such an interpretation and the details of the events which have been described as ethnic cleansing by academic or legal experts. This often leads to the promotion of vastly different versions of the event in question.

==Criticism of the term==
[[Gregory Stanton]], the founder of [[Genocide Watch]], has criticised the rise of the term and its use for events that he feels should be called "genocide": as "ethnic cleansing" has no legal definition, its media use can detract attention from events that should be prosecuted as genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blum |first=Rony |last2=Stanton |first2=Gregory H. |last3=Sagi |first3=Shira |last4=Richter |first4=Elihu D. |title='Ethnic cleansing' bleaches the atrocities of genocide |journal=European Journal of Public Health |year=2007 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pmid=17513346 |pages=204–209 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckm011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also "Ethnic Cleansing and Genocidal Intent: A Failure of Judicial Interpretation?", ''Genocide Studies and Prevention'' 5, 1 (April 2010), Douglas Singleterry&lt;/ref&gt; Because of widespread acceptance after media influence, it has become a term used legally, but carries no legal repercussions as there is no legal definition.

In 1992, the German equivalent of ethnic cleansing" ({{lang-de|Ethnische Säuberung}}) was named [[Un-word of the year|German Un-Word of the Year]] by the ''[[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]]'' due to its euphemistic, inappropriate nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christoph |last=Gunkel |date=October 31, 2010 |url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l18/l0/F.html#featuredEntry |publisher=[[Spiegel Online]] |title=Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort! |language=de |trans-title=One year, one (un)word!}}&lt;/ref&gt;
