'''Ethnic cleansing''' refers to various policies or practices aimed at the displacement of an [[ethnic group]] from a particular territory. The term entered English and international usage in the early 1990s to describe certain events in the former [[ex-Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], with the induced cleansing of [[Bosniaks]] ("Bosnian Muslims"). The term became known to the world as Serbian war overheads most of the time either openly discussed or indicated their plans in cleansing (čišćenje) of territories. Narrower definitions equate ethnic cleansing with forcible population transfer accompanied by gross human-rights violations and other factors. In broader definitions it is effectively a synonym of [[population transfer]]. 

Synonyms include ''sectarian revenge'' and ''ethnic purification'' and (in the French versions of some UN documents) ''nettoyage ethnique''  and ''épuration ethnique''.&lt;ref&gt;Drazen Petrovic, [http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art3.html "Ethnic Cleansing - An Attempt at Methodology"], ''European Journal of International Law'', Vol. No. 3. Retrieved 20 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The term ethnic cleansing has been variously defined. In the words of Andrew Bell-Fialkoff:

:[E]thnic cleansing [...] defies easy definition. At one end it is virtually indistinguishable from forced emigration and population exchange while at the other it merges with deportation and genocide. At the most general level, however, ethnic cleansing can be understood as the expulsion of an "undesirable" population from a given territory due to religious or ethnic discrimination, political, strategic or ideological considerations, or a combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew  Bell-Fialkoff, "[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5199/andrew-bell-fialkoff/a-brief-history-of-ethnic-cleansing.html A Brief History of Ethnic Cleansing]", Foreign Affairs 72 (3): 110, Summer 1993. Retrieved 20 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drazen Petrovic has distinguished between broad and narrow definitions. Broader definitions focus on the fact of expulsion based on ethnic criteria, while narrower definitions include additional criteria:  for example, that expulsions are systematic, illegal, involve gross human-rights abuses, or are connected with an ongoing internal or international war. According to Petrovic:

:[E]thnic cleansing is a well-defined policy of a particular group of persons to systematically eliminate another group from a given territory on the basis of religious, ethnic or national origin. Such a policy involves violence and is very often connected with military operations. It is to be achieved by all possible means, from discrimination to extermination, and entails violations of human rights and international humanitarian law."&lt;ref&gt;Petrovic,  [http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art3.html "Ethnic Cleansing - An Attempt at Methodology"], ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The term "ethnic cleansing" entered the English lexicon as a [[loan translation]] of the [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]/[[Serbian language|Serbian]]/[[Croatian language|Croatian]] phrase ''etničko čišćenje'' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/etnitʃko tʃiʃtʃʲeɲe/}}). {{Dubious}} 
During the [[1990s]] it was used extensively by the media in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in relation to the [[Yugoslav wars]], and appears to have been popularised by the international media some time around [[1992]]. The term may have originated some time before the [[1990s]] in the military doctrine of the former [[Yugoslav People's Army]], which spoke of "cleansing the field" (''čišćenje terena'', [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/tʃiʃtʃʲeɲe terena/}}) of enemies to take total control of a conquered area. The origins of this doctrine are unclear, but may have been a legacy of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partizan]] era.

This originally applied purely to military enemies, but came to be applied to ethnic groups as well. It was used in this context in Yugoslavia as early as [[1981]], in relation to the policies of the [[Kosovo]] Albanian administration creating an "ethnically clean" territory (i.e. "cleanly" Albanian) in the province&lt;ref&gt;Marvine Howe in the New York Times (July 12, 1981), quoting an Albanian official in Kosovo&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this usage had antecedents.

One usage of the term ''cleansing'' can be found on [[May 16]], [[1941]], during the [[World War II|Second World War]], by one [[Viktor Gutic|Viktor Gutić]], a commander in the [[Croatia]]n fascist faction, the [[Ustase|Ustaše]]: ''Every Croat who today solicits for our enemies not only is not a good Croat, but also an opponent and disrupter of the prearranged, well-calculated plan for cleansing ''[čišćenje]'' our [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] of unwanted elements [...].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pavelicpapers.com/documents/ndhnews/ndhn0004.html Pavelicpapers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ustaše did carry out large-scale ethnic cleansing and [[genocide]] in Croatia during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and sometimes used the term "cleansing" to describe it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pavelicpapers.com/documents/ndh/ndh002.html Pavelicpapers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the same time, on [[30 June]], [[1941]], the lawyer [[Stevan Moljević]] from [[Banja Luka]], the main ideologue of the [[Serbia]]n nationalist organization, the [[Chetnik]]s, and [[Draža Mihailović|Mihailović]]’s most trusted confidant, published a booklet with the title ''On Our State and Its Borders''. Moljević assessed the circumstances in the following manner: ''One must take the opportunity of the war conditions and at a suitable moment take hold of the territory marked on the map, cleanse ''[očistiti]'' it before anybody notices and with strong battalions occupy the key places (...) and the territory surrounding these cities, freed of non-[[Serbs|Serb]] elements. The guilty must be promptly punished and the others deported - the [[Croats]] to [[Croatia]], the [[Muslims]] to [[Turkey]] or perhaps [[Albania]] - while the vacated territory is settled with Serb refugees now located in Serbia.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=3025&amp;reportid=169 The Moljevic Memorandum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "cleansing" ("cleansing of borders", очистка границ) was used in Soviet documents of early 1930s in reference to the resettlement of [[Poles]] from the 22-km border zone in [[Byelorussian SSR]] and [[Ukrainian SSR]]. The process was repeated on a larger and wider scale in 1939-1941, see [[Involuntary settlements in the Soviet Union]] and [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]. 

A similar term with the same intent was used by the [[Nazism|Nazi]] administration in [[Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]]. When an area under Nazi control had its entire [[Jew]]ish population removed, whether by driving the population out, by deportation to [[Concentration Camp]]s, and/or [[murder]], the area was declared ''judenrein'', (lit. "Jew Clean"): "cleansed of Jews".(cf. [[racial hygiene]]). (refer to Robert Brinkman aka b dub's novel "ethnic cleansing"

==Ethnic cleansing as a military and political tactic==
The purpose of ethnic cleansing is to remove the conditions for potential and actual opposition, whether political, terrorist, guerrilla or military, by physically removing any potentially or actually hostile ethnic communities. Although it has sometimes been motivated by a doctrine that claim an ethnic group is literally "unclean" (as in the case of the Jews of medieval Europe), more usually it has been a rational (if brutal) way of ensuring that total control can be asserted over an area. The campaign in Bosnia in early 1992 was a case in point. The tactic was used by Croatian, Muslim Bosnian and Serbian forces. Ethnic cleansing is often also accompanied by efforts to eradicate all physical traces of the expelled ethnic group, such as by the destruction of cultural artifacts, religious sites and physical records.{{fact}}

As a tactic, ethnic cleansing has a number of significant advantages and disadvantages. It enables a force to eliminate civilian support for resistance by eliminating the civilians &amp;mdash; in a reversal of [[Mao Zedong]]'s dictum that guerrillas among a civilian population are fish in water, it drains the water. When enforced as part of a political settlement, as happened with the forced resettlement of ethnic Germans to Germany after [[1945]], it can contribute to long-term stability{{fact}}. Some individuals of the large German population in [[Czechoslovakia]] and prewar [[Poland]] had been sources of friction before the Second World War, but this was forcibly resolved{{fact}}. It thus establishes "facts on the ground" - radical demographic changes which can be very hard to reverse{{fact}}. But this does not concern the treatment of the inhabitants of [[Historical Eastern Germany]].{{fact}}

On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is such a brutal tactic and so often accompanied by large-scale bloodshed that it is widely reviled. It is generally regarded as lying somewhere between [[population transfer]]s and [[genocide]] on a scale of odiousness, and is treated by international law as a [[war crime]].

==Ethnic cleansing as a crime under international law==
There is no formal legal definition of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt; Ward Ferdinandusse, [http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol15/No5/9.pdf The Interaction of National and
International Approaches in the Repression of International Crimes], The European Journal of International Law Vol. 15 no.5 (2004), p. 1042, note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ethnic cleansing in the broad sense - the forcible deportation of a population - is defined as a crime against humanity under the statutes of both [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/law/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm ''Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''], Article 7; [http://www.un.org/icty/legaldoc-e/index.htm ''Updated Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia''], Article 5.&lt;/ref&gt;. The gross human-rights violations integral to stricter definitions of ethnic cleansing are treated as separate crimes falling under the definitions for genocide or crimes against humanity of the statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Daphna Shraga and Ralph Zacklin [http://www.ejil.org/journal/Vol5/No3/art4-01.html "The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia"], The European Journal of International Law Vol. 15 no.3 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Commission of Experts (established pursuant to Security Council Resolution 780) held that the practices associated with ethnic cleansing "constitute crimes against humanity and can be assimilated to specific war crimes. Furthermore ... such acts could also fall within the meaning of the Genocide Convention." The UN General Assembly condemned "ethnic cleansing" and racial hatred in a [[1992]] resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r080.htm A/RES/47/80] ""Ethnic cleansing" and racial hatred" United Nations. 12/16/1992. Retrieved on [[2006]], [[July 3|09-03]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--The emergence of ethnic cleansing as a distinct category of war crime has been a somewhat complex process. Each individual element of a programme of ethnic cleansing could be considered as an individual violation of humanitarian law - a killing here, a house-burning there - thus missing the systematic way in which such violations were perpetrated with a single aim in mind. International courts therefore consider individual incidents in the light of a possible pattern of ethnic cleansing. In the Yugoslav case, for instance, the ICTY considers the widespread massacres and abuses of human rights in Bosnia and Kosovo as part of an overall "joint criminal enterprise" to carve out ethnically pure states in the region.

However, many alleged "ethnic cleansings" in the past do not fit the modern definition of "crimes against humanity."  For example, the post-WW2 [[German expulsions]] were sanctioned by the international agreement at [[Potsdam conference]], requiring that the actions proceed humanely.--&gt;

==Silent Ethnic Cleansing==
{{Disputed}}

'''Silent ethnic cleansing''' is a term coined in the mid-[[1990s]] by some observers of the [[Yugoslav wars]].  Apparently concerned with Western-media representations of atrocities committed in the conflict &amp;mdash; which generally focused on those perpetrated by the [[Serbs]] &amp;mdash; atrocities committed against Serbs were dubbed "silent", on the grounds that they were not receiving adequate coverage. {{fact}}

Since that time, the term has been used by other ethnically oriented groups for situations that they perceive to be similar &amp;mdash; examples include both sides in [[Northern Ireland]]'s continuing [[The Troubles|troubles]], and those who object to the expulsion of [[Volksdeutsche|ethnic Germans]] from former German territories during and after [[World War II]].

Some observers, however, assert that the term should only be used to denote population changes that do not occur as the result of overt violent action, or at least not from more or less organized aggression - the absence of such stressors being the very factor that makes it "silent" (although some form of coercion must logically exist).
