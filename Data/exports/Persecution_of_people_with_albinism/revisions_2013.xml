{{Discrimination sidebar}} 
'''Persecution of people with albinism''' is based on the belief that certain body parts of [[Albinism|albinistic]] people transmit magical powers. This [[superstition]], which is present in some parts of the [[African Great Lakes]] region, has been promulgated and exploited by [[witch doctor]]s and others who use such body parts as ingredients in rituals, concoctions and [[potions]] with the claim that their [[witchcraft|magic]] will bring prosperity to the user ("[[muti]]" or [[medicine murder]]).&lt;ref name="bbc727" /&gt;  

As a result, people with  albinism have been persecuted, killed and dismembered, and graves of albinos dug up and desecrated. At the same time, people with albinism have also been ostracised and even killed for exactly the opposite reason, because they are presumed to be cursed and bring bad luck.&lt;ref name="bbc403" /&gt;

==Tanzania==
It is estimated that over 150,000 albinos live in [[Tanzania]]; 8,000 of these are registered with the Tanzania Albino Society (TAS).&lt;ref name="bbc403"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/africa/7327989.stm |author=BBC |title=Tanzania in witchdoctor crackdown |date=3 April 2008 | accessdate=2010-01-03 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of albinos have fled to the [[Dar es Salaam]] area as they feel safer in an urban setting. Tanzania is thought to have the largest population of albinos in Africa.&lt;ref name="The albino tribe butchered to feed a gruesome trade in 'magical' body parts"&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Malone|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1215949/The-albino-tribe-butchered-feed-gruesome-trade-magical-body-parts.html|title=The albino tribe butchered to feed a gruesome trade in 'magical' body parts|date=2009-09-24|accessdate=2009-09-24|work=[[Daily Mail]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007 the Tanzania Albino Society accused the government of inactivity in the face of four albino killings over the previous three months.&lt;ref  name="bbc1" /&gt; While older albino women with red eyes had been at risk for being murdered sporadically in the past as [[witch]]es, this killing spree may have been the beginning of the ongoing persecution of albinos with the intent to harvest the victims' body parts.&lt;ref name="bbc403" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7148673.stm |title=Tanzania fear over albino killing |author=BBC |date=17 December 2007 | accessdate=2010-01-03 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With escalating killings, President [[Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete|Kikwete]] publicly and repeatedly  condemned [[witch doctor]]s, their helpers and middlemen, and the clients, which include members of the police force, for  these murders. Victims include [[child abduction|children snatched or abducted]] from their parents. The killers and their accomplices use hair, arms, legs, skin, eyes, genitals, and blood in rituals or for witch potions.&lt;ref name="bbc727" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kul" /&gt; [[Fishermen]] incorporate albino hair into their nets in their hope to catch more fish from [[Lake Victoria]] or to find gold in the belly of the fish that they catch.&lt;ref name=bbc727&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7527729.stm|title=Tanzania Albinos Targeted Again|publisher=[[BBC News]] (online edition)|date=27 July 2008| author=[[BBC]] | accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite journal

A number of steps  were taken by the government to protect the albino population.  The president ordered a crackdown on witchdoctors in the spring of 2008.&lt;ref name="bbc403" /&gt; In addition, an albino woman, [[Al-Shymaa Kway-Geer]], was named  to become a member of the parliament, the first albino in such a position in the [[history of Tanzania]]. Police have also been advised to generate lists of albinos and provide special protection for them.&lt;ref name="BBC721"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7518049.stm | author=Karen Allen |title=Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos. |date=21 July 2008 | accessdate=2010-01-03 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To foil [[graverobber]]s, graves of the albinistic were to be sealed with concrete.&lt;ref name="bbc727" /&gt; However, by October 2008, killings had not abated, and while some suspects had been apprehended, no convictions had taken place.&lt;ref name="kul"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=d9487de6-5eeb-4b6e-b21f-4863db51113c |title=Crackdown vowed after Tanzania albino girl killed, mutilated |author=John Kulekana|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that over 50 murders had taken place since March 2007, many of them in the mining and fishing communities near Lake Victoria, especially at [[Mwanza]], [[Shinyanga]] and [[Mara, Tanzania|Mara]].&lt;ref name="kii"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200810200901.html |author=Orton Kiishweko |title=Tanzania: JK Orders Crackdown to Stem Murder of Albinos. |date=20 October 2008| work=The Citizen|location=Dar es Salaam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, "Prime Minister Pinda had declared war on the albino hunters, and in an effort to stop the trade in albino body parts he had revoked the licenses of all the country's [[witch doctor]]s who use the body parts in their black magic fetishes."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themorningstarr.co.uk/2009/01/24/tanzania-albino-hunting-update/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First conviction ===
The first ever conviction for the killing of an albino in Tanzania occurred on 23 September 2009 at the High Court in [[Kahama]].&lt;ref name="Albinos call for public hanging of murderers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Albino killers 'should be hanged'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Three sentenced to hang for murder of an African 'ghost'"&gt;{{cite news|author=Daniel Howden|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/three-sentenced-to-hang-for-murder-of-an-african-ghost-1792295.html|title=Three sentenced to hang for murder of an African 'ghost'|date=2009-09-24|accessdate=2009-09-24|work=[[The Independent]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Men severed albino boy's legs in ritual killing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/09/23/2694777.htm?section=world|title=Men severed albino boy's legs in ritual killing|date=2009-09-23|accessdate=2009-09-24|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conviction came about following the murder and mutilation of a 14-year-old boy, Matatizo Dunia, who was attacked by three men in [[Bukombe]] district in [[Shinyanga Region]] in December 2008.&lt;ref name="Three sentenced to hang for murder of an African 'ghost'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Men severed albino boy's legs in ritual killing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Death for Tanzania albino killers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tanzanian albino killers death sentence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/2009/09/090923_tanz_albino.shtml|title=Tanzanian albino killers death sentence|date=2009-09-23|accessdate=2009-09-24|publisher=[[BBC World Service]] (includes audio)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men carried Dunia from his home late at night before chopping him into pieces.&lt;ref name="The albino tribe butchered to feed a gruesome trade in 'magical' body parts"/&gt; 

One of them was later found with Dunia's leg in his possession.&lt;ref name="The albino tribe butchered to feed a gruesome trade in 'magical' body parts"/&gt; The rest of Dunia's body parts were located concealed in shrubbery.&lt;ref name="The albino tribe butchered to feed a gruesome trade in 'magical' body parts"/&gt; The men confessed a desire to sell Dunia's parts to a witch doctor, yet despite this, their legal team had not anticipated the [[capital punishment|death sentence]] of hanging which the three men would receive.&lt;ref name="The albino tribe butchered to feed a gruesome trade in 'magical' body parts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Death for Tanzania albino killers"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8270446.stm|title=Death for Tanzania albino killers|date=2009-09-23|accessdate=2009-09-24|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Canada's [[Under The Same Sun]] albino activist organisation praised the breakthrough but its founder Peter Ash remarked: "This is one conviction. There are 52 other families still awaiting justice".&lt;ref name="Three men to hang for Tanzania albino murder"&gt;{{cite news|author=George Obulutsa|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE58M0IE20090923|title=Three men to hang for Tanzania albino murder|date=2009-09-23|accessdate=2009-09-24|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tanzania Albino Society's chairman Ernest Kimaya called for the [[public execution|hanging to be made public]] to further demonstrate to others that the issue of killing albinos was to be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="Albinos call for public hanging of murderers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecitizen.co.tz/newe.php?id=15284|title=Albinos call for public hanging of murderers|date=2009-09-24|accessdate=2009-09-24|work=[[The Citizen (South Africa)|The Citizen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albino killers 'should be hanged'"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8273139.stm|title=Albino killers 'should be hanged'|date=2009-09-24|accessdate=2009-09-24|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albino killers to be hanged"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gbcghana.com/news/28493detail.html|title=Albino killers to be hanged|date=2009-09-25|accessdate=2009-09-25|publisher=[[Ghana Broadcasting Corporation]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other African states==
By June 2008 killings had been reported in neighboring [[Kenya]] and possibly also the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref name="kul" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

In October 2008 [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] reported on the further expansion of killings of albinos to the [[Ruyigi]] region  of [[Burundi]].  Body parts of the victims are then smuggled to Tanzania where they are used for witch doctor rituals and potions.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.france24.com/20081014-burundis-albinos-flee-sorcerers-organ-traders |author=Esdras Ndikumanna |title=Burundi's albinos flee sorcerers and organ traders |publisher=Agence France-Presse |date=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albinos have become "a commercial good", commented Nicodeme Gahimbare in Ruyigi, who established a local safe haven in his fortified house.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;

By 2010 cases had also been reported from Swaziland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/africans-albinism-hunted-tanzania/story?id=11446434  |author=Chung J, Diaz J |title=Africans With Albinism Hunted: Limbs Sold on Tanzania's Black Market  |date=August 26, 2010  |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
After events involving murders of albino humans by three Tanzanian men had been publicised by the [[BBC News|BBC]] and others, the [[European Parliament]] strongly condemned the killing of albinos in Tanzania on 4 September  2008.&lt;ref name="EU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2008-0413+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN |title=European Parliament resolution on the killing of albinos in Tanzania.|author=[[European Parliament]]|date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The U.S. House of Representatives passed H. Resolution 1088, introduced by Rep Gerry Connolly (D, VA), by a vote of 418-1 on February 22, 2010. The resolution condemns the attacks and killings; categorizes them as human rights violations, and urges the governments of Tanzania and Burundi to vigorously prosecute such cases and to conduct educational campaigns to combat the superstitious beliefs that underlie the violent attacks.
