{{Party politics}}

In [[politics]], '''''Right''''', '''''right-wing''''' and '''''rightist''''' generally refer to support for a [[Social stratification|hierarchical]] society justified on the basis of an appeal to [[natural law]] or [[tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Alexander Smith, Raymond Tatalovich. ''Cultures at war: moral conflicts in western democracies''. Toronto, Canada: Broadview Press, Ltd, 2003. Pp 30. "That viewpoint is held by contemporary sociologists, for whom 'right-wing movements' are conceptualized as 'social movements whose stated goals are to maintain structures of order, status, honor, or traditional social differences or values' as compared to left-wing movements which seek 'greater equality or political participation.' In other words, the sociological perspective sees preservationist politics as a right-wing attempt to defend privilege within the ''social hierarchy''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Left and right: the significance of a political distinction'', Norberto Bobbio and Allan Cameron, pg. 37, [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Seymour Martin Lipset]], cited in Fuchs, D., and Klingemann, H. 1990.

==History of the term==
{{See also|Left–right politics}}
[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|5 May 1789: Opening of the Estates-General in Versailles]]

The political term ''right-wing'' originates from the [[French Revolution]], when [[Liberalism|liberal]] deputies from the [[Third Estate]] generally sat to the left of the president's chair, a habit which began in the [[French States-General|Estates General]] of 1789. The nobility, members of the [[Second Estate]], generally sat to the right. In the successive [[Legislative Assembly (France)|legislative assemblies]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]] who supported the [[Ancien Régime]] were commonly referred to as rightists, because they sat on the right side. A major figure on the right was [[Joseph de Maistre]], who argued for an authoritarian form of conservatism. Throughout the [[France in the 19th century|19th century]], the main line dividing [[Politics of France|Left and Right in France]] was between supporters of the [[Republic]] and supporters of the [[Monarchy]].&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|url=http://books.google.com/?id=67ttjXHhT3wC&amp;dq=the+government+and+politics+of+france&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415357326}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the right, the [[Legitimist]]s and [[Ultra-royalist]]s held [[counter-revolutionary]] views, while the [[Orleanist]]s hoped to create a [[constitutional monarchy]] under their preferred branch of the royal family, a brief reality after the 1830 [[July Revolution]].

The left, right, and center are often associated with socialism, conservatism, and liberalism.&lt;ref name="Political Man 1960 pp. 131"&gt;''Political Man'' (1960) by Seymour Martin Lipset, pp. 131–133&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians and social scientists seek to reduce political beliefs to class, with left, right, and center politicians representing the working, upper, and middle classes.&lt;ref name="Political Man 1960 pp. 131"/&gt; [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] for example takes modern political parties to be a consequence of "Democratic Class Struggle".&lt;ref&gt;''Political Man'' (1960) by Seymour Martin Lipset, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Others draw attention to the role which regional and religious divisions play in democratic politics.&lt;ref&gt; For example Kevin Phillips in "The Cousins' Wars: Religion, Politics, &amp; The Triumph of Anglo-America" (1999) pp.513-607&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Louis Hartz argues that in US politics there were two main opposing groups, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and [[Jeffersonian democracy|Democrat]], which represented industrialists and agriculturalists, but because both accepted liberal principles, both were essentially centrist.&lt;ref&gt;''The Liberal Tradition in America'' (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Kirk]] claims that the [[American War of Independence]] was a ''conservative'' reaction, which sought to uphold traditional English liberties against what they took to be an abuse of power by the [[monarch]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Conservative Mind'' (1953) by Russell Kirk&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 Seymour Martin Lipset coined the term [[radical right]] to describe those who opposed [[Statist]] social reforms and foreign interventionism.&lt;ref&gt;"The Radical Right", ''British Journal of Sociology'' I (June 1955) by S. M. Lipset&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]] suggests that it is incorrect to view the political spectrum as a line, with socialists on the left, conservatives on the right, and liberals in the middle. Instead each group pulls at the corner of a triangle. In the early [[Twentieth Century]] socialists pulled harder, and so the entire political spectrum shifted to the left. In the [[Anglosphere]] differences between conservatives and liberals are obscured by the fact that supporters of liberty defend established institutions, on the grounds that the tradition they inherited is liberal. Hayek claimed that explaining American politics in terms of European politics creates confusion, because radicals and socialists in America frequently call themselves liberals.&lt;ref&gt;"Why I Am Not a Conservative", F. A. Hayek in ''The Constitution of Liberty'' (1960)[http://www.fahayek.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Libertarians]] often reject being described as "left" or "right." [[Leonard Read]] claimed that these terms were "authoritarian".&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard E. Read]], [http://www.fee.org/Publications/the-Freeman/article.asp?aid=3184 Neither Left Nor Right], [[The Freeman]], February 1998, Vol. 48 No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Harry Browne]] "We should never define Libertarian positions in terms coined by [[Liberalism|liberals]] or [[Conservativism|conservatives]]{{ndash}} nor as some variant of their positions."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Browne, [http://www.harrybrowne.org/articles/Abortion.htm The Libertarian stand on abortion], [http://harrybrowne.org Harry Browne web site], December 21, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Block]] also rejects these labels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Block]], [http://mises.org/journals/jls/22_1/22_1_8.pdf Libertarianism is unique; it belongs neither to the right nor the left], ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Volume 22 (2010): 127–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, after World War II, [[monarchist]]s and [[theocracy|theocrat]]s (i.e. "Throne and Altar" conservatives) diminished in importance, and were replaced by [[conservative liberal]]s and [[Christian democrats]].&lt;ref name=Trans&gt;Hloušek, Vít &amp; Kopeček, Lubomír.

ISBN 0754678407&lt;/ref&gt; 
Stephen Fisher writes in ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'' that in liberal democracies the term "Right" is defined as opposition to [[socialism]] or [[social democracy]], and that right-wing parties include philosophies of [[conservatism]], [[Christian democracy]], [[liberalism]], [[libertarianism]], and [[nationalism]]. He claims that "extreme right parties (have included) elements of racism and fascism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Varieties==
The spectrum of right-wing politics ranges from [[centre-right]] to [[far right]]. By the late 19th century, the French political spectrum classified the [[center-right]] as [[Constitutional monarchy|Constitutional Monarchists]], [[Orleanists]], and [[Bonapartists]], and the [[far right]] as [[Ultra-Royalists]] and [[Legitimists]]. The [[centre-right]] [[Gaullism|Gaullists]] in post-World War II France advocated considerable social spending on education and infrastructure development, as well as extensive economic regulation but a limited amount of the wealth redistribution measures more characteristic of [[social democracy]].

A definition of the term "centre-right" is necessarily broad and approximate because political terms have varying meanings in different countries. Parties of the centre-right generally support [[liberal democracy]], [[capitalism]], the [[market economy]] (albeit with some limited government regulation), private [[property (ownership right)|property rights]], the existence of the [[welfare state]] in some limited form, and opposition to [[socialism]] and [[communism]]. Such definitions generally include political parties that base their ideology and policies upon [[conservatism]] and [[economic liberalism]].

The terms ''far right'' and ''radical right'' have been used by different people in conflicting ways.&lt;ref&gt;Betz &amp; Immerfall 1998; Betz 1994; Durham 2000; Durham 2002; Hainsworth 2000; Mudde 2000; Berlet &amp; Lyons, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''far right'' is most often used to describe extreme [[nationalism]], [[fundamentalism|religious fundamentalism]] and sociopolitically "[[reactionary]]" groups, as well as the less readily categorized ideologies of [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YYdTvMmSYpEC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Routledge companion to fascism ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13|isbn=9780415214957|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Ual1NR2WPasC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPR7,M1 |title=The Christian right: the far right ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13|isbn=9780719054860|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=sVZ8EUvJjJ4C&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPR5,M1 |title=Right-wing extremism in the twenty ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=2000-06-30 |accessdate=2010-05-13|isbn=9780714651828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JcJ5nr2MZfUC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Western democracies and the new ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13|isbn=9780415369718|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
===Social stratification and social order===
Right-wing politics involves in varying degrees the rejection of [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] objectives of [[left-wing politics]], claiming either that equality is artificial or that the imposition of social equality is detrimental to society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated68"&gt;''Left and right: the significance of a political distinction'', Norberto Bobbio and Allan Cameron, pg. 68, [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
Right-wing ideologies and movements support [[social order]]. The original French right wing was called "the party of order" and said that France needed a strong political leader to keep order.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; [[Latin Conservatism]], founded by [[Joseph de Maistre]], is uncompromising in its belief in the need for order. Maistre, like [[Thomas Hobbes]] before him, supported [[Political absolutism|absolutism]] as the only means of avoiding violent disorder. Maistre, who fled the [[French Revolution]], became convinced that ultra-liberal ideas, particularly Rousseau's theory of a "general will", had led to the horrors of the French Revolution and the bloodshed of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Maistre also objected to the quasi-secularism and self-indulgence of some late 18th and early 19th century monarchies, and believed that state and church must remain inseparable. The principles of Maistre's Latin Conservatism were fully instituted in Spain under [[Francisco Franco]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
Religious fundamentalists have often supported the use of political power to enforce their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Martin E. Marty, R. Scott Appleby, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Fundamentalisms observed. University of Chicago Press, 1994. P. 91. ISBN 0-226-50878-1, ISBN 978-0-226-50878-8.&lt;/ref&gt; While traditional right-wing politics supports legal and moral authority over those who would challenge such authority, the "Libertarian Right," in contrast with the religious Right and the nationalist Right, is anti-authoritarian.

===Tradition===
A common way to sum up the beliefs of the right is to focus on a support for [[tradition]]. Traditionalism emphasizes the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[tradition]] and [[custom (law)|custom]], [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]], and [[patriotism]], [[Localism (politics)|localism]], and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, pp. 870-875.&lt;/ref&gt; It has affinities with [[reactionary]] and [[counterrevolution]]ary thought{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, and some adherents{{Who|date=August 2011}} of this movement perhaps embrace that label{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, defying the stigma that has attached to it in Western culture since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Many traditionalist conservatives believe in [[monarchism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Traditionalism has existed in various forms in the West since its beginning, however it was in the 18th century that modern [[traditionalist conservatism]] emerged and even then it was not until the mid-twentieth century in the United States that it was an organized intellectual force. Traditionalism was found in the writings of a group of U.S. university professors (labeled the "New Conservatives" by the popular press) who rejected the notions of [[individualism]], [[liberalism]], [[modernity]], and [[social progress]], promoted cultural and educational renewal,&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt; and revived interest in what [[T. S. Eliot]] referred to as "the permanent things" (those perennial truths which endure from age to age and those basic institutions that ground society such as the church, the family, the state, and community life.)

The term "[[family values]]" has had different meanings in different cultures. In the late 20th- and early 21st Centuries, the term has been frequently used in political debate, especially by social and religious conservatives, who believe that the world has seen a decline in family values since the end of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=392846&amp;in_page_id=1879 "Traditional families hit by declining morals, say mothers"], ''Daily Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used as a buzzword by right-wing parties such as the [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican Party]] in the United States, the [[Family First Party]] in Australia, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] in the United Kingdom and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] in India. Right-wing supporters of "family values" generally oppose [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], [[homosexuality]], and [[adultery]]. [[left-wing politics|Leftists]] and [[feminist]]s often accuse the right of supporting [[patriarchy]] and traditional, hierarchical [[gender roles]].

===Nationalism===
In France, [[Nationalism]] was originally a left-wing and Republican ideology, as the French exception consisted in it being a Republican regime.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'', Oxford University Press, 2003, ISBN 978-0-19-925298-5, "An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...", "The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world."&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalism became a main trait of the right wing after [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|the period of ''boulangisme'']] and, moreover, of the far-right after the [[Dreyfus Affair]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extrême droite en France'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; These right-wing nationalists endorsed [[ethnic nationalism]] and believed in defining a "true" national identity and defending it from elements deemed not part of the identity and corrupt.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; They also promoted [[Social Darwinism]], applying the concept of "[[survival of the fittest]]" to nations and races.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian ''Political Ideology Today'' (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing nationalism was influenced by [[Romantic nationalism]] in which the state derives its political legitimacy as an organic consequence of the unity of those it governs. This includes, depending on the particular manner of practice, the language, race, culture, religion and customs of the "nation" in its primal sense of those who were "born" within its culture.

Linked with right-wing nationalism is [[cultural conservatism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Cultural conservatism supports the preservation of the heritage of a nation or culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Economics===
Historically, the Right has advocated preserving the wealth and power of aristocrats and nobles. Reactionary right-wing politics involves the creation or promotion of a [[social hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin E. Marty, R. Scott Appleby, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. ''Fundamentalisms observed'', "Reactionary right-wing themes emphasizing authority, social hierarchy, and obedience, as well as condemnations of liberalism, the democratic ethos, the "rights of man" associated with the legacy of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, and the political and cultural ethos of modern liberal democracy are especially prominent in the writings and public statements of Archbishop Lefebere", p. 91, University of Chicago Press, 1994. P. 91. ISBN 0-226-50878-1, ISBN 978-0-226-50878-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing politics views social and economic hierarchies as either natural or normal and rejects attempts to remove such hierarchies. For example, right-wing politicians in France during the [[French Revolution]] opposed the removal of the [[monarchy]] and [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] privilege.&lt;ref name="Parliaments 1988 pp. 287–302"/&gt; Traditional rightists were uncomfortable with liberal [[capitalism]]. Particularly in continental Europe, many conservatives have been uncomfortable with the impact of capitalism upon culture and traditions. The conservative opposition to the French Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the development of individualistic liberalism as a political theory and as institutionalized social practices sought to retain traditional social hierarchies, practices and institutions. There has also been a conservative [[protectionist]] opposition to certain types of international capitalism. There are still right-wing movements, notably American [[paleoconservatives]], that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society as a whole, which they see as infringing upon or decaying social traditions or hierarchies that are essential for social order. Conservative authoritarians and those on the [[far right]] have supported [[corporatism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fascism, Comparison and Definition'', Stanley Payne, University of Wisconsin Press, ISBN 0-299-08064-1, 9780299080648, pg 19: "Right radicals and conservative authoritarians almost without exception became corporatists in formal doctrines of political economy, but the fascists were less explicit and in general less schematic."&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, most right-wing ideologies and movements support capitalism. In Europe, capitalists formed alliances with the Right during their conflict with workers after 1848. In France, the right's support of capitialism can be traced to the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; The so-called [[neoliberal]] right, popularized by [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], combines support for [[free markets]], [[privatisation]] and deregulation of the economy with traditional rightist beliefs in patriotism, elitism and order.&lt;ref name=Lukes/&gt; [[Right-libertarianism|Right-wing libertarianism]] (sometimes known as [[libertarian conservatism]] or [[conservative libertarianism]]) supports a decentralized economy based on [[economic freedom]], and advocates policies such as [[property rights]], [[free markets]] and [[free trade]]. Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked.&lt;ref name="heritage.org"/&gt; Anthony Gregory has written that right-wing, or conservative libertarianism, "can refer to any number of varying and at times mutually exclusive political orientations." He listed some as: being "interested mainly in 'economic freedoms'"; following the "conservative lifestyle of right-libertarians"; seeking "others to embrace their own conservative lifestyle"; considering big business "as a great victim of the state"; favoring a "strong national defense"; having "an Old Right opposition to empire." He holds that the issue is not right or left but "whether a person sees the state as a major hazard or just another institution to be reformed and directed toward a political goal."&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Gregory, [http://www.lewrockwell.com/gregory/gregory127.html Left, Right, Moderate and Radical], [[LewRockwell.com]], December 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Right often advocates [[equality of opportunities]] as an alternative to [[equality of outcome]]. [[Russell Kirk]], a major figure of American conservatism included "civilized society requires orders and classes" as one of the "canons" of conservatism.&lt;ref name="heritage.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=John |first=David C. |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL811.cfm |title=The Origins of the Modern American Conservative Movement &amp;#124; The Heritage Foundation |publisher=Heritage.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western-style [[corporate capitalism]] but not full-fledged [[laissez-faire]] economics or individual autonomy was adopted by reformist governments in Singapore and Taiwan during a period of authoritarian rule and economic reform. These countries continue to venerate tradition in what has been described an "Asian model" of capitalism.

===Populism===
{{Main|Right-wing populism}}
[[Right-wing populism]] is a combination of [[ethno-nationalism]] with anti-[[Elitism|elitist]] [[Populism|populist]] rhetoric and a radical critique of existing political institutions. According to Margaret Canovan, a right-wing populist is "...a charismatic leader, using the tactics of politicians’ populism to go past the politicians and intellectual elite and appeal to the reactionary sentiments of the populace, often buttressing his claim to speak for the people by the use of referendums."

There are elements of populism in traditionalist conservatism. While many traditionalist conservatives live in urban centers, the countryside and the values of rural life are prized highly (sometimes even being romanticized, as in pastoral poetry). The principles of agrarianism (i.e., preserving the small family farm, open land, the conservation of natural resource, and stewardship of the land) are central to a traditionalist's understanding of rural life.

One example of right-wing populists were the [[Southern Agrarians]] of the United States. They bemoaned the increasing loss of Southern identity and culture to industrialization.  They believed that the traditional agrarian roots of the United States, which dated back to the nation's founding in the 18th century, were important to its nature.  Their manifesto was a critique of the rapid industrialization and urbanization during the first few decades of the 20th century in the southern United States.  It posited an alternative based on a return to the more traditionally rural and local culture, and agrarian [[American values]].  The group opposed the changes in the US that were leading it to become more urban, national/international, and industrial.  Because the book was published at the opening (1930) of what would eventually become the [[Great Depression]], some viewed it as particularly prescient. The book's stance was [[anti-communist]].

===Religion===
Government support for the majority religion has from the beginning of the movement been a major part of right-wing politics. The original French right wing supported the power of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and opposed the secularization proposed by the [[anti-clerical]] forces of the Left.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; Religious figures with right-wing views, as in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after the French Revolution, typically called for the creation or restoration of the authority of religious institutions and the social hierarchy that was associated with religion.&lt;ref name="Martin E. Marty 1994. P. 91"&gt;Martin E. Marty, R. Scott Appleby, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. ''Fundamentalisms observed''. University of Chicago Press, 1994. P. 91. ISBNISBN 0-226-50878-1, ISBN9780226508788.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph de Maistre]] argued for the indirect authority of the [[Pope]] over temporal matters. According to Maistre, only governments founded upon a Christian constitution, implicit in the customs and institutions of all European societies but especially in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Europe]]an monarchies, could avoid the disorder and bloodshed that followed the implementation of [[Rationalism|rationalist]] political programs, as in the
French Revolution.

The [[Christian right]] is a major political force in the West, supported by the Republican Party in the United States and by Christian Democratic parties in Europe. They generally support laws upholding religious values, and laws against illegal immigration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-06-08-voa4.cfm, "Conservative parties across Europe are cheering their victory, following four days of voting for the E.U.

===Anti-communism===
{{Main|Anti-communism}}

Early communist movements were at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the [[Europe]]an continent at the time. Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views, and the [[Communist Manifesto]] began "A spectre is haunting Europe," suggesting that monarchs feared for their thrones. Advocacy of communism was illegal in the [[Russian Empire]], the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to [[World War I]]. Many Monarchists (except [[Constitutional Monarchy|Constitutional Monarchists]]) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order.
By [[World War I]] however, in most European monarchies, the Divine Right of Kings had become discredited and replaced by [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements. Most European monarchs became figureheads; elected governments held the real power. The most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist Soviet Union. The Russian Revolution inspired a series of other communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917–1922. Many of these, such as the [[German Revolution]], were defeated by nationalist and monarchist military units.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the fading of traditional right-wing politics. The mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising [[Fascism|fascist]] movements on the one hand, and by [[United States|American]]-inspired [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] on the other. When communist groups and political parties began appearing around the world, as in the [[Republic of China]] in the 1920s, their opponents were usually [[colonialism|colonial authorities]] or local nationalist movements.

After [[World War II]], communism became a global phenomenon, and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies. Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religion, and nationalism. Communists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying [[Wall Street]] as the oppressor of the masses. The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy, and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term "[[McCarthyism]]".Throughout the [[Cold War]], conservative governments in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]] turned to the United States for political and economic support.
