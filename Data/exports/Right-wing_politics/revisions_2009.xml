{{Party politics}}

In [[politics]], '''''right-wing''''', '''''rightist''''' and '''''the Right''''' are used to describe certain postitions and ideologies. While use of the term ''Right'' varies, it is most commonly used to refer to support for preserving [[tradition]]al or [[cultural]] values and customs or for maintaining some form of [[social hierarchy]] or private control of the [[means of production]].&lt;ref&gt;''Left and right: the significance of a political distinction'', Norberto Bobbio and Allan Cameron, pg. 37, [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Seymour Martin Lipset]], cited in Fuchs, D., and Klingemann, H. 1990.

ISBN 0472112937, 9780472112937&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Right'' was coined during the [[French Revolution]], referring to seating arrangements in parliament; those who sat on the right supported preserving the institutions of the [[Ancien Régime]]  (the [[monarchy]], the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and the [[established religion|established church]]).&lt;ref name="Parliaments 1988 pp. 287–302"&gt;The Architecture of Parliaments: Legislative Houses and Political Culture Charles T.

Today the term ''the Right'' is primarily used to refer to political groups that have a historical connection with the traditional Right, including [[Conservatism|conservatives]], [[Reactionary|reactionaries]], [[monarchism|monarchists]], [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] and [[theocracy|theocrats]]. But in modern times, the Right has also encompassed views supporting [[capitalism]], [[free market]]s and some forms of [[nationalism]].

==History of the term==
{{See also|Left-Right politics}}
The political term ''right-wing'' originates from the [[French Revolution]] when [[Liberalism|liberal]] deputies from the [[Third Estate]] generally sat to the left of the president's chair, a habit which began in the [[French States-General|Estates General]] of 1789. The nobility, members of the [[Second Estate]], generally sat to the right. In the successive [[Legislative Assembly (France)|legislative assemblies]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]] who supported the [[Ancien Régime]] were commonly referred to as rightists because they sat on the right side. One major figure on the right was [[Joseph de Maistre]] who argued for an authoritarian and less liberal form of conservatism. Throughout the [[France in the 19th century|19th century]], the main line dividing [[Politics of France|Left and Right in France]] was between supporters of the [[Republic]] and those of the [[Monarchy]].&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=67ttjXHhT3wC&amp;dq=the+government+and+politics+of+france&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tUFySqX7CYWIMqOg3LEM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Government and Politics of France]|year=2006|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the right, the [[Legitimist]]s and [[Ultra-royalist]]s held [[counter-revolutionary]] views and rejected any compromise with modern ideologies while the [[Orleanist]]s hoped to create a [[constitutional monarchy]], under their preferred branch of the royal family, a brief reality after the 1830 [[July Revolution]]. The [[Bonapartist]]s advocated the idea of a [[authoritarian|strong]] and [[centralized government|centralized state]], based on [[populism|popular]] support.  Since then the term right-wing has come to be associated with preserving the [[status quo]] in the form of institutions and traditions.
 
In Europe, with a strong traditional class-structure, historians and social scientists identified the political spectrum on the basis of class, with left, right and center representing the working, upper and middle classes.  While these cleavages developed at the time of the French revolution, they deepened in the 19th century and both right and left accepted the class nature of their positions.  While universal suffrage, the acceptance of democracy and regional and religious division blurred the distinction between the groups, the analysis continued to be applied.  The most usual ideologies of left, right and center were socialism, conservatism and liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Political Man'' (1960) by Seymour Martin Lipset, pp. 131–133&lt;/ref&gt;  Seymour Martin Lipset saw modern political parties as continuing the "Democratic Class Struggle" that led to their creation.&lt;ref&gt;''Political Man'' (1960) by Seymour Martin Lipset, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, with its economic system less codified as rigid a structure of hereditary social classes, the political spectrum has been analyzed with a more idealogical emphasis. For example, Louis Hartz identified the mainstream political ideology of America as Lockean liberalism, not lying in a feudal past, and saw the two main opposing forces in American history as [[Whig]] and [[Jeffersonian democracy|Democrat]], representing the industrialists and the agriculturalists, but both accepting liberal principals and therefore essentially centrist.&lt;ref&gt;''The Liberal Tradition in America'' (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Kirk]] however argued that the American Revolution had been a ''conservative'' reaction and therefore the term conservative could apply to American politics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Conservative Mind'' (1953) by Russell Kirk&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Kirk's theory gained very little academic acceptance, it popularized the term ''conservative'' in the United States and it was adopted by the [[New Right]] and later by the majority of the Republican Party and blue dog Democrats.  Lipset coined the term ''radical right'' in 1955 to describe radical groups opposed to social reforms and foreign interventionism&lt;ref&gt;"The Radical Right", ''British Journal of Sociology'' I (June 1955) by S. M. Lipset&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''right'' later came to be applied to American conservatism.  In other English-speaking countries however, the term has received less acceptance, and is usually considered pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnredwoodsdiary.com/2009/02/01/dont-be-right/ ''Don't be "right"'' (2009) by John Redwood]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]] wrote that it was incorrect to represent the political spectrum as a line with socialists on the left, conservatives on the right and liberals in the middle.  Instead he suggested seeing each group as pulling at the corner of a triangle.  The socialists had by mid-twentieth century pulled harder, so that the entire political spectrum had shifted to the left and socialist ideas had become respectable.  In the United States however the difference between conservatives and liberals was obscured by the fact that it was possible to defend individual liberty by defending established institutions, as the American tradition was liberal.  He thought that the attempt to transplant the European type of conservatism to America had created confusion in viewing the political spectrum as had the tendency of American radicals and socialists to call themselves liberals.&lt;ref&gt;"Why I Am Not a Conservative", F. A. Hayek in ''The Constitution of Liberty'' (1960)[http://www.fahayek.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, after World War II, traditional rightist parties and movements such as monarchists, aristocrats and authoritarian conservatives have diminshed in power on the mainstream right and were replaced with [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]]s, [[right-libertarianism|libertarians]] and [[laissez faire]] captialists.

==Varieties==
The spectrum of right-wing politics ranges from [[centre-right]] to [[far right]]. By the late 19th century, the French political spectrum classified the [[center-right]] as [[Constitutional monarchy|Constitutional Monarchists]], [[Orleanists]], and [[Bonapartists]], and the [[far right]] as [[Ultra-Royalists]] and [[Legitimists]]. The [[centre-right]] [[Gaullism|Gaullists]] in post-World War II France advocated considerable social spending on education and infrastructure development, as well as extensive economic regulation but a limited amount of the wealth redistribution measures more characteristic of [[social democracy]].

A definition of the term "centre-right" is necessarily broad and approximate because political terms have varying meanings in different countries. Parties of the centre-right generally support [[liberal democracy]], [[capitalism]], the [[market economy]] (although with some limited government regulation), private [[property (ownership right)|property rights]], the existence of the [[welfare state]] in some limited form, and opposition to [[socialism]] and [[communism]]. Such definitions generally include political parties that base their ideology and policies upon [[conservatism]] and [[economic liberalism]]. 

The terms ''far right'' and ''radical right'' have been used by different people in conflicting ways.&lt;ref&gt;Betz &amp; Immerfall 1998; Betz 1994; Durham 2000; Durham 2002; Hainsworth 2000; Mudde 2000; Berlet &amp; Lyons, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''far right'' is most often used to describe [[nationalist]], [[Extremism#Religious extremism|religious extremist]] and [[reactionary]] groups as well as [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;id=YYdTvMmSYpEC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5Kjou7UerL&amp;sig=K9uamjo6ogLg5lBlPkF7YbrjcJ4&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;id=Ual1NR2WPasC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=K5bdSeB96U&amp;sig=RC-_zQR3OGeCIj0c4vJv6EEHgAk&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPR7,M1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;id=sVZ8EUvJjJ4C&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=SMPfNA8ixk&amp;sig=c_rZ76IsxCm_Kb959LzCekTHYek&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result#PPR5,M1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;id=JcJ5nr2MZfUC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Y5MrmJz8lV&amp;sig=GdDOAIrzoMgANd0XM1dDeMfnKa0&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
===Social hierarchy===
Reactionary right-wing politics involves the creation or promotion of a [[social hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin E. Marty, R. Scott Appleby, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. ''Fundamentalisms observed'', "Reactionary right-wing themes emphasizing authority, social hierarchy, and obedience, as well as condemnations of liberalism, the democratic ethos, the "rights of man" associated with the legacy of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, and the political and cultural ethos of modern liberal democracy are especially prominent in the writings and public statements of Archbishop Lefebere", p. 91, University of Chicago Press, 1994. P. 91. ISBN 0226508781, ISBN 9780226508788.&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing politics views social and economic hierarchies as either natural or normal and rejects attempts to remove such hierarchies. For example, right-wing politicians in France during the [[French Revolution]] opposed the removal of the [[monarchy]] and [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] privilege.&lt;ref name="Parliaments 1988 pp. 287–302"/&gt; Religious figures with right-wing views, as in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after the French Revolution, typically called for the creation or restoration of the authority of religious institutions and the social hierarchy that was associated with religion.&lt;ref name="Martin E. Marty 1994. P. 91"&gt;Martin E. Marty, R. Scott Appleby, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. ''Fundamentalisms observed''. University of Chicago Press, 1994. P. 91. ISBNISBN 0226508781, ISBN9780226508788.&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing [[Racialism|racialists]] believe that there is a racial hierarchy wherein superior races have a natural authority or supremacy over inferior races.&lt;ref&gt;Shanto Iyengar, William James McGuire. ''Explorations in political psychology''. Duke University Press, 1993. P. 208. ISBN 0822313243, ISBN9780822313243.&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing economics involves the acceptance of a social hierarchy based on economic wealth and [[social class]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellen A. Brantlinger. Dividing classes: how the middle class negotiates and rationalizes school advantage. Routledge, 2003. P. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2009}}  
    
The Right often advocates [[equality of opportunities]] as an alternative to [[equality of outcome]].&lt;ref&gt;Bobbio, Norberto, "Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction" (translated by Allan Cameron), 1997, University of Chicago Press. ISBN 0226062465&lt;/ref&gt; The Right generally regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as [[utopia]]n or [[authoritarian]].&lt;ref name="Bobbio"&gt;[[Norberto Bobbio|Bobbio]], Norberto, "Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction" (translated by Allan Cameron), 1997, University of Chicago Press. ISBN 0226062465&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Kirk]], a major figure of American conservatism included "civilized society requires orders and classes" as one of the "canons" of conservatism.&lt;ref name="heritage.org"&gt;http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL811.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social order===
Many right-wing ideologies and movements support the social order. The original French right-wing was called "the party of order" and said that France needed a strong political leader to keep order.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt;

[[Latin Conservatism]], founded by [[Joseph de Maistre]], is uncompromising in its belief in the need for order.  Maistre, like [[Thomas Hobbes]] before him, supported [[Political absolutism|absolutism]] as the only means of avoiding violent disorder.  Maistre, who fled the [[French Revolution]], became convinced that ultra-liberal ideas, particularly Rousseau's theory of a "general will", had led to the horrors of the French Revolution and the bloodshed of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  Maistre also objected to the quasi-secularism and self-indulgence of some late 18th century monarchies, and believed that state and church must remain inseparable.   The principles of Maistre's Latin Conservatism were fully instituted in Spain under [[Francisco Franco]]. 

Religious fundamentalists have often supported the use of political power to enforce their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Martin E. Marty, R. Scott Appleby, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Fundamentalisms observed. University of Chicago Press, 1994. P. 91. ISBN 0226508781, ISBN 9780226508788.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While traditional right-wing politics supports legal and moral authority over those who would challenge such authority, the Libertarian Right, in contrast with the religious Right and the nationalist Right, is anti-authoritarian.

===Nationalism===
In France, [[Nationalism]] was originally a left-wing and Republican ideology.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'', Oxford University Press, 2003, ISBN 9780199252985, "An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...", "The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world."&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalism became a main trait of the right-wing and, moreover, of the far right after the [[Dreyfus Affair]].&lt;ref&gt; [[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extrême droite en France'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The original right-wing nationalists endorsed [[ethnic nationalism]] and believed in defining a "true" national identity and defending it from elements deemed not part of the identity and corrupt.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt;

In the United States, the idea of national sovereignty was deemed to derive from that of the independent states forming it, and from their people, as described and limited by the [[Constitution of the United States]], whose [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|tenth amendment]] notably reserves power to the states where not explicitly identified, rather than delegating it to the nation. [[American nationalism|American nationalist]] identity developed gradually, being expressed weakly for instance in the motivation for the war of 1812 for which a significant element was the [[impressment]] of "American" seamen by the British Navy&lt;ref&gt;David S Heidler and Jeanne T Heidler, The War of 1812, Greenwood Press, 2002, pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;, which still claimed they were British subjects. It was expressed more strongly later, in Andrew Jackson's famous pronouncement in 1830: "Our Federal Union: it must be preserved"&lt;ref&gt;James Parton, Life of Andrew Jackson, vol. 3, p. 283 (1860)&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[American Civil War]] established nationalism as a foundation of American government, with the basic issue being preservation of the national Union&lt;ref&gt;"My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume V, "Letter to Horace Greeley" (August 22, 1862), p. 388. &lt;/ref&gt;

Linked with right-wing nationalism is [[cultural conservatism]]. Cultural conservatism supports the preservation of the heritage of a nation or culture, usually in the face of external forces for change. The culture in question may be as large as [[Western culture]] or [[China|Chinese]] [[civilization]] or as small as that of [[Tibet]]. Cultural conservatives try to adapt norms handed down from the past. The norms may be romantic, like the [[anti-metric movement]] that demands the retention of traditional weights and measures in Britain and the United States and opposes their replacement with the [[Metrication#United Kingdom|metric system]]. They may be institutional: in the West this has included [[chivalry]] and [[feudalism]], as well as [[capitalism]], [[laïcité]] and the [[rule of law]]. Cultural conservatives often argue that old institutions have adapted to a particular place or culture and therefore ought to be preserved. Others argue that a people have a right to their cultural norms, their own language and traditions.

===Economics===
Historically, the Right has advocated preserving the wealth and power of aristocrats and nobles.  In modern times, most  right-wing ideologies and movements support [[capitalism]]. [[Right-libertarianism|Right-wing libertarianism]] (sometimes known as [[libertarian conservatism]] or [[conservative libertarianism]]) supports a decentralized economy based on [[economic freedom]], and advocates policies such as [[property rights]], [[free markets]] and [[free trade]]. Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked.&lt;ref name="heritage.org"/&gt; Rafael Di Tella (Harvard Business School) and Robert MacCulloch (Imperial College London) claim that [[economic freedom]] correlates with right-leaning governments.&lt;ref name="flow"&gt;[http://www.people.hbs.edu/rditella/papers/WPLegit06.pdf "Why doesn't Capitalism flow to Poor Countries?"] Rafael Di Tella (Harvard Business School) and Robert MacCulloch (Imperial College London)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Reagan]] said in an interview: "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html Inside Ronald Reagan], a [[Reason (magazine)|Reason magazine]] Interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christopher Pierson, "...we can find on both right and left the view that the essence of civil society is its guarantee of a market capitalist economy primised upon private property. The difference is that the right like it and the left do not."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Pierson. ''The modern state''. Routledge. 2004. ISBN 9780415329323 p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; The right's association with capitialism can be traced to the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt;

Western-style [[corporate capitalism]] but not full-fledged [[laissez-faire]] economics or individual autonomy was adopted by reformist governments in Singapore and Taiwan during a period of authoritarian rule and economic reform. These countries continue to venerate tradition in what has been described an "Asian model" of capitalism. Some right-wing movements and parties have supported [[protectionism]], such as France’s [[National Front (France)|National Front]]. Conservative authoritarians and those on the [[far right]] have supported [[corporatism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fascism, Comparison and Definition'', Stanley Payne, University of Wisconsin Press, ISBN 0299080641, 9780299080648, pg 19: "Right radicals and conservative authoritarians almost without exception became corporatists in formal doctrines of political economy, but the fascists were less explicit and in general less schematic."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Government support for the majority religion has from the beginning of the movement been a major part of right-wing politics.  The original French right-wing supported the power of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and opposed the secularization proposed by the [[anti-clerical]] forces of the Left.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; Religious figures with right-wing views, as in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after the French Revolution, typically called for the creation or restoration of the authority of religious institutions and the social hierarchy that was associated with religion.&lt;ref name="Martin E. Marty 1994. P. 91"/&gt;

[[Joseph de Maistre]] argued for the indirect authority of the [[Pope]] over temporal matters. According to Maistre, only governments founded upon a Christian constitution, implicit in the customs and institutions of all European societies but especially in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Europe]]an monarchies, could avoid the disorder and bloodshed that followed the implementation of [[Rationalism|rationalist]] political programs, as in the 
French Revolution. 

The [[Christian right]] is a major political force in the West, supported by the Republican Party in the United States and by Christian Democratic parties in Europe.  They generally support laws upholding religious values, and laws against immigration, especially immigration by non-Christians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-06-08-voa4.cfm, "Conservative parties across Europe are cheering their victory, following four days of voting for the E.U. Parliament that resulted in heavy losses for the left."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hindu nationalism]] has been a part of right-wing politics in India. A form of conservative populism, the movement has attracted not only privileged groups fearing encroachment on their dominant positions, but also "plebeian" and impoverished groups seeking recognition around a majoritarian rhetoric of cultural pride, order, and national strength.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Blom Hansen, ''The Saffron Wave: Democracy and Hindu Nationalism in Modern India'', Princeton University Press, 2001, ISBN 140080342X, 9781400803422&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Likud]] party in Israel expresses support for the [[Torah]] within the context of civil Judaism. Many [[Islamist]] groups have been associated with the right, such as the [[Great Union Party]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/68827/rescue-teams-could-not-reach-turkish-party-leader-muhsin-yazicioglu-after-helicopter-crash.html&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Felicity Party]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=6073&lt;/ref&gt; of Turkey and the [[Combatant Clergy Association]]/Association of Militant Clergy ('Jame'e-ye Rowhaniyat-e Mobarez)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/~fgause/168read.htm Elections Summaries for POLS 168 -- Middle East Politics (Fall 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/623899.stm Poll test for Iran reformists]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Islamic Society of Engineers]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merip.org/mero/mero020101.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anoushiravan Ehteshami and Mahjoob Zweiri, ''Iran and the rise of its neoconservatives: the politics of Tehran's silent revolution'', I.B.Tauris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; of Iran.

Today many social and religious conservatives find themselves in opposition to scientific organizations over such topics as [[evolution]] and [[Global warming controversy|the global warming debate]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irr.org.uk/cgi-bin/news/open.pl?id=4447, "Christian school teaches right-wing creationist theories, by Liz Fekete, 1 August 2002, 'The government policy of funding for faith schools has been criticised after it was revealed that the Emmanuel City Technology College in Gateshead is teaching creationism - that human origins are (relatively) recent and divine - as opposed to scientific evolution, to explain our origins.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nationalacademies.org/evolution/Intro.html, "Biological evolution is one of the most important ideas of modern science.

===Anti-communism===
{{Main|Anti-communism}}

Early communist movements were at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the [[Europe]]an continent at the time.  Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views, and the [[Communist Manifesto]] began "A spectre is haunting Europe," suggesting that monarchs feared for their thrones.  Advocacy of communism was illegal in the [[Russian Empire]], the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to [[World War I]].  Many Monarchists (except [[Constitutional Monarchy|Constitutional Monarchists]]) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order.

By [[World War I]] however, in most European monarchies, the Divine Right of Kings had become discredited and replaced by [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements.  Most European monarchs became figureheads; elected governments held the real power. The most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist Soviet Union. The Russian Revolution inspired a series of other communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917–1922. Many of these, such as the [[German Revolution]], were defeated by monarchist military units.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the fading of traditional right-wing politics. The mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising [[Fascism|fascist]] movements on the one hand, and by [[United States|American]]-inspired [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] on the other.  When communist groups and political parties began appearing around the world, as in the [[Republic of China]] in the late 1920s, their opponents were usually [[colonialism|colonial authorities]] or local nationalist movements. Two examples of reactionary anti-communist [[dictatorship]]s were the governments of [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Augusto Pinochet]].

After [[World War II]], communism became a global phenomenon, and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies.  Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religion, and nationalism.  Communists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying [[Wall Street]] as the oppressor of the masses.  

The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy, and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term "[[McCarthyism]]".

Throughout the [[Cold War]], conservative governments in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]] turned to the United States for political and economic support. Some of these were [[authoritarian]] regimes, which – according to their critics – used the fear of communism as a means of legitimizing repression, the suspension of [[civil rights]], and the abolition of [[democracy]]. Examples include [[South Korea]] under [[Syngman Rhee]] ''(see [[Jeju massacre]])'', the [[Republic of China]] under Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[South Vietnam]] under [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], [[Indonesia]] under General [[Suharto]], [[Zaire]] under [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], [[Paraguay]] under [[Alfredo Stroessner]] and [[Chile]] under [[Augusto Pinochet]].

During the 1980s, the conservative governments of [[Ronald Reagan]] in the United States, [[Margaret Thatcher]] in Britain, and [[Brian Mulroney]] in Canada followed a clearly anti-Soviet foreign policy that is credited by their supporters as a major factor in the fall of the Soviet Union and the democratization of [[Eastern Europe]] and other countries.

In the aftermath of the Cold War, communism is no longer seen as a major force in world politics, and therefore most conservatives are far less concerned with anti-communism. However, conservative anti-communism resurfaces anywhere that communist political groups make significant advances, such as in [[Nepal]] in recent years.
