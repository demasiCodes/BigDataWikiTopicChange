As noted by Jost (2009), within the context of Western political development, opposition to change is often synonymous with support for inequality. Notwithstanding its prominence in the literature, we are hesitant to adopt this definition of the right since it requires the researcher to interpret ideological claims according to an abstract understanding of equality. For instance, Noel &amp; Therien (2008) argue that right-wing opposition to affirmative action speaks in the name of equality and rejects positive discrimination based on demographic factors. From this perspective, the right is not inegalitarian but is “differently egalitarian” (Noel &amp; Therien 2008, p. 18).|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dziblatt/files/gidron_and_ziblatt_2019.pdf|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-090717-092750|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the competition in [[market economies]].&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, Roger "A Dictionary of Political Thought" "Defined by contrast to (or perhaps more accurately conflict with) the left the term ''right'' does not even have the respectability of a history.

The political terms [[Left–right political spectrum|''Left'' and ''Right'']] were used during the 18th century [[French Revolution]] to reference the seating arrangement of the [[French parliament|Parliament]]: those who sat to the right of the chair of the presiding officer ''(le président)'' were broadly supportive of the institutions of the [[Monarchism|monarchist]] [[Ancien Régime|Old Regime]].&lt;ref name="Parliaments 1988 pp. 287–302"&gt;Goodsell, Charles T., "The Architecture of Parliaments: Legislative Houses and Political Culture", British Journal of Political Science, Vol. 18, No. 3 (July 1988), pp. 287–302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linski, Gerhard, ''Current Issues and Research In Macrosociology'' (Brill Archive, 1984) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Barry ''Political Economy: A Comparative Approach'' (Praeger Paperback, 1998), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; The original Right in France was formed as a reaction against the "Left" and comprised those supporting hierarchy, tradition, and [[clericalism]].&lt;ref name="Carlisle"/&gt;{{rp|693}} The expression {{lang|fr|la droite}} ("the right") increased in use after the [[Bourbon Restoration#Second Restoration|restoration of the monarchy in 1815]], when it was applied to the [[Ultra-royalist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, Marcel, "Right and Left" in Nora, Pierre, ed., ''Realms of Memory: Conflicts and Divisions'' (1996) pp. 247–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1830s to the 1880s, the  [[Western world]]'s [[social class]] structure and economy shifted from [[nobility]] and [[aristocracy]] towards [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Kahan. ''Mind Vs. Money: The War Between Intellectuals and Capitalism''. New Brunswick, New Jersey: [[Transaction Publishers]], 2010. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This general economic shift towards capitalism affected [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] movements such as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]], which responded by becoming supportive of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Adams. ''Political Ideology Today''. Manchester, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: [[Manchester University Press]], 2001. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The people of English-speaking countries did not apply the terms ''right'' and ''left'' to their own politics until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The English Ideology: Studies in the Language of Victorian Politics'', George Watson Allen Lane, London, 1973, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''right-wing'' was originally applied to [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservatives]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]], and reactionaries; an extension, ''[[extreme right-wing]],'' denotes [[fascism]], [[Nazism]], and [[racial supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', ''Right(-wing)...and for extreme right parties racism and fascism.'', p. 465, Oxford, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920780-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Europe, economic conservatives are usually considered liberal, and the Right includes [[Nationalism|nationalists]], [[idealism|idealist]], [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[opposition to immigration|opponents of immigration]], religious conservatives, and, historically, a significant number of right-wing movements with [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] sentiments, including [[Conservatism|conservatives]] and [[Fascism|fascists]], who opposed contemporary capitalism because they believed that selfishness and excessive [[Economic materialism|materialism]] were inherent in it.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard V. Kaplan, Rudy Koshar, ''The Weimar Moment: Liberalism, Political Theology, and Law'' (2012) p 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Kahan, ''Mind Vs. Money: The War Between Intellectuals and Capitalism'' (2010), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Right includes both [[fiscal conservatism|economic]] and [[social conservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome L. Himmelstein, ''To the right: The transformation of American conservatism'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to ''The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought,'' the Right has gone through five distinct historical stages:&lt;ref&gt;Ball, T. and R. Bellamy, eds., ''The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century Political Thought'', pp. 610–12.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The reactionary right sought a return to [[aristocracy]] and [[State religion|established religion]].
# The moderate right distrusted intellectuals and sought limited government.
# The radical right favored a [[Romantic nationalism|romantic]] and aggressive form of [[nationalism]],
# The extreme right proposed [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration]] policies and implicit [[racism]].
# The [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] right sought to combine a market economy and economic deregulation with the traditional right-wing beliefs in [[patriotism]], elitism and law and order.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2018}}

Rightist regimes were common in Europe in the [[Interwar period]], 1919–1938.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

===France===
{{See also|Left–right politics}}
[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|5 May 1789, opening of the Estates-General in Versailles in 1789, as the conservatives sat on the right]]

The political term ''right-wing'' was first used during the [[French Revolution]], when [[Liberalism|liberal]] deputies of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Third Estate]] generally sat to the left of the presiding officer's chair, a custom that began in the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] of 1789. The nobility, members of the [[Estates General (France)|Second Estate]], generally sat to the right. In the successive [[Legislative Assembly (France)|legislative assemblies]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]] who supported the [[Ancien Régime|Old Regime]] were commonly referred to as rightists because they sat on the right side. A major figure on the right was [[Joseph de Maistre]], who argued for an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] form of [[conservatism]].

Throughout the [[France in the 19th century|19th century]], the main line dividing [[Politics of France|Left and Right in France]] was between supporters of the republic (often secularists) and supporters of the monarchy (often Catholics).&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67ttjXHhT3wC&amp;q=the+government+and+politics+of+france|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-35732-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the right, the [[Legitimists]] and [[Ultra-royalist]]s held [[counter-revolutionary]] views, while the [[Orléanist]]s hoped to create a [[constitutional monarchy]] under their preferred branch of the royal family, a brief reality after the 1830 [[July Revolution]].

The centre-right Gaullists in post-World War II France advocated considerable social spending on education and infrastructure development as well as extensive economic regulation, but limited the wealth redistribution measures characteristic of [[social democracy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Hungary===
[[Hungary between the two world wars|In Hungary]] after  the collapse of a short-lived Communist regime, according to historian [[István Deák]]:
:Between 1919 and 1944 Hungary was a rightist country. Forged out of a counter-revolutionary heritage, its governments advocated a “nationalist Christian”  policy; they extolled heroism, faith, and unity; they despised the French Revolution, and they spurned the liberal and socialist ideologies of the 19th century. The governments saw  Hungary as a bulwark against bolshevism and bolshevism’s instruments: socialism, cosmopolitanism, and Freemasonry. They perpetrated the rule of a small clique of aristocrats, civil servants, and army officers, and surrounded with adulation the head of the state, the counterrevolutionary [[Miklós Horthy|Admiral Horthy]].&lt;ref&gt; István Deák, “Hungary”  in Hans Roger and Egon Weber,eds., ''The European right: A historical profile'' (1963) p 364-407 quoting p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In British politics, the terms ''right'' and ''left'' came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain Between the Wars: 1918–1940'' (1955), p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] defines right-wing extremism in the United States as "broadly divided into those groups, movements, and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups), and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf|title=Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment|publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The meaning of right-wing "varies across societies, historical epochs, and political systems and ideologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Augoustinos|first1=Martha|last2=Walker|first2=Iain|last3=Donaghue|first3=Ngaire|title=Social Cognition: An Integrated Introduction|date=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=9780761942191|page=320|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYjEwFRPEQgC&amp;pg=PA230}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', in liberal democracies, the political right opposes [[socialism]], and [[social democracy]]. Right-wing parties include [[Conservatism|conservatives]], [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]], [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]], and [[Nationalism|nationalists]]; as well as [[Fascism|fascists]] on the [[far-right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLean|first1=Iain|last2=McMillan|first2=Alistair|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|page=465|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199205165|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British academic [[Roger Eatwell]] and Neal O'Sullivan divide the right into five types: reactionary, moderate, radical, extreme and new.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Chip Berlet]] wrote that each of these "styles of thought" are "responses to the left", including liberalism and socialism, which have arisen since the 1789 French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Berlet, p. 117"&gt;Berlet, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The reactionary right looks toward the past and is "aristocratic, religious and authoritarian".&lt;ref name="Berlet, p. 117"/&gt;
# The moderate right, typified by the writings of [[Edmund Burke]], is tolerant of change, provided it is gradual and accepts some aspects of liberalism, including the rule of law and capitalism, although it sees radical ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and individualism as harmful to society. The moderate right often promotes nationalism and social welfare policies.&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 1999, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Radical right'' is a term developed after World War II to describe groups and ideologies such as [[McCarthyism]], the [[John Birch Society]], [[Thatcherism]], and the [[Republikaner Party]]. Eatwell stresses that this use has "major typological problems" and that the term "has also been applied to clearly democratic developments."&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 2004, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The radical right includes [[right-wing populism]] and various other subtypes.&lt;ref name="Berlet, p. 117" /&gt;
# The [[Extreme Right|extreme right]] has four traits: "1) [[anti-democracy]]; 2) [[Right-wing nationalism|nationalism]]; 3) racism; and 4) the strong state."&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 2004, p. 8, "Today four other traits feature most prominently in definitions: 1) anti-democracy; 2) nationalism; 3) racism; 4) the strong state".&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[New Right]] consists of the [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]], who stress [[small government]], [[Free market|free markets]], and individual initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vincent|first1=Andrew|title=Modern Political Ideologies|date=1995|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-631-19507-8|edition=2nd|quote=Who to include under the rubric of the New Right remains puzzling. It is usually seen as an amalgam of traditional liberal conservatism, Austrian liberal economic theory ... extreme libertarianism (anarch-capitalism) and crude populism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors make a distinction between the centre-right and the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;Betz &amp; Immerfall 1998; Betz 1994; Durham 2000; Durham 2002; Hainsworth 2000; Mudde 2000; Berlet &amp; Lyons, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parties of the centre-right generally support liberal democracy, capitalism, the market economy (though they may accept government regulation to control monopolies), private property rights and a limited welfare state (for example, government provision of education and medical care). They support conservatism and economic liberalism and oppose socialism and communism.

* By contrast, the phrase "far-right" is used to describe those who favor an absolutist government, which uses the power of the state to support the dominant ethnic group or religion and often to criminalize other ethnic groups or religions.&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/routledgecompani00davi|url-access=registration|quote=far right.|title=The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-415-21495-7|year=2002|last1=Davies|first1=Peter|last2=Davies|first2=Peter Jonathan|last3=Lynch|first3=Derek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ual1NR2WPasC&amp;q=%22far+right%22|title=The Christian Right, the Far Right and the Boundaries of American Conservatism|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-7190-5486-0|year=2000|last1=Durham|first1=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVZ8EUvJjJ4C&amp;q=%22far+right%22|title=Right-wing Extremism in the Twenty-first Century|date=30 June 2000|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-7146-5182-8|last1=Merkl|first1=Peter H.|last2=Weinberg|first2=Leonard|last3=Leonard|first3=Weinberg|last4=Merkl|first4=Professor Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcJ5nr2MZfUC&amp;q=%22far+right%22|title=Western Democracies and the New Extreme Right Challenge|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-415-36971-8|year=2004|last1=Eatwell|first1=Roger|last2=Mudde|first2=Cas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1857918.stm|title=Pim Fortuyn: The far-right Dutch maverick|work=BBC News|date=7 March 2002|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples of leaders to whom the far-right label is often applied are: [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Spain]], [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]], [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6069233|title=A Dictator's Legacy of Economic Growth|date=14 September 2006|accessdate=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2007/05/04/politico_funding/|title=Glenn Greenwald|work=Salon.com|date=31 May 2012|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canovan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canovan|first1=Margaret|title=Populism|date=1981|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=978-0151730780|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/populism00cano}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Betz|first=Hans-Georg|title=Radical Right-Wing Populism in Western Europe|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1994|isbn=978-0-312-08390-8|url=https://archive.org/details/radicalrightwing00betz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael E.

=== Anti-communism ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2019}}
[[File:Communist-manifesto.png|thumb|upright|First edition of ''Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei,'' or ''Manifesto of the Communist Party,'' printed in England, 1848]]

The original use of "right-wing" in reference to [[communism]] had the conservatives on the right, the liberals in the centre and the communists on the left. Both the conservatives and the liberals were strongly [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]]. The history of the use of the term ''right-wing'' in reference to anti-communism is a complicated one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendershot|first1=Cyndy|title=Anti-Communism and Popular Culture in Mid-Century America|date=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0786414406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Marxist movements were at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the [[Europe]]an continent at the time. Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views and the ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'', which began "[a] spectre [that] is haunting Europe", stated that monarchs feared for their thrones. Advocacy of communism was illegal in the [[Russian Empire]], the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to [[World War I]]. Many monarchists (except [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchists]]) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order. The struggle between monarchists and communists was often described as a struggle between the Right and the Left.

By [[World War I]], in most European monarchies the [[divine right of kings]] had become discredited and was replaced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements. Most European monarchs became figureheads or they accepted a lesser degree of powers while elected governments held the day-to-day power. The most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Russian Revolution]] inspired a series of other [[Revolutions of 1917–1923|communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917–1923]]. Many of these, such as the [[German Revolution]], were defeated by nationalist and monarchist military units. During this period, nationalism began to be considered right-wing, especially when it opposed the internationalism of the communists.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the decline of traditional right-wing politics. The mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising [[Fascism|fascist]] movements on the one hand and by [[United States|American]]-inspired [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] on the other. When communist groups and political parties began appearing around the world, their opponents were usually [[Colonialism|colonial authorities]] and the term ''right-wing'' came to be applied to [[colonialism]].

After [[World War II]], communism became a global phenomenon and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies. Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religious values and nationalism. Throughout the [[Cold War]], colonial governments in [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] turned to the United States for political and economic support. Communists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying [[Wall Street]] as the oppressor of the masses. The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term ''[[McCarthyism]]''. While both liberals and conservatives were anti-communist, the followers of Senator McCarthy were called ''right-wing'' and those on the right called liberals who favored free speech, even for communists; ''leftist''.

=== Economics ===
In France after the French Revolution, the Right fought against the rising power of those who had grown rich through commerce and sought to preserve the rights of the hereditary nobility. They were uncomfortable with capitalism, the Enlightenment, individualism, and industrialism, and fought to retain traditional social hierarchies and institutions.&lt;ref name="Parliaments 1988 pp. 287–302"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Appleby"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marty|first1=Martin E.|last2=Appleby|first2=R.

Paulist Press, 2003, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bandera carlista.jpg|thumb|A [[Carlism|Carlist]] flag]]
In the nineteenth century, the Right had shifted to support the newly rich in some European countries (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing movements, such as [[Carlism]] in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany and Russia, remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism. Nevertheless, a few right-wing movements — notably the French [[Nouvelle Droite]], [[CasaPound]] and American [[paleoconservatism]] — are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society. These forces see capitalism and industrialism as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies which are essential for social order.&lt;ref name="Fascism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=Stanley G.|title=Fascism: Comparison and Definition|date=1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisc.|isbn=978-0-299-08064-8|page=19|quote=Right radicals and conservative authoritarians almost without exception became corporatists in formal doctrines of political economy, but the fascists were less explicit and in general less schematic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, "right-wing" is sometimes used to describe [[Laissez-faire|''laissez-faire'' capitalism]]. In Europe, capitalists formed alliances with the Right during their conflicts with workers after 1848. In France, the Right's support of capitalism can be traced to the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; The so-called [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] Right, popularised by [[US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[UK Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], combines support for [[free markets]], [[privatisation]] and [[deregulation]] with traditional right-wing support for social conformity.&lt;ref name="Lukes"/&gt; [[Right-libertarianism|Right-wing libertarianism]] (sometimes known as [[libertarian conservatism]] or [[conservative libertarianism]]) supports a decentralised economy based on [[economic freedom]] and holds [[property rights]], [[free markets]] and [[free trade]] to be the most important kinds of freedom. Political theorist Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked.&lt;ref name="heritage.org"/&gt;

Conservative authoritarians and those on the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] have supported [[fascism]] and [[corporatism]],&lt;ref name="Fascism"/&gt; a [[political ideology]] which advocates the organization of society by [[Corporate group (sociology)|corporate groups]], such as agricultural, labour, military, scientific, or guild associations on the basis of their common interests.{{sfn|Wiarda|1997| p=27,141}}&lt;ref name="Clarke, Paul A.

=== Nationalism ===
[[Image:Degradation alfred dreyfus.jpg|thumb|upright.|On January 5, 1895, Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]] was [[Cashiering|cashiered.]]]]
In France, [[nationalism]] was originally a left-wing and Republican ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=William|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-925298-5|edition=2nd|quote="An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...", "The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world."|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoff00doyl}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|the period of ''boulangisme'']] and the [[Dreyfus Affair]], nationalism became a trait of the right-wing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extrême droite en France'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing nationalists sought to define and defend a "true" national identity from elements which they believed were corrupting that identity.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; Some were [[Supremacism|supremacists]], who in accordance with [[scientific racism]] and [[social Darwinism]] applied the concept of "[[survival of the fittest]]" to [[nation]]s and [[Race (human categorization)|races]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian ''Political Ideology Today'' (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Right-wing nationalism]] was influenced by [[Romantic nationalism]], in which the state derives its political legitimacy from the organic unity of those it governs. This generally includes the language, race, culture, religion and customs of the nation, all of which were "born" within its culture. Linked with right-wing nationalism is [[cultural conservatism]], which supports the preservation of the heritage of a nation or culture and often sees deviations from cultural norms as an existential threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramet|first1=Sabrina|last2=Griffin|first2=Roger|title=The Radical Right in Central and Eastern Europe since 1989|date=1999|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park|isbn=978-0271018119}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Natural law and traditionalism ===
[[File:T S Elliot - Mar 1923 Shadowland.jpg|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt;T.S. Elliot, 1923&lt;/center&gt;]]
Right-wing politics typically justifies a hierarchical society on the basis of [[natural law]] or [[tradition]].&lt;ref name="T. Alexander Smith 2003. p. 30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan Cameron pg. 37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuchs, D. 1990. p. 203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated68"/&gt;

Traditionalism was advocated by a group of United States university professors (labeled the "New Conservatives" by the popular press) who rejected the concepts of [[individualism]], [[liberalism]], [[modernity]] and [[social progress]], seeking instead to promote what they identified as cultural and educational renewal&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Frohnen, Jeremy Beer and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt; and a revived interest in what [[T. S. Eliot]] referred to as "the permanent things" (concepts perceived by traditionalists as truths that endure from age to age alongside basic institutions of western society such as the church, the family, the state and business).

=== Populism ===
{{Main article|Right-wing populism}}
[[File:TeaPartyByFreedomFan.JPG|thumb|Tea Party protesters walk towards the [[United States Capitol]] during the [[Taxpayer March on Washington]], 12 September 2009.]]
[[Right-wing populism]] is a combination of civic- and ethno-nationalism with [[anti-elitism]], using populist rhetoric to provide a radical critique of existing political institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cas Mudde|Mudde, Cas]] and Kaltwasser, Cristóbal Rovira (2017) ''Populism: a Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press. pp.14-15, 72-73. {{isbn|978-0-19-023487-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Margaret Canovan, a right-wing populist is "a charismatic leader, using the tactics of politicians' populism to go past the politicians and intellectual elite and appeal to the reactionary sentiments of the populace, often buttressing his claim to speak for the people by the use of referendums".&lt;ref name="Canovan"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

In Europe, right-wing populism often takes the form of distrust of the [[European Union]] and of politicians in general combined with anti-immigrant rhetoric and a call for a return to traditional, national values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayward|first1=Jack|title=Elitism, Populism, and European Politics|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198280354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} In the United States, the [[Tea Party movement]] states that the core beliefs for membership are the primacy of individual liberties as defined in the Constitution of the United States, small federal government and respect for the rule of law. Some policy positions include an opposition to illegal immigration, a strong national military force, the right to individual gun ownership, cutting taxes, reducing government spending and balancing the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teaparty.org/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=Tea Party|date=2 September 2004|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
[[File:Prithvi Narayan Shah.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Maharajadhiraja]] [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] (1723-1775), [[King of Nepal]], propagated the ideals of Hindu text Dharmashastra as ruling ideology]]
Government support for an [[State religion|established religion]] was associated with the original French Right.&lt;ref name="Appleby"/&gt;{{Fv|date=September 2020|reason=[[Marcel Lefebvre]] was a modern archbishop, b. 1905, not relevant here}} Philosopher and diplomat [[Joseph de Maistre]] argued for the indirect authority of the [[Pope]] over temporal matters. According to Maistre, only governments which were founded upon Christian constitutions — which were implicit in the customs and institutions of all European societies, especially in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Europe]]an monarchies — could avoid the disorder and bloodshed that followed the implementation of [[Rationalism|rationalist]] political programs, as in the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Church of England]] was established by [[Henry VIII]] and some churchmen are given seats in the [[House of Lords]], but they are considered politically neutral rather than specifically right or left-wing.

American right-wing media frequently urge the government to enact laws which support their religious tenets.&lt;ref name="Appleby"/&gt;{{Fv|date=September 2020|reason=[[Marcel Lefebvre]] was a French archbishop, not relevant here}} They also oppose sex outside marriage and [[same-sex marriage]], and they sometimes reject scientific positions on [[evolution]] and other matters where science tends to disagree with the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Diana|last=DeGette|title=Sex, Science, and Stem Cells: Inside the Right Wing Assault on Reason|publisher=[[The Lyons Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59921-431-3|url=https://archive.org/details/sexsciencestemce00dege}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Mooney, ''The Republican War on Science: Revised and Updated'', ASIN: B001OQOIPM&lt;/ref&gt; 

Outside the West, some other [[Religion|religiously]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnically]] based political groups are considered right-wing.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist movement]] has attracted privileged groups which fear encroachment on their dominant positions as well as "plebeian" and impoverished groups which seek recognition around a majoritarian rhetoric of cultural pride, order, and national strength.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Blom Hansen, ''The Saffron Wave: Democracy and Hindu Nationalism in Modern India'', Princeton University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|1-4008-0342-X}}, 9781400803422.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social stratification ===
[[File:Kirk 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Russell Kirk, 1963]]
Right-wing politics involves in varying degrees the rejection of some [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] objectives of [[left-wing politics]], claiming either that [[Social inequality|social]] or [[economic inequality]] is natural and inevitable or that it is beneficial to society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated68"&gt;''Left and right: the significance of a political distinction'', Norberto Bobbio and Allan Cameron, pg. 68, [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing ideologies and movements support [[social order]]. The original French right-wing was called "the party of order" and held that France needed a strong political leader to keep order.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; British conservative scholar R. J.
