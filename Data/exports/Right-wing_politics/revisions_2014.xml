The term "right wing" has been used to refer to a number of different political positions through history.  The political terms ''Right'' and ''[[Left-wing politics|Left]]'' were coined during the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99), and referred to where politicians sat in the French parliament; those who sat to the right of the chair of the parliamentary president were broadly supportive of the institutions of the monarchist ''[[Ancien Régime]]''.&lt;ref name="Parliaments 1988 pp. 287–302"&gt;Goodsell, Charles T., "The Architecture of Parliaments: Legislative Houses and Political Culture", British Journal of Political Science, Vol. 18, No. 3 (July , 1988) pp. 287–302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linski, Gerhard, ''Current Issues and Research In Macrosociology'' (Brill Archive, 1984) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Barry ''Political Economy: A Comparative Approach'' (Praeger Paperback, 1998) pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt;  The original Right in France was formed as a [[Reactionary|reaction]] against the Left, and comprised those politicians supporting hierarchy, tradition, and [[clericalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodney P.

==History==
{{See also|Left–right politics}}
[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|5 May 1789: Opening of the Estates-General in Versailles]]

The political term ''right-wing'' originates from the [[French Revolution]], when [[Liberalism|liberal]] deputies from the [[Estates-General of 1789|Third Estate]] generally sat to the left of the president's chair, a habit which began in the [[French States-General|Estates General]] of 1789. The nobility, members of the [[Estates General (France)|Second Estate]], generally sat to the right. In the successive [[Legislative Assembly (France)|legislative assemblies]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]] who supported the [[Ancien Régime]] were commonly referred to as rightists, because they sat on the right side. A major figure on the right was [[Joseph de Maistre]], who argued for an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] form of [[conservatism]]. Throughout the [[France in the 19th century|19th century]], the main line dividing [[Politics of France|Left and Right in France]] was between supporters of the [[Republic]] and supporters of the [[Monarchy]].&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|url=http://books.google.com/?id=67ttjXHhT3wC&amp;dq=the+government+and+politics+of+france&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-35732-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the right, the [[Legitimists]] and [[Ultra-royalist]]s held [[counter-revolutionary]] views, while the [[Orléanist]]s hoped to create a [[constitutional monarchy]] under their preferred branch of the royal family, a brief reality after the 1830 [[July Revolution]].  The centre-right Gaullists in post-World War II France advocated considerable social spending on education and infrastructure development, as well as extensive economic regulation, but limited the wealth redistribution measures characteristic of [[social democracy]].

In British politics the terms 'right' and 'left' came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain Between the Wars: 1918-1940'' (1955) p 577&lt;/ref&gt;

The Right has gone through five distinct historical stages: (i) the reactionary right, which sought a return to aristocracy and established religion; (ii) the moderate right, who sought limited government and distrusted intellectuals; (iii) the [[radical right]], who favored a romantic and aggressive nationalism; (iv) the extreme right, who proposed anti-immigration policies and implicit racism; and (v) the [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] right, who sought to combine a belief in a market economy and economic deregulation with the traditional Right-wing beliefs in [[patriotism]], [[élitism]], and law and order.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, T. and R.

The meaning of right-wing "varies across societies, historical epochs, and political systems and ideologies."&lt;ref&gt;''The meaning of 'right-wing' and 'left-wing' varies across societies, historical epochs and political systems and ideologies.''

Right-wing parties include conservatives, Christian democrats, classical liberals, nationalists and, on the far Right, racists and fascists.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, Iain and Alistair McMillan, eds.,''Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'' (Oxford University Press, 2009) ISBN 9780199205165&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Eatwell and O'Sullivan{{who|date=September 2014}} divide the Right into five types:  'reactionary', 'moderate', 'radical', 'extreme', and 'new'.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  Chip Berlet argues that each of these "styles of thought" are "responses to the left", including liberalism and socialism, that have arisen since the 1789 French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Berlet, p. 117"&gt;Berlet, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The 'reactionary right' looks toward the past and is "aristocratic, religious and authoritarian".&lt;ref name="Berlet, p. 117"/&gt; The 'moderate right', typified by the writings of [[Edmund Burke]], is tolerant of change, provided it is gradual, and accepts some aspects of liberalism, including the rule of law and capitalism, although it sees radical laissez-faire and individualism as harmful to society. Often he moderate right promotes nationalism and social welfare policies.&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 1999, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; 'Radical right' is a term developed after World War II to describe groups and ideologies such as [[McCarthyism]], the [[John Birch Society]], [[Thatcherism]], and the [[Republikaner Party]]. Eatwell stresses that this use has "major typological problems" and that the term "has also been applied to clearly democratic developments." &lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 2004, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;  The radical right includes [[right-wing populism]] and various other subtypes.&lt;ref&gt;Berlet, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; Eatwell argues that the 'extreme right' has four traits: "1)anti-democracy; 2) nationalism; 3) racism; and 4) the strong state".&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 2004, p. 8, "Today four other traits feature most prominently in definitions: 1) anti-democracy; 2) nationalism; 3) racism; 4) the strong state..."&lt;/ref&gt; The 'New Right' consists of the liberal conservatives, who stress small government, free markets, and individual initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, Andrew, ''Modern Political Ideologies'', 2nd ed., (Wiley-Blackwell, 2008) p. 66,  ISBN 978-0-631-19507-8, "Who to include under the rubric of the New Right remains puzzling.  It is usually seen as an amalgam of traditional liberal conservatism, Austrian liberal economic theory ... extreme libertarianism (anarch-capitalism) and crude populism." &lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors make a distinction between the centre-right and the far right.&lt;ref&gt;Betz &amp; Immerfall 1998; Betz 1994; Durham 2000; Durham 2002; Hainsworth 2000; Mudde 2000; Berlet &amp; Lyons, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Parties of the centre-right generally support liberal democracy, capitalism, the market economy (though they may accept government regulation to control monopolies), private property rights, and a limited welfare state (for example government provision of education and medical care). They support conservatism and economic liberalism, and oppose socialism and communism. The phrase ''far right'', by contrast, is used to describe those who favor an absolutist government, which uses the power of the state to support the dominant ethnic group or religion and often to criminalize other ethnic groups or religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YYdTvMmSYpEC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Routledge companion to fascism ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13|isbn=978-0-415-21495-7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Ual1NR2WPasC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPR7,M1 |title=The Christian right: the far right ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13|isbn=978-0-7190-5486-0|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=sVZ8EUvJjJ4C&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPR5,M1 |title=Right-wing extremism in the twenty ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=2000-06-30 |accessdate=2010-05-13|isbn=978-0-7146-5182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JcJ5nr2MZfUC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Western democracies and the new ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13|isbn=978-0-415-36971-8|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1857918.stm |title=Pim Fortuyn: The far-right Dutch maverick |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-03-07 |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples of leaders to whom the ''far right'' label is often applied are [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Spain]] and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6069233|title=A Dictator's Legacy of Economic Growth|date=2006-09-14|accessdate=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2007/05/04/politico_funding/ |title=Glenn Greenwald |publisher=Salon.com |date=31 May 2012  |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canovan"&gt;Canovan, Margaret. 1981.

===Anti-communism===
{{Main|Anti-communism}}
The original use of "right-wing" in reference to communism had the conservatives on the Right, the liberals in the center, and the communists on the Left.  Both the conservatives and the liberals were strongly anti-communist.  As time went on, however, conservatives accused liberals of being "soft on communism", and using freedom of speech and freedom of religion as a cover for their hidden communist sympathies.  The history of the use of the term "right-wing" to mean anti-communist is a complicated one.

Early Marxist movements were at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the [[Europe]]an continent at the time. Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views, and the [[Communist Manifesto]], which began "A spectre is haunting Europe," stated that monarchs feared for their thrones. Advocacy of communism was illegal in the [[Russian Empire]], the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to [[World War I]]. Many Monarchists (except [[Constitutional Monarchy|Constitutional Monarchists]]) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order.  The struggle between monarchists and communists was often described as a struggle between the Right and the Left.

By [[World War I]] however, in most European monarchies, the Divine Right of Kings had become discredited and replaced by [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements. Most European monarchs became figureheads; elected governments held the real power. The most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist Soviet Union. The Russian Revolution inspired a series of other communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917–1922. Many of these, such as the [[German Revolution]], were defeated by nationalist and monarchist military units.  In this period, nationalism began to be considered right-wing, especially when it opposed the internationalism of the communists.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the fading of traditional right-wing politics. The mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising [[Fascism|fascist]] movements on the one hand, and by [[United States|American]]-inspired [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] on the other. When communist groups and political parties began appearing around the world, as in the [[Republic of China]] in the 1920s, their opponents were usually [[colonialism|colonial authorities]], and the term right-wing came to be applied to [[colonialism]].

After [[World War II]], communism became a global phenomenon, and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies. Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religion, and nationalism.  Throughout the [[Cold War]], colonial governments in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]] turned to the United States for political and economic support.  Communists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying [[Wall Street]] as the oppressor of the masses. The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy, and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term "[[McCarthyism]]".  While both liberals and conservatives were anti-communist, the followers of Senator McCarthy were called right-wing, and those on the Right called liberals who favored free speech, even for communists, leftist.

===Economics===
In France after the French Revolution, the Right fought against the rising power of those who had grown rich through commerce, and sought to preserve the rights of the hereditary nobility.  They were uncomfortable with capitalism, with the Enlightenment, with individualism, and with industrialism and fought to retain traditional social hierarchies and institutions.&lt;ref name="Parliaments 1988 pp. 287–302"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin E. Marty, R. Scott Appleby, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. ''Fundamentalisms observed'', "Reactionary right-wing themes emphasizing authority, social hierarchy, and obedience, as well as condemnations of liberalism, the democratic ethos, the "rights of man" associated with the legacy of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, and the political and cultural ethos of modern liberal democracy are especially prominent in the writings and public statements of Archbishop Lefebere", p. 91, University of Chicago Press, 1994. P. 91. ISBN 0-226-50878-1, ISBN 978-0-226-50878-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the Right had shifted to support the newly rich in some European countries, particularly England, and instead of favoring the nobility over industrialists, favored capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing currents on the continent, such as [[Carlism]] in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany, and Russia, remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism.  There are, however, still a few right-wing movements today, notably the French [[Nouvelle Droite]], [[CasaPound]], and American [[paleoconservatives]], that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society as a whole, which they see as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that they see as essential for social order.&lt;ref name="Fascism pg 19"&gt;''Fascism, Comparison and Definition'', Stanley Payne, University of Wisconsin Press, ISBN 0-299-08064-1, ISBN 978-0-299-08064-8, pg 19: "Right radicals and conservative authoritarians almost without exception became corporatists in formal doctrines of political economy, but the fascists were less explicit and in general less schematic."&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, "right-wing" is sometimes used to describe [[Laissez-faire|laissez-faire capitalism]].  In Europe, capitalists formed alliances with the Right during their conflicts with workers after 1848. In France, the Right's support of capitalism can be traced to the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; The so-called [[neoliberal]] Right, popularized by [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], combines support for [[free markets]], [[privatisation]], and [[deregulation]] with traditional right-wing support for social conformity.&lt;ref name=Lukes/&gt; [[Right-libertarianism|Right-wing libertarianism]] (sometimes known as [[libertarian conservatism]] or [[conservative libertarianism]]) supports a decentralized economy based on [[economic freedom]], and holds [[property rights]], [[free markets]] and [[free trade]] to be the most important kinds of freedom. Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked.&lt;ref name="heritage.org"/&gt; Anthony Gregory has written that right-wing libertarianism, "can refer to any number of varying and at times mutually exclusive political orientations." He holds that the issue is not right or left but "whether a person sees the state as a major hazard or just another institution to be reformed and directed toward a political goal."&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Gregory, [http://www.lewrockwell.com/gregory/gregory127.html Left, Right, Moderate and Radical], [[LewRockwell.com]], December 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, [[nationalism]] was originally a left-wing and Republican ideology.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'', Oxford University Press, 2003, ISBN 978-0-19-925298-5, "An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...", "The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world."&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|the period of ''boulangisme'']] and the [[Dreyfus Affair]] nationalism became a trait of the right-wing .&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extrême droite en France'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing nationalists sought to define and defend a "true" national identity from elements deemed to be corrupting that identity.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; Some were [[Supremacism|supremacists]] who, in accordance with [[Social Darwinism]], applied the concept of "[[survival of the fittest]]" to nations and races.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian ''Political Ideology Today'' (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing nationalism was influenced by [[romantic nationalism]], in which the state derives its political legitimacy from the organic unity of those it governs. This generally includes, the language, race, culture, religion and customs of the "nation", all of which were "born" within its culture. Linked with right-wing nationalism is [[cultural conservatism]], which supports the preservation of the heritage of a nation or culture, and often sees deviations from cultural norms as an existential threat.&lt;ref&gt;Sabrina P. Ramet, ''The Radical Right in Central and Eastern Europe since 1989'', Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999, ISBN 978-0271018119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural law and traditionalism===
Right-wing politics typically justifies a hierarchical society on the basis of [[natural law]] or [[tradition]].&lt;ref name="T. Alexander Smith 2003. p. 30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan Cameron pg. 37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuchs, D. 1990. p. 203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark, William 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated68"/&gt;

Traditionalism was advocated by a group of U.S. university professors (labeled the "New Conservatives" by the popular press) who rejected the concepts of [[individualism]], [[liberalism]], [[modernity]], and [[social progress]], and sought instead to promote what they identify as cultural and educational renewal,&lt;ref&gt;Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt; and a revived interest in what [[T. S. Eliot]] referred to as "the permanent things" (concepts perceived by traditionalists as truths that endure from age to age alongside basic institutions of western society such as the church, the family, the state, and business.)

===Populism===
{{Main|Right-wing populism}}
[[Right-wing populism]] is a combination of [[ethno-nationalism]] with [[anti-elitism]], using populist rhetoric to provide a radical critique of existing political institutions. According to Margaret Canovan, a right-wing populist is "...a charismatic leader, using the tactics of politicians’ populism to go past the politicians and intellectual elite and appeal to the reactionary sentiments of the populace, often buttressing his claim to speak for the people by the use of referendums."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Canovan, ''Populism'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1981, ISBN 978-0151730780&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, right-wing populism often takes the form of distrust of the European Union, and of politicians in general, combined with anti-immigrant rhetoric, and a call for a return to traditional, national values.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Hayward, editor, ''Elitism, Populism, and European Politics'', Oxford University Press, 1996, ISBN 978-0198280354&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Government support for an established religion was associated with the original French "right wing."&lt;ref name="Martin E. Marty 1994. P. 91"&gt;Martin E. Marty, R. Scott Appleby, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. ''Fundamentalisms observed''. University of Chicago Press, 1994. P. 91. ISBN 0-226-50878-1, ISBN 978-0-226-50878-8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph de Maistre]] argued for the indirect authority of the [[Pope]] over temporal matters. According to Maistre, only governments founded upon a Christian constitution, implicit in the customs and institutions of all European societies but especially in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Europe]]an monarchies, could avoid the disorder and bloodshed that followed the implementation of [[Rationalism|rationalist]] political programs, as in the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Church of England]] was established by [[Henry VIII]]. Some churchmen are given seats in the [[House of Lords]] but are considered politically neutral, rather than right or left wing.

The [[Christian right]] is a major force in North America. They generally support laws upholding what they consider religious values, such as opposition to abortion, contraception, sex outside of marriage, and to same-sex marriage.  Outside the West, other religious and ethnic groups are considered right-wing.  In India, [[Hindu nationalism]] is sometimes considered a part of the Right. The Hindu nationalist movement has attracted privileged groups fearing encroachment on their dominant positions, and also "plebeian" and impoverished groups seeking recognition around a majoritarian rhetoric of cultural pride, order, and national strength.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Blom Hansen, ''The Saffron Wave: Democracy and Hindu Nationalism in Modern India'', Princeton University Press, 2001, ISBN 1-4008-0342-X, 9781400803422&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Islamist]] groups have been called "right wing" including the [[Great Union Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/68827/rescue-teams-could-not-reach-turkish-party-leader-muhsin-yazicioglu-after-helicopter-crash.html|author=Demirtas, Burcu|title=Rescue Teams Could Not Reach Turkish Party Leader, Muhsin Yazicioglu after Helicopter Crash|publisher=Turkishweekly.net |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Combatant Clergy Association]]/Association of Militant Clergy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~fgause/168read.htm |title=Readings |publisher=uvm.edu |date=Fall 2007 |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/623899.stm |title=Poll test for Iran reformists |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-02-10 |accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Islamic Society of Engineers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/mero/mero020101.html |title=Middle East Report Online: Iran's Conservatives Face the Electorate, by Arang Keshavarzian |publisher=Merip.org |date=1997-05-23 |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anoushiravan Ehteshami and Mahjoob Zweiri, ''Iran and the rise of its neoconservatives: the politics of Tehran's silent revolution'', I.B.Tauris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; of Iran.

Religious fundamentalists frequently feel that governments should enact laws supporting their religious tenets.&lt;ref&gt;Martin E. Marty, R. Scott Appleby, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Fundamentalisms observed. University of Chicago Press, 1994. P. 91. ISBN 0-226-50878-1, ISBN 978-0-226-50878-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Noble, ''Tabernacle of Hate: Seduction Into Right-Wing Extremism'', Syracuse University Press, 2010, ISBN 978-0815632481&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John R. Bradley, ''After the Arab Spring'', "... the right-wing Arab-Iranian exile Amir Teheri ..." p. 143, Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, ISBN 978-0230338197&lt;/ref&gt;  The religious Right may be in conflict with scientific positions on [[evolution]] and other matters where science disagrees with dogma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110927234655/https://www.irr.org.uk/cgi-bin/news/open.pl?id=4447|title=Christian school teaches right-wing creationist theories|first=Liz|last=Fekete|date=1 August 2002|quote="The government policy of funding for faith schools has been criticised after it was revealed that the Emmanuel City Technology College in Gateshead is teaching creationism - that human origins are (relatively) recent and divine - as opposed to scientific evolution, to explain our origins."|website=Independent Race and Refugee news network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15857761/|title=Muslim creationism makes inroads in Turkey'|first=Tom|last=Heneghan|date=Nov 22, 2006|quote="Creationism is so widely accepted here that Turkey placed last in a recent survey of public acceptance of evolution in 34 countries — just behind the United States." "Darwinism did become an issue during the left-vs.-right political turmoil before a 1980 military coup because Communist bookshops touted Darwin's works as a complement to Karl Marx. 'It looked like Marx and Darwin were together, two long-bearded guys spreading ideas that make people lose their faith,' said Istanbul journalist Mustafa Akyol."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Diana|last=DeGette|title=Sex, Science, and Stem Cells: Inside the Right Wing Assault on Reason|publisher=[[The Lyons Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59921-431-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Mooney, ''The Republican War on Science: Revised and Updated'', ASIN: B001OQOIPM&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[family values]]" has been used as a buzzword by right-wing parties such as the [[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican Party]] in the United States, the [[Family First Party]] in Australia, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] in the United Kingdom and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] in India to describe support for traditional families, and opposition to the changes the modern world has made in how families live. Right-wing supporters of "family values" may oppose [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]], [[homosexuality]], and [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2004 Republican Party Platform: A Safer World and a More Hopeful America|url=http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/Sections/News/Politics/Conventions/RNC-2004platform.pdf|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=23 July 2012|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social stratification===
Right-wing politics involves in varying degrees the rejection of some [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] objectives of [[left-wing politics]], claiming either that economic inequality is natural and inevitable or that it is beneficial to society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated68"&gt;''Left and right: the significance of a political distinction'', Norberto Bobbio and Allan Cameron, pg. 68, [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
Right-wing ideologies and movements support [[social order]]. The original French right-wing was called "the party of order" and held that France needed a strong political leader to keep order.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt;

British conservative scholar R. J. White, who rejects egalitarianism, wrote: "Men are equal before God and the laws, but unequal in all else; hierarchy is the order of nature, and privilege is the reward of honourable service".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Moyra Grant. ''Key Ideas in Politics''. Cheltenham, England, UK: Nelson Thornes, Ltd., 2003. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; American conservative [[Russell Kirk]] also rejected egalitarianism as imposing sameness, stating: "Men are created different; and a government that ignores this law becomes an unjust government for it sacrifices nobility to mediocrity".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;  He took as one of the "canons" of conservatism the principle that "civilized society requires orders and classes".&lt;ref name="heritage.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=John |first=David C. |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL811.cfm |title=The Origins of the Modern American Conservative Movement|publisher=heritage.org |date=21 November 2003  |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Right libertarians reject collective or state-imposed equality as undermining reward for personal merit, initiative, and enterprise.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; In their view, it is unjust, limits personal freedom, and leads to social uniformity and mediocrity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; [[Libertarian socialism|Left-libertarians]], however, argue that "equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity... Free opportunity and acting out your individuality means development of natural dissimilarities and variations".&lt;ref&gt;Berkman, Alexander, ''The ABC of Anarchism'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, freedom without equality gives more freedom to those at a higher social status, and equality without freedom is a form of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. What is Property? p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Chomsky Reader, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;
