{{Segregation}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Racial segregation''' is the systemic separation of people into [[race (human classification)|racial]] or other [[Ethnicity|ethnic groups]] in daily life. Segregation can involve [[wikt:spatial|spatial]] separation of the races, and mandatory use of different institutions, such as schools and hospitals by people of different races. Specifically, it may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a public toilet, attending school, going to the movies, riding on a bus, or in the rental or purchase of a home or of hotel rooms.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, segregation often allowed close contact in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] situations, such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race.

Segregation is defined by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] as "the act by which a (natural or legal) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification, in conformity with the proposed definition of discrimination. As a result, the voluntary act of separating oneself from other people on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds does not constitute segregation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/activities/GPR/EN/Recommendation_N7/Recommendation_7_en.asp ECRI General Policy Recommendation N°7: National legislation to combat racism and racial discrimination] — Explanatory memorandum, Para. 16&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UN Forum on Minority Issues, "The creation and development of classes and schools providing education in minority languages should not be considered impermissible segregation, if the assignment to such classes and schools is of a voluntary nature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.11.Add.1.pdf Recommendations of the Forum on Minority Issues A/HRC/10/11/Add.1] — para. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial segregation has been generally outlawed worldwide. In the [[United States]], segregation was mandated by law in some states (such as the [[Jim Crow laws]]) and came with [[anti-miscegenation laws]] (prohibitions against [[interracial marriage]]), until the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] led by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] started a [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] Constitutional Revolution in 1950s and 1960s which outlawed racial segregation throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Virginia [[Racial Integrity Act]], Virginia Code § 20–58 and § 20–59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/brown/history/5-decision/courts-decision.html|title=The Court's Decision - Separate Is Not Equal|website=americanhistory.si.edu|access-date=2019-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73968804.pdf|title=The Warren Court: Completion of a Constitutional Revolution|last=|first=|date=|website=William &amp; Mary Law School Scholarship Repository|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/347us483|title=Brown v.

Schelling (1969) "Models of segregation", ''American Economic Review'', 1969, 59(2), [http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic185351.files/shelling1.pdf 488–493].&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation may be maintained by means ranging from discrimination in hiring and in the rental and sale of housing to certain races to [[vigilante]] violence (such as [[lynching]]s). Generally, a situation that arises when members of different races mutually prefer to associate and do business with members of their own race would usually be described as ''separation'' or ''[[de facto]] separation'' of the races rather than ''segregation''.

==Historical cases==
Wherever there have been multiracial communities, there has been racial segregation. Only areas with extensive [[miscegenation]], or mixing, such as Hawaii and Brazil, despite some social stratification, seem to be exempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/488135/racial-segregation Racial segregation]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial China===
====Tang dynasty====
Several laws enforcing racial segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed by the [[Han Chinese]] during the [[Tang dynasty]]. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced [[Uyghur people|Uighurs]] to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from pretending to be Chinese. Chinese disliked Uighurs because they practiced [[usury]]. The magistrate who issued the orders may have wanted to protect "purity" in Chinese custom. In 836, when Lu Chun was appointed as governor of Canton, he was disgusted to find Chinese living with foreigners and intermarriage between Chinese and foreigners. Lu enforced separation, banning interracial marriages, and made it illegal for foreigners to own property. Lu Chun believed his principles were just and upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jqAGIL02BWQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=chinese+uighurs+779+edict+lure+canton+836+foreigners+and+chinese+lu+governor+forbade+marriages+forced+separate#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20uighurs%20779%20edict%20lure%20canton%20836%20foreigners%20and%20chinese%20lu%20governor%20forbade%20marriages%20forced%20separate&amp;f=false |title=The golden peaches of Samarkand: a study of Tʻang exotics |author=Edward H.

====Qing dynasty====
{{main article|Eight Banners}}
The [[Qing Dynasty]] was founded not by the Han Chinese who form the majority of the Chinese population, but the Manchus, who are today an ethnic minority of China. The [[Manchu people|Manchus]] were keenly aware of their minority status, however, it was only later in the dynasty that they banned intermarriage.

Han defectors played a massive role in the Qing conquest of China. Han Chinese Generals who defected to the Manchu were often [[Heqin#Qing dynasty|given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage]] while the ordinary soldiers who defected were given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader [[Nurhaci]] married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General [[Li Yongfang]] after he surrendered [[Fushun]] in [[Liaoning]] to the Manchu in 1618.&lt;ref name="ed.

Watson, Ebrey 1991],  pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto and [[Hongtaiji]] in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="ed. Walthall 2008"/&gt;

Geng Zhongming, a Han bannerman, was awarded the title of Prince Jingnan, and his son Geng Jingmao managed to have both his sons Geng Jingzhong and Geng Zhaozhong become court attendants under Shunzhi and get married to Aisin Gioro women, with Haoge's (a son of Hong Taiji) daughter marrying Geng Jingzhong and Prince Abatai's (Hong Taiji) granddaughter marrying Geng Zhaozhong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA1017#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|first=FREDERIC WAKEMAN|last=JR|date=1 January 1985|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780520048041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing differentiated between Han Bannermen and ordinary Han civilians. Han Bannermen were made out of Han Chinese who defected to the Qing up to 1644 and joined the Eight Banners, giving them social and legal privileges in addition to being acculturated to Manchu culture. So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled up the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority within the Banners, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cpfgQNWXpyoC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=16+percent+manchu+bannermen+1648&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XV-XVKWhDcm_ggSs2oPQBw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=16%20percent%20manchu%20bannermen%201648&amp;f=false Naquin 1987], p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sZt0TgTAgPoC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=16+percent+manchu+bannermen+1648&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XV-XVKWhDcm_ggSs2oPQBw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=16%20percent%20manchu%20bannermen%201648&amp;f=false Fairbank, Goldman 2006], p. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pages.uoregon.edu/inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing3.htm|title=Summing up Naquin/Rawski|website=pages.uoregon.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this multi-ethnic force in which Manchus were only a minority, which conquered China for the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gAIcwz3V_JsC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;dq=The+conquest+of+China+was+achieved+by+these+combined+banner+forces,+in+which+less+than+16+percent+of+the+soldiers+by+1648+were+actually+of+Manchu+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7l-XVJnbGIe-ggT4oYGIDQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20conquest%20of%20China%20was%20achieved%20by%20these%20combined%20banner%20forces%2C%20in%20which%20less%20than%2016%20percent%20of%20the%20soldiers%20by%201648%20were%20actually%20of%20Manchu%20origin&amp;f=false eds.

It was Han Chinese Bannermen who were responsible for the successful Qing conquest of China, they made up the majority of governors in the early Qing and were the ones who governed and administered China after the conquest, stabilizing Qing rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vI1RRslLNSwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=fifteen+governors+chinese+manchus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nEwFVN_IHtOxggSco4LwDQ&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=fifteen%20governors%20chinese%20manchus&amp;f=false Spencer 1990], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Han Bannermen dominated the post of governor-general in the time of the Shunzhi and Kangxi Emperors, and also the post of governors, largely excluding ordinary Han civilians from the posts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rXiSxh1oGe0C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=fifteen+governors+chinese+manchus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WksFVJPAAcPGggSk4oHAAw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=fifteen%20governors%20chinese%20manchus&amp;f=false Spence 1988], pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote ethnic harmony, a 1648 decree from the Manchu [[Shunzhi Emperor]] allowed Han Chinese civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners, it was only later in the dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140111230216/http://www.chss.iup.edu/chr/CHR-2004Fall-11-WANG-research%20notes-final.pdf Wang 2004, pp. 215–216 &amp; 219–221.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXHbhsfaJAYC&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|first=Anne|last=Walthall|date=1 January 2008|publisher=University of California Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780520254442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing implemented a policy of segregation between the Bannermen of the [[Eight Banners]] (Manchu Bannermen, Mongol Bannermen, Han Bannermen) and Han Chinese civilians{{when|date=July 2015}}. This ethnic segregation had cultural and economic reasons: intermarriage was forbidden to keep up the Manchu heritage and minimize [[sinicization]]. Han Chinese civilians and Mongol civilians [[Willow Palisade|were banned]] from settling in Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing2.htm |title=From Ming to Qing |publisher=Darkwing.uoregon.edu |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Han civilians and Mongol civilians were banned from crossing into each other's lands. Ordinary Mongol civilians in Inner Mongolia were banned from even crossing into other [[Banners of Inner Mongolia|Mongol Banners]]. (A banner in Inner Mongolia was an administrative division and not related to the Mongol Bannermen in the Eight Banners)

These restrictions did not apply [[Eight Banners|Han Bannermen]], who were settled in Manchuria by the Qing. Han bannermen were differentiated from Han civilians by the Qing and treated differently.

The Qing Dynasty started [[Chuang Guandong|colonizing Manchuria with Han Chinese]] later on in the dynasty's rule, but the Manchu area was still separated from modern-day Inner Mongolia by the [[Willow Palisade|Outer Willow Palisade]], which kept the Manchu and the Mongols in the area separate.

The policy of segregation applied directly to the [[Eight Banners|banner]] garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities in which they were stationed. Manchu Bannermen, Han Bannermen, and Mongol Bannermen were separated from the Han civilian population. While the Manchus followed the governmental structure of the preceding [[Ming dynasty]], their ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han Chinese civilian officials who had passed the highest levels of the [[Imperial examinations|state examinations]], and because of the small number of Manchus, this insured that a large fraction of them would be government officials.

===Colonialism===
====Latin America====
{{Main|Casta#"Purity of blood" and the evolution of racial classification|l1 = Racial classification in colonial Latin America}}
Spanish colonists created [[casta|caste systems]] in [[Latin American]] countries based on classification by race and race mixture. An extensive nomenclature developed, including the terms "[[mulatto]]", "[[mestizo]]", and "[[zambo]]" (the latter the origin of "[[sambo (racial term)|sambo]]"). The Spanish had practiced a form of caste system in [[Hispania]] before their expulsion of the Jews and Muslims. While many Latin American countries have long since rendered the system officially illegal through legislation, usually at the time of independence, [[prejudice]] based on degrees of perceived racial distance from European ancestry combined with one's socioeconomic status remain, an echo of the colonial caste system.&lt;ref&gt;Soong, Roland. [http://www.zonalatina.com/Zldata55.htm "Racial Classifications in Latin America"], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Howard F., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1870658 "Review"], ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 76, No. 5 (Dec. 1971), 1626–1628.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rhodesia====
[[File:Rhodesialand.png|thumb|Land apportionment in Rhodesia in 1965]]
{{further|Land reform in Zimbabwe#Creation of the Tribal Trust Lands|l1 = South Rhodesia Land Apportionment Act}}
The Land Apportionment Act of 1930 passed in [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now known as Zimbabwe) was a segregationist measure that governed land allocation and acquisition in rural areas, making distinctions between blacks and whites.&lt;ref&gt; A. C. JENNINGS, LAND APPORTIONMENT IN SOUTHERN RHODESIA, African Affairs, Volume XXXIV, Issue CXXXVI, July 1935, Pages 296–312, https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a100934 &lt;/ref&gt;

One highly publicized legal battle occurred in 1960 involving the opening of a new theatre that was to be open to all races; the proposed unsegregated [[public toilet]]s at the newly built [[Reps Theatre]] in 1959 caused an argument called "The Battle of the Toilets".

====French Algeria====
{{Main|French Algeria#Discrimination}}
{{See also|Indigénat|Assimilation (French colonialism)}}
Following its conquest of [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] controlled [[Algeria]] in 1830, for well over a century France maintained [[French colonial empires|colonial rule]] in the territory which has been described as "quasi-[[apartheid]]".&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;"Algeria was in fact a colony but constitutionally was a part of France and not thought of in the 1950s (even by many on the left) as a colony. It was a society of nine million or so 'Muslim' Algerians who were dominated by the million settlers of diverse origins (but fiercely French) who maintained a quasi-apartheid regime." Bell, David Scott. ''Presidential Power in Fifth Republic France'', Berg Publishers, 2000, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial law of 1865 allowed Arab and Berber Algerians to apply for French [[citizenship]] only if they abandoned their Muslim identity; Azzedine Haddour argues that this established "the formal structures of a political apartheid".&lt;ref&gt;"[the] ''senatus-consulte'' of 1865 stipulated that all the colonised indigenous were under French jurisdiction, i.e., French nationals subjected to French laws, but it restricted citizenship only to those who renounced their Muslim religion and culture. There was an obvious split in French legal discourse: a split between nationality and citizenship which established the formal structures of a political apartheid encouraging the existence of 'French subjects' disenfranchised, without any rights to citizenship, treated as objects of French law and not citizens". Debra Kelly. ''Autobiography And Independence: Selfhood and Creativity in North African Postcolonial Writing in French'', Liverpool University Press, 2005, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Camille Bonora-Waisman writes that, "in contrast with the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates", this "colonial apartheid society" was unique to Algeria.&lt;ref name=Bonora-Waisman&gt;"In contrast with the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates, Algeria was made an integral part of France and became a colony of settlement for more than one million Europeans... under colonial rule, Algerians encountered France's 'civilising mission' only through the plundering of lands and colonial apartheid society..." Bonora-Waisman, Camille. ''France and the Algerian Conflict: Issues in Democracy and Political Stability, 1988–1995'', Ashgate Publishing, 2003, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

This "internal system of apartheid" met with considerable resistance from the Muslims affected by it, and is cited as one of the causes of the [[Algerian War|1954 insurrection]] and ensuing independence war.&lt;ref name=Wall&gt;"As a settler colony with an internal system of apartheid, administered under the fiction that it was part of metropolitan France, and endowed with a powerful colonial lobby that virtually determined the course of French politics with respect to its internal affairs, it experienced insurrection in 1954 on the part of its Muslim population." Wall, Irwin M. ''France, the United States, and the Algerian War'', University of California Press, 2001, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgian Congo====
{{Main|Belgian Congo#Social inequality and racial discrimination }}
Though there were no specific laws imposing racial segregation and barring blacks from establishments frequented by whites, ''de facto'' [[racial segregation|segregation]] operated in most areas. For example, initially, the [[inner city|city centers]] were reserved to the white population only, while the black population was organized in ''cités indigènes'' (indigenous neighbourhoods called 'le belge'). Hospitals, department stores and other facilities were often reserved for either whites or blacks.

The black population in the cities could not leave their houses from 9 pm to 4 am. This type of segregation began to disappear gradually only in the 1950s, but even then the Congolese remained or felt treated in many respects as second-rate citizens (for instance in political and legal terms).

From 1953, and even more so after the triumphant visit of [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]] to the colony in 1955, Governor-General [[Léon Pétillon]] (1952–1958) worked to create a "Belgian-Congolese community", in which blacks and whites were to be treated as equals.&lt;ref&gt;
Pétillon, L. A. M. (1967), ''Témoignage et réflexions'', Brussels: Renaissance du Livre.
&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, [[anti-miscegenation laws]] remained in place, and between 1959 and 1962 thousands of mixed-race Congolese children were forcibly deported from the Congo by the Belgian government and the Catholic Church and taken to Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Paravicini| first = Giulia| title = Belgium apologizes for colonial-era abduction of mixed-race children| publisher = [[Reuters]]| date = 4 April 2019| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belgium-congo/belgium-apologizes-for-colonial-era-abduction-of-mixed-race-children-idUSKCN1RG2NF| access-date = 10 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial antisemitism===

Jews in Europe were generally forced, by decree or informal pressure, to live in highly segregated [[ghettos]] and [[shtetls]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wirth, Louis]]. ''The Ghetto''.

From the beginning of the 15th century, Jewish populations in [[Morocco]] were confined to [[mellah]]s. In cities, a ''mellah'' was surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway. In contrast, rural ''mellahs'' were separate villages whose sole inhabitants were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/017/morocco.html |title=The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G.

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the lives of [[History of Jews in Iran|Persian Jews]]:
{{quote|…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town…; for they are considered as unclean creatures…  Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…  For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans…  If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him… unmercifully…  If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods… Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)…, he is sure to be murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 16 May 1940, ''[[Administrasjonsrådet]]'' asked [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen|Rikskommisariatet]] why radio receivers had been confiscated from Jews in Norway.&lt;ref name="Folk, fører og frifinnelse"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aftenposten.no/article/ap-aw0BO.html|title=Folk, fører og frifinnelse|first=Tor|last=Bomann-larsen|website=Aftenposten}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Administrasjonsrådet'' thereafter "quietly" accepted&lt;ref name="Folk, fører og frifinnelse"/&gt; racial segregation between Norwegian citizens, has been claimed by [[Tor Bomann-Larsen]].

German praise for America's institutional racism, previously found in Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'', was continuous throughout the early 1930s, and radical Nazi lawyers were advocates of the use of American models.&lt;ref name="Whitman"/&gt; Race based U.S. citizenship laws and [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|anti-miscegenation laws]] directly inspired the two principal [[Nuremberg Laws]]—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Q.

Under the General Government of [[occupied Poland]] in 1940, the Nazis divided the population into different groups, each with different rights, food rations, allowed housing strips in the cities, public transportation, etc. In an effort to split Polish identity they attempted to establish ethnic divisions of [[Kashubians]] and [[Gorals]] ([[Goralenvolk]]), based on these groups' alleged "Germanic component".

During the 1930s and 1940s, Jews in Nazi-controlled states were made to wear something that identified them as Jewish, such as a [[yellow badge|yellow ribbon or star of David]], and were, along with [[Romani people|Romas]] (Gypsies), discriminated against by the racial laws. Jewish doctors were not allowed to treat Aryan patients nor were Jewish professors permitted to teach Aryan pupils. In addition, Jews were not allowed to use any public transportation, besides the ferry, and were able to shop only from 3–5 pm in Jewish stores. After ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' ("The Night of Broken Glass"), the Jews were fined 1,000,000 [[German reichsmark|marks]] for damages done by the Nazi troops and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members.

Jews and Roma were subjected to [[genocide]] as "undesirable" racial groups in the [[Holocaust]]. The Nazis established [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939–1944|ghettos]] to confine Jews and sometimes Romas into tightly packed areas of the cities of Eastern Europe, turning them into ''[[de facto]]'' [[concentration camp]]s. The [[Warsaw Ghetto]] was the largest of these ghettos, with 400,000 people. The [[Łódź Ghetto]] was the second largest, holding about 160,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/timeline/ghettos.htm |title=Holocaust Timeline: The Ghettos |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date=23 November 1939 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1939 and 1945, at least 1.5 million [[Poland|Polish]] citizens were transported to the Reich for [[forced labour]] (in all, about 12 million forced laborers were employed in the German war economy inside [[Nazi Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Marek (nda) |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html |title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |title=Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War |publisher=Summeroftruth.org |accessdate=18 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014235036/http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nazi Germany also used forced laborers from Western Europe, [[Poles]], along with other Eastern Europeans viewed as racially inferior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |title=Hitler's Plans |publisher=Dac.neu.edu |accessdate=5 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401234751/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archivedate=1 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  were subject to deeper discriminatory measures. They were forced to wear a yellow with purple border and letter "[[P (Nazi symbol)|P]]" (for Polen/Polish) cloth identifying tag sewn to their clothing, subjected to a [[curfew]], and banned from [[public transportation]].

While the treatment of factory workers or farm hands often varied depending on the individual employer, Polish laborers as a rule were compelled to work longer hours for lower wages than Western Europeans – in many cities, they were forced to live in segregated barracks behind barbed wire. Social relations with [[Germans]] outside work were forbidden, and sexual relations (''[[Rassenschande]]'' or "racial defilement") were punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-trc.org/poles.htm |title=Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era |publisher=Holocaust-trc.org |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fascist Italy====
In 1938, the [[Italian Fascism|fascist regime]] led by [[Benito Mussolini]], under pressure from the Nazis, introduced a series of [[Italian Racial Laws]] instituting an official segregationist policy in the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian Empire]], especially aimed against Jews. This policy enforced various segregationist norms, like the prohibition for Jews to teach or study in ordinary schools and universities, to own industries reputed of major national interest, to work as journalists, to enter the military, and to wed non-Jews.
Some of the immediate consequences of the introduction of the 'provvedimenti per la difesa della razza' (norms for the defence of the race) included many of the best Italian scientists leaving their job, or even Italy. Amongst these, world-renowned physicists [[Emilio Segrè]], [[Enrico Fermi]] (whose wife was Jewish), [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], [[Bruno Rossi]], [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], mathematicians [[Federigo Enriques]] and [[Guido Fubini]] and even the fascist propaganda director, art critic and journalist [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was one of Mussolini's mistresses. [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], who would successively win the [[Nobel Prize for Medicine]], was forbidden to work at the university. [[Albert Einstein]], upon approval of the racial law, resigned from honorary membership of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].

After 1943, when Northern Italy was [[Kingdom of Italy#Civil war (1943–1945)|occupied by the Nazis]], Italian Jews were rounded up for the Holocaust.

After [[Jim Crow]] laws were passed that segregated [[African Americans]] and [[White Americans|Whites]], the lives of those who were negatively affected saw no progress in their quest for equality. Racial segregation was not a new phenomenon, as almost four million blacks had been [[slavery in the United States|slave]]s before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the end of slavery led to starvation and death for millions of black Americans|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/16/slavery-starvation-civil-war|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leon Litwack 2004"&gt;Leon Litwack, ''Jim Crow Blues'', Magazine of History (OAH Publications, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The laws passed segregated African Americans from Whites in order to enforce a system of white supremacy.

After the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in America, [[Racism in the United States|racial discrimination]] became regulated by the so-called [[Jim Crow laws]], which mandated strict segregation of the races. Though many such laws were instituted shortly after fighting ended, they only became formalized after the 1877 end of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction period]]. The period that followed is known as the [[nadir of American race relations]]. The legislation (or in some states, such as Florida, the state constitutions) that mandated segregation lasted at least until a 1968 ruling by the Supreme Court outlawing all forms of segregation.

While the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] majority in the 1896 ''[[Plessy v.

Institutionalized racial segregation was ended as an official practice during the [[civil rights movement]] by the efforts of such civil rights activists as [[Clarence M.

====South Africa====
{{Main article|Apartheid}}
[[File:DurbanSign1989.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"[[Apartheid]]": sign on Durban beach in English, [[Afrikaans]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]]]
The [[apartheid]] system carried out by [[Afrikaner]] minority rule enacted a nationwide social policy "separate development" with the National Party victory in 1948, following the "colour bar"-discriminatory legislation dating back to the beginning of the [[Union of South Africa]] and the Boer republics before which, while repressive to black South Africans along with other minorities, had not gone nearly so far.

Apartheid laws can be generally divided into following acts. Firstly, the Population Registration Act in 1950 classified residents in South Africa into four racial groups: "black", "white", "[[Coloured]]", and "Indian" and noted their racial identities on their identifications. Secondly, the [[Group Areas Act]] in 1950 assigned different regions according to different races. People were forced to live in their corresponding regions and the action of passing the boundaries without a permit was made illegal, extending pass laws that had already curtailed black movement. Thirdly, under the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act in 1953, amenities in public areas, like hospitals, universities and parks, were labeled separately according to particular races. In addition, the Bantu Education Act in 1953 segregated national education in South Africa as well. Additionally, the government of the time enforced the [[pass laws]], which deprived black South Africans of their right to travel freely within their own country. Under this system black people were severely restricted from urban areas, requiring authorisation from a white employer to enter.

Uprisings and protests against apartheid appeared immediately when apartheid arose. As early as 1949, the youth wing of the African National Congress (ANC) advocated the ending of apartheid and suggested fighting against racial segregation by various methods. During the following decades, hundreds of anti-apartheid actions occurred, including those of the Black Consciousness Movement, students' protests, labor strikes, and church group activism etc. In 1991, the [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991|Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act]] was passed, repealing laws enforcing racial segregation, including the Group Areas Act.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Zimmermann (1996). "Southern Cross: Civil Law and Common Law in South Africa". p. 90. Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Nelson Mandela won in the first multiracial democratic election in South Africa. His success fulfilled the ending of apartheid in South African history.

On 28 April 2007, the [[Council of Representatives of Bahrain|lower house]] of [[National Assembly of Bahrain|Bahraini Parliament]] passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. To justify the law MP Nasser Fadhala, a close ally of the government said "bachelors also use these houses to make alcohol, run prostitute rings or to rape children and housemaids".&lt;ref name="migrantworkers3"/&gt;

Sadiq Rahma, technical committee head, who is a member of [[Al Wefaq]] said: "The rules we are drawing up are designed to protect the rights of both the families and the Asian bachelors (..) these labourers often have habits which are difficult for families living nearby to tolerate (..) they come out of their homes half dressed, brew alcohol illegally in their homes, use prostitutes and make the neighbourhood dirty (..) these are poor people who often live in groups of 50 or more, crammed into one house or apartment," said Mr Rahma. "The rules also state that there must be at least one bathroom for every five people (..) there have also been cases in which young children have been sexually molested."&lt;ref name="GDN 23.1.2006"&gt;{{cite news | author = Tariq Kkonji | url = http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=133367 | title = 'No go' rule for bachelor labourers | newspaper = [[Gulf Daily News]] | date=23 January 2006 | accessdate=2 January 2012|author-link = Tariq Kkonji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution is not to force migrant workers into ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve the standard of living for them."&lt;ref name="migrantworkers3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="migrantworkers2" /&gt;

===Canada===
Since the 1970s, there has been a concern expressed by some academics that major Canadian cities are becoming more segregated on income and ethnic lines. Reports have indicated that the inner suburbs of post-merger Toronto&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost1&gt;{{cite news|last=Mendelson|first=Rachel|title=Vancouver Income Inequality Study Shows City Segregating Along Racial, Income Lines|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/12/vancouver-income-inequality-study_n_1334796.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=12 March 2012|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the southern bedroom communities of Greater Vancouver&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; have become steadily more immigrant and [[visible minority]] dominated communities and have lagged behind other neighbourhoods in average income. A CBC panel in Vancouver in 2012 discussed the growing public fear that the proliferation of [[ethnic enclaves]] in Greater Vancouver (such as Han Chinese in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] and Punjabis in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]]) amounted to a type of [[self-segregation]]. In response to these fears, many minority activists have pointed out that most Canadian neighbourhoods remain predominately White, and yet Whites are never accused of "self-segregation".

A long-standing practice of national segregation has also been imposed upon the commercial salmon fishery in British Columbia since 1992 when separate commercial fisheries were created for select aboriginal groups on three B.C. river systems. Canadians of other nations who fish in the separate fisheries have been arrested, jailed and prosecuted. Although the fishermen who were prosecuted were successful at trial (see the decision in R. v.

[[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] proclaims equal rights to all citizens regardless of ethnicity, denomination or race. Israel has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality (such as prohibition of [[Prohibition of Discrimination in Products, Services and Entry into Places of Entertainment and Public Places Law, 2000|discrimination]], [[Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law, 1988|equality in Employment]], libel based on race or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:חוק איסור לשון הרע]]&lt;/ref&gt;). There is however, in practice, significant institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's Arab citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2004/41723.htm|title=Israel and the occupied territories|first=Bureau of Public Affairs|last=Department Of State.

In 2010, the Israeli supreme court sent a message against racial segregation in a case involving the [[Slonim (Hasidic dynasty)|Slonim]] Hassidic sect of the [[Ashkenazi Jews]], ruling that segregation between Ashkenazi and Sephardi students in a school is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1997685,00.html | work=Time | title=The Jewish Religious Conflict Tearing at Israel | date=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that they seek "to maintain an equal level of religiosity, not from racism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3926221,00.html Discrimination claimed in Modiin Illit haredi schools – Israel News, Ynetnews].

Due to many cultural differences, and animosity towards a minority perceived to wish to annihilate Israel, a system of passively co-existing communities, segregated along ethnic lines has emerged in Israel, with Arab-Israeli minority communities being left "marooned outside the mainstream". This de facto segregation also exists between different Jewish ethnic groups ("''edot''")  such as [[Sepharadim]], [[Ashkenazim]] and [[Beta Israel]] (Jews of Ethiopian descent),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethiopian Jewish Immigrants in Israel: The Homeland Postponed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwgJDV8Ho0cC&amp;pg=9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=9|year=2001|first=Tanya|last=Schwartz|isbn=9780700712380}}&lt;/ref&gt; which   leads to de facto segregated schools, housing and public policy.  The government has embarked on a program to shut down such schools, in order to force integration, but some in the Ethiopian community complained that not all such schools have been closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/ethiopian-israelis-accuse-state-of-school-segregation-1.381933|title=Ethiopian Israelis Accuse State of School Segregation|publisher=|newspaper=Haaretz|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2007 poll commissioned by the Center Against Racism and conducted by the GeoCartographia Institute, 75% of Israeli Jews would not agree to live in a building with Arab residents, 60% would not accept any Arab visitors at their homes, 40% believed that Arabs should be stripped of their right to vote, and 59% believe that the culture of Arabs is primitive.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3381836,00.html |title= יותר ממחצית היהודים: נישואים לערבי הם בגידה – חדשות היום |publisher=ynet.co.il |date=27 March 2007 |accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper= Ynet |last1= נחמיאס |first1= רועי }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a public opinion poll showed that 53% of the polled Israeli Jews said they would not object to an Arab living in their building, while 42% said they would.

=== Kenya ===
The end of British colonial rule in Kenya in 1964 led to an inadvertent increase in ethnic segregation. Through private purchases and government schemes, farm land previously held by European farmers was transferred to African owners. These farms were further sub-divided into smaller localities, and, due to joint migration, many adjacent localities were occupied by members of different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Undercurrents of Ethnic Conflicts in Kenya |last=Oucho |first=John |publisher=Brill |year=2002 |isbn=978-90-04-12459-2 |location=Leiden |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pages needed|date=April 2017}} This separation along these boundaries persists today.

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom has no legally sanctioned system of racial segregation and has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1976/74/data.htm|title=Race Relations Act 1976 (Repealed)|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, due to many cultural differences between the pre-existing system of passively co-existing communities, segregation along racial lines has emerged in parts of the United Kingdom, with minority communities being left "marooned outside the mainstream".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4273414.stm |work=BBC News | title=Britons warned over 'segregation' | date=22 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The affected and 'ghettoised' communities are often largely representative of [[Pakistanis]], [[Indian people|Indians]] and other Sub-Continentals, and has been thought to be the basis of ethnic tensions, and a deterioration of the standard of living and levels of education and employment among ethnic minorities in poorer areas. These factors are considered by some to have been a cause of the 2001 race riots in Bradford, Oldham and Burnley in the north of England which have large Asian communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1702799.stm |work=BBC News | title=Race 'segregation' caused riots | date=11 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ccsr.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/staff/Ludi/documents/UrbS_41_3_2004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609214608/http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/staff/Ludi/documents/UrbS_41_3_2004.pdf |archivedate=9 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be some indication that such segregation, particularly in residential terms, seems to be the result of the unilateral 'steering' of ethnic groups into particular areas as well as a culture of vendor discrimination and distrust of ethnic minority clients by some estate agents and other property professionals.&lt;ref&gt;PHILLIPS, D. (2002) Movement to opportunity? South Asian relocation in northern cities. End of Award report, ESRC R000238038. School of Geography, University of Leeds. Pg.7.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be indicative of a market preference amongst the more wealthy to reside in areas of less ethnic mixture; less ethnic mixture being perceived as increasing the value and desirability of a residential area. This is likely as other theories such as "ethnic [[Auto-segregation|self segregation]]" have sometimes been shown to be baseless, and a majority of ethnic respondents to a few surveys on the matter have been in favour of wider social and residential integration.&lt;ref name="ccsr.ac.uk"/&gt;

It is the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as mortgages, banking, insurance, access to jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf |title=Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities |accessdate=18 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513204845/http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; access to health care,&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Race and health]]&lt;/ref&gt;  or even supermarkets&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ptc5hvexthe7wrye/ In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition], Elizabeth Eisenhauer, [[GeoJournal]]  Volume 53, Number 2 / February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; to residents in certain, often racially determined,&lt;ref name="eastny"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto] by Walter Thabit. {{ISBN|0-8147-8267-1}}.

Over the next twenty years, a succession of further court decisions and federal laws, including the ''[[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]]'' and measure to end [[Mortgage Discrimination|mortgage discrimination]] in 1975, would completely invalidate ''[[de jure]]'' racial segregation and discrimination in the U.S., although ''de facto'' segregation and discrimination have proven more resilient. According to the Civil Rights Project at [[Harvard University]], the actual de facto desegregation of U.S. public schools peaked in the late 1980s; since that time, the schools have, in fact, become more segregated mainly due to the ethnic segregation of the nation with whites dominating the suburbs and minorities the urban centers. According to Rajiv Sethi, an economist at Columbia University, black-white segregation in housing is slowly declining for most metropolitan areas in the US.&lt;ref&gt;''Inequality and Segregation''

Regulations ensure that all housing units are expensive enough to prevent access by undesirable groups. By bidding up the price of housing, many white neighborhoods effectively shut out black people, because they may be unwilling, or unable, to pay the premium to buy entry into these expensive neighborhoods. Conversely, equivalent housing in black neighborhoods is far more affordable to those who are unable or unwilling to pay a premium to live in white neighborhoods. Through the 1990s, residential segregation remained at its extreme and has been called "[[hypersegregation]]" by some sociologists or "American Apartheid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Massey D.S., Denton N.
