In the USA institutionalized racial segregation was ended by the efforts of such [[civil rights]] activists as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], working during the period from the end of [[World War II]] through the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]] and the [[Civil Rights Act]] supported by President [[Lyndon Johnson]].

Although not all advocates concede the validity of the concept of "race" as applied to human divisions, discrimination on color or other ethnic characteristics is often labelled "racist" (see [[race]], [[racism]]).</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
