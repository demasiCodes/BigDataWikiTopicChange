'''Racial segregation''' is a kind of formalized or institutionalized [[racial discrimination|discrimination on the basis of race]]. It is characterized by the races' separation from each other when both are doing equal tasks, such as eating in a restaurant. However, segregation often allows close contact in [[hierarchical]] situations, such as when a person of one race is working as a servant for the member of another race. Segregation can involve [[spatial]] separation of the races, and/or the use of different institutions, such as [[school]]s by different races. See also: [[racism]].

==Overview==

Although many societies throughout history have practiced racial segregation, it was by no means universal, and some multiracial societies such as the [[Roman Empire]] were notable for their rejection of racial segregation. Most modern societies reject racism (at least officially). However, anxieties about racial issues tend to be phrased in coded form as issues relating to [[immigration]].

In general, rationales for racial segregation can be divided into two classes:
* an attempt by a majority group to oppress or expel a minority group, or vice-versa
* an attempt at self-determination by the minority group itself, or alternatively by the majority

== Nazi Germany ==

An example of [[miscegenation]] laws was the racist and [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] [[Nuremberg Laws]] enacted by the [[Nazis]] in [[Germany]] against the large German [[Jew]]ish community during the [[1930s]]. The laws prohibited marriages between Jews (deemed as ''[[Untermensch]]en'' - "subhuman beings") and German "[[Aryan]]s" (deemed the ''[[Herrenrasse]]'' - "master race"). Many interfaith and intermarried couples committed suicide when these laws came into effect.

Under the [[General Government]] of occupied [[Poland]] in [[1940]], the population was divided into different groups, each with different rights, food rations, allowed strips in the cities, public transportation, and assigned 
*[[Ukraine|Ukrainians]],
*Highlanders (''Goralenvolk'') - an attempt to split the Polish nation by using local collaborators  
*[[Poland|Poles]], 
*[[Jew|Jews]] (eventually sentenced to extermination as a category).

During the [[1930s]] and [[1940s|40s]], Jews and [[Roma people|Roma]] were forced to wear yellow ribbons, and were discriminated against by the racial laws. Jewish doctors and professors were not allowed to teach [[Aryan]] pupils or treat [[Aryan]] patients. Later, during [[WWII]], Jews and Roma were sent to the [[concentration camp]]s, solely on the basis of their race.

After the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] abolished [[slavery]] in the [[U.S. Southern States]], racial discrimination became regulated by the so-called [[Jim Crow law]]s, which mandated strict segregation of the races.  Though such laws were instituted shortly after fighting ended in many cases, they only became formalized after the end of [[Reconstruction]] in the 1870s and 80s during a period known as the [[nadir of American race relations]]. This legalized segregation lasted up to the [[1960s]]. White and black people would sometimes be required to use separate schools, public toilets, park benches, train and restaurant seating, etc.  In some locales, in addition to segregated seating, it could be forbidden for stores or restaurants to serve different races under the same roof. 

Segregation was also pervasive in housing.  State constitutions (for example, that of California) had clauses giving local jurisdictions the right to regulate where members of certain races could live.  White landowners often included [[restrictive covenant]]s in deeds through which they prevented blacks or Asians from ever purchasing their property from any subsequent owner.  In the 1948 case of ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', the Supreme Court finally ruled that such covenants were unenforceable in a court of law.  However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see [[white flight]] for more explanation).

"[[Miscegenation]]" laws prohibited people of different races from marrying. As one of many examples of such state laws, Utah's marriage law had an anti-miscegenation component that was passed in 1899 and repealed in 1963. It prohibited marriage between a white and anyone considered a negro, mulatto (half negro), quadroon (one-quarter negro), octoroon (one-eighth negro), Mongolian, or member of the malay race (presumably a Polynesian or Melanesian). No restrictions were placed on marriages between people that were not "white persons." (Utah Code, 40-1-2, C. L. 17, ยง2967 as amended by L. 39, C. 50; L. 41, Ch. 35.).

In [[World War I]], blacks served in the [[United States Armed Forces]] to some degree or another, including in the Army where segregated units were created. However, they were often poorly trained, equipped, and led, and low expectations meant low performance. Still, the 93rd Division, serving alongside the French (who needed troops, and with their use of Algerian, Moroccan, etc soldiers saw nothing wrong with black soldiers), performed well, with the 369th Infantry (formerly 15th New York National Guard) Regiment distinguished themselves, and were known as the "Harlem Hellfighters". 

During [[World War II]], people of Japanese descent (whether citizens or not) were [[Japanese American relocation|excluded]] from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and placed in [[internment camp]]s, on the basis of their race.

Advocation to end government racial segregation grew among African Americans and progressives after the end of the World War. On [[January 26]], [[1948]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] signed [[Executive Order 9981]], ending segregation in the [[United States Armed Forces]]. 

Institutionalized racial segregation was ended in practice by the efforts of such [[civil rights]] activists as [[Rosa Parks]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], working during the period from the end of World War II through the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] supported by President [[Lyndon Johnson]]. Many of their efforts were acts of [[civil disobedience]] aimed at violating the racial segregation rules and laws, such as insisting on sitting at the white part of the bus (Rosa Parks), or holding [[sit-in]]s at all-white diners. 

Although racial equality is, at least in theory, granted to all citizens in the US today, some see the [[USA Patriot Act]] as an attempt at covert racial segregation or discrimination against non-citizens. [[Arab]]s and [[Pakistan]]is, who have similar skin color, are allegedly subjected to different procedures that do not apply to others.  However, the US has strict rules against [[racial profiling]] to prevent such segregation.

Not all racial segregation laws have been repealed in the United States, although Supreme Court rulings have rendered them unenforceable. For instance, the [[Alabama Constitution]] still mandates that "Separate schools shall be provided for white and colored children, and no child of either race shall be permitted to attend a school of the other race." [http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/CA-245806.htm]  A proposal to repeal this provision was narrowly defeated in [[2004]]. However, in a different arena the US Supreme Court ruled in February 2005 in ''Johnson v. California'' (125 S. Ct. 1141) that the California Department of Corrections' unwritten practice of racially-segregating prisoners in its prison reception centers is to be subject to [[strict scrutiny]], the highest level of constitutional review. Although the high court [[remanded]] the case back to the lower courts, it is likely that their decision will have the impact of forcing California to alter its practice of segregating by race in its reception centers.

== South Africa==

[[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|Apartheid]] was a system which existed in [[South Africa]] for over forty years, although the term itself had a history going back to the [[1910s]]. It was formalized in the years following the victory of the [[National Party (South Africa) | National Party]] in the all-white national election of [[1948]], increased in dominancy under the rule of Prime Minister [[Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd]] and remained law until [[1990]]. Examples of partheid policy introduced are the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, [[1951]], which made it illegal for marriage between races. Apartheid was abolished following a rapid change in public perception of racial segregation throughout the [[world]], and an economic [[boycott]] against South Africa which had crippled and threatened to destroy its economy.

== Rhodesia ==
The British [[colony]] of [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]), under [[Ian Smith]], leader of the white minority government, declared unilateral independence in 1965.  For the next 15 years, Rhodesia operated under white minority rule until international sanctions forced Smith to hold multiracial elections, after a brief period of British rule in 1979.

Laws enforcing segregation had been around before 1965, although many institutions simply ignored them. One highly publicised legal battle occured in [[1960]] involving the opening of a new [[Reps Theatre|Theatre]] that was to be open to all races, this incident was nicknamed [[Reps Theatre|"The Battle of the Toilets"]]

== Arab world ==

After municipal elections in [[Bahrain]] in 2002 brought [[Islamist]] opposition party [[Al Wefaq|Al Wefaq Islamic Action]] to power in the capital [[Manama]], its newly installed mayor, [[Murthader Bader]] called for the introduction of racial segregation with the removal from the city of all non-Bahraini South Asian inhabitants and for the creation of a new township to house them. 

Mr Bader told the English language [http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/1yr_arc_Articles.asp?Article=87912&amp;Sn=BNEW&amp;IssueID=27131| Gulf Daily News] "It would cost a lot and we would have to find an area to accept them," he said. "A big question is where to build any new accommodation."

The government rejected the proposals.

==Fiji==
[[Fiji coups of 1987|Two military coups]] in [[Fiji]] in [[1987]] removed from power a government that was led by an [[Fijian people|ethnic Fijian]], but was supported principally by the [[Indo-Fijian]] (ethnic Indian) electorate, which then made up approximately half of the population.  A new constitution was promulgated in [[1990]], establishing Fiji as a republic, with the offices of [[List of Presidents of Fiji|President]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Fiji|Prime Minister]], two-thirds of the [[Senate (Fiji)|Senate]], and a clear majority of the [[House of Representatives (Fiji)|House of Representatives]] reserved for ethnic Fijians, despite the fact that ethnic Fijians then comprised less than half the population.  Ethnic Fijian ownership of the land (which was worked principally by Indo-Fijians) was also entrenched in the constitution.

World-wide condemnation of the [[1990]] constitution, and a [[Brain Drain|brain-drain]] of many Indo-Fijian professionals and businesspeople, caused the Fijian government to revise the [[Constitution of Fiji|constitution]] in [[1997]].  Amendments deleted most of the discriminatory provisions, and subsequent elections in [[1999]] brought a new government to power, with [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] as the country's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister.  

[[Fiji coup of 2000|Another coup followed in 2000]], with [[George Speight]], supported by sympathetic offices in the Army and police force, seizing power, with the aim of ending Indo-Fijian influence in politics.  Democracy, and the moderate [[1997]] constitution, were eventually restored, however.

Current prime minister [[Laisenia Qarase]] has refused to adhere to the Constitution by not including members of the largely Indo-Fijian [[Fiji Labour Party]] in the government.

==Related issues==

Although not all advocates concede the validity of the concept of "race" as applied to human divisions, discrimination on color or other ethnic characteristics is often labelled "racist" (see [[race]], [[racism]]).

==White separatism==
{{main|White separatism}}

'''White separatism''' is the belief that those who are of [[Whites|white]] or Caucasian [[race]] should have separate institutions or even separate societies, territories, governments, and should not "breed" with those considered to be of non-white races.[[White separatism#Controversial Groups|White separatists groups]] often label themselves as [[racialism|racialist]]s rather than [[racist]]s. White separatism is one among many forms of [[separatism]]. 

Many white separatists believe in [[white supremacy]], but some do not.  Some consider the segregationists of the [[Southern United States]] and the advocates of [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]] as being white separatists as these advocates of segregationism and apartheid used the same language of separatism and denied that they were "White supremacists" despite evidence to the contrary. Both groups also had advanced a belief in the inherent "inferiority" of non-whites, whom they claimed are incapable of properly either governing themselves or any other races. Some segragationists put forward the proposition that "separation" doesn't necessarily mean superiority and thus endorsed the "separate but equal" proposition for educational segregation that the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] struck down in the case of [[Brown v. Board of Education]].

== Black separatism ==
{{main|Black separatism}}

'''Black separatism''' is a separatist political movement that seeks a separate homeland for black people, particularly African-Americans. Parallel to the white separatism, there also exists, particularly in the [[United States]], a similarly politically marginal ''black separatist'' movement. Black separatists generally hold that whites are racist oppressors of blacks and that there can be no remedy for black advancement within contemporary white-dominated society. They believe that the only solution for blacks is to break away and to create a separate, segregated black society. The mainstream black separatism is sharply opposed by anti-segregationists and integrationists within the African American community. They generally hold that blacks can and should advance within the larger American society and call on them to work to achieve that through personal improvement, educational achievement, business involvement, and political action.

== Latino separatism ==
Some of the political groups among Latinos, or Americans of Mexican descent, in 1960s advocated racial separatism for the [[bronze race]] or the [[Chicanos]]. Some of them wanted to create an independent Chicano state in the south-west of [[United States]], on the territories that were won by America from [[Mexico]] after the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1848. Some of these views were reflected in the [[Plan Espiritual de Aztlan]] document which inspired Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, [[MEChA]].
