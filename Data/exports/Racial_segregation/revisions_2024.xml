{{Segregation}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Racial segregation''' is the separation of people into [[race (human classification)|racial]] or other [[Ethnicity|ethnic groups]] in daily life. Segregation can involve the spatial separation of the races, and mandatory use of different institutions, such as schools and hospitals by people of different races. Specifically, it may be applied to activities such as eating in restaurants, drinking from water fountains, using public toilets, attending schools, going to films, riding buses, renting or purchasing homes or renting hotel rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Schill |first1=Michael |title=Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium |last2=Wachter |first2=Susan|journal=Cityscape |year=2001 |pages=5–19 |citeseerx=10.1.1.536.5952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, segregation often allows close contact between members of different racial or ethnic groups in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] situations, such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race. Racial segregation has generally been outlawed worldwide.  

Segregation is defined by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] as "the act by which a (natural or legal) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification, in [[conformity]] with the proposed definition of discrimination. As a result, the voluntary act of separating oneself from other people on the basis of one of the enumerated grounds does not constitute segregation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance|title=European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) - Homepage - European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) - www.coe.int|website=European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI)|access-date=6 August 2024|archive-date=20 July 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240720171245/https://www.coe.int/en/web/european-commission-against-racism-and-intolerance/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the UN Forum on Minority Issues, "The creation and development of classes and schools providing education in minority languages should not be considered impermissible segregation if the assignment to such classes and schools is of a voluntary nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.11.Add.1.pdf|title=Recommendations of the Forum on Minority Issues A/HRC/10/11/Add.1 — para. 27|access-date=3 January 2012|archive-date=18 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918200706/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.11.Add.1.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial segregation can amount to the international [[crime of apartheid]] and a [[crimes against humanity|crime against humanity]] under the 2002 [[Rome Statute|Rome Declaration]] of [[Statute of the International Criminal Court]].

==== Qing dynasty ====

{{Main|Eight Banners}}

The [[Qing dynasty]] was founded not by Han Chinese, who form the majority of the Chinese population, but by [[Manchu people|Manchus]], who are today an ethnic minority of China. The Manchus were keenly aware of their minority status, however, it was only later in the dynasty that they banned intermarriage.

Han defectors played a massive role in the Qing conquest of China. Han Chinese Generals of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]] who defected to the Manchu were often [[Heqin#Qing dynasty|given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage]] while the ordinary soldiers who defected were given non-royal Manchu women as wives. The Manchu leader [[Nurhaci]] married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General [[Li Yongfang]] after he surrendered [[Fushun]] in [[Liaoning]] to the Manchu in 1618.&lt;ref name="ed.

A mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto and [[Hongtaiji]] in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="ed. Walthall 2008" /&gt;

[[Geng Zhongming]], a Han bannerman, was awarded the title of Prince Jingnan, and his son Geng Jingmao managed to have both his sons [[Geng Jingzhong]] and Geng Zhaozhong become court attendants under [[Shunzhi Emperor|Shunzhi]] and marry Aisin Gioro women, with Haoge's (a son of Hong Taiji) daughter marrying Geng Jingzhong and Prince Abatai's (Hong Taiji) granddaughter marrying Geng Zhaozhong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Wakeman, Frederic Jr. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA1017 |title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China |date=1 January 1985 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520048041 |via=Google Books |access-date=15 August 2015 |archive-date=31 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230731033512/https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&amp;pg=PA1017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing differentiated between Han Bannermen and ordinary Han civilians. Han Bannermen were made out of Han Chinese who defected to the Qing up to 1644 and joined the Eight Banners, giving them social and legal privileges in addition to being acculturated to Manchu culture. So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority within the Banners, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpfgQNWXpyoC&amp;pg=PA141 |title=Naquin |year=1987 |page=141 |isbn=0300046022 |last1=Naquin |first1=Susan |last2=Rawski |first2=Evelyn Sakakida |publisher=Yale University Press |access-date=17 January 2015 |archive-date=6 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240806051625/https://books.google.com/books?id=cpfgQNWXpyoC&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZt0TgTAgPoC&amp;pg=PA146 |title=Fairbank, Goldman |year=2006|isbn=9780674036659 |last1=Fairbank |first1=John King |last2=Goldman |first2=Merle |publisher=Harvard University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Summing up Naquin/Rawski |url=https://pages.uoregon.edu/inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing3.htm |website=pages.uoregon.edu |access-date=5 July 2019 |archive-date=19 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819105038/https://pages.uoregon.edu/inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing3.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this multi-ethnic force in which Manchus were only a minority, which conquered China for the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAIcwz3V_JsC&amp;pg=PA175 |title=eds.

It was Han Chinese Bannermen who were responsible for the successful Qing conquest of China, they made up the majority of governors in the early Qing and were the ones who governed and administered China after the conquest, stabilizing Qing rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vI1RRslLNSwC&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Spencer |year=1990 |page=41|isbn=9780393307801 |last1=Spence |first1=Jonathan D. |publisher=W.

To promote ethnic harmony, a 1648 decree from the Manchu [[Shunzhi Emperor]] allowed Han Chinese civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners, it was only later in the dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Wang 2004, pp. 215–216 &amp; 219–221. |url=http://www.chss.iup.edu/chr/CHR-2004Fall-11-WANG-research%20notes-final.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111230216/http://www.chss.iup.edu/chr/CHR-2004Fall-11-WANG-research%20notes-final.pdf |archive-date=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Walthall |first=Anne |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXHbhsfaJAYC&amp;pg=PA140 |title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520254442 |via=Google Books |access-date=15 August 2015 |archive-date=6 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240806052152/https://books.google.com/books?id=QXHbhsfaJAYC&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing implemented a policy of segregation between the Bannermen of the [[Eight Banners]] (Manchu Bannermen, Mongol Bannermen, Han Bannermen) and Han Chinese civilians{{when|date=July 2015}}. This ethnic segregation had cultural and economic reasons: intermarriage was forbidden to keep up the Manchu heritage and minimize [[sinicization]]. Han Chinese civilians and Mongol civilians [[Willow Palisade|were banned]] from settling in Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=From Ming to Qing |url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing2.htm |access-date=18 January 2010 |publisher=Darkwing.uoregon.edu |archive-date=28 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628182234/http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing2.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Han civilians and Mongol civilians were banned from crossing into each other's lands. Ordinary Mongol civilians in Inner Mongolia were banned from even crossing into other [[Banners of Inner Mongolia|Mongol Banners]] (a banner in Inner Mongolia was an administrative division and not related to the Mongol Bannermen in the Eight Banners).

These restrictions did not apply to [[Eight Banners|Han Bannermen]], who were settled in Manchuria by the Qing. Han bannermen were differentiated from Han civilians by the Qing and treated differently.

The Qing Dynasty started [[Chuang Guandong|colonizing Manchuria with Han Chinese]] later on in the dynasty's rule, but the Manchu area was still separated from modern-day Inner Mongolia by the [[Willow Palisade|Outer Willow Palisade]], which kept the Manchu and the Mongols in the area separate.

The policy of segregation applied directly to the [[Eight Banners|banner]] garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities in which they were stationed. Manchu Bannermen, Han Bannermen, and Mongol Bannermen were separated from the Han civilian population. While the Manchus followed the governmental structure of the preceding [[Ming dynasty]], their ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han Chinese civilian officials who had passed the highest levels of the [[Imperial examinations|state examinations]], and because of the small number of Manchus, this insured that a large fraction of them would be government officials.

From 1952, and even more so after the triumphant visit of [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]] to the colony in 1955, Governor-General [[Léon Pétillon]] (1952–1958) worked to create a "Belgian-Congolese community", in which Black and White people were to be treated as equals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pétillon |first=L.

Following its conquest of [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] controlled [[Algeria]] in 1830, for well over a century, France maintained [[French colonial empires|colonial rule]] in the territory which has been described as "quasi-[[apartheid]]".&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bell |first=David Scott |title=Presidential Power in Fifth Republic France |publisher=Berg Publishers |year=2000 |page=36 |quote=Algeria was in fact a colony but constitutionally was a part of France and not thought of in the 1950s (even by many on the left) as a colony.

In 1972, the [[President of Uganda]] [[Idi Amin]] ordered the expulsion of the country's Indian minority with disastrous consequences for the local economy. The government confiscated some 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates, along with cars, homes and other household goods.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1981"&gt;{{harvnb|Jørgensen|1981|pp=285–290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 15th century, Jewish populations in [[Morocco]] were confined to [[mellah]]s. In cities, a ''mellah'' was surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway. In contrast, rural ''mellahs'' were separate villages whose sole inhabitants were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G.

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the lives of [[History of Jews in Iran|Persian Jews]]:
{{blockquote|…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town…; for they are considered as unclean creatures…  Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity, and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…  For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans…  If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him… unmercifully…  If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods… Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)…, he is sure to be murdered.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 16 May 1940 in Norway, the {{Lang|no|[[Administrasjonsrådet]]}} asked the [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen|Rikskommisariatet]] why radio receivers had been confiscated from Jews in Norway.&lt;ref name="Folk, fører og frifinnelse"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bomann-larsen |first=Tor |title=Folk, fører og frifinnelse |url=https://www.aftenposten.no/article/ap-aw0BO.html |website=Aftenposten |date=29 December 2011 |access-date=5 July 2019 |archive-date=28 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728140657/https://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikk/i/aw0BO/folk-foerer-og-frifinnelse |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; That {{Lang|no|Administrasjonsrådet}} thereafter "quietly" accepted&lt;ref name="Folk, fører og frifinnelse" /&gt; racial segregation between Norwegian citizens, has been claimed by [[Tor Bomann-Larsen]].

==== Fascist Italy ====

{{Main|Italian fascism|Italian fascism and racism}}

In 1938, under pressure from the Nazis, the [[Italian Fascism|fascist regime]], which was led by [[Benito Mussolini]], passed a series of [[Italian Racial Laws|racial laws]] which instituted an official segregationist policy in the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian Empire]], this policy was especially directed against [[Italian Jews]]. This policy enforced various segregationist norms, like the laws which banned Jews from teaching or studying in ordinary schools and universities, banned Jews from owning industries that were reputed to be very important to the nation, banned Jews from working as journalists, banned Jews from joining the military, and banned Jews from marrying non-Jews.
As an immediate consequence of the introduction of the 'provvedimenti per la difesa della razza' (norms for the defence of the race), many of the best Italian scientists quit their jobs, and some of them also left Italy. Amongst these scientists were the internationally-known physicists [[Emilio Segrè]], [[Enrico Fermi]] (whose wife was Jewish), [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], [[Bruno Rossi]], [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], mathematicians [[Federigo Enriques]] and [[Guido Fubini]] and even the fascist propaganda director, art critic and journalist [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was one of Mussolini's mistresses. [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], who would successively win the [[Nobel Prize for Medicine]], was forbidden to work at the university. Upon the passage of the racial law, [[Albert Einstein]] cancelled his honorary membership in the {{Lang|it|[[Accademia dei Lincei]]|italic=no}}.

After 1943, when [[Northern Italy]] was [[Kingdom of Italy#Civil war (1943–1945)|occupied by the Nazis]], Italian Jews were rounded up and became victims of the [[The Holocaust in Italy|Holocaust]].

German praise for America's system of [[institutional racism]], which was expressed in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', was continuous throughout the early 1930s.&lt;ref name="Whitman" /&gt; The U.S. was the global leader of codified racism, and its race laws fascinated the Germans.&lt;ref name="Whitman" /&gt; The ''National Socialist Handbook for Law and Legislation'' of 1934–35, edited by Hitler's lawyer [[Hans Frank]], contains a pivotal essay by Herbert Kier on the recommendations for race legislation which devoted a quarter of its pages to U.S. legislation—from segregation, race-based citizenship, immigration regulations, and [[anti-miscegenation]].&lt;ref name="Whitman" /&gt; This directly inspired the two principal [[Nuremberg Laws]]—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law.&lt;ref name="Whitman"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Whitman |first=James Q. |title=Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law |date=2017 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=37–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban on interracial marriage (anti-miscegenation) prohibited sexual relations and marriages between people classified as "[[Aryan]]" and "non-Aryan".

Under the General Government of [[occupied Poland]] in 1940, the Nazis divided the population into different groups, each with different rights, food rations, allowed housing strips in the cities, public transportation, etc. In an effort to split the Polish people's identity, they attempted to establish ethnic divisions of [[Kashubians]] and [[Gorals]] ([[Goralenvolk]]), based on these groups' alleged "Germanic component".

During the 1930s and 1940s, Jews in [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi-controlled states]] were forced to wear something that identified them as Jewish, such as a [[yellow badge|yellow ribbon or a star of David]], and along with [[Romani people|Romas]] (Gypsies), they were subjected to discrimination by the racial laws. Jewish doctors were not allowed to treat [[Aryan race|Aryan]] patients and Jewish professors were not permitted to teach Aryan pupils. In addition, Jews were not allowed to use any form of public transportation, besides the ferry, and they were only allowed to shop in Jewish stores from 3–5 pm. After ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' ("The Night of Broken Glass"), the Jews were fined {{Reichsmark|1,000,000,000|link=yes}} for the damage which was done by Nazi troops and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members.

[[Jews]], [[Polish people|Poles]], and [[Romani people|Roma]] were subjected to [[genocide]] as "undesirable" racial groups in [[The Holocaust]]. The Nazis established [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939–1944|ghettos]] in order to confine Jews and sometimes, they confined Romas in tightly packed areas of the cities of [[Eastern Europe]], turning them into ''[[de facto]]'' [[concentration camp]]s. The [[Warsaw Ghetto]] was the largest of these ghettos, with 400,000 people. The [[Łódź Ghetto]] was the second largest, holding about 160,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=23 November 1939 |title=Holocaust Timeline: The Ghettos |url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/timeline/ghettos.htm |access-date=18 January 2010 |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |archive-date=3 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503154427/http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/timeline/ghettos.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1939 and 1945, at least 1.5 million [[Poland|Polish]] citizens were transported to the Reich for [[forced labour]] (in all, about 12 million forced laborers were employed in the German war economy inside [[Nazi Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Michael Marek |title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810111755/https://www.dw.com/en/final-compensation-pending-for-former-nazi-forced-laborers/a-1757323 |archive-date=10 August 2015 |access-date=18 January 2010 |publisher=Dw-world.de}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War |url=http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014235036/http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |archive-date=14 October 2007 |access-date=18 January 2010 |publisher=Summeroftruth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nazi Germany also used forced laborers from Western Europe, [[Polish people|Poles]], along with other Eastern Europeans viewed as racially inferior,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Hitler's Plans |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401234751/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |archive-date=1 April 2010 |access-date=5 April 2016 |publisher=Dac.neu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  were subject to deeper discriminatory measures. They were forced to wear a yellow with purple border and letter "[[P (Nazi symbol)|P]]" (for Polen/Polish) cloth identifying tag sewn to their clothing, subjected to a [[curfew]], and banned from [[public transportation]].

While the treatment of factory workers or farm hands often varied depending on the individual employer, Polish laborers, as a rule, were compelled to work longer hours for lower wages than Western Europeans – in many cities, they were forced to live in segregated barracks behind barbed wire. Social relations with [[Germans]] outside work were forbidden, and sexual relations (''[[Rassenschande]]'' or "racial defilement") were punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era |url=http://www.holocaust-trc.org/poles.htm |access-date=18 January 2010 |publisher=Holocaust-trc.org |archive-date=16 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716193932/http://www.holocaust-trc.org/poles.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other countries ===
==== Canada ====
{{Main|Racial segregation in Canada}}
Racial segregation was widespread and deeply imbedded into the fabric of Canadian society prior to the Canadian constitution of 1982. Multiple court decisions, including one from the Supreme Court of Canada in 1939, upheld racial segregation as valid. The last black specifically segregated school closed in Ontario in 1965, while the last black specifically segregated school closed in Nova Scotia in 1983. The last racially segregated Indigenous school closed in 1996 in Saskatchewan.&lt;ref name="ency"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henry|first1=Natasha|title=Racial segregation of Black people in Canada|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/racial-segregation-of-black-people-in-canada|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=21 Dec 2022|archive-date=24 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220324054026/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/racial-segregation-of-black-people-in-canada|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Canada has had multiple white only neighbourhoods and cities, white only public spaces, stores, universities, hospitals, employment, restaurants, theatres, sports arenas and universities. Though the black population in Canada was significantly less than the black population in the United States, severe restrictions on black people existed in all forms, particularly in immigration, employment access and mobility. Unlike in the United States, racial segregation in Canada applied to all non-whites and was historically enforced through laws, court decisions and social norms with a closed immigration system that barred virtually all non-whites from immigrating until 1962. Section 38 of the 1910 Immigration Act permitted the government to prohibit the entry of immigrants "belonging to any race deemed unsuited to the climate or requirements of Canada, or of immigrants of any specified class, occupation or character."&lt;ref name="ency"/&gt;

Racial segregation practices extended to many areas of employment in Canada. Black men and women in Quebec were historically relegated to the service sector regardless of their educational attainment. White business owners and even provincial and federal government agencies often did not hire black people, with explicit rules preventing their employment. When the labour movement took hold in Canada near the end of the 19th century, workers began organizing and forming trade unions with the aim of improving the working conditions and quality of life for employees. However, black workers were systematically denied membership to these unions, and worker's protection was reserved exclusively for whites.&lt;ref name="ency"/&gt;

In fifteenth-century north-east Germany, people of [[Wends|Wend]]ish, i.e. [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], origin were not allowed to join some [[guild]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Situation with the Sorbs in the Past and Present |url=http://www.ifl-leipzig.com/fileadmin/daten/downloads/DOWNLOADCENTER/Publikationen/internationale%20Zusammenfassungen%20Europa%20Regional/2002/Heft2/en.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713003632/http://www.ifl-leipzig.com/fileadmin/daten/downloads/DOWNLOADCENTER/Publikationen/internationale%20Zusammenfassungen%20Europa%20Regional/2002/Heft2/en.pdf | archive-date=13 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Wilhelm Raabe]], "down into the eighteenth century no German guild accepted a Wend."&lt;ref&gt;Raabe, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Apartheid}}
[[File:DurbanSign1989.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"[[Apartheid]]": sign on Durban beach in English, [[Afrikaans]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]], 1989]]
The [[apartheid]] system carried out by [[Afrikaner]] minority rule enacted a nationwide social policy "separate development" with the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] victory in the [[1948 South African general election|1948 general election]], following the "colour bar"-discriminatory legislation dating back to the beginning of the [[Union of South Africa]] and the [[Boer Republics|Boer republics]] before which, while repressive to Black South Africans along with other minorities, had not gone nearly so far.

Apartheid laws can be generally divided into following acts. Firstly, the [[Population Registration Act, 1950|Population Registration Act]] in 1950 classified residents in South Africa into four racial groups: "black", "white", "[[Coloured]]", and "Indian" and noted their racial identities on their identifications. Secondly, the [[Group Areas Act]] in 1950 assigned different regions according to different races. People were forced to live in their corresponding regions and the action of passing the boundaries without a permit was made illegal, extending pass laws that had already curtailed black movement. Thirdly, under the [[Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, 1953|Reservation of Separate Amenities Act]] in 1953, amenities in public areas, like hospitals, universities and parks, were labeled separately according to particular races. In addition, the [[Bantu Education Act, 1953|Bantu Education Act]] in 1953 segregated national education in South Africa as well. Additionally, the government of the time enforced the [[pass laws]], which deprived Black South Africans of their right to travel freely within their own country. Under this system Black South Africans were severely restricted from urban areas, requiring authorisation from a white employer to enter.

Uprisings and protests against apartheid appeared immediately when apartheid arose. As early as 1949, the [[African National Congress Youth League|Youth League]] of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) advocated the ending of apartheid and suggested fighting against racial segregation by various methods. During the following decades, hundreds of anti-apartheid actions occurred, including those of the [[Black Consciousness Movement]], students' protests, labor strikes, and church group activism etc. In 1991, the [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991|Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act]] was passed, repealing laws enforcing racial segregation, including the Group Areas Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zimmermann |first=Reinhard |title=Southern Cross: Civil Law and Common Law in South Africa |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1996 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, [[Nelson Mandela]] won in the first [[1994 South African general election|multiracial democratic election]] in South Africa. His success fulfilled the ending of apartheid in South African history.

In the United States, [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] was mandated by law in some states and enforced along with [[anti-miscegenation laws]] (prohibitions against [[interracial marriage]]), until the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] led by Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] struck down racial segregation.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Virginia [[Racial Integrity Act]], Virginia Code § 20–58 and § 20–59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Court's Decision – Separate Is Not Equal |url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/brown/history/5-decision/courts-decision.html |access-date=20 October 2019 |website=americanhistory.si.edu |archive-date=13 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200313032737/https://americanhistory.si.edu/brown/history/5-decision/courts-decision.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Warren Court: Completion of a Constitutional Revolution |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73968804.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003223936/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73968804.pdf |archive-date=3 October 2019 |website=William &amp; Mary Law School Scholarship Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Brown v.

After the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] abolishing [[Slavery in the United States]], [[Jim Crow laws]] were introduced to codify [[Racism in the United States|racial discrimination]]. The laws mandated strict segregation of the races. Though many of these laws were passed shortly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended, they only became formalized after the end of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] in 1877. The period that followed the Reconstruction era is known as the [[nadir of American race relations]].

While the U.S. Supreme Court majority in the 1896 ''[[Plessy v.

Likewise, when former president [[Harry S.

Institutionalized racial segregation was ended as an official practice during the [[civil rights movement]] by the efforts of such civil rights activists as [[Clarence M. Mitchell Jr.]], [[Rosa Parks]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[James Farmer]] working for social and political freedom during the period from the end of World War II through the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] desegregation order of 1961, the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] in 1964 and the [[Voting Rights Act]] in 1965 supported by President [[Lyndon B.

Many of their efforts were acts of [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] [[civil disobedience]] aimed at disrupting the enforcement of racial segregation rules and laws, such as refusing to give up a seat in the black part of the bus to a white person (Rosa Parks), or holding [[sit-in]]s at all-white [[wikt:diner|diners]].

On 28 April 2007, the [[Council of Representatives of Bahrain|lower house]] of [[National Assembly of Bahrain|Bahraini Parliament]] passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. To justify the law, Nasser Fadhala, [[Member of Parliament|MP]], a close ally of the government, said "bachelors also use these houses to make alcohol, run prostitute rings or to rape children and housemaids".&lt;ref name="migrantworkers3" /&gt;

Sadiq Rahma, technical committee head, who is a member of [[Al Wefaq]], said: "The rules we are drawing up are designed to protect the rights of both the families and the Asian bachelors (..) these labourers often have habits which are difficult for families living nearby to tolerate (..) they come out of their homes half dressed, brew alcohol illegally in their homes, use prostitutes and make the neighbourhood dirty (..) these are poor people who often live in groups of 50 or more, crammed into one house or apartment," said Mr Rahma. "The rules also state that there must be at least one bathroom for every five people (..) there have also been cases in which young children have been sexually molested."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Tariq Kkonji |date=23 January 2006 |title='No go' rule for bachelor labourers |work=[[Gulf Daily News]] |url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=133367 |access-date=2 January 2012 |archive-date=19 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119090039/http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=133367 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===

Until 1965, racial segregation in schools, stores and most aspects of public life existed legally in [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]] and [[Nova Scotia]], and informally in other provinces such as [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Henry |first=Natasha |date=8 September 2021 |title=Racial Segregation of Black People in Canada |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/racial-segregation-of-black-people-in-canada |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |access-date=4 August 2020 |archive-date=24 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220324054026/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/racial-segregation-of-black-people-in-canada |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, there has been a concern expressed by some academics that major Canadian cities are becoming more segregated on income and ethnic lines. Reports have indicated that the inner suburbs of post-merger [[Toronto]]&lt;ref name=huffingtonpost1 /&gt; and the southern [[bedroom communities]] of [[Greater Vancouver]]&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Mendelson |first=Rachel |date=12 March 2012 |title=Vancouver Income Inequality Study Shows City Segregating Along Racial, Income Lines |work=Huffington Post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/12/vancouver-income-inequality-study_n_1334796.html |access-date=22 February 2015 |archive-date=23 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223025103/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/12/vancouver-income-inequality-study_n_1334796.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; have become steadily more immigrant and [[visible minority]] dominated communities and have lagged behind other neighbourhoods in average income. A [[CBC News|CBC]] panel in Vancouver in 2012 discussed the growing public fear that the proliferation of [[ethnic enclaves]] in Greater Vancouver (such as [[Chinese Canadians in Greater Vancouver|Han Chinese]] in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond B.C.]] and [[Punjabis in Vancouver|Punjabis]] in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey, B.C.]]) amounted to a type of [[self-segregation]]. In response to these fears, many minority activists have pointed out that most Canadian neighbourhoods remain predominately White, and yet white people are never accused of "self-segregation".

Israeli apartheid is [[crime of apartheid|a system of institutionalized segregation and discrimination]] in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-occupied]] [[Palestinian territories]] and to a lesser extent in [[Israel]] proper. This system is characterized by near-total physical separation between the [[Palestinian]] and the [[Israeli settlements|Israeli settler]] population of the [[West Bank]], as well as the judicial separation that governs both communities, which discriminates against the Palestinians in a wide range of ways. Israel also discriminates against [[Palestinian refugees]] in the [[Palestinian diaspora|diaspora]] and against [[Palestinian citizens of Israel|its own Palestinian citizens]]. Palestinians in the occupied territories live under [[military occupation]] and are progressively segregated, barred from [[freedom of movement]], and discriminated against. After institutionalized segregation, Palestinians face eventual [[forced displacement]] of their homes by [[Israeli settlers]] at which point they barred from returning home, and the Palestinian areas becomes annexed into the Israeli state.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |title=A regime of Jewish supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea: This is apartheid |url=https://www.btselem.org/publications/fulltext/202101_this_is_apartheid |publisher=B'Tselem |access-date=12 January 2021 |date=12 January 2021 |quote=A regime that uses laws, practices and organized violence to cement the supremacy of one group over another is an apartheid regime.

In 2010, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] sent a message against racial segregation in a case involving the [[Slonim (Hasidic dynasty)|Slonim]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidic]] sect of the [[Ashkenazi Jews]], ruling that segregation between [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] students in a school is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1997685,00.html |title=The Jewish Religious Conflict Tearing at Israel |date=17 June 2010 |magazine=Time |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619044520/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1997685,00.html |archive-date=19 June 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that they seek "to maintain an equal level of religiosity, not from racism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=20 June 1995 |title=Discrimination claimed in Modiin Illit haredi schools |work=Israel News |publisher=Ynetnews.com |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3926221,00.html |access-date=12 December 2012 |archive-date=23 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023065856/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3926221,00.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the charges, the Slonim [[Haredi Judaism|Haredim]] invited Sephardi girls to school, and added in a statement: "All along, we said it's not about race, but the High Court went out against our [[rabbi]]s, and therefore we went to prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Mandel |first=Jonah |date=23 July 2010 |title=Hassidim invite Sephardi girls to school |work=Jpost.com |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=182335 |access-date=12 December 2012 |archive-date=20 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020112751/http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=182335 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to many cultural differences, and animosity towards a minority perceived to wish to annihilate Israel, a system of passively co-existing communities, segregated along ethnic lines has emerged in Israel, with Arab-Israeli minority communities being left "marooned outside the mainstream".

=== Kenya ===

The end of [[Kenya Colony|British colonial rule in Kenya]] in 1964 led to an inadvertent increase in ethnic segregation. Through private purchases and government schemes, farmland previously held by [[White people in Kenya|European farmers]] was transferred to African owners. These farms were further sub-divided into smaller localities, and, due to joint migration, many adjacent localities were occupied by members of different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Oucho |first=John |title=Undercurrents of Ethnic Conflicts in Kenya |publisher=Brill |year=2002 |isbn=978-90-04-12459-2 |location=Leiden}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pages needed|date=April 2017}} This separation along these boundaries persists today.

Malaysia is also not a signatory of the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD), one of the only few countries in the world not to do so. A possible ratification in 2018 led to an [[2018 anti-ICERD rally|anti-ICERD mass rally]] by Malay supremacists at the country's capital to prevent it, threatening a racial conflict if it does happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PAS and Umno to hold anti-Icerd rally in KL on Dec 8 |url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/452368 |publisher=[[Malaysiakini]] |access-date=17 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117153030/https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/452368 |archive-date=17 November 2018 |date=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such racial segregation policies have caused significant rates of [[human capital flight]] (brain drain) from Malaysia. A study by [[Stanford University]] highlighted that among the main factors behind the Malaysian brain drain include social injustice.

For centuries, the so-called [[Haratin]] lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by white Moors of Arab/Berber ancestry. Many descendants of the [[Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes today still adhere to the [[supremacist]] ideology of their ancestors. This ideology has led to oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups in the region of [[Sudan]] and [[Western Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=5 March 2007 |title=Fair elections haunted by racial imbalance |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522 |access-date=18 January 2010 |publisher=Irinnews.org |archive-date=25 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325015835/http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=War and Genocide in Sudan |url=http://www.iabolish.org/slavery_today/in_depth/sudan-genocide.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927031133/http://www.iabolish.org/slavery_today/in_depth/sudan-genocide.html |archive-date=27 September 2007 |access-date=18 January 2010 |publisher=Iabolish.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=7 December 2007 |title=Mauritania: The real beginning of the end of slavery? |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=75756 |access-date=18 January 2010 |publisher=Irinnews.org |archive-date=12 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112175902/http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=75756 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Racial segregation in the United Kingdom}}

Although racial segregation was never made legal in the UK, occasionally pubs, workplaces, shops and other commercial premises operated a "colour bar" where non-white customers were banned from using certain rooms and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Waters |first=Rob |date=2017-04-03 |title=The rise and fall of the drinking club |url=http://www.blacklondonhistories.org.uk/uncategorized/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-drinking-club/ |access-date=2022-03-09 |website=Black London Histories |language=en |archive-date=7 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407072226/http://www.blacklondonhistories.org.uk/uncategorized/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-drinking-club/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation also operated in the 20th century in certain professions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2013-08-26 |title=What was behind the Bristol bus boycott? |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23795655 |access-date=2022-03-09 |archive-date=19 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231019141711/https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-23795655 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; in housing and even at Buckingham Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2021-06-02 |title=Buckingham Palace banned ethnic minorities from office roles, papers reveal |url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/02/buckingham-palace-banned-ethnic-minorities-from-office-roles-papers-reveal |access-date=2022-03-09 |website=The Guardian |language=en |archive-date=10 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220310121328/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/02/buckingham-palace-banned-ethnic-minorities-from-office-roles-papers-reveal |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The colour bar in pubs was deemed illegal by the [[Race Relations Act 1965]] but other institutions such as members' clubs could still bar people because of their race until a few years later.

The United Kingdom nowadays has no legally sanctioned system of racial segregation and has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality.&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Race Relations Act 1976 (Repealed) |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1976/74/data.htm |website=www.legislation.gov.uk |access-date=5 July 2019 |archive-date=5 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705104021/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1976/74/data.htm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to many cultural differences between the pre-existing system of passively co-existing communities, segregation along racial lines has emerged in parts of the United Kingdom, with minority communities being left "marooned outside the mainstream".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=22 September 2005 |title=Britons warned over 'segregation' |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4273414.stm |access-date=6 December 2011 |archive-date=22 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222184258/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4273414.stm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The affected and 'ghettoised' communities are often largely representative of [[Pakistanis]], [[Indian people|Indians]] and other Sub-Continentals, and has been thought to be the basis of ethnic tensions, and a deterioration of the standard of living and levels of education and employment among ethnic minorities in poorer areas. These factors are considered by some to have been a cause of the 2001 English race riots in [[2001 Bradford riots|Bradford]], [[2001 Oldham riots|Oldham]] and [[2001 Harehills riot|Harehills]] in [[northern England]] which have large Asian communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=11 December 2001 |title=Race 'segregation' caused riots |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1702799.stm |access-date=6 December 2011 |archive-date=12 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212141758/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1702799.stm |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ccsr.ac.uk"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Statistics of Racial Segregation: Measures, Evidence and Policy |url=http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/staff/Ludi/documents/UrbS_41_3_2004.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609214608/http://www.ccsr.ac.uk/staff/Ludi/documents/UrbS_41_3_2004.pdf |archive-date=9 June 2012 |access-date=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be some indication that such segregation, particularly in residential terms, seems to be the result of the unilateral 'steering' of ethnic groups into particular areas as well as a culture of vendor discrimination and distrust of ethnic minority clients by some estate agents and other property professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=PHILLIPS |first=D. |title=Movement to opportunity? South Asian relocation in northern cities |work=End of Award report, ESRC R000238038 |publisher=School of Geography, University of Leeds |year=2002 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be indicative of a market preference amongst the more wealthy to reside in areas of less ethnic mixture; less ethnic mixture being perceived as increasing the value and desirability of a residential area. This is likely as other theories such as "ethnic [[Auto-segregation|self segregation]]" have sometimes been shown to be baseless, and a majority of ethnic respondents to a few surveys on the matter have been in favour of wider social and residential integration.

[[Redlining]] is part of how white communities in America maintained some level of racial segregation.
