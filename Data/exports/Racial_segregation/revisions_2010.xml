{{Segregation}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Racial segregation''' is the separation  of different kinds of humans (like black and white people) into [[race (classification of human beings)|racial group]]s in daily life. It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a [[washroom]], attending school, going to the movies, or in the rental or purchase of a home.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation is generally outlawed, but may exist through social norms, even when there is no strong individual preference for it, as suggested by [[Thomas Schelling]]'s models of segregation and subsequent work.  Segregation may be maintained by means ranging from [[discrimination]] in hiring and in the rental and sale of housing to certain races to [[vigilante]] violence (such as [[lynching]]s, e.g.) Generally, a situation that arises when members of different races mutually prefer to associate and do business with members of their own race would usually be described as ''separation'' or ''de facto separation'' of the races rather than ''segregation''. In the [[United States]], legal segregation  was required in some states and came with "[[anti-miscegenation laws]]" (prohibitions against [[interracial marriage]]).&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Virginia [[Racial Integrity Act]], Virginia Code § 20-58 and § 20-59&lt;/ref&gt; There were laws passed against segregation in the USA in the 1960s.

Segregation, however, often allowed close contact in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] situations, such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race. Segregation can involve [[wiktionary:spatial|spatial]] separation of the races, and/or mandatory use of different institutions, such as schools and hospitals by people of different races.

==Historical cases==
Historically various conquerors—among them Asian [[Manchus]], African [[Bantu people|Bantu]], and American [[Aztec]]s—have practiced discrimination involving the segregation of subject races. Racial segregation has appeared in all parts of the world where there are multiracial communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/488135/racial-segregation Racial segregation]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
3,000–8,000 years ago, [[Indo-European]]-speaking nomadic groups from Europe, the Near East, Anatolia, and the Caucasus migrated to India. According to 19th century British historians, it was these "Aryans" who and established the     [[caste system]], an [[elitist]] act of social organization that (according to the British) separated the "light-skinned" Indo-Aryan conquerors from the "conquered dark-skinned" indigenous [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]] tribes through enforcement of "racial [[endogamy]]". This claim was used by the British, defining themselves as "purely Aryan", to justify [[British Raj|British Rule in India]]. Much of this was simply [[conjecture]], fueled by [[British Empire|British]] [[imperialism]]&lt;ref name="NehruIndia"&gt;From [[Discovery of India]] by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], reproduced from "History : Modern India" (p108) by S.N. Sen, New Age Publishers, ISBN 8122417744.&lt;/ref&gt; British policies of [[divide and rule]] as well as enumeration of the population into rigid categories during the tenure of British rule in India contributed towards the hardening of these segregated caste identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Corbridge |first=Staurt |coauthors=Harriss, John |title= Reinventing India: Liberalization, Hindu Nationalism and Popular Democracy|year=2000 |publisher= Polity press |page=8}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Since the independence of [[India]] from British rule, the British [[fantasy]] of an "Aryan Invasion and subjugation of the dark skinned Dravidians in India" has become a staple polemic in [[South Asia]]n geopolitics, including the propaganda of [[Indophobia]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ayesha Jalal]]. (1995). [http://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0020-7438(199502)27:1%3C73:CPHAOI%3E2.0.CO;2-0 Conjuring Pakistan: History as Official Imagining]. ''International Journal of Middle East Studies''. 27(1). pp. 73-89.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no decisive theory as to the origins of the caste system in India, and globally renown historians and archaeologists like [[Jim Shaffer]], [[J.P. Mallory]], [[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]], and others, have disputed the claim of "Aryan Invasion".&lt;ref&gt;
*[[Jim Shaffer]] - "Current archaeological data do not support the existence of an Indo-Aryan or European invasion into South Asia any time in the pre- or protohistoric periods. Instead, it is possible to document archaeologically a series of cultural changes reflecting indigenous cultural developments from prehistoric to historic periods"{{cite book |title = The Indo-Aryan Invasions : Cultural Myth and Archaeological Reality |author = Jim Shaffer}}
*[[J.P. Mallory]] - "... the extraordinary difficulty of making a case for expansions from Andronovo to northern India, and that attempts to link the Indo-Aryans to such sites as the Beshkent and Vakhsh cultures only gets the Indo-Iranian to Central Asia, but not as far as the seats of the Medes, Persians or Indo-Aryans". As quoted in Bryant (see below)
*[[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]] - "India is not the only Indo-European-speaking area that has not revealed any archaeological traces of immigration."there is at least a series of archaeological cultures that can be traced approaching the Indian subcontinent, even if discontinuous, which does not seem to be the case for any hypothetical east-to-west emigration"

}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have also debunked the British claims that so-called "Aryans" and "Dravidians" have a "racial divide". A study conducted by the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]] in 2009 (in collaboration with [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and the [[Broad Institute of Harvard]] and [[MIT]]) analyzed half a million genetic markers across the genomes of 132 individuals from 25 ethnic groups from 13 states in India across multiple caste groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/scitech/report_indians-are-one-people-descended-from-two-tribes_1292864 |title=Indians are one people descended from two tribes |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study establishes, based on the impossibility of identifying any genetic indicators across caste lines, that castes in South Asia grew out of traditional tribal organizations during the formation of Indian society, and was not the product of any mythical "Aryan Invasion" and "subjugation" of Dravidian people, unlike what British racial-[[revanchist]] and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] claims would have one believe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/india/Aryan-Dravidian-divide-a-myth-Study/articleshow/5053274.cms Aryan-Dravidian divide a myth: Study], [[Times of India]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
Segregation may have existed in early [[Timeline of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon England]], restricting intermarriage and resulting in the displacement of the native [[Brython|British]] population by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] incomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060721-england.html |title=Ancient Britain Had Apartheid-Like Society, Study Suggests |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research led by the [[University College London]], Anglo-Saxon settlers enjoyed substantial social and economic advantages over [[Celt|Celtic Britons]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Mark G. et al.

The [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] were a series of thirty-five acts passed at [[Kilkenny]] in 1366. They forbad the intermarriage between the native Irish and the English settlers in [[Ireland]], the English fostering of Irish children, the English adoption of Irish children and use of Irish names and dress.&lt;ref&gt;Simms, Katherine.

===Jewish segregation===
[[Jew]]s in Europe generally were forced, by decree or by informal pressure, to live in highly segregated [[ghettos]] and [[shtetls]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wirth, Louis]]. ''The Ghetto''. Transaction Publishers (1997), pp. 29–40. ISBN 1560009837.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1204 the [[papacy]] required Jews to segregate themselves from Christians and to wear distinctive clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/projects/margin/jew.htm |title=A Short History of the Jewish Tradition |publisher=.kenyon.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced segregation of Jews spread throughout Europe during the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/232679/ghetto Ghetto]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Russian Empire]], Jews were restricted to the so-called [[Pale of Settlement]], the Western frontier of the Russian Empire corresponding roughly to the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclop&amp;aelig;dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism |title=Anti-Semitism in modern Europe |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, the majority of European Jews lived in the Pale of Settlement.

Jewish population were confined to [[mellah]]s in [[Morocco]] beginning from the 15th century. In cities, a ''mellah'' was surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway. In contrast, rural ''mellahs'' were separate villages inhabited solely by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/017/morocco.html |title=The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G. Bennett |publisher=Sefarad.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the life  of [[History of Jews in Iran|Persian Jews]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town…; for they are considered as unclean creatures…  Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…  For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans…  If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults.  The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him… unmercifully…  If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods… Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)…, he is sure to be murdered."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Tang dynasty China===
Several laws enforcing racial segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed by the [[Han chinese]] during the Tang dynasty. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced [[Uyghur people|Uighurs]] to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from pretending to be Chinese. Chinese disliked Uighurs because they practiced [[usury]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The magristrate who issued the orders may have wanted to protect "purity" in Chinese custom. In 836 Lu Chun was appointed as governor of Canton, he was disgusted to find Chinese living with foreigners and intermarriage between Chinese and foreigners. Lu enforced separation, banning interracial marriages, and made it illegal for foreigners to property. Lu Chun believed his principles were just and upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jqAGIL02BWQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=chinese+uighurs+779+edict+lure+canton+836+foreigners+and+chinese+lu+governor+forbade+marriages+forced+separate&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SOTQTPwQgYGUB5OXibUM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20uighurs%20779%20edict%20lure%20canton%20836%20foreigners%20and%20chinese%20lu%20governor%20forbade%20marriages%20forced%20separate&amp;f=false|title=The golden peaches of Samarkand: a study of Tʻang exotics|author=Edward H.

===Qing dynasty China===
Following their conquest of [[China]] and establishment of the [[Qing]] dynasty in 1644, the [[Manchu]]s were keenly aware of their minority status. During the early eras of their reign, they implemented a strict policy of racial segregation between the Manchus and [[Mongol]]s on the one hand and the [[Han Chinese]] on the other. This ethnic segregation had cultural and economic reasons: intermarriage was forbidden to keep up the Manchurian heritage and minimize sinicization. In addition, in 1668 all Han Chinese were banned from settling in Manchuria (see ''[[Willow Palisade]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~inaasim/Mingqing04/Qing2.htm |title=From Ming to Qing |publisher=Darkwing.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1644, Han men in China had been required to wear a [[queue (hairstyle)|queue]] as a sign of submission to the ruling [[Manchus]]. The penalty for refusal was death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hair: Its Power and Meaning in Asian Cultures|author=Hiltebeitel, Alf et al.|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|year=1998|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of segregation applied directly to the [[Eight Banners|banner]] garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities in which they were stationed. (The Eight Banners formed the basic framework for the Manchu military organization.) Examples as in cities where there were limitations of space, such as in [[Qingzhou]] (青州), a new fortified town was purposely erected to house the Banner garrison and their families.  While the Manchus followed the governmental structure of the preceding [[Ming dynasty]], their ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between Manchu noblemen and Han officials who had passed the highest levels of the [[Imperial examinations|state examinations]].

===Latin America===
Spanish colonists created [[casta|caste systems]] in [[Latin American]] countries based on classification by race and race mixture.  An entire nomenclature developed, including the familiar terms "[[mulatto]]", "[[mestizo]]", and "[[zambo]]" (the latter the origin of "[[sambo (racial term)|sambo]]").  The Spanish had practiced a form of caste system in [[Hispania]] prior to their expulsion of the [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]]. While many Latin American countries have long since rendered the system officially illegal through legislation, usually at the time of independence, [[prejudice]] based on degrees of perceived racial distance from [[Europe]]an ancestry combined with one's socioeconomic status remain, an echo of the colonial caste system.&lt;ref&gt;Soong, Roland. [http://www.zonalatina.com/Zldata55.htm "Racial Classifications in Latin America"], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Howard F., [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8762(197112)76%3A5%3C1626%3ARACILA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-6 "Review"], ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 76, No. 5 (Dec., 1971), 1626-1628.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the early 14th century, some [[guild]]s in the cities of North-East Germany introduced statutes, under which persons of [[Wends|Wend]]ish, i.e. [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]], origin were forbidden from joining the guild.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ifl-leipzig.com/fileadmin/daten/downloads/DOWNLOADCENTER/Publikationen/internationale%20Zusammenfassungen%20Europa%20Regional/2002/Heft2/en.pdf The Situation with the Sorbs in the Past and Present]" (pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilhelm Raabe, ''"down into the eighteenth century no German guild accepted a Wend."''&lt;ref&gt;Raabe, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban of interracial marriage was part of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] enacted by the [[Nazis]] in [[Germany]] against the German [[Jew]]ish community during the 1930s. The laws prohibited marriages between Jews and [[Aryan]] Germans, which were classified as different races.&lt;ref&gt;The Laws for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour (September 15, 1935), section 1. "Marriages between Jews and citizens of German or kindred blood are forbidden. Marriages concluded in defiance of this law are void, even if, for the purpose of evading this law, they were concluded abroad."&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the General Government of occupied [[Poland]] in 1940, the Nazis divided the population into different groups, each with different rights, food rations, allowed housing strips in the cities, public transportation, etc. In an effort to split Polish identity they attempted to establish ethnic divisions of [[Kashubians]] ([[Kaschobenvolk]]), [[Gorals|Highlanders]] ([[Goralenvolk]]), based on their alleged 'Germanic' component.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Jews in Nazi-controlled states were made to wear yellow ribbons or stars of David, and were, along with [[Romani people|Romas]] (Gypsies), discriminated against by the racial laws. Jewish doctors and professors were not allowed to treat Aryan (effectively, [[gentile]]) patients or teach [[Aryan race|Aryan]] pupils, respectively.
The Jews were not allowed to use any public transportation, besides the ferry, and were able to shop only from 3-5 pm in Jewish stores.  After ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' ("The Night of Broken Glass"), the Jews were fined 1,000,000 [[German reichsmark|marks]] for damages done by the Nazi troops and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members.

Jews and Roma were subjected to [[genocide]] as "undesirable" "racial" groups in the [[Holocaust]]. The Nazis established [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939-1944|ghetto]]s to confine Jews and sometimes Romas into tightly packed areas of the cities of [[Eastern Europe]], turning them into ''de-facto'' [[concentration camp]]s. The [[Warsaw Ghetto]] was the largest of these [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939-1944|ghettos]], with 400,000 people.  The [[Ghetto Litzmannstadt]] was the second largest, holding about 160,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/timeline/ghettos.htm |title=Holocaust Timeline: The Ghettos |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date=1939-11-23 |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1939 and 1945, at least 1.5 million [[Poland|Polish]] citizens were transported to the Reich for [[forced labour]] (in all, about 12 million forced laborers were employed in the German war economy inside the [[Nazi Germany]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Marek (nda) |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html |title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |publisher=Dw-world.de |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |title=Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War |publisher=Summeroftruth.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nazi Germany also used forced laborers from [[Western Europe]], [[Poles]], along with other [[Eastern Europe]]ans viewed as racially inferior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm |title=Hitler’s Plans |publisher=Dac.neu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; were subject to deeper discriminatory measures. They were forced to wear identifying red tags with "P"s sewn to their clothing, subjected to a [[curfew]], and banned from [[public transportation]].

While the treatment of factory workers or farm hands often varied depending on the individual employer, Polish laborers as a rule were compelled to work longer hours for lower wages than Western Europeans — in many cities, they were forced to live in segregated barracks behind barbed wire. Social relations with [[Germans]] outside work were forbidden, and sexual relations ("racial defilement") were punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-trc.org/poles.htm |title=Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era |publisher=Holocaust-trc.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In 1938, the [[fascism|fascist]] regime led by [[Benito Mussolini]] introduced a series of laws instituting an official segregationist policy in the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian Empire]], especially aimed against the [[Jew]]s. This policy enforced various segregationist norms, like the prohibition for Jews to teach or study in ordinary schools and universities, to own industries reputed of major national interest, to work as journalists, to enter the military, and to wed non-Jews.
Some of the immediate consequences of the introduction of the 'provvedimenti per la difesa della razza' (norms for the defence of the race) included many of the best Italian scientists leaving their job, or even Italy. Amongst these, world-renowned physicists [[Emilio Segrè]], [[Enrico Fermi]] (whose wife was Jewish), [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], [[Bruno Rossi]], [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], mathematicians [[Federigo Enriques]] and [[Guido Fubini]] and even the fascist propaganda director, art critic and journalist [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was one of Mussolini's mistresses. [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], who would successively win the [[Nobel Prize]] for medicine, was forbidden to work at the university. [[Albert Einstein]], upon approval of the racial law, resigned from honorary membership of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].

Later, [[Fascist Italy]] participated actively in the persecution of the Italian Jews, arresting and handing over tens of thousands of Jews to [[Nazi Germany]]. The persecution of the Jews ended in southern Italy (controlled by the Kingdom of Italy) after the armistice with the Allies (September 8, 1943), while in central and northern Italy (controlled by the [[Italian Social Republic]], a puppet state of Nazi Germany led by Mussolini) the persecution continued until the definitive fall of Mussolini's regime (April 25, 1945).

===Rhodesia===
The British colony of [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]), under [[Ian Smith]], leader of the white minority government, declared unilateral independence in 1965.  For the next 15 years, Rhodesia operated under white minority rule until international sanctions forced Smith to hold multiracial elections, after a brief period of British rule in 1979.

Laws enforcing segregation had been around before 1965, although many institutions simply ignored them. One highly publicized legal battle occurred in 1960 involving the opening of a new [[Reps Theatre|Theatre]] that was to be open to all races, this incident was nicknamed [[Reps Theatre|"The Battle of the Toilets"]].

===Canada===
Racial Segregation in Canada, particularly British Columbia, was widespread during colonial times and continued through the 1950s. Early workplaces were often segregated, with different groups being allowed certain jobs and rates of pay. Fish canneries &amp; coal mines were both highly segregated. In coal mining operations - such as the one at [[Cumberland, British Columbia|Cumberland in Vancouver Island]] - had separate China Towns, "Jap" Towns and white towns. Fish canneries were segregated as well - with separate living areas and jobs for Whites, Japanese, Chinese and First Nations ('Indians'). Non-whites were usually paid less and segregation served to prevent labour solidarity. Following the [[Japanese Canadian internment|internment of the Japanese Canadians during the Second World War]], the Japanese were removed from these systems and more First Nations were hired. In some locations there were whites-only bathrooms and water fountains. At [[Namu, British Columbia|Namu]] Cannery this system existed - though the Japanese were considered 'honourary whites' and allowed to use white bathrooms. In the case of Namu - it was desegregated when a group of First Nations women removed the 'whites-only' signs and took them to the cannery manager in the mid-20th century.

First Nations ('Indian' people) were also prohibited from using the same facilities in transportation - rail cars, accommodations on steamships are two examples. Both First Nations, and Asians were restricted from some professions in the early 20th Century. Indians were also prohibited from entering pool halls or bars, owning logging licences (required to log). The right to vote was granted to Indians in 1960 for federal elections. Other non-white groups acquired voting rights earlier - shortly after World War Two.

Schools were segregated. The last segregated black school ([[Merlin, Ontario]]) was closed in 1965. The last canadian segregated black school ([[Guysborough, Nova Scotia]]) was closed in 1983 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/schoolhouse/008003-2200-e.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

===South Africa===
{{Main|South Africa under apartheid}}

[[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|Apartheid]] was a system which existed in [[South Africa]] for over forty years, although the term itself had a history going back to the 1910s and unofficially before that for many years. It was formalized in the years following the victory of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] in the all-white national election of 1948, increased in dominancy under the rule of Prime Minister [[Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd]] and remained law until 1994.  Examples of apartheid policy introduced are the [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act]], 1951, which made marriage between races illegal.

Apartheid was abolished following a rapid change in public perception of racial segregation throughout the world, and an economic [[boycott]] against South Africa which had crippled and threatened to destroy its economy.

===United States===
{{Main|Racial segregation in the United States}}

After the [[13 Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in America, racial discrimination became regulated by the so called [[Jim Crow laws]], which mandated strict segregation of the races. Though such laws were instituted shortly after fighting ended in many cases, they only became formalized after the end of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-enforced [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] in the 1870s and 80s during a period known as the [[nadir of American race relations]]. This legalized segregation lasted up to the mid 1960s, primarily through the deep and extensive power of [[Southern Democrats]].

[[File:Segregation 1938b.jpg|thumb|left|thumb|An African-American youth at a drinking fountain in [[Halifax, North Carolina]], in 1938.]]
While the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] majority in 1896 ''[[Plessy vs. Ferguson|Plessy]]'' explicitly upheld only "[[separate but equal]]" facilities (specifically, transportation facilities), Justice [[John Marshall Harlan]] in his [[dissenting opinion|dissent]] protested that the decision was an expression of [[white supremacy]]; he predicted that segregation would "stimulate aggressions … upon the admitted rights of colored citizens," "arouse race hate" and "perpetuate a feeling of distrust between [the] races. Feelings between whites and blacks were so tense, even the jails were segregated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040503/fonerkennedy |title=Brown at 50 |publisher=Thenation.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Eric Foner and Randall Kennedy, "Brown at 50", ''The Nation'', posted April 15, 2004 (May 3, 2004 issue)--&gt;

Institutionalized racial segregation was ended as an official practice by the efforts of such [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights]] [[activism|activists]] as [[Clarence Mitchell, Jr.]], [[Rosa Parks]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], working during the period from the end of World War II through the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] supported by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Many of their efforts were acts of [[non-violent]] [[civil disobedience]] aimed at disrupting the enforcement of racial segregation rules and laws, such as refusing to give up a seat in the black part of the bus to a white person ([[Rosa Parks]]), or holding [[sit-in]]s at all-white [[wiktionary:diner|diners]].

By 1968 all forms of segregation had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and by 1970, support for formal legal segregation had dissolved. Formal racial discrimination was illegal in school systems, businesses, the American military, other civil services and the government. Separate bathrooms, water fountains and schools all disappeared and the civil rights movement had the public's support.

Since then, African-Americans have played a significant role as mayors, governors, and state officials in both Southern and Northern states and on the national level have been on the Supreme Court, in the House of Representatives and the Senate, in presidential cabinets, as head of the joint chiefs of staff, and in 2009, the first black [[President of the United States]].

[[Redlining]] is the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/services/psfiles/dp99/dp9913.pdf |title=Racial Discrimination and Redlining in Cities |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; access to health care,&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Race and health]]&lt;/ref&gt;  or even [[supermarkets]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/ptc5hvexthe7wrye/ In poor health: Supermarket redlining and urban nutrition], Elizabeth Eisenhauer, [[GeoJournal]] 	Volume 53, Number 2 / February, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; to residents in certain, often racially determined,&lt;ref name="eastny"&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=TWo8OFJpFtAC How East New York Became a Ghetto] by Walter Thabit. ISBN 0814782671. Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; areas. The most devastating form of redlining, and the most common use of the term, refers to [[Mortgage Discrimination|mortgage discrimination]]. Over the next twenty years, a succession of further court decisions and federal laws, including the ''[[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]]'' and measure to end [[Mortgage Discrimination|mortgage discrimination]] in 1975, would completely invalidate ''[[de jure]]'' racial segregation and discrimination in the U.S., although ''de facto'' segregation and discrimination have proven more resilient.  According to the Civil Rights Project at [[Harvard University]], the actual de facto desegregation of U.S. public schools peaked in the late 1980s; since that time, the schools have, in fact, become more segregated mainly due to the ethnic segregation of the nation with whites dominating the suburbs and minorities the urban centers.

The Supreme Court Cases:
[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] -- 1857, slaves considered not citizens but property

[[Plessy v. Ferguson]] -- 1896, segregation allowed if equal but separate

[[Irene Morgan|Irene Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia]] -- 1946, segregation of races not allowed on motor carriers

[[Sweatt v. Painter]] -- 1950, a university cannot exclude a student due to race

[[Brown v. Board of Education]] of Topeka, [[Kansas]] -- 1954, segregation outlawed in public schools

[[Green v. County School Board of New Kent County]] -- 1968, parents cannot choose a previous all-white or all-black school for children

==Contemporary segregation==
===Canada===
In Canada, the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] tribe of [[Kahnawake]] has been criticized for evicting non-Mohawks from the Mohawk reserve.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=2529314#ixzz0gEyxbZlC&lt;/ref&gt; Mohawks who marry outside of their race lose their right to live in their homelands.&lt;ref name="nationalpost.com"&gt;http://www.nationalpost.com/news/a9/3288607/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/768952--evicting-26-non-natives-splits-reserve | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Richard | last=Brennan | title=Evicting 26 non-natives splits reserve | date=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mohawk government claims that its policy of racially exclusive membership is for the preservation of its identity,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/native+Then+leave+reserve+Mohawks/2515716/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no exemption for those who adopt Mohawk language or culture.&lt;ref name="nationalpost.com"/&gt; The policy is based on a 1981 moratorium which was made law in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvo.org/cfmx/tvoorg/theagenda/index.cfm?page_id=3&amp;action=blog&amp;subaction=viewpost&amp;blog_id=445&amp;post_id=11966&lt;/ref&gt; All interracial couples are sent eviction notices regardless of how long they have lived on the reserve.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt; The only exemption is for interracial couples married before the 1981 moratorium.

Although some concerned Mohawk citizens have contested the racially-exclusive membership policy, the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] has ruled that the Mohawk government may adopt policies it deems necessary to ensure the survival of its people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A long standing practice of segregation has also been imposed upon the commercial salmon fishery in British Columbia since 1992 when separate commercial fisheries were created for select aboriginal groups on three B.C. river systems.  Canadians of other races who fish in the separate fisheries have been arrested, jailed and prosecuted.  Although the fishermen who were prosecuted were successful at trial (see the decision in R. v. Kapp,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/judgments/pc/2003/02/p03_0279.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the decision was overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/sc/04/09/2004bcsc0958.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On final appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favour of the program on the grounds that segregation of this workplace is a step towards equality in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2008/2008scc41/2008scc41.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Affirmative action programs in Canada are protected from equality rights challenges by s. 15(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The segregation continues today though more than 35 percent of the fishermen in the B.C. commercial fishery are of aboriginal ancestry, yet Canadians of aboriginal ancestry comprise less than 4 percent of B.C.'s population.

Some activists consider that the [[Indian caste system]] is a form of [[racial discrimination]].&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/programs/specials/racism/010828.caste.html |title=An Untouchable Subject? |publisher=Npr.org |date=2001-08-29 |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants of the [[United Nations]] Conference Against Racism in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]] in March 2001, condemned discrimination due to the caste system, and tried to pass a resolution declaring that caste as a basis for the segregation and oppression of peoples in terms of their descent and occupation is a form of [[apartheid]]. However, no formal resolution was passed to that effect&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.ca/racism/Submitted/Theme/castedeclaration.shtml Final Declaration of the Global Conference Against Racism and Caste-based Discrimination]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such allegations have also been rejected by many sociologists such as [[Andre Béteille]], who writes that treating caste as a form of racism is "politically mischievous" and worse, "scientifically nonsense" since there is no discernible difference in the racial characteristics between [[Brahmins]] and [[Scheduled Castes]]. He writes that "Every social group cannot be regarded as a race simply because we want to protect it against prejudice and discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcar.alrc.net/mainfile2.php/For+the+negative/14/ Race and caste] by [[Andre Beteille]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pakistan]]i-American sociologist [[Ayesha Jalal]] also rejects these allegations. In her book, "Democracy and Authoritarianism in [[South Asia]]", she writes that "As for [[Hinduism]], the hierarchical principles of the [[Brahmin|Brahmanical]] social order have always been contested from within Hindu society, suggesting that equality has been and continues to be both [[Hindu reform movements|valued and practiced]]."&lt;ref&gt;A.

There was racial segregation in life back then because white people did not like the Asian and black people having the same equal rights as they did because they thought that they were more powerful and better than them. As a result of this, they were extremely racist and didn’t allow black to have even simple rights such as owning their own land, having any marriages between white and black people and not even letting a black person on the buses.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies in San Francisco showed that groups of homeowners of all races tended to self-segregate in order to be with people of the same education level and race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20070910/sc_livescience/homeownersselfsegregatebyraceandeducation;_ylt=AlyjmsI5BA7s..hPZgWKnT0DW7oF ''Homeowners self segregate by race and education'' AP News 2007-09-10]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, the legal barriers enforcing segregation had been mostly replaced by decentralized racism, where whites pay more than blacks to live in predominantly white areas.&lt;ref name="vigdor"&gt;..&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many whites are willing, and are able, to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood. Equivalent housing in white areas commands a higher rent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kiel K.A., Zabel J.E. |title=Housing Price Differentials in U.S. Cities: Household and Neighborhood Racial Effects |journal=Journal of Housing Economics |volume=5 |year=1996 |page=143 |doi=10.1006/jhec.1996.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By bidding up the price of housing, many white neighborhoods effectively shut out blacks, because blacks are unwilling, or unable, to pay the premium to buy entry into these expensive neighborhoods. Conversely, equivalent housing in black neighborhoods is far more affordable to those who are unable or unwilling to pay a premium to live in white neighborhoods. Through the 1990s, residential segregation remained at its extreme and has been called "[[hypersegregation]]" by some sociologists or "American Apartheid"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Massey D.S., Denton N. A. |title=American Apartheid. |place=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in ''Johnson v. California'' {{ussc|125|1141|2005}} that the [[California]] Department of Corrections' unwritten practice of racially segregating prisoners in its prison reception centers — which California claimed was for inmate safety (gangs in California, as throughout the U.S., usually organize on racial lines)— is to be subject to [[strict scrutiny]], the highest level of constitutional review.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Sociologists in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s long studied the impact of racial segregation in California, the nation's most populous and racially diverse state not known for customary segregation the Southeast US was infamous. (See also [[Demographics of California]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A socially liberal, but racially divided state can have softer prevalent forms of racial segregated communities populated of nearly all whites, blacks, Asian-Americans, and Hispanics (of any race, an ethnic designation) brought upon by economic changes, housing integration, white flight and immigration (in the case of Mexican and Latin American) in California.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} For examples, South L.A. and west Oakland are a majority (or plurally) black, East Los Angeles is predominantly [[Mexican American]] and San Francisco has strictly [[Chinese American]] neighborhoods.
