The term was first coined  in 1990 in an article in ''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeune Afrique Economie]]'' by Francophone Congolese author [[Sony Lab'ou Tansi]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=African literature : an anthology of criticism and theory |last=Tansi |first=Sony Labou |date=2007 |publisher=Blackwell Pub |isbn=978-1405112017 |location=Malden, MA |pages=54–60 |chapter=An Open Letter to Africans c/o The Punic One Party State |oclc=71173671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sony Labou Tansi, "Lettre aux Africains... sous couvert du parti punique," ''Jeune Afrique Economie 1''36 (1990): 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and [[intellectual]] [[Frank B. Wilderson III]] developed the term in his political [[memoir]], ''Incognegro: A Memoir of Exile and Apartheid'', about his time spent teaching and participating in the [[African National Congress]] in [[South Africa]] during [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Incognegro|pages=96–146|year=2015|chapter=3|publisher=Duke University Press|doi=10.1215/9780822374985-003|isbn=9780822374985}} archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20160810162506/https://www.dukeupress.edu/incognegro&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Tansi, "Afro-pessimism [is] a terrible word used to conceal the greatest mess of all time," which is the "tragedy" that Africa's position "dooms us to construct and build garbage economies in the depths of the most cruel, unbearable, and inhuman form of indignity that humans can swallow" (as translated by John Conteh-Morgan).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Wilderson, along with [[Achille Mbembe]], [[Jared Sexton]], D. S. Marriott, Christina Sharpe, and others who have contributed to afro-pessimist thought, cite the [[Martinique|Martinician]] psychiatrist, philosopher, and writer [[Frantz Fanon]] as a foundational figure in the tradition of Afro-pessimism. 

Afro-pessimism has been constructed in many ways and with different aims. But Afro-pessimism is chiefly approached as a [[wikt:transcendence|transcendent]]{{Clarify|date=July 2019}} position, not as a negative or disaffected political attitude in the sense that [[pessimism]] might seemingly connote. The Black radical tradition has drawn upon the term as a way to acknowledge the power, depth, and vitality of the resilience and radical imagination of people of [[African descent]]. Within this same critique, some have used Afro-pessimism to articulate the subject-position of renunciation, refusal, distancing, dread, doubt and abjection in response to the historical [[Psychological trauma|traumas]] and ongoing effects of colonialism. This includes the view that dismantling [[white supremacy]] would mean dismantling many of the social and political institutions of the [[modern world]].

Interest in the concept of Afro-pessimism has manifested in [[online]] discussions and in Afro-pessimist approaches to art, [[poetics]], and [[computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sexton|first1=Jared|title=Afro-Pessimism:The Unclear Word|journal=Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge|date=2016|issue=29|url=http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|issn=1555-9998|doi=10.20415/rhiz/029.e02|doi-access=free|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907061732/http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|archive-date=2017-09-07|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pan-Africanism ==
Afro-pessimist ideas have been part of ongoing conversations about [[pan-African]] identity, as an inclusionary concept of blackness among all people of African descent.&lt;ref name="Nothias"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-African thought has drawn attention to the shared racial identity and also the particulars of the expression of African identity among the [[African Diaspora]] and peoples on the [[Africa|African continent]]. Pan-African thought has analyzed the ongoing struggles of African peoples, and the power of [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentricity]] as a move away from the colonialism and violence of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentricity]]. The writings of [[Frantz Fanon]], a [[Martinique|Martinican]] psychiatrist, intellectual, and revolutionary, reflect pan-African and Afro-pessimistic approaches to decolonization and black liberation. 

=== Négritude ===
The [[Pan-African]] movement [[négritude]] represents pessimism as a kind of realist recognition of the historical traumas of colonialism, from an [[existentialist]] position. A key figure in the movement, [[Aimé Césaire]], uses pessimism to consider transcendence and a recognition of the breadth of the cultural imagination and perseverance of people of African descent.

==In international relations theory==
Afro-pessimism has also been employed as a term describing a narrative in Western media and International relations theory that portrays [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] Africa as unlikely to achieve economic growth and democratic governance. This use of Afro-pessimism has nothing to with Wilderson's definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilderson|first1=Frank|title=Red, White &amp; Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0-8223-4692-0|page=346|oclc=457770963}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of Afro-pessimism has been criticized as a Western construct regarding the ongoing portrayal of Africa and African people in Western media, overwhelmingly in terms of tragedy, doom, victimization, and victim-hood.&lt;ref name="de B'eberi and Louw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de B’béri |first1=Boulou Ebanda |last2=Louw |first2=P.

In this way the media tends to victimize and exoticize Africa for its ongoing struggles with poverty, health crises, famine, and lack of modern development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bassil |first1=Noah R. |title=The roots of Afropessimism: the British invention of the 'dark continent.' |journal=Critical Arts: South-North Cultural and Media Studies |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=2011-10-13 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=377–396 |issn=0256-0046 |doi=10.1080/02560046.2011.615141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victimization is then visible in [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] and development projects, which sometimes use the language of "saving" African people from such "humanitarian disasters".&lt;ref name="Nothias"/&gt;
