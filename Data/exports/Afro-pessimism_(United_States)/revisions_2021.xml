'''Afro-pessimism''' is a critical framework that describes the ongoing effects of [[racism]], [[colonialism]], and historical processes of [[Slavery in the United States|enslavement]] including the [[Atlantic slave trade|trans-Atlantic slave trade]] and their impact on structural conditions as well as the personal, subjective, and lived experience and [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] reality of [[African Americans]]. It is particularly applicable to U.S. contexts. According to the 2018 [https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780190280024/obo-9780190280024-0056.xml Oxford Bibliography entry on Afro-pessimism] written by Patrice Douglass, Selamawit D. Terrefe, and [[Frank B. Wilderson III]], Afro-pessimism can be understood as “a lens of interpretation that accounts for civil society’s dependence on anti-black violence—a regime of violence that positions black people as internal enemies of civil society.” This violence, they argue, “cannot be analogized with the regimes of violence that disciplines the Marxist subaltern, the postcolonial subaltern, the colored but nonblack Western immigrant, the nonblack queer, or the nonblack woman.” According to Wilderson, the scholar who coined the term as it functions most popularly today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cunningham |first1=Vinson |title=The Argument of "Afropessimism" |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/07/20/the-argument-of-afropessimism |website=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afro-pessimism theorizes blackness as a position of, using the language of scholar [[Saidiya Hartman]], "accumulation and fungibility"; that is, as a condition of—or relation to—ontological death, as opposed to a cultural identity or human subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hartman |first1=Saidiya |title=Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth Century America. |date=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jared Sexton locates the foundational thread of Afro-pessimism in the "motive force of a singular ''wish'' inherited in no small part from black women's traditions of analysis, interpretation, invention, and survival."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sexton|first=Jared|date=2016|title=Afro-Pessimism: The Unclear Word|url=https://doi.org/10.20415/rhiz/029.e02|journal=Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge|issue=29|doi=10.20415/rhiz/029.e02|issn=1555-9998|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As opposed to humanist anthropologists, historians, sociologists, and political scientists who engage the history of black subjectivity as one of entrenched political discrimination and social ostracization, Afro-pessimists across disciplines have argued that Black people are constitutively excluded from the category of the self-possessing, rights-bearing human being of [[modernity]]. As Wilderson writes, “Blacks do not function as political subjects; instead, our flesh and energies are instrumentalized for postcolonial, immigrant, LGBT, and workers’ agendas.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilderson III. |first1=Frank |title=Afro-Pessimism and the End of Redemption |url=https://humanitiesfutures.org/papers/afro-pessimism-end-redemption/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and influences ==
Wilderson has cited the work of [[Saidiya Hartman]], [[Joy James]], [[Christina Sharpe]], [[Sylvia Wynter]], [[Hortense Spillers]], [[Zakkiyah Iman Jackson]], and [[Achille Mbembe]] as influences and predecessors of the framework, although not of all these scholars agree with such characterization of their own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Nsele|first=Zamansele|date=2020-07-02|title=Part III: Afropessimism and rituals of anti-Black violence|url=https://mg.co.za/friday/2020-07-02-part-iii-afropessimism-and-rituals-of-anti-black-violence/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-04|website=The Mail &amp; Guardian|language=en-ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartman|first=Saidiya V.|date=2003|title=The Position of the Unthought|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20686156|journal=[[Qui Parle]]|volume=13 (2)|pages=183-201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe has named [[Dionne Brand]], particularly her 2001 work ''A Map to the Door of No Return: Notes to Belonging'', as writing in conversation with the concepts of Afro-pessimism by "mapping and creating a language for thinking, for articulating black (social) life lived alongside, under, and in the midst of the ordinary and extraordinary terror of enforced black social death."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sharpe|first=Christina|date=2012-05-15|title=Response to 'Ante-Anti-Blackness'|url=https://csalateral.org/section/theory/ante-anti-blackness-response-sharpe/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-04|website=Lateral|publisher=Cultural Studies Association|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts have traced similar lines of thinking to [[Frantz Fanon]] and 20th century [[Black Power movement|black revolutionary movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Racked &amp; Dispatched|url=https://archive.org/details/AfroPessimismread|title=Afro-Pessimism: An Introduction|date=2017|pages=7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in the late 20th century, scholars including [[Cornel West]], [[Derrick Bell]], and [[Lewis Gordon]] developed concepts of antagonism and abjection that bear similarities to components of Afro-pessimism, but without reaching the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Jesse|date=July 20, 2020|title=On Afropessimism|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/on-afropessimism/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-03-04|website=Los Angeles Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Orlando Patterson]]'s ''Slavery and Social Death'' forms a theoretical point of departure for almost all strands of Afro-pessimism. In an interview of the Kerner Report, Patterson had this to say about Afro-pessimism: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We’re going through a period of extreme despair about the situation of African-Americans. The most extreme form of this despair is a movement called Afro-pessimism, which holds that Black Americans are still viewed as they were viewed in the slavery days as different, inferior, and as outsiders.

I find myself in an odd situation because the Afro-pessimists draw heavily on one of my books, “Slavery and Social Death,” which is ironic, because I’m not a pessimist. I don’t think we’re in a situation of social death, because one of the elements of social death is that you’re not recognized as an integral member of the civic community, the public sphere, and we certainly are, on the political and cultural levels. And we’re very integrated in the military, which is the quintessence of what defines who belongs. The Afro-pessimists are right, though, to point to persisting segregation in the private sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mineo |first1=Liz |title=The Kerner Report on race, 50 years on |url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/03/harvard-professor-reflects-on-the-kerner-report-50-years-on/ |website=The Harvard Gazette |access-date=26 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
