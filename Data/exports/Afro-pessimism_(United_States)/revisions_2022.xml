'''Afro-pessimism''' is a critical framework that describes the ongoing effects of [[racism]], [[colonialism]], and historical processes of [[enslavement in the United States]], including the trans-[[Atlantic slave trade]] and their impact on structural conditions as well as the personal, subjective, and lived experience and [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] reality of [[African Americans]]; it is particularly applicable to U.S. contexts. According to the 2018 [[Oxford Bibliography]] entry on Afro-pessimism written by Patrice Douglass, Selamawit D. Terrefe, and [[Frank B. Wilderson III]], Afro-pessimism can be understood as "a lens of interpretation that accounts for civil society's dependence on anti-black violence—a regime of violence that positions black people as internal enemies of civil society". They argue this violence "cannot be analogized with the regimes of violence that disciplines the Marxist subaltern, the postcolonial subaltern, the colored but nonblack Western immigrant, the nonblack queer, or the nonblack woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Douglass|first1=Patrice|last2=Terrefe|first2=Selamawit D.|last3=Wilderson III|first3=Frank B.|date=28 August 2018|url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780190280024/obo-9780190280024-0056.xml|title=Afro-Pessimism|website=Oxford Bibliographies Online|doi=10.1093/OBO/9780190280024-0056|access-date=14 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilderson, the scholar who coined the term as it functions most popularly today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Cunningham|first=Vinson|date=10 July 2020|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/07/20/the-argument-of-afropessimism|title=The Argument of 'Afropessimism'|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=14 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;Afro-pessimism theorizes blackness as a position of, using the language of scholar [[Saidiya Hartman]], "accumulation and fungibility", that is as a condition of, or relation to, ontological death, as opposed to a cultural identity or human subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartman|first=Saidiya|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqr4H0sqEPYC|title=Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth Century America|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195089837|access-date=14 June 2022|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jared Sexton locates the foundational thread of Afro-pessimism in the "motive force of a singular ''wish'' inherited in no small part from black women's traditions of analysis, interpretation, invention, and survival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sexton|first=Jared|date=2016|title=Afro-Pessimism: The Unclear Word|journal=Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge|issue=29|doi=10.20415/rhiz/029.e02|doi-access=free|issn=1555-9998}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to humanist anthropologists, historians, sociologists, and political scientists who engage the history of black subjectivity as one of entrenched political discrimination and social ostracization, Afro-pessimists across disciplines have argued that Black people are constitutively excluded from the category of the self-possessing, rights-bearing human being of [[modernity]]. Wilderson writes that "Blacks do not function as political subjects; instead, our flesh and energies are instrumentalized for postcolonial, immigrant, LGBT, and workers' agendas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilderson III|first=Frank B.|date=25 May 2017|url=https://humanitiesfutures.org/papers/afro-pessimism-end-redemption/|title=Afro-Pessimism and the End of Redemption|publisher=Humanities Futures|access-date=14 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and influences ==
Wilderson has cited the work of [[Saidiya Hartman]], [[Zakiyyah Iman Jackson]], [[Joy James]], [[Achille Mbembe]], [[Christina Sharpe]], [[Hortense Spillers]], and [[Sylvia Wynter]] as influences and predecessors of the framework, although not of all these scholars agree with such characterization of their own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartman|first=Saidiya V.|date=2003|title=The Position of the Unthought|journal=Qui Parle|publisher=Duke University Press|volume=13|issue=2|pages=183–201|doi=10.1215/quiparle.13.2.183|jstor=20686156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nsele|first=Zamansele|date=2 July 2020|url=https://mg.co.za/friday/2020-07-02-part-iii-afropessimism-and-rituals-of-anti-black-violence/|url-status=live|title=Part III: Afropessimism and rituals of anti-Black violence|newspaper=The Mail &amp; Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200704164146/https://mg.co.za/friday/2020-07-02-part-iii-afropessimism-and-rituals-of-anti-black-violence/|archive-date=4 July 2020|access-date=14 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpe has named [[Dionne Brand]], particularly her 2001 work ''A Map to the Door of No Return: Notes to Belonging'', as writing in conversation with the concepts of Afro-pessimism by "mapping and creating a language for thinking, for articulating black (social) life lived alongside, under, and in the midst of the ordinary and extraordinary terror of enforced black social death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharpe|first=Christina|date=15 May 2012|url=https://csalateral.org/section/theory/ante-anti-blackness-response-sharpe/|url-status=live|title=Response to 'Ante-Anti-Blackness'|website=Lateral|publisher=Cultural Studies Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104070524/http://csalateral.org/section/theory/ante-anti-blackness-response-sharpe/|archive-date=4 January 2019|access-date=14 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other accounts have traced similar lines of thinking to [[Frantz Fanon]] and 20th-century black revolutionary movements, such as the [[Black Power movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Wilderson III|editor-first=Frank B.|year=2017|url=https://archive.org/details/AfroPessimismread|title=Afro-Pessimism: An Introduction|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|publisher=Racked &amp; Dispatched|pages=7–8|access-date=14 June 2022|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, scholars including [[Derrick Bell]], [[Lewis Gordon]], and [[Cornel West]] developed concepts of antagonism and abjection that bear similarities to components of Afro-pessimism but without reaching the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=McCarthy|first=Jesse|date=20 July 2020|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/on-afropessimism/|url-status=live|title=On Afropessimism|magazine=Los Angeles Review of Books|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200721113157/https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/on-afropessimism/|archive-date=21 July 2020|access-date=14 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Orlando Patterson]]'s book ''Slavery and Social Death'', first published in 1982, forms a theoretical point of departure for almost all strands of Afro-pessimism. In a 2018 interview on the [[Kerner Report]], Patterson had this to say about Afro-pessimism: "We're going through a period of extreme despair about the situation of African-Americans. The most extreme form of this despair is a movement called Afro-pessimism, which holds that Black Americans are still viewed as they were viewed in the slavery days as different, inferior, and as outsiders. I find myself in an odd situation because the Afro-pessimists draw heavily on one of my books, 'Slavery and Social Death,' which is ironic, because I'm not a pessimist. I don’t think we're in a situation of social death, because one of the elements of social death is that you're not recognized as an integral member of the civic community, the public sphere, and we certainly are, on the political and cultural levels. And we're very integrated in the military, which is the quintessence of what defines who belongs. The Afro-pessimists are right, though, to point to persisting segregation in the private sphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mineo|first=Liz|date=21 March 2018|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/03/harvard-professor-reflects-on-the-kerner-report-50-years-on/|title=The Kerner Report on race, 50 years on|newspaper=The Harvard Gazette|access-date=14 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;
