'''Allophilia''' is having a positive attitude for a group that is not one's own. The term derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] words meaning "liking or love of the other".&lt;ref&gt;Pittinsky, T. L. (2010). A two-dimensional theory of intergroup leadership: The case of national diversity. American Psychologist, 65(3), 194-200.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a framework for understanding effective intergroup leadership and is conceptualized as a measurable state of mind with tangible consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Allophilia—a new framework for understanding effective intergroup leadership |author= Todd Pittinsky|url= http://www.centerforpublicleadership.org/?option=com_content&amp;task=emailform&amp;id=267&amp;itemid=2|newspaper= [[Center for Public Leadership]], [[Harvard Kennedy School]] |date= |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Positive prejudice: Really loving your neighbour |author= |url= http://www.economist.com/node/8859092 |newspaper= [[The Economist]]|date= 15 March 2007 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "allophilia" was coined by [[Harvard]] professor Todd L. Pittinsky in 2006, after he was unable to find an antonym for prejudice in any dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Otherly Love: The Law of Dissimilars|author= Ashley Pettus|url= http://harvardmagazine.com/2006/01/the-law-of-dissimilars.html|newspaper= [[Harvard Magazine]] |date=January 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studied by [[social scientists]], allophilia is the antonym of negative [[prejudice]]s and the antonym of a host of "–isms": [[ageism]], [[sexism]], [[genderism]], [[discrimination towards non-binary gender persons|binarism]], [[racism]], [[speciesism]], [[heterosexism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[elitism]]/[[classism]], etc.; "-phobias": [[homophobia]], [[heterophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], [[biphobia]], [[transphobia]], [[effeminacy|effeminiphobia]], [[sissy]]phobia, [[ephebiphobia]], [[gerontophobia]], [[pedophobia]], [[surdophobia]],  [[islamophobia]], [[xenophobia]], etc.; and "anti-s":  [[anti-communism]], [[discrimination against the homeless|anti-homelessness]], [[anti-intellectualism]], [[bias against left-handed people|anti-left handedness]], etc. Allophilia can be felt towards members of a different [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sex]], [[ageing|age]], [[species]], [[gender role|gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[religion]], [[social status]], [[disability]], [[Social class|class]], [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[political party]], [[school]], [[team]], or workplace.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Allophilia has five statistical factors:
# affection,
# comfort,
# engagement,
# enthusiasm,
# kinship.

The Allophilia Scale measures each of these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Allophilia: Beyond tolerance lies true respect|author= Sheema Khan|url= http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/allophilia-beyond-tolerance-lies-true-respect/article9130024/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittinsky, T. L., Rosenthal, S. A., &amp; Montoya, R. M. (2010). Measuring positive attitudes toward outgroups: Development and Validation of the Allophilia Scale. In L. Tropp &amp; R. Mallett (Eds.), Beyond Prejudice Reduction: Pathways to Positive Intergroup Relations. Washington, D. C.: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical remedy for [[prejudice]] is to bring conflicting groups into a state of tolerance. However, tolerance is not the logical antithesis of prejudice, but rather is the midpoint between negative feelings and positive feelings toward others. Allophilia enhancement should serve as complement to prejudice reduction.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;Pittinsky, T. L., &amp; Montoya, R. M. (2009). Symhedonia in intergroup relations: The relationship of empathic joy to prejudice and allophilia. Psicologia Sociale, 3, 347–364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittinsky, T. L. (2009). Allophilia: Moving beyond tolerance in the classroom. Childhood Education, 85(4), 212–215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittinsky, T. L. (2009). Look both ways. Phi Delta Kappan, 90(5), 363–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, [[mudita|symhedonia]] (experiencing empathic joy) has been shown to be more closely associated with allophilia, while sympathy (experiencing empathic sorrow) has been shown to be more strongly associated with prejudice.&lt;ref name="ref3"/&gt;
