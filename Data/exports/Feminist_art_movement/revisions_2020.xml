{{Feminism sidebar}}
The '''feminist art movement''' refers to the efforts and accomplishments of [[feminism|feminists]] internationally to produce [[feminist art|art that reflects women's lives and experiences]], as well as to change the foundation for the production and reception of contemporary art. It also sought to bring more visibility to women within [[art history]] and art practice. By a way it is expressed to visualize the inner thoughts of the feminist movement to show for everyone and give meaning in art. It helps constructs the role to those who continue to undermine the mainstream (and often masculine) narrative of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://canvas.saatchiart.com/art/art-history-101/what-is-feminist-art|title=What is Feminist Art?|last=Kennedy|first=Victoria|date=July 19, 2017|website=canvas.saatchiart.com|access-date=March 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding with general developments within [[feminism]], and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s as an outgrowth of the so-called [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]]. It has been called "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/20/AR2007042000400.html Jeremy Strick], director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in the ''Washington Post'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 1960s was a period when women artists wanted to gain equal rights with men within the established art world, and to create [[feminist art]], often in non-traditional ways, to help "change the world."&lt;ref name="Art Story"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-feminist-art.htm# | title=Feminist art movement | publisher=The Art Story Foundation | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louise Bourgeois]] (1911-2010) and German-American [[Eva Hesse]] (1936-1970) were some early feminist artists.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

On 20 July 1964 [[Yoko Ono]], a [[Fluxus]], avant-garde artist, singer, and activist, presented ''Cut Piece'' at the Yamaichi Concert Hall, Kyoto, Japan where she sat still as parts of her clothing were cut off of her, which meant to protest violence against women. She performed it again at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="CBS Yoko Ono"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/crowd-cuts-yoko-onos-clothing-off/ | title=Crowd Cuts Yoko Ono's Clothing Off | work=CBS News | date=16 October 2003 | accessdate=12 January 2014 | author=Jarett Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son, Sean, participated in the artist performance on 15 September 2013 at the Théâtre le Ranelagh in Paris.  ''[[The Guardian]]'''s Jonathan Jones considered it "one of the 10 most shocking performance artworks ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/11/scrotum-top-10-shocking-performance-art | title=The 10 most shocking performance artworks ever | publisher=The Guardian | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=12 January 2014 | author=Jonathan Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Beth Edelson]]'s ''Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper'' (1972) appropriated [[Leonardo da Vinci]]’s ''The Last Supper'', with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. Benglis was among those notable women artists. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became "one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement."&lt;ref name="Frost Art Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drawingproject.frostartmuseum.org/mary-beth-edelson/|title=Mary Beth Edelson|work=The Frost Art Museum Drawing Project|accessdate=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clara - Edelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clara.nmwa.org/index.php?g=entity_detail&amp;entity_id=1321|title=Mary Beth Adelson|work=Clara - Database of Women Artists|publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=10 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110213429/http://clara.nmwa.org/index.php?g=entity_detail&amp;entity_id=1321|archive-date=10 January 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women artists, motivated by [[feminist theory]] and the [[feminist movement]], began the feminist art movement in the 1970s. Feminist art represented a shift away from [[modernism]], where art made by women was put in a different class to works made by men. The movement cultivated a new feminist consciousness, a "freedom to respond to life... [Unimpeded] by traditional male mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;Deoritha Anne Waters, Three Feminist Perspectives on Visual Media: Influences of the Second Wave Feminist Movement on Women’s Art Education and Their Lives as Artists, ed. Deoritha Anne Waters (Michigan: ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2014), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Or, as Griselda Pollock and Roszika Parker put it—a separation of Art with a capital "A" from art made by women produced a "feminine stereotype".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roszika Parker|author2=Griselda Pollock| title=Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideology |publisher=Pandora, RKP|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Dinner Party]] by [[Judy Chicago]], an art installation symbolically representing [[women’s history]], is widely considered the first epic feminist artwork.&lt;ref name="Gerhard2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane F. Gerhard|title=The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and the Power of Popular Feminism, 1970-2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xG_kD43EDP0C&amp;pg=PA221|date=1 June 2013|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-3675-6|pages=221–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This demand for equality in representation was codified in the [[Art Workers' Coalition]]'s (AWC) Statement of Demands, which was developed in 1969 and published in definitive form in March 1970. The AWC was set up to defend the rights of artists and force museums and galleries to reform their practices. While the coalition sprung up as a protest movement following Greek kinetic sculptor [[Panayiotis Vassilakis|Panagiotis "Takis" Vassilakis]]'s physical removal of his work Tele-Sculpture(1960) from a 1969 exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, it quickly issued a broad list of demands to 'art museums in general'.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Alongside calls for free admission, better representation of ethnic minorities, late openings and an agreement that galleries would not exhibit an artwork without the artist's consent, the AWC also demanded that museums 'encourage female artists to overcome centuries of damage done to the image of the female as an artist by establishing equal representation of the sexes in exhibitions, museum purchases and on selection committees'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Charles|title=Art in theory|url=https://archive.org/details/arttheoryantholo00harr|url-access=limited|date=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0-631-16575-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/arttheoryantholo00harr/page/n922 901]–2|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also feminist forms of [[postmodernism]] which emerged in the 1980s. The feminist art movement grew out of the struggle to find a new way to express sexual, material, social and political aspects of life, and femininity.&lt;ref name="Kramarae pp. 92-93"&gt;Entry on feminist art practice by Katy Deepwell in {{cite book|editor1=Cheris Kramarae|editor2=Dale Spender|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfrzBcycB-4C&amp;pg=PA92|date=1 December 2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-92088-9|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist art movements emerged in [[Feminist art movement in the United States|the United States]];  Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gislind Nabakowski|author2=Peter Gorsen|author3=Sander Helke| title=Frauen in der Kunst(2 Vols.)|publisher=Frankfurt,Suhrkamp|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Spain;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mav.org.es/cronologiaMAV/cronologia.html |title=Mujeres en les Artes Visuales, Women in the Visual Arts, Spanish chronology |access-date=2014-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221182157/http://www.mav.org.es/cronologiaMAV/cronologia.html |archive-date=2014-02-21 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian feminist art timeline|Australia]]; Canada;&lt;ref&gt;Marie  Rose Arbour  ''Art et Feminisme'' Exhibition catalogue.

The women's art movements spread world-wide in the latter half of the 20th century, including Sweden, Denmark and Norway, Russia, and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Hindsbo, Karen. ''The Beginning is Always Today: Scandinavian feminist art from the last 20 years''.

Japan, Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Women artists from Asia, Africa and particularly Eastern Europe emerged in large numbers onto the international art scene in the late 1980s and 1990s as [[contemporary art]] became popular worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erstestiftung.org/gender-check/ Gender Check: Masculinity and Femininity in the Art in Eastern Europe],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huangfu, Binghui.(ed).''Text and Sub-Text''(Singapore: Lasalle-SIA University, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dike, Paul Chike and Oyelola, Patricia. ''Nigerian Women in Visual Art''. National Gallery of Art, Lagos, Nigeria, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Major exhibitions of contemporary women artists include ''[[WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution]]'' curated by Connie Butler, SF MOMA, 2007, ''Global Feminisms'' curated by [[Linda Nochlin]] and Maura Reilly at the Brooklyn Museum, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/global_feminisms/  Global Feminisms]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rebelle'', curated by Mirjam Westen at MMKA, Arnheim, 2009, ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang! 45 Years of Art and Feminism'' curated by Xavier Arakistan at Bilbao Fine Arts Museum, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museobilbao.com/in/exposiciones/kiss-kiss-bang-bang-89 Kiss Kiss Bang Bang! 45 Years of Art and Feminism]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Elles at Centre Pompidou'' in Paris (2009-2011), which also toured to Seattle Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattleartmuseum.org/elles/elles_pompidou.html Elles Pompidou.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317230302/http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/elles/elles_pompidou.html |date=2014-03-17 }} Seattle Art Museum&lt;/ref&gt; have been increasingly international in their selection. This shift is also reflected in journals set up in the 1990s like ''[[n.paradoxa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Connor, Maureen|title=Working Notes: Conversation with Katy Deepwell|journal=Art Journal|volume=61|number=2|date=Summer 2002|jstor=778180|pages=32–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
