In November 2017, the hashtag #ChurchToo was started by Emily Joy and Hannah Paasch on Twitter and began trending in response to #MeToo as a way to try to highlight and stop sexual abuse that happens in a church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5034546/me-too-church-too-sexual-abuse/|title=#ChurchToo Urges Twitter Users to Address Abuse at Church|website=Time (magazine)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231215602/http://time.com/5034546/me-too-church-too-sexual-abuse/|archivedate=December 31, 2017|deadurl=no|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-abuse-churchtoo_us_5a205b30e4b03350e0b53131|title=Sexual Abuse Happens In #ChurchToo – We're Living Proof|last=Paasch|first=Hannah|date=December 4, 2017|website=HuffPost|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206053924/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-abuse-churchtoo_us_5a205b30e4b03350e0b53131|archivedate=December 6, 2017|deadurl=no|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early January 2018, about a hundred evangelical women also launched #SilenceIsNotSpiritual to call for changes to how sexual misconduct is dealt within the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-silence-breakers-a-kairos-moment-for-the-church_us_5a4bb0b3e4b0d86c803c79a7|title=The Silence Breakers: A Kairos Moment for the Church|last=James|first=Carolyn Custis|date=January 3, 2018|website=HuffPost|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125143503/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-silence-breakers-a-kairos-moment-for-the-church_us_5a4bb0b3e4b0d86c803c79a7|archivedate=January 25, 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2017/december/women-speak-up-in-silenceisnotspiritual-campaign.html|title=Women Speak Up in #SilenceIsNotSpiritual Campaign|website=CT Women|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224105550/http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2017/december/women-speak-up-in-silenceisnotspiritual-campaign.html|archivedate=December 24, 2017|deadurl=no|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; #ChurchToo started spreading again virally later in January 2018 in response to a live-streamed video admission by Pastor Andy Savage to his church that he sexually assaulted a 17-year-old girl twenty years before as a youth pastor while driving her home, but then received applause by his church for admitting to the incident and asking for forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religiondispatches.org/churchtoo-apology-of-evangelical-pastor-accused-of-sexual-assault-shows-why-sorry-isnt-enough/|title=#Churchtoo: Apology of Evangelical Pastor Accused of Sexual Assault Shows Why Sorry Isn't Enough|date=January 16, 2018|website=Religion Dispatches|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118132037/http://religiondispatches.org/churchtoo-apology-of-evangelical-pastor-accused-of-sexual-assault-shows-why-sorry-isnt-enough/|archivedate=January 18, 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krvs.org/post/amid-metoo-evangelicals-grapple-misconduct-churchtoo|title=Amid #MeToo, Evangelicals Grapple With Misconduct in Their Own Churches|last=Gjelten|first=Tom|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125143503/http://krvs.org/post/amid-metoo-evangelicals-grapple-misconduct-churchtoo|archivedate=January 25, 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.getreligion.org/getreligion/2018/1/12/big-coverage-of-memphis-pastor-and-woman-he-assaulted-provides-perfect-churchtoo-hook|title=Big coverage of Memphis pastor and woman he assaulted provides perfect #ChurchToo hook|website=GetReligion|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112185710/https://www.getreligion.org/getreligion/2018/1/12/big-coverage-of-memphis-pastor-and-woman-he-assaulted-provides-perfect-churchtoo-hook|archivedate=January 12, 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also| University of California, Irvine#Internal and political controversies}}
The [[University of California]] has been no stranger to sexual harassment with substantial accusations reported yearly in the hundreds at all nine UC campuses, notably UC Berekely, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/university-of-california-staff-faculty-sexual-misconduct-harassment-cases/|title=University of California releases details on 113 employee sexual misconduct cases |last=Press |first=Associated |date=2017-03-01 |work=CBS News |access-date=2018-10-22 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a landmark event at the [[University of California, Irvine]] spearheaded the removal and reprimanding of several campus officials and professors accused of sexual harassment and discrimination. In early July 2018, UC Irvine removed millionaire benefactor [[Francisco J. Ayala]]'s name from its biology school, central science library, graduate fellowships, scholar programs, and endowed chairs after an internal investigation substantiated a number of sexual harassment claims. The results from the investigation were compiled in a 97-page report, which included testimony from victims enduing Ayala's harassment for 15 years. &lt;ref&gt;[https://filebin.net/0zz55fgacjmtxeqb] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.uci.edu/2018/06/28/uci-proposes-new-name-for-school-of-biological-sciences-science-library-after-internal-investigation-substantiates-sexual-harassment-claims-against-signature-donor/|title=UCI proposes new name for School of Biological Sciences, science library after internal investigation substantiates sexual harassment claims against signature donor|last=Harriman |first=Pat |date=2018-06-28|work=UCI News|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/07/02/uc-irvine-says-it-will-remove-former-professors-name-institutions-he-helped-build|title=Professor, Donor, Harasser |last=Flaherty |first=Colleen |date=2018-07-02|work=Inside Higher Education|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/07/02/uc-irvine-says-it-will-remove-former-professors-name-institutions-he-helped-build|title=Acclaimed UC Irvine geneticist who gave millions to the campus resigns due to sexual harassment |last= Watanabe |first=Teresa |date=2018-06-28|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/06/prominent-geneticist-out-uc-irvine-after-harassment-finding|title=Prominent geneticist out at UC Irvine after harassment finding |last=Wadman |first=Meredith |date=2018-06-29|work=Science Magazine|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chancellor.uci.edu/engagement/campus-communications/2018/180628-franciscojayala-message.php|title=Important Message Regarding Francisco J.

=== Finance ===
It has been noted that, although the [[financial services|financial industry]] is known to have a wide prevalence of sexual harassment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-harassment-breakingviews/breakingviews-citys-metoo-moment-is-tipping-point-and-catalyst-idUSKBN1FE2F2|title=City's #MeToo moment is tipping point and catalyst|date=January 25, 2018|agency=Reuters |access-date=January 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126070649/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-harassment-breakingviews/breakingviews-citys-metoo-moment-is-tipping-point-and-catalyst-idUSKBN1FE2F2 |archive-date=January 26, 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of January 2018, there were no high-profile financial executives stepping down as the result of #MeToo allegations.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1188053/the-presidents-club-fallout-why-metoo-movement-will-not-affect-the-financial-world/|title=Why the financial world and big business will never have a #MeToo moment|last=Brinded|first=Lianna|website=Quartz |access-date=January 25, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126012855/https://qz.com/1188053/the-presidents-club-fallout-why-metoo-movement-will-not-affect-the-financial-world/|archivedate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first widely covered example of concrete consequences in finance was when two reporters, including Madison Marriage of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', went [[undercover operation|undercover]] at a men-only [[Presidents Club]] event meant to raise money for children. Because women were not allowed to attend except as "hostesses" in tight, short black dresses with black underwear, the two female reporters got jobs as hostesses and documented widespread sexual misconduct. As a result, The presidents Club was shut down.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In March 2018, Morgan Stanley broker [[Douglas E. Greenberg]] was put on administrative leave after a ''New York Times'' story outlined harassment allegations by four women, including multiple arrests for the violation of restraining orders, and a threat to burn down an ex-girlfriend's house. It has been called the #MeToo moment of Portland's financial service industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2018/03/morgan_stanley_aware_of_abuse.html|title=Morgan Stanley knew of abuse allegations against Lake Oswego broker: report|work=OregonLive.com|access-date=March 30, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted in discussion of #MeToo in finance that only about a quarter of top positions are held by women at several major banks, and there is evidence there may be wide disparities in some financial institutions between how much men and women are paid on average.&lt;ref name=":47" /&gt;

==== ME TOO bill in the US Congress ====
[[Jackie Speier]] proposed the Member and Employee Training and Oversight on Congress Act (ME TOO Congress Act) on November 15, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564405871/me-too-legislation-aims-to-combat-sexual-harassment-in-congress|title='Me Too' Legislation Aims To Combat Sexual Harassment in Congress|publisher=NPR |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121201936/https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564405871/me-too-legislation-aims-to-combat-sexual-harassment-in-congress|archivedate=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full language of the bipartisan bill was revealed by the House on January 18, 2018 as an amendment to the [[Congressional Accountability Act of 1995]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-unveils-landmark-sexual-harassment-overhaul-bill-n838436|title=House unveils landmark sexual harassment overhaul bill|publisher=NBC News |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122073057/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-unveils-landmark-sexual-harassment-overhaul-bill-n838436|archivedate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the bill is to change how the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government treats sexual harassment complaints. Under the old system, complaints regarding the legislative branch were channeled through the [[United States Congress Office of Compliance|Office of Compliance]], which required complete confidentially through the process and took months of counseling and mediation before a complaint could actually be filed. Any settlement payments were paid using federal taxes, and it was reported that within a decade, $15&amp;nbsp;million of tax money had been spent settling harassment and discrimination complaints. The bill would ensure future complaints could only take up to 180 days to be filed. The bill would also allow the staffers to transfer to a different department or otherwise work away from the presence of the alleged harasser without losing their jobs if they requested it. The bill would require Representatives and Senators to pay for their own harassment settlements. The Office of Compliance would no longer be allowed to keep settlements secret, and would be required to publicly publish the settlement amounts and the associated employing offices. For the first time, the same protections would also apply to unpaid workers, including pages, fellows and interns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/360489-lawmakers-unveil-me-too-congress-bill-to-overhaul-sexual-harassment-policies|title=Lawmakers unveil 'ME TOO Congress' bill to overhaul sexual harassment policies|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|date=November 15, 2017|website=TheHill|access-date=January 4, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223010703/http://thehill.com/homenews/house/360489-lawmakers-unveil-me-too-congress-bill-to-overhaul-sexual-harassment-policies|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/congress-harassment-policy-scandals-345481|title=House unveils sweeping harassment overhaul after wave of scandals|website=POLITICO |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072858/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/congress-harassment-policy-scandals-345481|archivedate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578524736/bill-changes-how-congressional-sexual-harassment-claims-are-handled|title=Bill Changes How Congressional Sexual Harassment Claims Are Handled|publisher=NPR |access-date=January 22, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122024352/https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578524736/bill-changes-how-congressional-sexual-harassment-claims-are-handled|archivedate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after #MeToo started spreading in late 2017, several allegations from a 2016 ''[[The Indianapolis Star|Indianapolis Star]]'' article re-surfaced in the gymnastic industry against former U.S. Gymnastics doctor [[Larry Nassar]] of [[Michigan State University]].

=== Pornography ===
There have been discussions about how [[pornography]] is related to the emergence of the #MeToo movement, and what changes, if any, should be made to the porn industry in response.&lt;ref name=":010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/07/me-too-anti-porn-conference-cosmopolitan-ban|title=The strange alliance between #MeToo and the anti-porn movement|last=Graves|first=Lucia|date=April 8, 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/danny-wylde-christopher-zeischegg-porn-814784|title=This ex-porn star is calling on #MeToo to include sex workers|date=February 21, 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deaths of five female porn actresses during the first three months of 2018 inspired demands that workers in the industry be included as part of the #MeToo movement.&lt;ref name=":58"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43093080|title=Porn stars call for respect after spate of deaths|last=Fabbri|first=Thomas|date=March 26, 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out that many women and men have been sexually assaulted on set.&lt;ref name=":59"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/186887/what-will-it-take-for-the-porn-industry-to-have-its-metoo-moment#.YPIF6SWdc|title=What will it take for the porn industry to have its #MeToo moment?|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some high-profile pornographic performers have been accused of assault since the emergence of #MeToo, including [[James Deen]] and [[Ron Jeremy]].&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/insider/reporting-the-porn-industry.html|title=What It's Like to Report About the Porn Industry|last=Syckle|first=Katie Van|date=March 26, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/porns-two-biggest-male-stars-stand-accused-of-serial-sexual-assault-wheres-the-outrage|title=Porn's Two Biggest Male Stars Stand Accused of Serial Sexual Assault.

Several groups of [[Christian]]s, [[Conservatism|conservative]] women, and [[Radical feminism|radical feminists]] have argued that #MeToo demonstrates pornography causes women to be viewed as sexual objects and contributes to the prevalence of sexual harassment. As a result, these groups believe the production and consumption of pornography should be greatly restricted or made illegal.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

Other social advocates and feminists have responded by pointing out that attempts to suppress pornography in the U.S. have historically never been effective at reducing consumption. They note that porn consumption in the U.S. is currently at what is likely the highest levels in history, but overall levels of sexual violence and rape are far lower today than when the [[Anti-pornography movement in the United States|anti-pornography movement in the U.S.]] first emerged during the 1960s. Additionally, many feminists argue that laws which make pornography illegal only further restrict women as far what they are and are not allowed to do with their bodies.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;

Many feminists have stated that pornography can be empowering or enjoyable for women and depicting female sexuality is not always objectification.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dailytrojan.com/2018/04/05/you-do-uterus-female-sexuality-isnt-always-objectification/|title=You Do Uterus: Female sexuality isn’t always objectification {{!}} Daily Trojan|date=April 5, 2018|work=Daily Trojan|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out that a lot of porn is made by women and for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternet.org/conservative-trying-use-metoo-movement-ban-pornography|title=This Conservative Is Trying to Use the #MeToo Movement to Ban Pornography|last=Fenwick|first=Cody|date=February 12, 2018|work=AlterNet|access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Award-winning porn actress and director [[Angela White]] says there is a "large positive shift within the industry" to more women directing and producing their own content and "to represent women as powerful sexual beings."&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt; Anti-porn activist [[Melissa Farley]] has said this ignores the "choicelessness" faced by many actresses in porn.&lt;ref name=":010"/&gt; Liberal advocates argue that anti-pornography movements in the U.S. have historically never tried to increase choices for vulnerable adult performers, and taking away a person's right to act in porn may hurt them economically by reducing their choices. Many adult performers have stated that the social stigma surrounding their type of work is already a major barrier when they're seeking help, and making porn illegal would leave them few options if they are suffering from sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt;

As a result of #MeToo, many adult performers, sex worker advocates and feminists have called for greater protections for pornographic actresses, for example reducing social stigmas, mandating training courses that teach performers their rights, and providing access to independent hotlines where performers can report abuse. They argue that making porn illegal would only cause the production of porn to go underground where there are even fewer options for help. Some liberal activists have argued to compromise by raising the legal age of entry into adult entertainment from 18 to 21, which would prevent some of the most vulnerable women from being taken advantage of, while allowing adult women to still do what they want with their own bodies.&lt;ref name=":58"/&gt;

Some have pointed out that many young people who do not receive a sex education adopt ideas about sex and sexual roles from pornography, whose fantasy depictions of those behaviors are not accurate to life, as they are designed for purposes of adult entertainment, and not educating the public on the reality of sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/magazine/teenagers-learning-online-porn-literacy-sex-education.html|title=What Teenagers Are Learning From Online Porn|date=February 7, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas of the United States teach [[Birth control|birth-control]] methods only by [[abstinence]] from sex.

Sex education can also effectively prepare children to identify and say no to unwanted sexual contact before it occurs, and gives parents an opportunity to teach children about consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/03/23/sex-ed-metoo-era-consent-parents/419690002/|title=Sex ed: Many parents wouldn't recognize it today -- and #metoo may change it even more|last=|first=|date=|work=USA TODAY|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose==
The original purpose of "Me Too" as used by Tarana Burke in 2006, was to empower women through empathy, especially young and vulnerable women. In October 2017, Alyssa Milano encouraged using the phrase as a hashtag to help reveal the extent of problems with sexual harassment and assault by showing how many people have experienced these events themselves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA" /&gt;

After millions of people started using the phrase, and it spread to dozens of other languages, the purpose changed and expanded, as a result, it has come to mean different things to different people. Tarana Burke accepts the title of the leader and creator of the movement but has stated she considers herself a worker of something much bigger. Burke has stated that this movement has grown to include both men and women of all colors and ages, as it continues to support marginalized people in marginalized communities.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|first1=Chris|last2=Lopez|first2=Linette|title=Tarana Burke on why she created the #MeToo movement – and where it's headed|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|website=[[Business Insider]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229055941/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|archivedate=December 29, 2017|date=December 13, 2017|access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/me-too-creator-tarana-burke-reminds-us-this-is-about-black-and-brown-survivors-20180104|title=Me Too creator Tarana Burke reminds us this is about Black and Brown survivors|last=Jeffries|first=Zenobia|website=[[Yes!

===Awareness and empathy===
Analyses of the movement often point to the prevalence of sexual violence, which has been estimated by the [[World Health Organization]] to affect one-third of all women worldwide. A 2017 poll by [[ABC News]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also found that 54% of American women report receiving "unwanted and inappropriate" sexual advances with 95% saying that such behavior usually goes unpunished.

===Policies and laws===
Burke has stated the current purpose of the movement is to give people the resources to have access to healing, and advocates for changes to laws and policies. Burke has highlighted goals such as processing all untested [[rape kit]]s, re-examining local school policies, improving the vetting of teachers, and updating sexual harassment policies.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|title=Tarana Burke on why she created the #MeToo movement – and where it's headed|last1=Snyder|first1=Chris|last2=Lopez|first2=Linette|date=December 13, 2017|website=[[Business Insider]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229055941/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12|archivedate=December 29, 2017|deadurl=no|access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has called for all professionals who work with children to be [[fingerprint]]ed and subjected to a [[background check]] before being cleared to start work. She advocates for sex education that teaches kids to report predatory behavior immediately.&lt;ref name=":172" /&gt; Burke supports the #MeToo bill in the [[US Congress]], which would remove the requirement that staffers of the federal government go through months of "cooling off" before being allowed to file a complaint against a Congressperson.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;

Milano states a priority for #MeToo is changing the laws surrounding sexual harassment and assault, for example, instituting protocols that give sufferers in all industries the ability to file complaints without retaliation. She supports legislation making it difficult for publicly traded companies to hide cover-up money from their stockholders and would like to make it illegal for employers to require new workers sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s as a condition of employment.&lt;ref name=":272" /&gt; Gender analysts such as [[Anna North]] have stated that #MeToo should be addressed as a labor issue due to the economic disadvantages to reporting harassment. North suggested combating underlying power imbalances in some workplaces, for example by raising the tipped minimum wage, and embraces innovations like the "portable [[panic button]]s" that are mandated for hotel employees in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/27/16803610/sexual-misconduct-harassment-reckoning-metoo|title=What I've learned covering sexual misconduct this year|website=Vox |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118064612/https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/27/16803610/sexual-misconduct-harassment-reckoning-metoo|archivedate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested that barriers to employment must be removed, such as the job requirement by some employers to sign non-disclosure agreements or other agreements that prevent an employee from talking about their employment publicly, or taking disputes (including sexual harassment claims) to arbitration or legal proceedings. It's been suggested that legislation should be passed that bans these types of mandatory pre-employment agreements.&lt;ref name=":65"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2018/01/31/445669/politics-policy-turning-corner-sexual-harassment/|title=From Politics to Policy: Turning the Corner on Sexual Harassment - Center for American Progress|date=January 31, 2018|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=April 14, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some policy-based changes that have been suggested is reducing limited managerial oversight; creating clear internal reporting mechanisms; more effective and proactive disciplinary measures; and creating a culture that encourages employees to be open about serious problems.&lt;ref name=":65" /&gt;

===Media coverage===
In the coverage of #MeToo, there has been widespread discussion about the best way for sufferers of sexual abuse or harassment to stop what is happening to them at work. There is general agreement that a lack of effective reporting options is a major factor that drives unchecked sexual misconduct in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-women-sexcrimes/despite-metoo-u-s-workers-fear-speaking-out-about-sexual-harassment-idUSKBN1DA0NY|title=Despite #MeToo, U.S. workers fear speaking out about sexual harassment|date=November 10, 2017|agency=Reuters |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011233/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-women-sexcrimes/despite-metoo-u-s-workers-fear-speaking-out-about-sexual-harassment-idUSKBN1DA0NY|archivedate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], a person who makes a sexual harassment complaint at work is reprimanded or fired 40% of the time, while the accused person is typically not investigated or punished.&lt;ref name=":332"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/world/europe/france-sexual-harassment.html|title='Revolt' in France Against Sexual Harassment Hits Cultural Resistance|last=Rubin|first=Alissa J.|date=November 19, 2017|website=The New York Times |access-date=January 15, 2018|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223074906/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/world/europe/france-sexual-harassment.html|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a 2016 report from the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] states that although 25–85% of women say they experience sexual harassment at work, few ever report the incidents, most commonly due to fear of reprisal.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; There is evidence that in [[Japan]], as few as 4% of rape victims report the crime, and the charges are dropped about half the time.&lt;ref name=":1522"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/metoo-sexual-assault-women-rights-japan/|title=Saying #MeToo in Japan|date=January 2, 2018|website=POLITICO |access-date=January 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106063552/https://www.politico.eu/article/metoo-sexual-assault-women-rights-japan/|archivedate=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/world/asia/japan-rape.html|title=She Broke Japan's Silence on Rape|last=Rich|first=Motoko|date=December 29, 2017|website=The New York Times |access-date=January 17, 2018|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124054016/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/world/asia/japan-rape.html|archivedate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a discussion on the best ways to handle [[whisper network]]s, or private lists of "people to avoid" that are shared unofficially in nearly every major institution or industry where sexual harassment is common due to power imbalances, including government, media, news, and academia. These lists have the stated purpose of warning other workers in the industry and are shared from person-to-person, on forums, in private social media groups, and via [[spreadsheet]]s. However, these lists can become "weaponized" and used to spread unsubstantiated gossip, which has been discussed widely in the media.&lt;ref name=":110"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/what-whisper-network-sexual-misconduct-allegations-719009|title=What is a whisper network?

Defenders say the lists provide a way to warn other people in the industry if worried about punishment, or if complaints have already been ignored, and also helps victims identify each other so they can speak out together.&lt;ref name=":110" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":210" /&gt; Sometimes these lists are kept for other reasons, for example, a spreadsheet from the United Kingdom called "High Libido MPs" and dubbed "the spreadsheet of shame" was created by a group of male and female parliamentary researchers, and contained a list of allegations against nearly 40 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. It is also rumored that [[whip (politics)|party whips]] (who are in charge of getting members of Parliament to commit to votes) maintain a "black book" that contains allegations against several lawmakers that can be used for [[blackmail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/sexual-harassment-british-parliament.html|title=Sexual Harassment Claims Surface in U.K. Parliament|last=Castle|first=Stephen|date=October 30, 2017|website=The New York Times |access-date=January 17, 2018|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118011016/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/sexual-harassment-british-parliament.html|archivedate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/30/uk-parliament-sexual-harassment-scandal/|title=Making Sense of the Lewd Sexual Harassment Scandal Roiling the U.K|website=Fortune |access-date=January 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031182703/http://fortune.com/2017/10/30/uk-parliament-sexual-harassment-scandal/|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dirty-dossier-accuses-mps-of-harassment-and-sex-in-offices-6f7q8kn8b|title=Dirty dossier accuses MPs of harassment and sex in offices|author1=Hannah McGrath|author2=Billy Kenber|date=October 30, 2017|website=The Times|access-date=January 17, 2018|issn=0140-0460|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is claimed a well-known person's sexual misconduct was an "open secret", these lists are often the source.&lt;ref name=":110" /&gt; In the wake of #MeToo, several private whisper network lists have been leaked to the public.&lt;ref name=":110" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":210"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/1/11/16878316/shitty-media-men-list-katie-roiphe-moira-donegan|title=The creator of the Shitty Media Men List has come forward.

When it was shared outside her private network, Donegan lost her job. Donegan stated it was unfair so few people had access to the list before it went public; for example, very few women of color received access (and therefore protection) from it. She pointed to her "[[privilege (sociology)|whiteness, health, education, and class]]" that allowed her to take the risk of sharing the list and getting fired.&lt;ref name=":210" /&gt;

The main problem with trying to protect more potential victims by publishing whisper networks is determining the best mechanism to verify allegations in a way that is fair to all parties.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/10/16/16482800/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-workplace|title=It's time to weaponize the "whisper network"|work=Vox |access-date=January 27, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127143320/https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/10/16/16482800/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-workplace|archivedate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/18/how-whisper-networks-help-protect-women-harvey-weinsteins-world/759860001/|title=How 'whisper networks' help protect women from the Harvey Weinsteins of the world|work=USA Today |access-date=January 27, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127154813/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/18/how-whisper-networks-help-protect-women-harvey-weinsteins-world/759860001/|archivedate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggestions have included strengthening [[trade union|labor unions]] in vulnerable industries so workers can report harassment directly to the union instead of to an employer.

Dr. John Launer of [[Health Education England]] stated leaders must be made aware of common "mismatches of perceptions" at work to reduce incidents where one person thinks they are flirting while the other person feels like they're being demeaned or harassed.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Reporter [[Anna North]] from ''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'' states one way to address #MeToo is teach children the basics of sex.

Professor [[Daniel W. Drezner|Daniel Drezner]] stated that #MeToo laid the groundwork for two major cultural shifts. One is the acceptance that sexual harassment (not just sexual assault) is unacceptable in the workplace. The other is that when a powerful person is accused of sexual harassment, the reaction should be a presumption that the less powerful accuser is "likely telling the truth, because the risks of going public are great." However, he states society is struggling with the speed at which change is being demanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/02/14/metoo-and-the-trouble-with-norms/|title=Perspective {{!}} #MeToo and the trouble with new norms|last=Drezner|first=Daniel W.|date=February 14, 2018|work=Washington Post|access-date=February 20, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and former [[Seduction community|pick-up artist]] [[Michael Ellsberg]] encourages men to reflect on past behavior and examples of questionable sexual behavior, such as the viral story [[Cat Person]], which is written from the perspective of a twenty-year-old woman who goes on a date with a much older man and ends up having an unpleasant sexual experience that was consensual but unwanted.

Relationship instructor Kasia Urbaniak said the movement is creating its own crisis around [[masculinity]]. "There's a reflective questioning about whether they’re going to be next and if they’ve ever hurt a woman. There's a level of anger and frustration. If you’ve been doing something wrong but haven't been told, there's an incredible sense of betrayal and it’ll provoke a backlash. I think silence on both sides is incredibly dangerous." Urbaniak says she would like women to be allies of men and to be curious about their experience. "In that alliance there's a lot more power and possibility than there is in men stepping aside and starting to stew."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/30/dominatrix-classes-be-more-assertive-work-and-life|title=Want to be more assertive in life?

==#HimToo==
{{main|Him Too movement}}
The related hashtag [[Him Too movement|#HimToo]] emerged in popularity with the #MeToo movement. Although dating back to at least 2015, and initially associated with politics or casual communication, #HimToo took on new meanings associated with #MeToo in 2017, with some using it to emphasize male victims of sexual harassment and abuse, and others using it to emphasize male perpetrators. In September and October 2018, during the [[Brett_Kavanaugh_Supreme_Court_nomination#Sexual_assault_allegations|sexual assault allegations raised during Brett Kavanaugh's nomination]] to the U.S. Supreme Court, #HimToo became used by supporters of Kavanaugh and to highlight male victims of false accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Morris |first1=Amanda |title=#HimToo: Left And Right Embrace Opposing Takes On Same Hashtag |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/10/11/656293787/-himtoo-left-and-right-embrace-opposing-takes-on-same-hashtag |website=NPR.org |language=en |date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ellis |first1=Emma Grey |title=How #HimToo Became the Tagline of the Men’s Rights Movement |url=https://www.wired.com/story/brett-kavanaugh-hearings-himtoo-metoo-christine-blasey-ford/ |website=WIRED |date=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creator [[Tarana Burke]] has laid out specific goals for the #MeToo movement, including: processing all untested rape kits in the United States, investigating the vetting of teachers, better protecting children at school, updating sexual harassment policies, and improving training in workplaces, places of worship, and schools. She has stated that everyone in a community, including men and women, must take action in order to make the #MeToo movement a success.

Some actors have admonished proponents of the movement for not distinguishing between different degrees of sexual misconduct. [[Matt Damon]] commented on the phenomenon in an interview, and later apologized, saying "the clearer signal to men and to younger people is, deny it.

Tarana Burke said in January 2018, "Those of us who do this work know that backlash is inevitable." While describing the backlash as carrying an underlying sentiment of fairness, she defended her movement as "not a witch hunt as people try to paint it". She stated that engaging with the cultural critique in #MeToo was more productive than calling for it to end or focusing on accused men who "haven't actually touched anybody".&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; [[Ronan Farrow]], who published the Weinstein exposé in the [[The New Yorker|''New Yorker'']] that helped start the #MeToo resurgence (alongside ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporters [[Megan Twohey]] and [[Jodi Kantor]]), was asked in late December 2017 whether he thought the movement had "gone too far". Farrow called for a careful examination of each story to guard against false accusations but also recalled the alleged sexual abuse his sister Dylan Farrow claims she went through at the hands of his father [[Woody Allen]]. He stated that after decades of silence, "My feeling is that this is a net benefit to society and that all of the people, men, and women, pouring forward and saying 'me too' deserve this moment. I think you're right to say that we all have to be conscious of the risk of the pendulum swinging too far, but in general this is a very positive step."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Janice|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ronan-farrow-harvey-weinstein-metoo-755974|title=Will innocent men become 'casualities' of #MeToo movement?|date=December 21, 2017|website=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=January 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104131421/http://www.newsweek.com/ronan-farrow-harvey-weinstein-metoo-755974|archivedate=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist [[Steven Thrasher]] noted that, "There has been worry that the #MeToo movement could lead to a sex panic.

He points to 2018 [[Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act]] (SESTA), which many experts say will only put sex workers at further risk by causing them to go underground, does not offer sex workers any help or protections, and as a side effect prevents most people from using online personal ads regardless of their intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/29/sexual-freedom-fosta-sosta|title=Sexual freedom is at risk from these damning new bills passed by Congress {{!}} Steven W Thrasher|last=Thrasher|first=Steven W.|date=March 29, 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the prevalence{{where?|date=October 2018}} of sexual misconduct, some have pointed out the lack of discussion in the #MeToo movement regarding law-enforcement misconduct.&lt;ref name=":55"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.newsweek.com/metoo-ignore-police-sexual-misconduct-757033|title= Why aren't we talking about sexual misconduct by police? {{!}} Opinion|date= December 22, 2017|work= Newsweek|access-date= April 7, 2018|language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":56"&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/copstoo-when-police-officers-use-sexual-assault-to-te-1823081788|title= #CopsToo: When Police Officers Use Sexual Assault to Terrorize Vulnerable Communities|last= Butler|first= Danielle|work= Very Smart Brothas|access-date= April 7, 2018|language= en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-sexual-misconduct-metoo/|title= As Hollywood &amp; Politicians Get Spotlight, Why Has Police Sexual Abuse Escaped #MeToo Movement?|date= December 25, 2017|work= The Free Thought Project|access-date= April 7, 2018|language= en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":57"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Police sexual misconduct disproportionately affects women of color, though women from all walks of life are affected.&lt;ref name=":57" /&gt; The [[Cato Institute]] reported that in 2010, more than 9% of police misconduct reports in 2010 involved sexual abuse, and there are multiple indications that "sexual assault rates are significantly higher for police when compared to the general population."&lt;ref name=":56" /&gt; Fear of retribution is considered{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} one reason some law-enforcement officers are not subjected to significant consequences for known misconduct.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt; Police-reform activist Roger Goldman stated that an officer who is fired for sexual misconduct from one police department often gets rehired by a different department, where they can continue the misconduct in a new environment.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt; Some states (such as Florida and Georgia) have licensing laws that can decertify a law-enforcement officer who has committed major misconduct, which prevents decertified officers from being hired again in that state.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt; Some have called for sexual misconduct allegations against police to be investigated by third parties to reduce bias (as opposed to the common practice of investigations being led by fellow law-enforcement officers or colleagues in the same department).&lt;ref name=":57" /&gt;

=== Lack of representation of minority women ===
Many have pointed to a lack of representation of minority women in the #MeToo movement or its leadership.&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theroot.com/these-are-the-women-of-color-who-fought-both-sexism-and-1823720002|title=These Are the Women of Color Who Fought Both Sexism and the Racism of White Feminists|last=Branigin|first=Anne|work=The Root|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":48"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/1150028/gloria-steinem-on-metoo-black-women-have-always-been-more-feminist-than-white-women/|title=Gloria Steinem on #MeToo: Black women have always been more feminist than white women — Quartz|last=Fessler|first=Leah|website=qz.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":49"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://work.qz.com/1147950/metoo-hijacked-black-womens-work-on-race-and-gender-equality/|title=#MeToo hijacked black women's work on race and gender equality|work=Quartz at Work|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":50"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://valleyadvocate.com/2018/01/31/metoo-black-women-periphery-movement/|title=#MeToo?

Minority women are overrepresented in industries with the greatest number of sexual harassment claims, for example hotels, health, food services, and retail.&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt; It has been pointed out that undocumented minority women often have no recourse if they're experiencing sexual violence.&lt;ref name=":54"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hollywood-having-metoo-moment-women-color-have-fought-battle-decades-n841121|title=Hollywood is having a #MeToo moment. Minority women have fought this battle for decades.|work=NBC News|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activist [[Charlene Carruthers]] said, "If wealthy, highly visible women in news and entertainment are sexually harassed, assaulted and raped—what do we think is happening to women in retail, food service and domestic work?"&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;

Former victim Farah Tanis stated there are also additional barriers for black women who want to participate in the #MeToo movement. She pointed out that there is often social pressure not to report allegations against black men, especially from church and family, because many would view that as a betrayal against their "brothers."&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Additionally, black women are less likely to be believed if they do speak out.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/black-women-metoo-antirape-movement#9|title=There Is No #MeToo Without Black Women|work=Healthline|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that the American judicial system acknowledges the term "sexual harassment" only because of successful sexual harassment lawsuits by three black women: [[Diane R. Williams|Diane Williams]] and Paulette Barnes against the US government, and Mechelle Vinson against a bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=October 20, 2017|work=The Nation|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinson's case of [[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]] eventually leading to the unanimous 1986 Supreme Court decision that sexual harassment violates the [[Civil Rights Act]].&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt; Black law professor [[Anita Hill]] again brought sexual harassment to public discourse in 1991 with her testimony against Supreme Court nominee [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/27/560231232/women-are-speaking-up-about-harassment-and-abuse-but-why-now|title=Women Are Speaking Up About Harassment And Abuse, But Why Now?|work=NPR.org|access-date=April 7, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarana Burke initially criticized the movement for ignoring the work of black women in creating dialogue addressing sexual assault. However, she did salute those who partook in the movement and credited Milano for acknowledging Burke's own similar movement.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-woman-me-too-movement-tarana-burke-alyssa-milano|title=Black woman Tarana Burke founded the 'Me Too' movement|last=Hill|first=Zahara|date=October 16, 2017|website=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|accessdate=October 17, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017035553/http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-woman-me-too-movement-tarana-burke-alyssa-milano|archivedate=October 17, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American feminist and journalist [[Gloria Steinem]] said there is a blind spot surrounding [[intersectionality]] between race and gender, and a major problem with today's feminists is they are not acknowledging "that women of color in general—and especially black women—have always been more likely to be feminist than white women."&lt;ref name=":35" /&gt; Steinem argues that #MeToo could never have happened without the work of these women, and women in the #MeToo movement have a responsibility: “If you have more power, remember to listen as much as you talk. And if you have less power, remember to talk as much as you listen."&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt;

=== Overemphasis on specific cases ===
The #MeToo movement has been criticized for putting too much public focus on the consequences of specific individuals who have been accused of sexual misconduct, as opposed to discussing policies and changes to institutional norms that would help people who are currently experiencing sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/6-perspectives-on-the-future-of-metoo/|title=6 Perspectives on the Future of #MeToo|last=Fonda|first=Jane|date=December 13, 2017|work=The Nation |access-date=February 1, 2018|last2=Covert|first2=Bryce|issn=0027-8378|last3=Pollitt|first3=Katha|last4=Meyerson|first4=Collier|last5=Lipsitz|first5=Raina|last6=Walsh|first6=Joan|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131001011/https://www.thenation.com/article/6-perspectives-on-the-future-of-metoo/|archivedate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's been noted that although allegations surrounding high-profile public figures tends to attract the most attention, the stories of regular workers often go unacknowledged.&lt;ref name=":65" /&gt; Yet to ensure meaningful change, these workers’ experiences must be at the center of any policy solutions that lawmakers pursue. Tarana Burke has voiced similar misgivings, pointing out one problematic aspect of #MeToo is "All of this media attention is on the perpetrator. All of the conversation about fairness and due process is focused on the perpetrator." She states the movement should focus on specific steps to help current and future sufferers.&lt;ref name=":173"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/me-too-creator-tarana-burke-reminds-us-this-is-about-black-and-brown-survivors-20180104|title=Me Too creator Tarana Burke reminds us this is about Black and Brown survivors|last=Jeffries|first=Zenobia|date=January 4, 2018|website=[[Yes!

==Financial support==
In May 2018, The New York Women's Foundation announced their Fund to Support the Me Too Movement and Allies, a $25M commitment over the next five years to provide funding and support survivors of sexual violence.[https://www.apnews.com/c07113f1a73047a589eedd1ef936fecb]

In September 2018, CBS announced that it would be donating $20 million of former Chairman Les Moonves' severance to #MeToo.  Moonves was forced to step down after numerous sexual misconduct accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tom McCarthy |title=Les Moonves resigns from CBS after six more women accuse him of sexual harassment |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/09/les-moonves-cbs-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-new-ronan-farrow-report |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=10 September 2018 |quote=Moonves and CBS will donate $20m to one or more organisations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace.

Sharing stories of sexual abuse against higher-ranking men is especially dangerous for women in the country, and may result in the killing of the victim or her family members.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt; Some women are also punished or killed to by their own family for speaking out, to [[Honor killing|redeem their "honor"]] after being tarnished by rape.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt; Despite the risks, some notable people such as ''Sarienews'' journalist Maryam Mehtar, and presidential advisor Shaharzad Akbar have shared their own #MeToo stories on social media. Mehtar experienced extreme abuse and several death threats for sharing her story about being sexually harassed in public on a daily basis, and was publicly called a "whore" in an interview with ''The New York Times'' by Afghan writer Jalil Junbish. He also called the NYT reporter a whore in the same interview.

Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] has been a vocal advocate and supporter of the #MeToo movement. In a speech at the [[World Economic Forum]] in January 2018, Trudeau called for critical discussion on issues brought up by the #MeToo, [[Time's Up (movement)|Time's Up]], and Women's March movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/pm-keynote-remarks-for-world-economic-forum-2018/|title=Justin Trudeau's Davos address in full|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trudeau has also advocated and acted upon a high standard set for himself and members of his government. Trudeau stated that he holds a "zero tolerance for sexual assault, harassment or other forms of misconduct by his employees or caucus colleagues".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/01/17/change-in-canadian-society-on-sexual-harassment-not-fast-enough-trudeau-says.html|title=Change in Canadian society on sexual harassment ‘not fast enough,’ Trudeau says  {{!}} The Star|work=thestar.com|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] party, Trudeau initiated investigations on several members of parliament resulting in the dismissal of cabinet minister [[Kent Hehr]], the resignation of MP [[Darshan Kang]], and the suspension and later expulsion of MPs [[Scott Andrews (politician)|Scott Andrews]] and [[Massimo Pacetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-hehr-sexual-allegations-1.4510371|title=Trudeau says Liberals 'doing the best that we can' amid sexual harassment allegations {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Trudeau explained that the zero tolerance standard applied to himself as well and stated, "I've been very, very careful all my life to be thoughtful, to be respectful of people's space and people's headspace as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-careful-metoo-1.4511093|title=Trudeau says zero tolerance on misconduct toward women applies to him as well {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=July 9, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{POV section|date=February 2018}}
On Chinese social networks, hashtags #WoYeShi or #metoo are sometimes used to denote the #Metoo hashtag.

In mainland China, the [[Internet censorship in China|Chinese internet censorship service]] has slowed down the Chinese MeToo posts via censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Javier C.|last1=Hernandez|first2=Zoe|last2=Mou|date=January 23, 2018|title='Me Too,' Chinese Women Say.

An article appearing on the state-run ''[[China Daily]]'' newspaper states that sexual misconduct is rare in China due to superior education and culture has caused considerable Internet outrages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/anger-as-chinese-media-claim-harassment-is-just-a-western-problem|title=Anger as Chinese media claim harassment is just a western problem|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108130241/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/17/anger-as-chinese-media-claim-harassment-is-just-a-western-problem|archivedate=November 8, 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 8, 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study from a pair of professors from [[City University of Hong Kong]] indicated that about 80% of working women in China have experienced sexual harassment at some point in their career,&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; and there were strong reactions of anger online following the report.

New laws recently made it illegal for television programming to contain images of a women's cleavage, sexual acts outside of marriage, or any topics that present "Western lifestyles" in a positive light. #MeToo has received extreme governmental [[censorship]] online.&lt;ref name=":302" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

Sophie Richardson, the [[Human Rights Watch]] director for China, stated the Chinese government regularly suppresses discussion of women's rights, for example an incident in 2015 where [[Li Tingting]] and four other activists were arrested when the government learned they planned to hand out stickers about preventing sexual harassment on public transportation.&lt;ref name=":31" /&gt;

In Hong Kong, track and field athlete Vera Lui Lai-Yiu posted her case of sex abuse alongside #metoo on her Facebook fanpage on her 23rd birthday. She posted in response to a similar action by gymnast [[McKayla Maroney]]. Lui posted a picture of herself holding a piece of paper with the handwritten words "#metoo lly" (her initials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/laiyiului/photos/rpp.1084620708226476/1613101928711682/?type=3&amp;theater|title=我被我的前教練性侵犯|date=November 30, 2017|website=Facebook|language=zh|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206195621/https://www.facebook.com/laiyiului/photos/rpp.1084620708226476/1613101928711682/?type=3&amp;theater|archivedate=December 6, 2017|deadurl=no}}{{Primary source inline|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20171130/57522123|title=香港體育界驚爆性侵 「欄后」呂麗瑤生日FB勇敢指控前教練|date=November 30, 2017|website=Apple Daily Hong Kong|language=zh|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032439/https://hk.news.appledaily.com/local/realtime/article/20171130/57522123|archivedate=December 1, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/hong-kong-athlete-says-coach-abused-her-as-teen/article/508811|title=Hong Kong athlete says coach abused her as teen|date=November 30, 2017|website=Digital Journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041229/http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/hong-kong-athlete-says-coach-abused-her-as-teen/article/508811|archivedate=December 1, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2122203/coach-sexually-assaulted-her-when-she-was-13-hong-kong|title=Police to investigate after Hong Kong hurdler Vera Lui says coach sexually assaulted her when she was 13|date=November 30, 2017|website=South China Morning Post|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130025628/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/2122203/coach-sexually-assaulted-her-when-she-was-13-hong-kong|archivedate=November 30, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=100313&amp;sid=4|title=Hurdler Vera Lui claims sexual assault by coach in teenage years|date=November 30, 2017|website=the Standard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041033/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=100313&amp;sid=4|archivedate=December 1, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, student Zheng Xi publicly started a campaign against sexual harassment in response to #MeToo.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;

The people who signed the letter, especially {{lang|fr|Deneuve|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|Millet|italic=no}}, were criticized for saying men should have the "right to pester" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/french-feminists-catherine-deneuve-metoo-letter-sexual-harassment|title=After the #MeToo backlash, an insider's guide to French feminism|last=Poirier|first=Agnès|date=January 14, 2018|website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=January 15, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114235554/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/french-feminists-catherine-deneuve-metoo-letter-sexual-harassment|archivedate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also told people not to be bothered by small amounts of sexual harassment, for example men who rub against women on public transportation. The letter states women should "consider it as the expression of a great sexual misery, or even as a nonevent".&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; French politician {{lang|fr|[[Marlène Schiappa]]|italic=no}} said some aspects of the letter were "profoundly shocking" and "we have immense difficulty convincing young women that when a man rubs his genitals against a woman in the [[Paris Métro|Métro]] without her consent, it is an act of sexual assault that can lead to three years in prison and a 75,000 euro fine."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

A week after its publication, {{lang|fr|Deneuve|italic=no}} issued a letter of clarification, and said although she still agrees with the spirit of the original letter, she wants to clarify that she does believe sexual harassment and assault are real problems, and apologized to all victims of unpleasant sexual acts who read the letter and felt hurt by it.&lt;ref name=":36"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/catherine-deneuve-me-too.html|title=Catherine Deneuve Apologizes to Victims after Denouncing #MeToo|last=Codrea-Rado|first=Anna|year=2018|website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=January 15, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115143236/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/arts/catherine-deneuve-me-too.html|archivedate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":37"&gt;{{cite web|last=Deneuve|first=Catherine |author-link=Catherine Deneuve|url=http://www.liberation.fr/debats/2018/01/14/catherine-deneuve-rien-dans-le-texte-ne-pretend-que-le-harcelement-a-du-bon-sans-quoi-je-ne-l-aurais_1622399|title=Catherine Deneuve : "Rien dans le texte ne prétend&amp;nbsp;que le harcèlement a du bon, sans quoi je ne l'aurais pas signé"|website=[[Libération]]|date=January 14, 2018 |access-date=January 15, 2018|language=fr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115191819/http://www.liberation.fr/debats/2018/01/14/catherine-deneuve-rien-dans-le-texte-ne-pretend-que-le-harcelement-a-du-bon-sans-quoi-je-ne-l-aurais_1622399|archivedate=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political commentator {{lang|fr|Anastasia Colosimo|italic=no}} said the movement to prevent sexual misconduct at work is more accepted by younger women in France because they take sexual freedom as a given, while older feminists are afraid #MeToo may hurt the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name=":352" /&gt; Legal professional {{lang|fr|Marilyn Baldeck|italic=no}} noted that when people are given "concrete examples" of sexual misconduct, they often "change their minds and acknowledge how harmful some situations can be".&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; French politician {{lang|fr|Sandrine Rousseau|italic=no}} said that the #MeToo movement will continue because French women have been silenced for too long.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; A petition aimed at President {{lang|fr|Emmanuel Macron|italic=no}} demanded sexual harassment to be taken more seriously in France, and received more than 100,000 signatures in 3 days.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

Singer [[Tom Connan]] said in an interview published by [[L'Obs]] that he had been the victim of sexual harassment and claimed that men (not only women) were also affected by the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/societe/20171018.OBS6179/tom-musicien-j-ai-ete-agresse-a-17-ans-je-n-ai-rien-dit-j-avais-peur-pour-ma-carriere.html|title=Tom, musicien : "J'ai été agressé à 17 ans.

There were reports of mass sexual assaults during the 2018 new year's celebrations in [[Bangalore]], which have been associated with #MeToo. The incidents were initially dismissed by the police until someone uploaded CCTV footage of the assaults to social media.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Home Minister G.

Several lists of alleged rapists and harassers started spreading on social media in India, including "The List" which initially included the names of about sixty highly-respected academic men.

Harimaya writes how the #MeToo movement has shown several women that they are not alone as they feared, and that many women are experiencing the same sexual violence and harassment.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Keiko Kojima of Buzzfeed Japan says that #MeToo is needed in Japan because sexual harassment is baked into Japanese society, and the movement is about the fact that it is okay to say no to sexual violence. She said growing up that she felt getting molested on the train was an unavoidable as mosquito bites in the summer, and she hopes that #MeToo gives more victims the ability to find their voice, including male victims. She says that, despite how it is attacked in Japanese media, that #MeToo is not an "anti-man" campaign, it is simply about anti-violence and anti-harassment. She also believes it is extremely important for men to call out behaviors in others such as sexual harassment or having sex with someone who is unconscious. Therefore, every person who is not committing sexual violence is part of the #MeToo movement, whether they are male or female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/keikokojima/metoo-ga-kirai-na-anata|title=#MeToo が嫌いなあなたへ|last=Kojima|first=Keiko|website=BuzzFeed |access-date=January 5, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233606/https://www.buzzfeed.com/jp/keikokojima/metoo-ga-kirai-na-anata|archivedate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiori Ito notes that the word "rape" is [[taboo]] in Japan, and is typically described with less threatening words such as saying an underage victim was "tricked" or a woman was "violated" to describe what happened, which Ito says contributes to the public not understanding the full extent of the problem.&lt;ref name=":1522" /&gt; The legal age of consent in Japan is 13. She says women in Japan are regularly exposed to harassment from a young age, and recalls being groped by a man at a swimming pool when she was 10 only to be blamed herself for wearing a "cute bikini".

As part of the #MeToo movement, {{ill|Shiori Ito|jp|伊藤詩織}} went public alleging that she was raped by {{ill|Noriyuki Yamaguchi|jp|山口敬之}}, a prominent TV journalist and acquaintance of Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]],&lt;ref name=BBC2018-06-28a&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan's secret shame|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0b8cfcj/japans-secret-shame|date=20 June 2018|accessdate=26 July 2018 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; an admission she says was unthinkable for a woman to do in Japan. Yamaguchi rejects her accusations, and says that sex was consensual.&lt;ref name=BBC2018-06-28a/&gt; She said her experience with Japan's legal system showed her that victims of sex crimes were undermined and ignored. She called for the Japanese parliament to update Japan's laws regarding rape, which were over a century old. She explains how she could not get information on which hospital provides rape kits without going through a preliminary interview in person. When she went to the police, she was discouraged from filing a report, and informed her career would be ruined for no reason if she did this. She was told she did not act like a victim, and had to be interviewed by several officers, including one who made her reenact the rape with a dummy while he took pictures. Although they initially said they would arrest Yamaguchi, the case and charges were unexpectedly dropped. Ito then went to the media, but no one would take her story. When she spoke about the experience at a press conference, she made national news and immediately started receiving a negative backlash, hate mail, and threats.&lt;ref name=":1522" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/22/asia/shiori-ito-japan-metoo-intl/index.html|title=Ignored, humiliated: How Japan is accused of failing survivors of sexual abuse|author1=Anna Stewart|author2=Euan McKirdy|author3=Junko Ogura|website=Edition.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been unsuccessful in her attempts to have criminal charges brought against Yamaguchi, but as of 2018 she was still pursuing a civil case against him, which he was defending.&lt;ref name=BBC2018-06-28a/&gt;

[[Nigerians|Nigerian]] women and children get sexually assaulted every day and do not speak up about it due to fear of [[stigmatisation]] and [[prejudice]].&lt;ref name=":60"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pulse.ng/gist/metro/horror-stories-of-how-these-nigerian-women-were-raped-id8066173.html|title=Horror stories of how these Nigerian women were raped|last=Akinloye|first=Dimeji|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official silence seems to surround [[sexual abuse]] of women in Nigeria, with the police frequently not taking sexual abuse reports seriously.&lt;ref name=":61"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IZUGBARA|first=C.

==== Role of power and privilege ====
There is a factor of power influencing the slow growth of the movement in Nigeria. The country is a highly patriarchal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guardian.ng/features/as-metoo-moves-across-the-world-is-nigeria-next/|title=As #MeToo moves across the world, is Nigeria next?|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have complained of how unimaginable it is in the country to report cases of harassment.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-africa-women-sexcrimes/metoo-challenges-taboo-against-admitting-sexual-abuse-in-africa-idUSKBN1CP1CG|title=#MeToo challenges taboo against admitting sexual abuse in Africa|last=Peyton|first=Nellie|work=U.S.|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, sexual harassment is so prominent within the country that it is perceived as almost a right to men.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;

====Brenda Uphopho case====
She had been assaulted three times by three different men. The first incident took place at age five. At that time, she was too young to understand what happened till she turned 18 when she encountered a similar incident again. She was at a party when a stranger forced her to have sex with him. Upon her refusal, he beat her up and raped her. Due to the stigma attached to being raped, she resorted to silence. The final experience took place at her workplace when her boss forcibly put his hand under her skirt. She still remained silent with the notion of not being believed and being judged by others. Realizing she could not remain silent and needed to make an impact, Uphopho currently works with her husband to break the "culture of silence" around abuse in Nigeria. They produced a play called "Shattered" which seeks to encourage victims of sexual abuse to speak up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/02/africa/nigeria-rape-survivors-metoo-asequals/index.html|title=The #MeToo stories you haven't heard: Meet the women speaking out in Nigeria|last=CNN|first=Stephanie Busari and Torera Idowu|work=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With hashtags such as #BoycottAliZafar, #BoycottTeefainTrouble, and #TeefaisTrouble, a huge wave of activists built a momentum on social media ahead of the movie's premiere and subsequent screenings. A few major Pakistani media outlets outright ignored the demonstrations but other had to give in when protestors turned up at cinemas and police and other law enforcement agencies got involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cutacut.com/2018/07/21/police-detain-protesters-at-ali-zafars-teefa-in-trouble-screening-in-neuplex-karachi/|title=Police detain protesters at Ali Zafar’s Teefa in Trouble screening in Nueplex Karachi|work=cutacut|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestors again showed up at Lahore’s CineStar for voice their anger and disappointment at both the promotion of the film of an alleged harasser and the celebrities pouring in to support him. The controversy deepened when, in one instance, the demonstrators asked Waleed Zaman, the creative director of women’s clothing brand Kayseria, the reason why he was backing the film, to which Zaman responded by saying: “We support sexual harassment of women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gulfnews.com/news/asia/pakistan/we-support-sexual-harassment-pakistani-businessman-1.2254722|title=We support sexual harassment: Pakistani businessman|last=Editor|first=Rabab Khan, Community Interactivity|date=2018-07-21|work=GulfNews|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/07/22/white-lies-273/|title=White Lies|website=Pakistantoday.com.pk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender studies scholar {{lang|sv|[[Eva Lundgren]]|italic=no}} and legal scholar {{lang|sv|Jenny Westerstrand|italic=no}} wrote that the Swedish journalistic profession bore a large part of the blame in Sweden for the problems the Me Too debate had highlighted because Swedish journalists had systematically attacked critical discussion of and research on men's [[violence against women]] for over 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.svd.se/journalistkaren-har-fortigit-mans-vald-mot-kvinnor Journalistkåren har förtigit mäns våld mot kvinnor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127083952/https://www.svd.se/journalistkaren-har-fortigit-mans-vald-mot-kvinnor |date=January 27, 2018 }}, ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Ellinor Skagegård in the Swedish newspaper {{lang|sv|[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|italic=yes}} wrote that during the Me Too campaign, it looks as if Lundgren was right in her research on men's violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.svd.se/hennes-forskning-hanades--metoo-kan-ge-upprattelse Hennes forskning hånades – #metoo kan ge upprättelse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127083823/https://www.svd.se/hennes-forskning-hanades--metoo-kan-ge-upprattelse |date=January 27, 2018 }}, ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of allegations concerning the involvement of British politicians in cases of [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault|assault]] arose in October and November 2017, the [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals]]. Allegations were prompted by discussions among junior staff employed in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] at Westminster following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]] in Hollywood earlier in October, and the subsequent rise of Me Too. The journalists [[Jane Merrick]] and Kate Maltby made allegations against the Defence Minister [[Michael Fallon]] and de facto Deputy Prime Minister [[Damian Green]], respectively. These led to the departures of both from Theresa May's cabinet, the latter after a two-month inquiry that also considered allegations that Green had lied about copious amounts of pornography found on his parliamentary computer. Both Merrick and Maltby cited the #MeToo movement as inspiring their allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/01/britains-metoo-movement-is-uncovering-a-culture-of-rampant-sexism-and-harassment-in-londons-corridors-of-power.html|title=That Charity Dinner Was Just the Tip of the Iceberg of the British Elite's Culture of Sexism and Harassment|first=Julia|last=Rampen|website=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
