'''#MeToo'''{{efn|&lt;nowiki&gt;#MeToo&lt;/nowiki&gt; has various related local or international names.}} was a [[social movement]] and [[Consciousness raising|awareness campaign]] against [[sexual abuse]], [[sexual harassment]] and [[rape culture]], in which women publicize their experiences of sexual abuse or sexual harassment.&lt;ref name="Frye-2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time17"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zacharek |first1=Stephanie |last2=Dockterman |first2=Eliana |last3=Edwards |first3=Haley Sweetland |date=18 December 2017 |title=TIME Person of the Year 2018: The Silence Breakers |url=https://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strause"/&gt; The phrase "Me Too" was initially used in this context on [[social media]] in 2006, on [[Myspace]], by [[sexual assault]] survivor and activist [[Tarana Burke]].&lt;ref name="Ohlheiser-2017"/&gt; The [[hashtag]] ''#MeToo'' was used starting in 2017 as a way to draw attention to the magnitude of the problem.

Widespread media coverage and discussion of sexual harassment, particularly in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], led to high-profile terminations from positions held, as well as criticism and backlash.&lt;ref name="Jeffries-2018a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Livsey13jan18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams4jan18"/&gt;

After millions of people started using the phrase and hashtag in this manner in English, the expression began to spread to dozens of other languages. The scope has become somewhat broader with this expansion, however, and Burke has more recently referred to it as an international movement for justice for marginalized people.&lt;ref name="Snyder-2017a"/&gt; After the hashtag #MeToo went viral in late 2017, [[Facebook]] reported that almost half of its American users were friends with someone who said they had been sexually assaulted or harassed.&lt;ref&gt;Ashwini Tambe, "Reckoning with the Silences of #MeToo." ''Feminist studies'' 44.1 (2018): 197-203 [http://www.feministstudies.org/pdf/40-49/44-1-10-News_And_Views_(Tambe).pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:MeToo logo.svg|thumb|Wordmark used on protest rallies]]
The original purpose of "Me Too" as used by Tarana Burke in 2006 was to empower women through empathy, especially young and vulnerable women. In October 2017, Alyssa Milano encouraged using the phrase as a hashtag to help reveal the extent of problems with sexual harassment and assault by showing how many people have experienced these events themselves. It therefore encourages women to speak up about their abuses, knowing that they are not alone.&lt;ref name="Ohlheiser-2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA"/&gt;

After millions of people started using the phrase, and it spread to dozens of other languages, the purpose changed and expanded, and as a result, it has come to mean different things to different people. Tarana Burke accepts the title of "leader" of the movement, but has stated that she considers herself more of a "worker". Burke has stated that this movement has grown to include both men and women of all colors and ages, as it continues to support marginalized people in marginalized communities.&lt;ref name="Jeffries-2018a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/me-too-creator-tarana-burke-reminds-us-this-is-about-black-and-brown-survivors-20180104 |title=Me Too creator Tarana Burke reminds us this is about Black and Brown survivors |last=Jeffries |first=Zenobia |website=[[Yes!

===Awareness and empathy===
Analyses of the movement often point to the prevalence of sexual violence, which has been estimated by the [[World Health Organization]] to affect one-third of all women worldwide. A 2017 poll by [[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' also found that 54% of American women report receiving "unwanted and inappropriate" sexual advances with 95% saying that such behavior usually goes unpunished. Others state that #MeToo underscores the need for men to intervene when they witness demeaning behavior.&lt;ref name="Radu-2017b"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-25/how-metoo-has-awoken-women-around-the-world |title=How #MeToo has awoken women around the world |last=Radu |first=Sintia |date=October 25, 2017 |website=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report|US News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106120413/https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-10-25/how-metoo-has-awoken-women-around-the-world |archive-date=January 6, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/me-too-lets-men-off-the-hook_us_59e4e3a2e4b04d1d518390d2 |title=The problem with asking women to say 'Me Too' |last=Chapin |first=Angelina |date=October 16, 2017 |website=[[HuffPost]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102235158/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/me-too-lets-men-off-the-hook_us_59e4e3a2e4b04d1d518390d2 |archive-date=January 2, 2018 |url-status=live|access-date=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/17/me-too-hashtag-sexual-harassment-at-work-stats/ |title=A new poll on sexual harassment suggests why 'Me Too' went so insanely viral |last=Zillman |first=Claire |date=October 17, 2017 |website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |access-date=January 13, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113093211/http://fortune.com/2017/10/17/me-too-hashtag-sexual-harassment-at-work-stats/ |archive-date=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke said that #MeToo declares sexual violence sufferers are not alone and should not be ashamed.&lt;ref name="SantiagoCNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/us/me-too-tarana-burke-origin-trnd/index.html |title=An activist, a little girl and the heartbreaking origin of 'Me too' |first1=Cassandra |last1=Santiago |first2=Doug |last2=Criss |publisher=[[CNN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017235824/http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/us/me-too-tarana-burke-origin-trnd/index.html |archive-date=October 17, 2017 |url-status=live|access-date=October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burke says sexual violence is usually caused by someone the woman knows, so people should be educated from a young age that they have the right to say no to sexual contact from any person, even after repeated solicitations from an authority or spouse, and to report [[Serial offender hunting patterns|predatory behavior]].&lt;ref name="Jeffries-2018b"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/me-too-creator-tarana-burke-reminds-us-this-is-about-black-and-brown-survivors-20180104 |title=Me Too creator Tarana Burke reminds us this is about Black and Brown survivors |last=Jeffries |first=Zenobia |date=January 4, 2018 |website=[[Yes!

Alyssa Milano said that #MeToo has helped society understand the "magnitude of the problem" and that "it's a standing in solidarity to all those who have been hurt."&lt;ref name="People2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.com/movies/me-too-alyssa-milano-heads-twitter-campaign-against-sexual-harassment-assault/ |title=#MeToo: Sexual harassment and assault movement tweeted over 500,000 times as celebs share stories |last=Petit |first=Stephanie |date=October 16, 2017 |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017014318/http://people.com/movies/me-too-alyssa-milano-heads-twitter-campaign-against-sexual-harassment-assault/ |archive-date=October 17, 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/01/alyssa-milano-mee-too-sexual-harassment-abuse |title=Alyssa Milano on the #MeToo movement: 'We're not going to stand for it any more' |last=Sayej |first=Nadja |date=December 1, 2017 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=January 5, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102051427/https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/01/alyssa-milano-mee-too-sexual-harassment-abuse |archive-date=January 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that the success of #MeToo will require men to take a stand against behavior that objectifies women.&lt;ref name="Milano-2018"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/alyssa-milano-why-i-joined-times-up-anti-sexual-misconduct-group-w514894 |title=Alyssa Milano on joining time's up: 'women are scared; women are angry' |last=Milano |first=Alyssa |author-link=Alyssa Milano |date=January 4, 2018 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=January 6, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106120433/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/alyssa-milano-why-i-joined-times-up-anti-sexual-misconduct-group-w514894 |archive-date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policies and laws===
Burke has stated the current purpose of the movement is to give people the resources to have access to healing, and to advocate for changes to laws and policies. Burke has highlighted goals such as processing all untested [[rape kit]]s, re-examining local school policies, improving the vetting of teachers, and updating sexual harassment policies.&lt;ref name="Snyder-2017b"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12 |title=Tarana Burke on why she created the #MeToo movement – and where it's headed |last1=Snyder |first1=Chris |last2=Lopez |first2=Linette |date=December 13, 2017 |website=[[Business Insider]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229055941/http://www.businessinsider.com/how-the-metoo-movement-started-where-its-headed-tarana-burke-time-person-of-year-women-2017-12 |archive-date=December 29, 2017 |url-status=live|access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has called for all professionals who work with children to be [[fingerprint]]ed and subjected to a [[background check]] before being cleared to start work. She advocates for [[sex education]] that teaches kids to report predatory behavior immediately.&lt;ref name="Jeffries-2018b"/&gt; Burke supports the [[Member and Employee Training and Oversight On Congress Act|#MeToo bill]] in the [[U.S. Congress]], which would remove the requirement that staffers of the federal government go through months of "cooling off" before being allowed to file a complaint against a Congressperson.&lt;ref name="Snyder-2017b"/&gt;

Milano stated in 2017 that a priority for #MeToo is changing the laws surrounding sexual harassment and assault, for example instituting protocols that allow sufferers in all industries to file complaints without retaliation. She supported legislation making it difficult for publicly traded companies to hide cover-up payments from their stockholders and would like to make it illegal for employers to require new workers to sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s as a condition of employment.&lt;ref name="Milano-2018"/&gt; Gender analysts such as [[Anna North]] have stated that #MeToo should be addressed as a labor issue due to the economic disadvantages to reporting harassment. North suggested combating underlying power imbalances in some workplaces, for example by raising the tipped minimum wage, and embracing innovations like the "portable [[panic button]]s" mandated for hotel employees in [[Seattle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/27/16803610/sexual-misconduct-harassment-reckoning-metoo |title=What I've learned covering sexual misconduct this year |website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=January 17, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118064612/https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/27/16803610/sexual-misconduct-harassment-reckoning-metoo |archive-date=January 18, 2018|date=December 27, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, the ruling in the case of C v. Hau Kar Kit [2023] HKDC 974 sent a strong reminder to employers that there should be zero tolerance to sexual harassment in the workplace. It turned out that the employer was also held liable under the Sex Discrimination Ordinance for unlawful act committed by any of their employees during the course of their employment, regardless of whether the employers have knowledge of the unlawful act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/perspectives-events/publications/2023/08/metoo-hong-kong-court-upholds-zero-tolerance-of-sexual-harassment-in-workplace|title=#MeToo: Hong Kong Court Upholds Zero Tolerance of Sexual Harassment in Workplace|website=[[Mayer Brown]]|date=August 10, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested that barriers to employment must be removed, such as the job requirement by some employers to sign non-disclosure agreements or other agreements that prevent an employee from talking about their employment publicly, or taking disputes (including sexual harassment claims) to arbitration rather than to legal proceedings. It's been suggested that legislation should be passed that bans these types of mandatory pre-employment agreements.&lt;ref name="Frye-2018"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2018/01/31/445669/politics-policy-turning-corner-sexual-harassment/ |title=From Politics to Policy: Turning the Corner on Sexual Harassment – Center for American Progress |date=January 31, 2018 |work=Center for American Progress|access-date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some policy-based changes that have been suggested include increasing managerial oversight; creating clear internal reporting mechanisms; more effective and proactive disciplinary measures; creating a culture that encourages employees to be open about serious problems;&lt;ref name="Frye-2018"/&gt; imposing financial penalties for companies that allow workers to remain in their position when they have repeatedly sexually harassed others; and forcing companies to pay huge fines or lose tax breaks if they decide to retain workers who are sexual harassers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=Stephanie Francis |title=Time's up |journal=ABA Journal |date=2018 |volume=104 |page=47 |url=https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/timesup_legal_judicial_harassment_assault }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage===
In the coverage of #MeToo, there has been widespread discussion about the best ways to stop sexual harassment and abuse—for those currently being victimized at work, as well as those who are seeking justice for past abuse and trying to find ways to end what they see as a widespread culture of abuse. There is general agreement that a lack of effective reporting options is a major factor that drives unchecked sexual misconduct in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Malo |first1=Sebastien |date=November 10, 2017 |title=Despite #MeToo, U.S. workers fear speaking out about sexual harassment |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-women-sexcrimes/despite-metoo-u-s-workers-fear-speaking-out-about-sexual-harassment-idUSKBN1DA0NY |work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

False reports of sexual assault are very rare,&lt;ref name="Orchowski Bogen Berkowitz 2020 pp. 1–232"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Orchowski |first1=Lindsay |title=Handbook of Interpersonal Violence Across the Lifespan |last2=Bogen |first2=Katherine W. |last3=Berkowitz |first3=Alan |publisher=Springer International Publishing |year=2020 |isbn=978-3-319-62122-7 |publication-place=Cham |pages=1–23 |chapter=False Reporting of Sexual Victimization: Prevalence, Definitions, and Public Perceptions |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-62122-7_193-1 |oclc=1240404173 |s2cid=226495024}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when they happen, they are put in the spotlight for the public to see. This can give the false impression that most reported sexual assaults are false. However, false reports of sexual assault account for only 2% to 10% of all reports.&lt;ref name="Kay 20182"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kay |first=Katty |date=September 18, 2018 |title=The truth about false assault accusations |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45565684 |access-date=November 15, 2018 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lisak Gardinier Nicksa Cote 2010 pp. 1318–13342"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lisak |first1=David |last2=Gardinier |first2=Lori |last3=Nicksa |first3=Sarah C. |last4=Cote |first4=Ashley M. |year=2010 |title=False Allegations of Sexual Assault: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=16 |issue=12 |pages=1318–1334 |doi=10.1177/1077801210387747 |pmid=21164210 |s2cid=15377916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures do not take into account that the majority of victims do not report when they are assaulted or harassed. Misconceptions about false reports are one of the reasons why women are scared to report their experiences with sexual assault—because they are afraid that no one will believe them, that in the process they will have embarrassed and humiliated themselves, in addition to opening themselves up to retribution from the assailants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=White |first=Gillian B. |date=November 22, 2017 |title=The Glaring Blind Spot of the 'Me Too' Movement |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/the-glaring-blind-spot-of-the-me-too-movement/546458/ |access-date=November 29, 2018 |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=False Reporting |url=https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/2012-03/Publications_NSVRC_Overview_False-Reporting.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, a person who makes a sexual harassment complaint at work is reprimanded or fired 40% of the time, while the accused person is typically not investigated or punished.&lt;ref name=":332"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rubin |first1=Alissa J. |date=19 November 2017 |title='Revolt' in France Against Sexual Harassment Hits Cultural Resistance |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/world/europe/france-sexual-harassment.html |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a 2016 report from the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] states that although 25–85% of women say they experience sexual harassment at work, few ever report the incidents, most commonly due to fear of reprisal.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; There is evidence that in Japan, as few as 4% of rape victims report the crime, and the charges are dropped about half the time.&lt;ref name=":1522"&gt;{{cite web |date=January 2, 2018 |title=Saying #MeToo in Japan |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/metoo-sexual-assault-women-rights-japan/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106063552/https://www.politico.eu/article/metoo-sexual-assault-women-rights-japan/ |archive-date=January 6, 2018 |access-date=January 5, 2018 |website=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rich |first1=Motoko |date=29 December 2017 |title=She Broke Japan's Silence on Rape |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/world/asia/japan-rape.html |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a discussion on the best ways to handle [[whisper network]]s, or private lists of "people to avoid" that are shared unofficially in nearly every major institution or industry where sexual harassment is common due to power imbalances, including government, media, news and academia. These lists have the stated purpose of warning other workers in the industry and are shared from person-to-person, on forums, in private social media groups, and via [[spreadsheet]]s. However, it has been argued that these lists can become "weaponized" and be used to spread unsubstantiated gossip—an opinion which has been discussed widely in the media.&lt;ref name=":110"&gt;{{cite web |date=November 22, 2017 |title=What is a whisper network? How women are taking down bad men in the #MeToo age |url=http://www.newsweek.com/what-whisper-network-sexual-misconduct-allegations-719009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118180947/http://www.newsweek.com/what-whisper-network-sexual-misconduct-allegations-719009 |archive-date=January 18, 2018 |access-date=January 17, 2018 |website=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders say the lists provide a way to warn other vulnerable people in the industry if worried about serious retribution from the abusers, especially if complaints have already been ignored. They say the lists help victims identify each other so they can speak out together and find safety in numbers.&lt;ref name=":110"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":210"&gt;{{cite web |date=January 11, 2018 |title=The creator of the Shitty Media Men List has come forward.

For example, a spreadsheet from the United Kingdom called "High Libido MPs" and dubbed "the spreadsheet of shame" was created by a group of male and female Parliamentary researchers, and contained a list of allegations against nearly 40 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. It is also rumored that [[party whip]]s (who are in charge of getting members of Parliament to commit to votes) maintain a "black book" that contains allegations against several lawmakers that can be used for [[blackmail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Castle |first1=Stephen |date=30 October 2017 |title=Sexual Harassment Claims Surface in U.K. Parliament |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/world/europe/sexual-harassment-british-parliament.html |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Making Sense of the Lewd Sexual Harassment Scandal Roiling the U.K |url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/30/uk-parliament-sexual-harassment-scandal/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031182703/http://fortune.com/2017/10/30/uk-parliament-sexual-harassment-scandal/ |archive-date=October 31, 2017 |access-date=January 17, 2018 |website=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McGrath |first1=Hannah |last2=Kenber |first2=Billy |date=October 30, 2017 |title=Dirty dossier accuses MPs of harassment and sex in offices |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dirty-dossier-accuses-mps-of-harassment-and-sex-in-offices-6f7q8kn8b |url-access=registration |access-date=January 17, 2018 |website=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is claimed a well-known person's sexual misconduct was an "open secret", these lists are often the source.&lt;ref name=":110"/&gt; In the wake of #MeToo, several private whisper network lists have been leaked to the public.&lt;ref name=":110"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":210"/&gt;

When it was shared outside her private network, Donegan lost her job. She stated it was unfair so few people had access to the list before it went public; for example, very few women of color received access (and therefore protection) from it. She pointed to her "[[Privilege (sociology)|whiteness, health, education and class]]" that allowed her to take the risk of sharing the list and getting fired.&lt;ref name=":210"/&gt;

The main problem with trying to protect more potential victims by publishing whisper networks is determining the best mechanism to verify allegations in a way that is fair to all parties.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite news |title=It's time to weaponize the "whisper network" |url=https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/10/16/16482800/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-workplace |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127143320/https://www.vox.com/first-person/2017/10/16/16482800/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-workplace |archive-date=January 27, 2018 |access-date=January 27, 2018 |work=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=How 'whisper networks' help protect women from the Harvey Weinsteins of the world |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/18/how-whisper-networks-help-protect-women-harvey-weinsteins-world/759860001/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127154813/https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/18/how-whisper-networks-help-protect-women-harvey-weinsteins-world/759860001/ |archive-date=January 27, 2018 |access-date=January 27, 2018 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggestions have included strengthening [[Trade union|labor unions]] in vulnerable industries so workers can report harassment directly to the union instead of to an employer.

North states the cultural notion that women do not enjoy sex leads men "to believe that a lukewarm yes is all they're ever going to get", referring to a 2017 study which found that men who believe women enjoy being forced into sex are "more likely to perceive women as consenting".&lt;ref name="North-2018a"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/16/16894722/aziz-ansari-grace-babe-me-too |title=The Aziz Ansari story is ordinary.

Alyssa Rosenberg of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called for society to be careful of overreaching by "being clear about what behavior is criminal, what behavior is legal but intolerable in a workplace, and what private intimate behavior is worthy of condemnation" but not part of the workplace discussion. She says "preserving the nuances" is more inclusive and realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Alyssa |title=The #MeToo movement is at a dangerous tipping point |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2018/01/17/the-metoo-movement-is-at-a-dangerous-tipping-point/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=17 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Daniel W. Drezner|Daniel Drezner]] stated that #MeToo laid the groundwork for two major cultural shifts. One is the acceptance that sexual harassment (not just sexual assault) is unacceptable in the workplace. The other is that when a powerful person is accused of sexual harassment, the reaction should be a presumption that the less powerful accuser is "likely telling the truth, because the risks of going public are great". However, he states society is struggling with the speed at which change is being demanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Drezner |first1=Daniel W. |title=#MeToo and the trouble with new norms |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/02/14/metoo-and-the-trouble-with-norms/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=14 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"There's a reflective questioning about whether they're going to be next and if they've ever hurt a woman. There's a level of anger and frustration. If you've been doing something wrong but haven't been told, there's an incredible sense of betrayal and it'll provoke a backlash. I think silence on both sides is incredibly dangerous." Urbaniak says she would like women to be allies of men and to be curious about their experience. "In that alliance there's a lot more power and possibility than there is in men stepping aside and starting to stew."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/30/dominatrix-classes-be-more-assertive-work-and-life |title=Want to be more assertive in life?

In August 2021, ''The Washington Post'' analyzed the impact of #MeToo on changing behavior. The article states there was a surge of reports of sexual assault in the twelve months preceding October 2018, but that many of the claims related to people coming forward regarding past incidents. The article shows a mixed picture regarding changing behavior with a significantly smaller percentage of women having experienced sexual coercion or unwanted sexual attention at the office in 2018 in comparison to 2016, but with a sharp rise in subtler forms of behaviors that do not rise to the level of illegal sexual harassment, such as jokes about what is still allowed or telling inappropriate stories, which may have come as a backlash to the #MeToo movement. The article notes that in response to the #MeToo movement, 19 states have enacted new sexual harassment protections for victims and more than 200 bills were introduced in state legislatures to deter harassment.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCarthy |first1=Ellen |title=#MeToo raised awareness about sexual misconduct.

In early July 2018, UC Irvine removed millionaire benefactor [[Francisco J.

The authors of a December 2018 ''[[Bloomberg News]]'' article on this topic interviewed more than thirty senior [[Wall Street]] executives and found that many are now more cautious about [[Mentorship|mentoring]] up and coming female executives because of the perceived risks involved.

The subject of sexual abuse in Hollywood acquired important significance in the world media in 2017, after producer Harvey Weinstein, founder of Miramax and the Weinstein Company, was accused by more than 80 women of having sexually assaulted them. The accusations ranged from sexual harassment to rape, with Weinstein denying any wrongdoing.[136] According to the women's reports, Weinstein invited young actresses or models to a hotel room or office on the pretext of discussing their careers, and then demanded massages or sexual intercourse. In an audio recording revealed during the ensuing scandal, Weinstein can be heard pressing model Ambra Gutierrez to accompany him to take a shower and, after her refusal, he insists, "I will not do anything to you, I swear it for my children."[137][138]

Among the actresses who claim to have suffered harassment or rape by Weinstein are Rose McGowan, Angelina Jolie, Mira Sorvino, Paz de la Huerta, Annabella Sciorra and Gwyneth Paltrow. Another, Italian actress Asia Argento, collated a list of sexual abuse accusations against Weinstein.[139] The incidents alleged in the list date from 1980 to 2015 and include 18 complaints of rape.[139] In them, it is alleged that Weinstein granted important roles in films in exchange for sexual favors. As a result, the Weinstein Company and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided to expel Weinstein.

Weinstein has been charged with first and third degree rape. He was sentenced to 23 years in a maximum security prison on March 11, 2020.[140] This has led to a larger conversation on what these implications of sexual assault have on other industries. In light of the scandal, others in varying industries have stepped forward to admit they have been sexually assaulted, leading to a conversation about a culture that perpetuates this. Many have begun a larger conversation on the cover-up of the abuses and the nuances that lead to it.[141]

Weinstein, however, continues to maintain his innocence, and his attorneys believe his conviction was achieved due to peer pressure. Weinstein's attorney Donna Rotunno says it was fueled by the pressure to charge a man with five accounts against him, and that emotions ran high in the courtroom, furthering the jury's pressure to convict Weinstein. Both Weinstein and Rotunno maintain that the women had consensual encounters with Weinstein, providing texts between the women and Weinstein that indicated potential consent.[142]

The accusations against Weinstein led to the disclosure of a number of victims of other sexual assaults by people in the film industry.

The Me Too movement still struggles with getting laws passed in certain areas of the United States. The U.S. government has not passed any laws for sexual harassment and abuse because Congress is holding out on it. Because no laws are not being passed, the movement stands up and continues to fight for social change. As they keep fighting, they get some changes across the U.S.&lt;ref name="North-2019"&gt;{{Cite web|last=North|first=Anna|date=October 4, 2019|title=7 positive changes that have come from the #MeToo movement|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/10/4/20852639/me-too-movement-sexual-harassment-law-2019|access-date=November 8, 2020|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some states, there has been banning of nondisclosure agreements because of the situation with Harvey Weinstein. He kept his assistant from speaking out for 20 years because of the nondisclosure agreement that Weinstein made him sign. So this banning has been enforced in states such as California, New Jersey and New York. There have been cases where the victims have been paid for their traumas. An example would be the case with [[Larry Nassar]], who used to be the doctor for the USA Gymnastics team. Nassar was sent to jail for 40 and 175 years for sexually assaulting more than 100 gymnasts on the team.

A 2021 study in the ''American Journal of Political Science'' found that supporters of the Me Too movement were far more even-handed when evaluating accusations of sexual misconduct in U.S. politics. Whereas partisans tended to be more likely to view accused out-party members as guilty of sexual misconduct than members of their party, Me Too supporters did not show similar degrees of favoritism towards their co-partisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klar |first1=Samara |last2=McCoy |first2=Alexandra |title=Partisan-Motivated Evaluations of Sexual Misconduct and the Mitigating Role of the #MeToo Movement |journal=American Journal of Political Science |date=October 2021 |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=777–789 |doi=10.1111/ajps.12619 |s2cid=237751225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the old system, complaints regarding the legislative branch were channeled through the [[United States Congress Office of Compliance|Office of Compliance]], which required complete confidentially through the process and took months of counseling and mediation before a complaint could be filed. Any settlement payments were paid using federal taxes, and it was reported that within a decade, $15&amp;nbsp;million of tax money had been spent settling harassment and discrimination complaints. The bill would ensure future complaints could only take up to 180 days to be filed. The bill would also allow the staffers to transfer to a different department or otherwise work away from the presence of the alleged harasser without losing their jobs if they requested it. The bill would require Representatives and Senators to pay for their harassment settlements. The Office of Compliance would no longer be allowed to keep settlements secret and would be required to publicly publish the settlement amounts and the associated employing offices. For the first time, the same protections would also apply to unpaid workers, including pages, fellows and interns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/360489-lawmakers-unveil-me-too-congress-bill-to-overhaul-sexual-harassment-policies/ |title=Lawmakers unveil 'ME TOO Congress' bill to overhaul sexual harassment policies |last=Marcos |first=Cristina |date=November 15, 2017 |website=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|access-date=January 4, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223010703/http://thehill.com/homenews/house/360489-lawmakers-unveil-me-too-congress-bill-to-overhaul-sexual-harassment-policies |archive-date=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/congress-harassment-policy-scandals-345481 |title=House unveils sweeping harassment overhaul after wave of scandals |website=[[Politico]]|date=January 17, 2018 |access-date=January 22, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072858/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/congress-harassment-policy-scandals-345481 |archive-date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578524736/bill-changes-how-congressional-sexual-harassment-claims-are-handled |title=Bill Changes How Congressional Sexual Harassment Claims Are Handled |newspaper=[[NPR]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |access-date=January 22, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122024352/https://www.npr.org/2018/01/17/578524736/bill-changes-how-congressional-sexual-harassment-claims-are-handled |archive-date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups of Christians, conservative women and [[Radical feminism|radical feminists]] have argued that #MeToo demonstrates pornography causes women to be viewed as sexual objects and contributes to the prevalence of sexual harassment. As a result, these groups believe the production and consumption of pornography should be greatly restricted or made illegal.&lt;ref name="Graves-2018"/&gt;

Others have pointed out that porn consumption in the U.S. is ballooning while rates of sexual violence and rape have been falling since the [[Anti-pornography movement in the United States|anti-pornography movement in the U.S.]] first emerged during the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Graves-2018"/&gt; Additionally, some commenters have stated that laws which make pornography illegal only further restrict women's bodily autonomy.&lt;ref name="Graves-2018"/&gt;

[[Lucia Graves]] stated in [[The Guardian]] that pornography can be empowering or enjoyable for women and depicting female sexuality is not always objectification.&lt;ref name="Graves-2018"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://dailytrojan.com/2018/04/05/you-do-uterus-female-sexuality-isnt-always-objectification/ |title=You Do Uterus: Female sexuality isn't always objectification {{!}} Daily Trojan|date=April 5, 2018|work=Daily Trojan|access-date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Award-winning porn actress and director [[Angela White]] says there is a "large positive shift within the industry" to more women directing and producing their own content and "to represent women as powerful sexual beings."&lt;ref name="Fabbri-2018"/&gt; Anti-porn activist [[Melissa Farley]] has said this ignores the "choicelessness" faced by many actresses in porn.&lt;ref name="Graves-2018"/&gt; Liberal advocates argue that anti-pornography movements in the U.S. have historically never tried to increase choices for vulnerable adult performers, and taking away a person's right to act in porn may hurt them economically by reducing their choices. Many adult performers have stated that the social stigma surrounding their type of work is already a major barrier to seeking help, and making porn illegal would leave them few options if they are suffering from sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="Fabbri-2018"/&gt;

As a result of #MeToo, many adult performers, sex worker advocates and feminists have called for greater protections for pornographic actresses, for example reducing social stigmas, mandating training courses that teach performers their rights, and providing access to independent hotlines where performers can report abuse. They argue that making porn illegal would only cause the production of porn to go underground where there are even fewer options for help. Some liberal activists have argued to compromise by raising the legal age of entry into adult entertainment from 18 to 21, which would prevent some of the most vulnerable women from being taken advantage of, while allowing adult women to still do what they want with their own bodies.&lt;ref name="Fabbri-2018"/&gt;

Some have pointed out that many young people who do not receive a sex education adopt ideas about sex and sexual roles from pornography, whose fantasy depictions of those behaviors are not accurate to life, as they are designed for purposes of adult entertainment, and not educating the public on the reality of sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Maggie |title=What Teenagers Are Learning From Online Porn |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/magazine/teenagers-learning-online-porn-literacy-sex-education.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas of the United States teach [[Birth control|birth-control]] methods only by [[abstinence]] from sex. In a 2015 article for the ''[[American Journal of Nursing]]'' David Carter noted that a study found that abstinence-based education was "correlated with increases in teenage pregnancies and births". Multiple people have voiced support for comprehensive [[sex education]] programs that encompass a wide range topics, which they state leave children more informed.&lt;ref name="Carter-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=Comprehensive Sex Education for Teens Is More Effective than Abstinence |journal=American Journal of Nursing |date=March 2012 |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=15 |doi=10.1097/01.NAJ.0000412622.87884.a3 |pmid=22373675 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several feminists have argued it is crucial to provide children with basic sex education before they are inevitably exposed to porn. Sex education can also effectively prepare children to identify and say no to unwanted sexual contact before it occurs, and gives parents an opportunity to teach children about consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/03/23/sex-ed-metoo-era-consent-parents/419690002/ |title=Sex ed: Many parents wouldn't recognize it today – and #metoo may change it even more |work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video games ===
{{see also|Sexism and video games}}In 2018, ''The Guardian'' reported that after the revelations about Weinstein, many women received solicitation emails hoping to uncover similar issues and spark the video games industry's #MeToo movement. This was in part due to the industry's notoriety for gender-based issues and toxicity in the gaming industry.

Beahm tweeted that he had "mutual conversations with a minor that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate," which former Twitch employees said was inaccurate, characterizing the messages as "graphic".

Creator [[Tarana Burke]] has laid out specific goals for the #MeToo movement, including: processing all untested rape kits in the United States, investigating the vetting of teachers, better protecting children at school, updating sexual harassment policies, and improving training in workplaces, places of worship and schools. She has stated that everyone in a community, including men and women, must act to make the #MeToo movement a success. She also supports the #MeToo Congress bill and hopes it will inspire similar legal changes in other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="Snyder-2017a"/&gt;

[[Samantha Geimer]], the victim of rape by film director [[Roman Polanski]], said that "when it's used as a weapon to attack famous people or harm and demonize certain people I don't think that's ever what #MeToo was meant for and it's become kind of toxic and lost its value".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/entertainment/2020/04/08/news/alleged-victim-defends-polanski-and-criticises-opportunistic-protesters-1895362/|title=Alleged victim defends Polanski and criticises 'opportunistic' protesters|date=April 8, 2020|website=Irish News|access-date=April 18, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some actors have admonished proponents of the movement for not distinguishing between different degrees of sexual misconduct.

Tarana Burke said in January 2018, "Those of us who do this work know that backlash is inevitable." While describing the backlash as carrying an underlying sentiment of fairness, she defended her movement as "not a witch hunt as people try to paint it". She stated that engaging with the cultural critique in #MeToo was more productive than calling for it to end or focusing on accused men who "haven't actually touched anybody".&lt;ref name="Jeffries-2018a"/&gt; [[Ronan Farrow]], who published the Weinstein exposé in the [[The New Yorker|''New Yorker'']] that helped start the #MeToo resurgence (alongside ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' reporters [[Megan Twohey]] and [[Jodi Kantor]]), was asked in late December 2017 whether he thought the movement had "gone too far". Farrow called for a careful examination of each story to guard against false accusations but also recalled the alleged sexual abuse his sister Dylan Farrow claims she went through at the hands of his father [[Woody Allen]]. He stated that after decades of silence, "My feeling is that this is a net benefit to society and that all of the people, men and women, pouring forward and saying 'me too' deserve this moment. I think you're right to say that we all have to be conscious of the risk of the pendulum swinging too far, but in general this is a very positive step."&lt;ref name=Williams4jan18&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Janice |url=http://www.newsweek.com/ronan-farrow-harvey-weinstein-metoo-755974 |title=Will innocent men become 'casualties' (sic) of #MeToo movement? |date=December 21, 2017 |website=[[Newsweek]] |access-date=January 5, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104131421/http://www.newsweek.com/ronan-farrow-harvey-weinstein-metoo-755974 |archive-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, it should also be determined whether one person has control or influence over the other person. She also states that one might decipher whether such a request is a certain threat or force. That's why she states that transacting in sex or exchanging sex for something means that coercion is still in the picture even if its consensual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tambe |first=Ashwini |date=2018 |title=Reckoning with the Silences of #MeToo |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.15767/feministstudies.44.1.0197 |journal=Feminist Studies |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=197–203 |doi=10.15767/feministstudies.44.1.0197 |jstor=10.15767/feministstudies.44.1.0197 |s2cid=150244127 |issn=0046-3663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist [[Steven Thrasher]] noted that, "There has been worry that the #MeToo movement could lead to a sex panic. But the real sex panic is not due to feminism run amok, but due to the patriarchal, homophobic, transantagonistic, theocratic desire of the U.S. Congress to control sex workers." He points to the 2018 [[Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act]] (SESTA), which many experts say will only put sex workers at further risk by causing them to go underground, does not offer sex workers any help or protections, and as a side effect prevents most people from using online personal ads regardless of their intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/29/sexual-freedom-fosta-sosta |title=Sexual freedom is at risk from these damning new bills passed by Congress {{!}} Steven W Thrasher|last=Thrasher|first=Steven W.|date=March 29, 2018|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failure to address police misconduct ===
Despite the prevalence of sexual misconduct, some have pointed out the lack of discussion in the #MeToo movement regarding law-enforcement misconduct.&lt;ref name="Goldman-2017"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/metoo-ignore-police-sexual-misconduct-757033 |title=Why aren't we talking about sexual misconduct by police? {{!}} Opinion|date= December 22, 2017|work=[[Newsweek]]|access-date= April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler-2018"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/copstoo-when-police-officers-use-sexual-assault-to-te-1823081788 |title=#CopsToo: When Police Officers Use Sexual Assault to Terrorize Vulnerable Communities |last=Butler |first=Danielle |work=Very Smart Brothas|access-date= April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-sexual-misconduct-metoo/ |title=As Hollywood &amp; Politicians Get Spotlight, Why Has Police Sexual Abuse Escaped #MeToo Movement? |date=December 25, 2017 |work=The Free Thought Project |access-date=April 7, 2018 |archive-date=April 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408074028/http://thefreethoughtproject.com/police-sexual-misconduct-metoo/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TCR-2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thecrimereport.org/2018/01/30/invisible-no-more-the-other-women-metoo-needs-to-defend/ |title='Invisible No More:' The Other Women #MeToo Should Defend {{!}} The Crime ReportThe Crime Report |website= thecrimereport.org|date=January 30, 2018 |access-date= April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police sexual misconduct disproportionately affects women of color, though women from all races are affected.&lt;ref name="TCR-2018"/&gt; The [[Cato Institute]] reported that in 2010, more than 9% of police misconduct reports in 2010 involved sexual abuse, and there are multiple indications that "sexual assault rates are significantly higher for police when compared to the general population."&lt;ref name="Butler-2018"/&gt; Fear of retribution is considered{{by whom|date=October 2018}} one reason some law-enforcement officers are not subjected to significant consequences for known misconduct.&lt;ref name="Goldman-2017"/&gt; Police-reform activist Roger Goldman stated that an officer who is fired for sexual misconduct from one police department often gets rehired by a different department, where they can continue the misconduct in a new environment.&lt;ref name="Goldman-2017"/&gt; Some states (such as Florida and Georgia) have licensing laws that can decertify a law-enforcement officer who has committed major misconduct, which prevents decertified officers from being hired again in that state.&lt;ref name="Goldman-2017"/&gt; Some have called for sexual misconduct allegations against police to be investigated by third parties to reduce bias (as opposed to the common practice of investigations being led by fellow law-enforcement officers or colleagues in the same department).&lt;ref name="TCR-2018"/&gt;

=== Lack of representation of minority women ===
Many have pointed to a lack of representation of minority women in the #MeToo movement or its leadership.&lt;ref name="Branigin-2018"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theroot.com/these-are-the-women-of-color-who-fought-both-sexism-and-1823720002 |title=These Are the Women of Color Who Fought Both Sexism and the Racism of White Feminists |last=Branigin |first=Anne |work=The Root|access-date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fessler-2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://qz.com/1150028/gloria-steinem-on-metoo-black-women-have-always-been-more-feminist-than-white-women/ |title=Gloria Steinem on #MeToo: Black women have always been more feminist than white women — Quartz |last=Fessler |first=Leah |website=Quartz|date=December 8, 2017 |access-date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Purtill-2017"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://work.qz.com/1147950/metoo-hijacked-black-womens-work-on-race-and-gender-equality/ |title=#MeToo hijacked black women's work on race and gender equality |work=Quartz at Work|access-date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beavers-2018"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://valleyadvocate.com/2018/01/31/metoo-black-women-periphery-movement/ |title=#MeToo?

Minority women are overrepresented in industries with the greatest number of sexual harassment claims, for example hotels, health, food services and retail.&lt;ref name="Purtill-2017"/&gt; It has been pointed out that undocumented minority women often have no recourse if they are experiencing sexual violence.&lt;ref name="Constante-2018"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hollywood-having-metoo-moment-women-color-have-fought-battle-decades-n841121 |title=Hollywood is having a #MeToo moment.

Survivor [[Farah Tanis]] stated there are also additional barriers for black women who want to participate in the #MeToo movement. She pointed out that social pressure discourages reports against black men, especially from church and family, because many would view that as a betrayal against their "brothers".&lt;ref name="Constante-2018"/&gt; Additionally, black women are less likely to be believed if they do speak out.&lt;ref name="Constante-2018"/&gt;

Some have argued that the American judicial system acknowledges the term "sexual harassment" only because of successful sexual harassment lawsuits by three black women: [[Diane R. Williams|Diane Williams]] and Paulette Barnes against the U.S. government, and Mechelle Vinson against a bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/ |title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women |last=Lipsitz |first=Raina |date=October 20, 2017 |work=The Nation |access-date=April 7, 2018 |archive-date=April 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408074746/https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinson's case of [[Meritor Savings Bank v.

Tarana Burke initially criticized the movement for ignoring the work of black women in creating dialogue addressing sexual assault. However, she did salute those who partook in the movement and credited Milano for acknowledging Burke's own similar movement.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-woman-me-too-movement-tarana-burke-alyssa-milano |title=Black woman Tarana Burke founded the 'Me Too' movement |last=Hill |first=Zahara |date=October 16, 2017 |website=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] |access-date=October 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017035553/http://www.ebony.com/news-views/black-woman-me-too-movement-tarana-burke-alyssa-milano |archive-date=October 17, 2017 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this, she pleaded to black women not to drop out of the movement just because the media isn't listening saying "This is your movement, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tarana-burke-tells-black-women-me-too-is-your-movement-too_us_5b967c8fe4b0162f472f65f6 |title=Tarana Burke Tells Black Women Me Too Is 'Your Movement, Too' |last=Vagianos |first=Alanna |website=[[HuffPost]] |date=September 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American feminist and journalist [[Gloria Steinem]] said there is a blind spot surrounding [[intersectionality]] between race and gender, and a major problem with today's feminists is they are not acknowledging "that women of color in general—and especially black women—have always been more likely to be feminist than white women."&lt;ref name="Branigin-2018"/&gt; Steinem argues that #MeToo could never have happened without the work of these women, and women in the #MeToo movement have a responsibility: "If you have more power, remember to listen as much as you talk. And if you have less power, remember to talk as much as you listen."&lt;ref name="Fessler-2017"/&gt;

The #MeToo movement has been criticized for putting too much public focus on the consequences of specific individuals who have been accused of sexual misconduct, as opposed to discussing policies and changes to institutional norms that would help people currently experiencing sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/6-perspectives-on-the-future-of-metoo/ |title=6 Perspectives on the Future of #MeToo |last1=Fonda |first1=Jane |date=December 13, 2017 |work=The Nation |access-date=February 1, 2018 |last2=Covert |first2=Bryce |last3=Pollitt |first3=Katha |last4=Meyerson |first4=Collier |last5=Lipsitz |first5=Raina |last6=Walsh |first6=Joan |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131001011/https://www.thenation.com/article/6-perspectives-on-the-future-of-metoo/ |archive-date=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's been noted that although allegations surrounding high-profile public figures tend to attract the most attention, the stories of regular workers often go unacknowledged.&lt;ref name="Frye-2018"/&gt; Yet to ensure meaningful change, these workers' experiences must be at the center of any policy solutions that lawmakers pursue. Tarana Burke has voiced similar misgivings, pointing out one problematic aspect of #MeToo is "All of this media attention is on the perpetrator. All of the conversation about fairness and due process is focused on the perpetrator." She states the movement should focus on specific steps to help current and future sufferers.&lt;ref name="Jeffries-2018c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/me-too-creator-tarana-burke-reminds-us-this-is-about-black-and-brown-survivors-20180104 |title=Me Too creator Tarana Burke reminds us this is about Black and Brown survivors |last=Jeffries |first=Zenobia |date=January 4, 2018 |website=[[Yes!

=== Disregard for incarcerated women ===
[[Prisoners' rights]] are significantly limited, and the power imbalance between female inmates and male officers allows and promotes [[prison rape]] and other forms of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-brown-me-too-women-prisons_us_5ac28e1de4b00fa46f854abf |title=Women in Prison Are Still Waiting For Their Me Too Moment |last=Brown |first=Kim |date=April 10, 2018 |work=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=February 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people have criticized the prison system for punishing women who act in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Yurcaba-2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rewire.news/article/2018/01/08/survivors-prison-rape-saying-isnt-option/ |title=For Survivors of Prison Rape, Saying 'Me Too' Isn't an Option |website=Rewire.News|date=January 8, 2018 |access-date=February 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others criticize the main outreach of the MeToo movement for failing to address the [[Prisoner abuse|systemic imprisonment of abused women and men]].&lt;ref name="Yurcaba-2018"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/09/20/when-prisoners-say-metoo |title=When Prisoners Say #MeToo |last=Metcalf |first=Jerry |date=September 21, 2018 |website=The Marshall Project|access-date=February 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/opinion/letters/female-prisoners-metoo.html |title=Opinion {{!}} Female Prisoners and #MeToo|date=October 8, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=February 19, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of #MeToo Behind Bars happened after a lawsuit was filed by four female inmates against correctional officers that brutally abused them.&lt;ref name="Sarai-2020"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Sarai |first=Tamar |date=2020-09-01 |title=Incarcerated women fight for a place in the #MeToo movement |url=http://prismreports.org/2020/09/01/incarcerated-women-fight-for-a-place-in-the-metoo-movement/ |access-date=2022-10-31 |website=Prism |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new campaign's purpose is to bring awareness to the public of sexual violence towards women in prison. Sara Kershner, lead campaign organizer, mentions that the perpetrators of this type of violence is usually the state, institutions and society.&lt;ref name="Sarai-2020"/&gt; She believes society disregards human rights of those who are incarcerated simply because they do not deserve them. As a result, there is no solidarity.
