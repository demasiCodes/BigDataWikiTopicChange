'''Domicide''' (from [[Latin]] ''domus'', meaning home or abode, and ''caedo'', meaning deliberate killing, though used here metaphorically), is the destruction of housing for corporate, political, strategic or bureaucratic reasoning.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Domicide {{!}} McGill-Queen’s University Press |url=https://www.mqup.ca/domicide-products-9780773522589.php |access-date=2024-08-29 |website=www.mqup.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also encompass the widespread destruction of a living environment, forcing the incumbent humans to move elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sullivan |first=Becky |date=9 February 2024 |title=What is 'domicide,' and why has war in Gaza brought new attention to the term? |url=https://www.npr.org/2024/02/09/1229625376/domicide-israel-gaza-palestinians |accessdate=21 May 2024 |website=[[National Public Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porteous |first=Douglas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOwb3IXYfoEC&amp;q=topocide&amp;pg=PA12 |title=Domicide: The Global Destruction Of Home |author2=Sandra E.

Rajagopal has argued that [[international law]] should be amended to consider domicide to be a [[war crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rajagopal |first=Balakrishnan |date=2024-01-29 |title=Opinion {{!}} Domicide: The Mass Destruction of Homes Should Be a Crime Against Humanity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/29/opinion/destruction-of-homes-crime-domicide.html |access-date=2024-01-29 |work=The New York Times |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Notable historical examples of domicide include: the [[Bombing of Tokyo]], which was the most destructive and deadly non-nuclear bombing in human history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Long |first=Tony |date=9 March 2011 |title=March 9, 1945: Burning the Heart Out of the Enemy |url=https://www.wired.com/2011/03/0309incendiary-bombs-kill-100000-tokyo/ |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |quote=1945: In the single deadliest air raid of World War II, 330 American B-29s rain incendiary bombs on Tokyo, touching off a firestorm that kills upwards of 100,000 people, burns a quarter of the city to the ground, and leaves a million homeless.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the bombing of [[Warsaw]] and [[Dresden]] and the destruction perpetrated by the [[Khmer Rouge]] in [[Cambodian Civil War#War crimes|Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Andrew E |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDfqfikFDmsC&amp;q=topocide&amp;pg=PA109 |title=Disaster and Development |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |isbn=9780203879238 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent [[Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip]] is considered to be the one of the most destructive campaigns in history.{{Citation needed|date=November 2024}} Balakrishnan Rajagopal, advisor to the United Nations on dams and Special Rapporteur on adequate housing has argued that Israel did domicide in the [[Gaza Strip]] during the [[Israel–Hamas war|Israel-Hamas war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2024-03-05 |title=UN rights expert condemns ‘systematic’ war-time mass destruction of homes {{!}} UN News |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147272 |access-date=2024-08-29 |website=news.un.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Mr. Balakrishnan Rajagopal |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures/sr-housing/mr-balakrishnan-rajagopal |website=United Nations Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
