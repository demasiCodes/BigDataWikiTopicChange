{{Feminism sidebar}}

'''Christian feminism''' is an aspect of [[feminist theology]] which seeks to advance and understand the [[sexual equality|equality]] of [[men]] and [[women]] morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a [[Christian]] perspective. Christian [[feminist]]s argue that contributions by women in that direction are necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that [[God]] does not [[discriminate]] on the basis of biologically-determined characteristics such as sex. Their major issues are the [[ordination of women]], male dominance in Christian [[marriage]], and claims of spiritual deficiency and inferiority of the abilities of women to interpret and exposit scripture compared to men. They also are concerned with issues such as the balance of [[parenting]] between [[mother]]s and [[father]]s and the overall treatment of women in the church. 

Certain Christians who sympathize with women's issues are uncomfortable with the term ''feminism''. One reason for this discomfort is the claim by some conservatives that Christian feminists are theological descendants of radical secular feminists such as [[Mary Daly]] and [[Betty Friedan]]. However, Christian feminists appeared on the scene much earlier than secular feminists (see "History" below). Increasingly, the term [[Christian egalitarianism]] is preferred by those advocating gender equality and equity among Christians. 

==History==

The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had taught that women are intrinsically inferior. Aristotle's discriminatory view was taken over the far more egalitarian views of [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]] by notable theologians such as [[Tertullian]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Chrysostom]], and [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt; Clack, Beverley. ''Misogyny in the Western Philosophical Tradition: A Reader.'' Routledge, 1999. ISBN 0415921821.&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant reformers [[John Calvin]] and [[John Knox]] also believed that men were spiritually and morally superior to women {{Fact|date=September 2008}}. Others{{Clarifyme|date=October 2008}}, such as [[Margaret Fell]] and [[Sojourner Truth]], were women. 

In the early 1800s some Christians began to teach that women are not innately inferior. Between 1808 and 1930, there appeared printed arguments in support of women's ministries. Thus emerged the first wave of Christian feminists. They advocated that the theology of gender and justice should be based on a whole-Bible approach rather than "proof texting" of isolated passages.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} Some notable first-wave Christian feminists include:
*[[Fredrik Franson]] (1852–1908). Founded the Evangelical Alliance Mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wheaton.edu/bgc/archives/GUIDES/087.htm (1) July 10, 1888—''Evangelistkurs''. Franson's announcement of Evangelist Course in Oslo beginning July 10, 9 a.m. He recounts blessings received through those who have worked as Evangelists, especially in the inland districts, since last winter—and especially so through the women evangelists. (2) Spring 1892—Franson's announcement concerning the founding and work of "The Scandinavian-American Women's Alliance Mission to Dark Places." (3) April 1896—''Profeterande Dottrar'' by Franson and [English] Prophesying Daughters by Franson—concerning women's' position in regard to evangelization.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Adoniram Judson Gordon|A. J. Gordon]] (1836–1895). The founder and first president of Gordon College.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gcts.edu/studentlife/ethos.php#women A.J. Gordon was a well-known advocate, in his day, of the preaching ministry of women.&lt;/ref&gt; "'Dr. A. J. Gordon stood by me steadily,' Frances Willard recalled."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jga/3.3/blum.html Blum, Edward (Baylor University).''Paul Has Been Forgotten: Women, Gender, and Revivalism during the Gilded Age.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Katharine Bushnell]] (1856–1946). Medical doctor, scholar, missionary, activist.
*[[Catherine Booth]] (1829–1890). Co-founder with her husband of the Salvation Army.
*[[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] (1839–1898). Preached at D. L. Moody revivals. President of Women's Christian Temperance Union.

==Other Definitions==
{{main|Evangelical}}
{{Unreferencedsection|date=October 2008}}
Combining the standard definition of feminism with Evangelical thought here is an alternative definition:  a discourse that involves various movements, theories and philosophies that are concerned with the issue of gender difference, which advocate equality for women, and campaign for women's rights and interests according to sound Biblical principles and the concept that the Bible is the infallible unadulterated word of God.{{Or|date=October 2008}}

==Issues==
{{GenderChristianity}}
===Women in church leadership===
{{main|Ordination of women}}
Feminism has affected many aspects of [[religion]]. In liberal branches of [[Protestant Christianity]] (and, notably, in some theologically conservative denominations, such as [[Assemblies of God]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=[[1990-08-14]] |url=http://ag.org/top/beliefs/position_papers/pp_downloads/pp_4191_women_ministry.pdf |title=The Role of Women in Ministry |format=[[PDF]] |pages=7 |publisher=The General Council of the Assemblies of God}}&lt;/ref&gt;) women are ordained as [[clergy]], and in [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] [[Judaism]], women are ordained as [[rabbi]]s and [[Hazzan|cantor]]s. Within these [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] groups, women have gradually obtained more positions of power; their perspectives now have greater influence in developing new statements of belief.

The leadership of women in religious matters continues to be restricted by many denominations. The [[Roman Catholic]] church, and [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] Protestant traditions such as the (American) Southern [[Baptist]] convention&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.net/aboutus/pswomen.asp SBC Position Statements - Women in Ministry&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, and the American "[[non-denominational]]" movement (that includes the [[Church of Christ]] and [[megachurch]]es)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/view/0034673x/ap060107/06a00020/1?frame=noframe&amp;userID=83d82910/01cc99331400501c40fcb&amp;dpi=3&amp;config=jstor Classifying Protestant Denominations]&lt;/ref&gt; generally exclude women from entering the priesthood and other clerical positions, limiting women to the roles of nuns or laypeople.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/l5p31j7w2q316882/ SpringerLink - Journal Article&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The argument against the ordination of women is based on the Biblical writings of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. Specifically, he writes that women should be silent in church and obedient to men: "...if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in church" (Corinthians 14:34-35); and in Timothy, "Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence" (2:11-12)

===Women as spiritually deficient===
Understanding whether women are spiritually deficient to men partly hinges on whether women are equipped spiritually with discernment to teach. The following passages also relate to whether women are inherently spiritually discerning as men:
*{{bibleref|Galatians|3:28}}. "There is neither…male nor female for all are one in Christ Jesus."
* '''Deborah''' of the [[Old Testament]] was a prophetess and "judge of Israel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amit.org.il/learning/english/JW/Deborah.htm Deborah the Prophetess]&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{bibleref|Genesis|2:20}}. The word translated "help" or "helper" is the same Hebrew word, "ēzer," which the Old Testament uses 17 times to describe the kind of help that God brings to His people in times of need; e.g., "Thou art my help (ēzer} and my deliverer," and "My help (ēzer) comes from the Lord."
*{{bibleref|Genesis|3:16}}. "To the woman he (God) said, 'I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.'"
 --&gt;

===Reproduction, sexuality and religion===
{{See also|Christianity and abortion}}
In the United States, conservative religious groups are often at philosophical odds with feminist and liberal religious groups over abortion and the use of birth control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plannedparenthood.org/news-articles-press/politics-policy-issues/abortion-access/antichoice-organizations-6127.htm Planned Parenthood]&lt;/ref&gt; These philosophical oppositions are manifest in courtroom and legislative battles, even making their way to the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/news/display.php?NewsID=10051 Religion News: Religious Opponents of Abortion Predict Supreme Court Shift&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholars like sociologist Flann Campbell have argued that conservative religious denominations tend to restrict male and female sexuality&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/view/00324728/di980713/98p0182w/0?frame=noframe&amp;userID=83d82910/01cc99331400501c40fcb&amp;dpi=3&amp;config=jstor Birth Control and Christian Churches]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=yUWz24sVu54C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP13&amp;dq=women+southern+baptist+convention&amp;ots=2zoqp_H0w-&amp;sig=4Jj4aGKdQ_Y98aJrpSg5vM5O8W8#PPA10,M1 Ordaining Women: Culture and Conflict in Religious Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/view/00324728/di980713/98p0182w/0 Birth Control and Christian Churches]&lt;/ref&gt;by prohibiting or limiting birth control use&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html Paul VI - Humanae Vitae&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, and condemning abortion as a [[sin]] likely punished by damnation to [[hell]] by [[God]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/baptist/sbcabres.html Southern Baptist Convention Resolutions on Abortion&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible-knowledge.com/Sin-of-Abortion.html Sin of Abortion and the Reasons Why&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these religious claims, mainline Protestant denominations (e.g. the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Methodist]], [[United Church of Christ]], [[Unitarian Universalist]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]] traditions), as well as [[Jewish]] denominations and the group [[Catholics for a Free Choice]] have formed the [[Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcrc.org/about/members.cfm RCRC - Member Organizations&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The RCRC often works as a feminist organization and in conjunction with other American feminist organizations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwlc.org/details.cfm?id=1223&amp;section=Reproductive%20Rights%3A%20General%20Materials National Women's Law Center&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- ===Women submitting to husbands===
The following passages relate to whether wives must submit to their husbands:
*{{bibleref|Ephesians|5:22}} Women are told to submit to their husbands.

===Head coverings===
In {{bibleref|1Corinthians|11:3–17}}, women are commanded to cover their heads in worship to show they recognize their husband's authority coming from the fact that man was created first and that he was created in God's image. However, one interpretation of this passage points out that Paul goes on to note that this was not necessary and that it was merely a cultural phenomenon, and whether women covered their heads or not was unimportant and not explicitly required.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} 

==The Bible==
{{Original research|date=April 2008}}
A major fundament of Christian Feminism is how people interpret the [[Bible]], particularly the influence of one's set of presuppositions on understanding the Bible. The same passages that one [[Christian denomination|denomination]] takes to say that women may do all sorts of very important things, but not preach to adult men, a Christian feminist might interpret otherwise. An historical approach can influence a Christian feminist's understanding of a passage by taking into account the specific [[cultural]] setting and circumstance of the time that the passage was written. 

===Some problematic passages===
A variety of biblical passages are used as authority to encourage women to not want leadership roles, exclusively in marriage and the pastorate. 

*{{bibleref|Job|2:10}} Job rebukes his wife for speaking as a foolish woman. The Bible also mentions men being foolish in many places.
*{{bibleref|Ecclesiastes|7:27-28}}{{Clarifyme|date=October 2008}}
*{{bibleref|Acts|1:21}} In English, being male appears as a prerequisite for apostlehood but in Greek{{Fact|date=June 2008}} the word encompasses both genders.
*{{bibleref|1Corinthians|11:3–16}} In some interpretations, women are commanded to cover their heads in worship to show they recognize their husband's authority coming from the fact that man was created first.
*{{bibleref|1Corinthians|14:34–35}} Women are told to be quiet in church.
*{{bibleref|Ephesians|5:22}} Women are told to submit to their husbands. 
*{{bibleref|1Timothy|2:11–12}} Women are told to be quiet in church because man was created first, and woman was deceived and sinned first.
*{{bibleref|Revelation|2:20}} The church of Thyatira is rebuked for letting a women teach. But this is not to be considered as against women. The problem here is the teacher is leading people to sexual sins.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

===Supportive passages===

*{{bibleref|Exodus|15:20}} [[Miriam]] is called a [[prophet]]ess.
*{{bibleref|Judges|4:4}} [[Deborah]], a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, leads Israel at as a Judge and a General.
*[[Eishes Chayil|Proverbs 31]] 10, 29 Women are commended when they are virtuous and valued as breadwinners.  The 'virtuous woman' is described as a manager of financial affairs.
*{{bibleref|Isaiah|8:3}} An anonymous prophetess is mentioned.
*{{bibleref|Joel|2:28–29}} A prophetic forecast that women and men alike will prophesy.
*{{bibleref|Luke|2:34–38}} Anna the prophetess is present for the [[male genital mutilation|circumcision]] of baby Jesus.
*Acts 9:36 A woman, Tabitha (Dorcas in Greek) is called a disciple "full of good works and almsdeeds".
*{{bibleref|Romans|16:1}} A woman, [[Phoebe]], is called a "diakonos," a Greek word meaning "one who serves", from which the English word "deacon" came.
*{{bibleref|Galatians|3:28}} "There is neither…male nor female for all are one in Christ Jesus."
