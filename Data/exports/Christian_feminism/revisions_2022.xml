'''Christian feminism''' is a school of [[Christian theology]] which seeks to advance and understand the [[sexual equality|equality]] of [[men]] and [[women]] morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a [[Christianity|Christian]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassey|first=Janette|date=1989|title= A Brief History of Christian Feminism|jstor=43052265|journal=Transformation|volume=6|issue=2|pages=1–5|doi=10.1177/026537888900600201|s2cid=150983833 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian [[feminist]]s argue that contributions by women, and an acknowledgment of women's value, are necessary for a complete understanding of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/0966735007072020|title = Modern Women, Traditional Abrahamic Religions and Interpreting Sacred Texts|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 15|issue = 2|pages = 145–159|year = 2007|last1 = Harrison|first1 = Victoria S.| s2cid=145641264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian feminists believe that [[God in Christianity|God]] does not [[Sexism|discriminate]] on the basis of biologically-determined characteristics such as sex and race, but created all humans to exist in harmony and equality, regardless of race or [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/08164649993083|title = Theme: Feminisms, Religions, Cultures, Identities|journal = Australian Feminist Studies|volume = 14|issue = 30|pages = 255–258|year = 1999|last1 = McPhillips|first1 = Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian feminists generally advocate for anti-[[essentialism]] as a part of their belief system, acknowledging that gender identities do not mandate a certain set of personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLeod-Harrison|first=Mark S.|date=September 2014|title=Christian Feminism, Gender and Human Essences: Toward a Solution of the Sameness and Differences Dilemma|journal=Forum Philosophicum|volume=19 |issue=2|pages=169–191|doi=10.5840/forphil20141921}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their major issues include the [[ordination of women]], [[Christian egalitarianism|biblical equality]] in [[marriage]], recognition of equal spiritual and moral abilities, [[abortion rights]], integration of [[Gender-neutral pronouns|gender neutral pronouns]] within readings of the Bible, and the search for a feminine or gender-transcendent divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/096673500100002604|title = 'Working for Change in the Position of Women in the Church': Christian Women's Information and Resources (CWIRES) and the British Christian Women's Movement, 1972-1990|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 9|issue = 26|pages = 44–69|year = 2001|last1 = Daggers|first1 = Jenny| s2cid=144674091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/096673509900002206|title = The Future of Christian Feminist Theologies—As I Sense it: Musings on the Effects of Historiography and Space|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 8|issue = 22|pages = 79–92|year = 1999|last1 = McEwan|first1 = Dorothea| s2cid=144816076 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/0966735007072034|title = The Possibility of a Gender-Transcendent God: Taking Macmurray Forward|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 15|issue = 2|pages = 236–255|year = 2007|last1 = McLntosh|first1 = Esther| s2cid=145121811 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/096673500401300104|title = In Woman's Image: An Iconography for God|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 13|pages = 40–61|year = 2004|last1 = Polinska|first1 = Wioleta| s2cid=170205207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian feminists often draw on the teachings of other religions and ideologies in addition to biblical evidence, and other Christian based texts throughout history that advocate for women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/096673509900002103|title = Thealogy and Theology: Mutually Exclusive or Creatively Interdependent?|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 7|issue = 21|pages = 21–38|year = 1999|last1 = Clack|first1 = Beverley| s2cid=143523339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassey|first=Janette|date=April 1989|title=A Brief History of Christian Feminism|journal= Transformation: An International Journal of Holistic Mission Studies|volume=6|issue=2|pages=1–5|doi=10.1177/026537888900600201|s2cid=150983833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[Christian egalitarianism]]'' is often preferred by those advocating gender equality and equity among Christians who do not wish to associate themselves with the [[Feminist movements and ideologies|feminist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Groothuis |first=Rebecca M. |url=http://www.christianethicstoday.com/CET/CET/CETJournal.pdf |title=Feminism Goes to Seed |journal=Christian Ethics Today |volume=5 |issue=6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195222/http://www.christianethicstoday.com/CET/CET/CETJournal.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Some Christian feminists believe that the principle of egalitarianism was present in the teachings of [[Jesus]] and the early Christian movements such as [[Marianismo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universidade Federal da Bahia: Mariana Cardoso Carvalho {{!}} Gênero {{!}} Etnia, raça e gênero|url=https://pt.scribd.com/document/400489853/9-As-Primeiras-Fronteiras-Fernando-Fernandez-e-Bernardo-Araujo|work=Scribd|access-date=2020-01-10|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200227164456/https://pt.scribd.com/document/400489853/9-As-Primeiras-Fronteiras-Fernando-Fernandez-e-Bernardo-Araujo|archive-date=2020-02-27|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is a highly contested view by many feminist scholars who believe that Christianity itself relies heavily on [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Sally K.|date=2004|title=The Marginalization of Evangelical Feminism|journal=Sociology of Religion|volume=65|issue=3|pages=215–237|doi=10.2307/3712250|issn=1069-4404|jstor=3712250}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{by whom|date=August 2018}} These interpretations of Christian origins have been criticized by secular feminists for "anachronistically projecting contemporary ideals back into the first century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 20487897|title = Christian Origins, Egalitarianism, and Utopia|journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|volume = 23|issue = 2|pages = 27–49|last1 = Beavis|first1 = Mary Ann|year = 2007|doi = 10.2979/FSR.2007.23.2.27| s2cid=144025040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]] [[Julian of Norwich]] and [[Hildegard of Bingen]] explored the idea of a divine power with both masculine and feminine characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Bauerschmidt |first=Frederick Christian |title=Seeing Jesus: Julian of Norwich and the Text of Christ's Body |journal=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies |volume=27 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=189–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/096673509900002203| title=Hildegard of Bingen: A Woman for our Time| journal=Feminist Theology| volume=8| issue=22| pages=25–41| year=1999| last1=Boyce-Tillman| first1=June| s2cid=144317390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist works from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries addressed objections to women learning, teaching and preaching in a religious context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/096673509900002206|title = The Future of Christian Feminist Theologies—As I Sense it: Musings on the Effects of Historiography and Space|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 8|issue = 22|pages = 79–92|year = 1999|last1 = McEwan|first1 = Dorothea| s2cid=144816076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such proto-feminist was [[Anne Hutchinson]] who was cast out of the [[Puritan]] colony of [[Massachusetts]] for teaching on the dignity and rights of women.&lt;ref&gt;Ellsberg, Robert.

The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] of feminism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries included an increased interest in the place of women in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassey|first=Janette|date=April 1989|title=A Brief History of Christian Feminism|journal= Transformation: An International Journal of Holistic Mission Studies|volume=6|issue=2|pages=1–5|doi=10.1177/026537888900600201|s2cid=150983833 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who were campaigning for their rights began to question their inferiority both within the church and in other spheres, which had previously been justified by church teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/096673500301200107| title=Imagining God in Our Ways: The Journals of Frances E.

During the 1960s and the 1970s many evangelical women were influenced by the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Sally K.|date=2004|title=The Marginalization of Evangelical Feminism|journal=Sociology of Religion|volume=65|issue=3|pages=215–237|doi=10.2307/3712250|issn=1069-4404|jstor=3712250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Feminists began writing and publishing articles that addressed reproductive rights as well as inequality in marriage and in the religious hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Sally K.|date=2004|title=The Marginalization of Evangelical Feminism|journal=Sociology of Religion|volume=65|issue=3|pages=215–237|doi=10.2307/3712250|issn=1069-4404|jstor=3712250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these articles, groups such as the EWC or [[Evangelical Women's Caucus]], and the ESA or [[Evangelicals for Societal Action]] were formed in order to create a social movement in the church towards equality, which was motivated by the Christian Feminist ideal that God created all people as equals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Sally K.|date=2004|title=The Marginalization of Evangelical Feminism|journal=Sociology of Religion|volume=65|issue=3|pages=215–237|doi=10.2307/3712250|issn=1069-4404|jstor=3712250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disputed section|date=October 2018}}
{{Religious text primary|section|date=March 2016}}

* {{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}}. "There is neither…male nor female for all are one in Christ Jesus."
* [[Deborah]] of the [[Old Testament]] was a [[prophetess]] and "judge of Israel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amit.org.il/learning/english/JW/Deborah.htm Deborah the Prophetess] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219100012/http://www.amit.org.il/learning/english/JW/Deborah.htm |date=2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Bibleref2|Genesis|2:20}}. The word translated "help" or "helper" is the same Hebrew word, "ēzer," which the Old Testament uses more than 17 times to describe the kind of help that God brings to His people in times of need; e.g., "Thou art my help (ēzer) and my deliverer," and "My help ''(ēzer)'' comes from the Lord." Never once in all these references is the word used to indicate subordination or servitude to another human being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godswordtowomen.org/ezerkenegdo.htm "Ezer Kenegdo" Word Study. God's Word to Women, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Bibleref2|Genesis|3:16}}. "To the woman he (God) said, 'I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.{{' "}}
* {{Bibleref2|1 Timothy|2:12}}. "But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."
* {{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|11:7-9}}. "For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man."
* {{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|14:34}}. "The women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says."
* {{Bibleref2|Colossians|3:18}}. "Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."
* {{Bibleref2|1 Peter|3:1}}. "Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives."
* {{Bibleref2|Ephesians 5:22-24}}. "Wives, be subject to your husbands as you are to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife just as Christ is the head of the church, the body of which he is the Savior. Just as the church is subject to Christ, so also wives ought to be, in everything, to their husbands."

=== Feminine or gender-transcendent God ===

{{see also|Gender of God}}

Some Christian feminists believe that gender equality within the church cannot be achieved without rethinking the portrayal and understanding of [[God]] as a [[masculinity|masculine]] being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/096673500100002807|title = Revisioning Christ|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 10|issue = 28|pages = 82–92|year = 2001|last1 = Kim|first1 = Grace Ji-Sun| s2cid=220706278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theological concept of [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]], usually seen as replacing or synonymous with the [[Holy Spirit]] in the [[Trinity]], is often used to fulfill this desire for symbols which reflect women's religious experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ignatian Spirituality and Christian Feminism|last=McCoy|first=Maria|year=2015|pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; How Sophia is configured is not static, but usually filled with emotions and individual expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/096673509900002206|title = The Future of Christian Feminist Theologies—As I Sense it: Musings on the Effects of Historiography and Space|journal = Feminist Theology|volume = 8|issue = 22|pages = 79–92|year = 1999|last1 = McEwan|first1 = Dorothea| s2cid=144816076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For some Christian feminists, the Sophia concept is found in a search for women who reflect contemporary feminist ideals in both the Old and New Testament.

== Critiques of Christian Feminism ==

=== Roman Catholicism ===
There have been multiple Popes, like Pope [[John Paul II]] and [[Pope Francis]], who have referenced a type of Feminism in their addresses to the public. Pope Francis is quoted saying the “irreplaceable role of the woman in the family … [t]he gifts of -delicacy … which are a richness of the feminine spirit, represent a genuine force for the life of the family … without which the human vocation would be unrealizable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=IN HIS THOUGHTS AND IN HIS WORDS: FRANCIS ON WOMEN by MIRIAM DUIGNAN|url=http://womensordinationcampaign.org/articles/2016/2/4/in-his-thoughts-and-in-his-words-francis-on-women-by-miriam-duignan|access-date=2020-10-11|website=Women's Ordination Worldwide|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men and women took Pope Francis words as a "vivid hope" that woman will take a more prominent role in the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2014-01-25|title=Pope wants 'capillary and incisive' role for women in church|url=https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/francis-chronicles/pope-wants-capillary-and-incisive-role-women-church|access-date=2020-10-11|website=National Catholic Reporter|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These same women and men also believe that "Radical Feminism" is the cause for the teachings of then Pope John Paul II to be viewed as negative, they also believe that Pope John Paul II was taking great strides, at least for his time, to include women in the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=A Pro-Woman Pope|url=https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/controversy/feminism/a-pro-woman-pope.html|access-date=2020-10-11|website=www.catholiceducation.org|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics of modern-day feminism believe that the negativity is not pointed in the right direction for the women's place in the Roman Catholic church.
&lt;!-- ===Women submitting to husbands===
The following passages relate to whether wives must submit to their husbands:

* {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:22}} Women are told to submit to their husbands.

=== Head coverings ===

In {{Bibleref|1Corinthians|11:3–17}}, women are commanded to cover their heads in worship to show they recognize their husband's authority coming from the fact that man was created first and that he was created in God's image. However, one interpretation of this passage points out that Paul goes on to note that this was not necessary and that it was merely a cultural phenomenon, and whether women covered their heads or not was unimportant and not explicitly required.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

== The Bible ==
{{Original research|date=April 2008}}

A major fundamental of Christian Feminism is how people interpret the [[Bible]], particularly the influence of one's set of presuppositions on understanding the Bible. The same passages that one [[Christian denomination|denomination]] takes to say that women may do all sorts of very important things, but not preach to adult men, a Christian feminist might interpret otherwise. An historical approach can influence a Christian feminist's understanding of a passage by taking into account the specific [[cultural]] setting and circumstance of the time that the passage was written.

In 1991 a group of leading evangelicals published the book Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism. Various authors contributed to the book in which they present biblical arguments critiquing evangelical Feminism and supporting a "complementarian" view of manhood and womanhood.

=== Some problematic passages ===

A variety of biblical passages are used as authority to encourage women to not want leadership roles, exclusively in marriage and the pastorate.

* {{Bibleref|Job|2:10}} Job rebukes his wife for speaking as a foolish woman. The Bible also mentions men being foolish in many places.
* {{Bibleref|Ecclesiastes|7:27-28}}{{Clarifyme|date=October 2008}}
* {{Bibleref|Acts|1:21}} In English, being male appears as a prerequisite for apostlehood but in Greek{{Fact|date=June 2008}} the word encompasses both genders.
* {{Bibleref|1Corinthians|11:3–16}} In some interpretations, women are commanded to cover their heads in worship to show they recognize their husband's authority coming from the fact that man was created first.
* {{Bibleref|1Corinthians|14:34–35}} Women are told to be quiet in church.
* {{Bibleref|Ephesians|5:22}} Women are told to submit to their husbands.
* {{Bibleref|1Timothy|2:11–12}} Women are told to be quiet in church because man was created first, and woman was deceived and sinned first.
* {{Bibleref|Revelation|2:20}} The church of Thyatira is rebuked for letting a women teach. But this is not to be considered as against women. The problem here is the teacher is leading people to sexual sins.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

=== Supportive passages ===

* {{Bibleref|Exodus|15:20}} [[Miriam]] is called a [[prophet]]ess.
* {{Bibleref|Judges|4:4}} [[Deborah]], a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, leads Israel at as a Judge and a General.
* [[Eishes Chayil|Proverbs 31]] 10, 29 Women are commended when they are virtuous and valued as breadwinners. The 'virtuous woman' is described as a manager of financial affairs.
* {{Bibleref|Isaiah|8:3}} An anonymous prophetess is mentioned.
* {{Bibleref|Joel|2:28–29}} A prophetic forecast that women and men alike will prophesy.
* {{Bibleref|Luke|2:34–38}} Anna the prophetess is present for the [[male genital mutilation|circumcision]] of baby Jesus.
* Acts 9:36 A woman, Tabitha (Dorcas in Greek) is called a disciple "full of good works and almsdeeds".
* {{Bibleref|Romans|16:1}} A woman, [[Phoebe]], is called a "diakonos," a Greek word meaning "one who serves", from which the English word "deacon" came.
* {{Bibleref|Galatians|3:28}} "There is neither…male nor female for all are one in Christ Jesus."
