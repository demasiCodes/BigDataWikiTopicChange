[[Image:Two seated men ca 1860.jpg|thumb|200px|right|'''Two Seated Men'''&lt;br&gt;In many societies, masculinity is understood to include open displays of same-sex non-sexual affection and physical contact. In other societies, such as the USA in recent times, such behavior is devalued and regarded as un-masculine.&lt;br&gt;Anonymous photo, USA, ca. [[1860]]]]

'''Masculinity''', is seen to be a [[virtue]] in a [[man]], a [[characteristic]] or trait which is part of a successful male's [[persona]]

The word '''masculine''' can refer to:
* the property of being biologically [[male]]
* a traditionally male gender role
* the masculine [[grammatical gender]]

The [[antonym]] of masculinity is [[feminity]] or [[effeminacy]].

==Sociology==
[[Sociologist]] Janet Saltzman Chafetz (1974, 35-36) describes seven areas of traditional masculinity:

#'''[[Physical]]'''--[[virile]], [[athletic]], [[strong]], [[brave]]. Sloppy, worry less about [[appearance]] and [[aging]];
#'''[[Functional]]'''--[[breadwinner]], provider;
#'''[[Sexual]]'''--sexually [[aggressive]], experienced. Single status acceptable; male "caught" by [[spouse]];
#'''[[Emotional]]'''--unemotional, [[stoic]], don't cry;
#'''Intellectual'''--[[logic]]al, [[intellectual]], [[rational]], [[objective]], [[scientific]], practical, [[mechanical]], public awareness, [[activity]], contributes to society; [[dogmatic]];
#'''[[Relationships|Interpersonal]]'''--[[leader]], [[dominating]]; [[disciplinarian]]; independent, [[free]], [[individualist]]ic; [[demand]]ing; and
#'''Other Personal Characteristics'''--[[aggressive]], [[status|success]]-orientated, [[ambitious]]; [[proud]], [[egotistical]], [[ambitious]]; [[moral]], [[trustworthy]]; decisive, [[competitive]], uninhibited, adventurous.
:(Levine, 1998, p.13)

==In women==
The converse of effeminacy in women is masculinity. In young girls this is also called "[[tom boy]]". An informal term for masculine women is "[[Butch_and_femme|butch]]", which is associated with [[lesbian]]ism. "Butch" is also used within the lesbian community, often without a negative connotation, but sometimes with a more specific meaning (Davis and Lapovsky Kennedy, 1989). Note that the adoption of attitudes normally associated with the opposite sex is perceived as a sign of [[homosexuality]].
