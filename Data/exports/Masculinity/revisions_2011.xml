[[File:Landsdowne Herakles.jpg|thumb|In Greek mythology, [[Heracles]] is synonymous with [[Apollonian]] masculinity.]]

'''Masculinity''' is, according to [[Collins Dictionary]], possessing qualities or characteristics considered typical of or appropriate to a man. The term can be used to describe any human, animal or object that has the quality of being masculine. When ''masculine'' is used to describe men, it can have degrees of comparison—''more masculine'', ''most masculine''.

The opposite can be expressed by terms such as ''unmanly'' or ''[[epicene]]''.&lt;ref name=Roget&gt;
''[[Roget's Thesaurus|Roget’s II: The New Thesaurus]]'', 3rd. ed., [[Houghton Mifflin]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
A typical near-[[synonym]] of masculinity is ''[[virility]]'' (from Latin ''[[:la:vir|vir]]'', man);&lt;ref name=Roget /&gt;
and the usual [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] is ''[[femininity]].''&lt;ref name=Roget /&gt;

== Literature review ==
=== Ancient ===

[[Cicero]] wrote that "a man's chief quality is [[courage]]."&lt;ref&gt;
"''Viri autem propria maxime est fortitudo''." Cicero, ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', 1:11:18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[literature]] goes back to about 3000 BCE. It includes both explicit statements of what was expected of men in [[law]]s, and implicit suggestions about masculinity in [[myth]]s involving [[god]]s and [[hero]]es. In 1000 BCE, The [[Hebrew Bible]] states King David of Israel told his son "Be strong, and be a man" upon David's death. Men throughout history have gone to meet exacting cultural standards of what is considered attractive. Kate Cooper, writing about ancient understandings of femininity, suggests that, "Wherever a woman is mentioned a man's character is being judged – and along with it what he stands for."&lt;ref&gt;
Kate Cooper, [http://books.google.com/books?id=QVvn8vUMZdIC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=%22wherever+a+woman+is+mentioned+a+man's+character+is+being+judged%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=lYAXvJa29I&amp;sig=LvrybebcK9gPm4PaJWe5934jD5Y ''The Virgin and The Bride: Idealized Womanhood in Late Antiquity'',] (Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Harvard University Press]], 1996), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  One well-known representative of this literature is the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' (from about 1750 BC).
*Rule 3: "If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death."
*Rule 128: "If a man takes a woman to wife, but has no intercourse with her, this woman is no wife to him."&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM ''The Code of Hammurabi''], translated by LW King, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholars suggest [[integrity]] and [[social equality|equality]] as masculine values in male-male relationships,&lt;ref&gt;
Karen Bassi, ['Acting like Men: Gender, Drama, and Nostalgia in Ancient Greece', ''Classical Philology'' '''96''' (2001): 86-92.]&lt;/ref&gt; and virility in male-female relationships. [[Legend]]s of ancient heroes include: ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh|The Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Such narratives are considered to reveal qualities in the hero that inspired [[respect]], like [[wisdom]] or [[courage]], the knowing of things that other men do not know and the taking of [[risk]]s that other men would not dare.

=== Medieval ===

[[Jeffrey Richards]] describes a European, "medieval masculinity which was essentially Christian and chivalric."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Richards, [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/cuva/1999/00000003/00000002/art00057 'From Christianity to Paganism: The New Middle Ages and the Values of ‘Medieval’ Masculinity,'] ''Cultural Values'' '''3''' (1999): 213-234.&lt;/ref&gt; Again ethics, courage and generosity are seen as characteristic of the portrayal of men (=niela) in literary history. In Anglo Saxon, ''[[Beowulf]]'' and, in several languages, the legends of [[King Arthur]] are famous examples of medieval ideals of masculinity. The documented ideals include many examples of an "exaulted" place for women, in romance and [[courtly love]].

==Masculine physical attributes==
[[Image:Lewis Hine Power house mechanic working on steam pump.jpg|thumb|right|During the first half of the twentieth century, men were often associated with images of [[industrialization]]]]

Some researchers argue that a number{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} of women may be aroused by broad chins and [[shoulder]]s and high [[cheekbones]], though there are cultural differences in those preferences, and arousal may be a mere indication of socialized notions of attractiveness. Other research suggests that women recognize a sculpted physique as indicative of "masculine" discipline and self-control.

== Biology and culture ==

[[Image:Marines wrestle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Direct competition of physical skill and strength is a feature of masculinity which appears in some form in virtually every culture on Earth. Here, two [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] compete in a [[wrestling]] match.]]

Some [[gender studies]] scholars will use the phrase "[[hegemonic masculinity]]" to refer to an ideal of male behavior which men are strongly encouraged to aim, which is calculated to guarantee the dominant position of some men over others.

=== Western trends ===
According to a paper submitted by [[Tracy Tylka]] to the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), in contemporary America: "Instead of seeing a decrease in [[objectification]] of women in society, there has just been an increase in the objectification of both sexes. And you can see that in the media today." Men and women restrict their food intake in an effort to achieve what they consider an attractively thin body, in extreme cases leading to [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/maleobj.htm Pressure To Be More Muscular May Lead Men To Unhealthy Behaviors]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Thomas Holbrook]], also a psychiatrist, cites a recent Canadian study indicating as many as one in six of those with eating disorders were men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9F02EED7133EF936A15755C0A9669C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Thinner: The Male Battle With Anorexia | first=Erica | last=Goode | date=2000-06-25 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Younger men and women who read fitness and fashion magazines could be psychologically harmed by the images of perfect female and male physiques," according to recent research in the United Kingdom. Some young women and men exercise excessively in an effort to achieve what they consider an attractively fit and muscular body, which in extreme cases can lead to [[body dysmorphic disorder]] or [[muscle dysmorphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7318411.stm | work=BBC News | title=Magazines 'harm male body image' | date=2008-03-28 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askmen.com/sports/bodybuilding/56_fitness_tip.html Muscle dysmorphia – AskMen.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/health/060815_bodyimage_men.html Men Muscle in on Body Image Problems | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the actual stereotypes may have remained relatively constant, the value attached to the masculine and feminine stereotypes seem to have changed over the past few decades.

Those associated with recent work in the study of masculinity from a philosophical perspective view masculinity as an unstable phenomenon and never ultimately achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Reeser, T. Masculinities in Theory, Malden: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masculinity in decline===

There has been a recent uptick of books, articles  and research studies documenting an endocrinological (or hormone) decline in the general male population.  Recent analysis shows average testosterone levels receding in men of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

==Development==
{{Section OR|date=December 2007}}
{{Main|Masculine psychology|Gender differences}}

[[File:PalmercarpenterA.jpg|thumb|A construction worker.]]

A great deal is now known about the development of masculine characteristics and the process of [[sexual differentiation]] specific to the reproductive system of ''Homo sapiens''. The [[SRY gene]] on the [[Y chromosome]] interferes with the process of creating a female, causing a chain of events that leads to [[testes]] formation, [[androgen]] production, and a range of both natal and post-natal hormonal effects. There is an extensive debate about how children develop [[gender identity|gender identities]].

In many cultures, displaying characteristics not typical to one's gender may become a social problem for the individual. Within [[sociology]] such labeling and conditioning is known as [[gender role|gender assumptions]], and is a part of [[socialization]] to better match a culture's [[mores]]. Among men, some non-standard behaviors may be considered a sign of [[homosexuality]], which frequently runs contrary to cultural notions of masculinity. When sexuality is defined in terms of object choice, as in early [[sexology]] studies, male homosexuality is interpreted as "[[feminine]]" sexuality. The corresponding social condemnation of excessive masculinity may be expressed in terms such as ''[[machismo]]'' or ''[[testosterone poisoning]]''.

The relative importance of the roles of socialization and genetics in the development of masculinity continues to be debated. While [[social conditioning]] obviously plays a role, some hold that certain aspects of the feminine and masculine identity exist in almost all human cultures, though this has not been thoroughly substantiated.

The historical development of gender role is addressed by such fields as [[behavioral genetics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[human ecology]], [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. All human [[culture]]s seem to encourage the development of gender roles, through [[literature]], [[costume]] and [[song]]. Some examples of this might include the epics of [[Homer]], the [[King Arthur]] tales in English, the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] commentaries of [[Confucius]]. More specialized treatments of masculinity may be found in works such as the [[Bhagavad Gita]] or [[bushidō]]'s [[Hagakure]].

Another term for a masculine woman is ''[[Butch and femme|butch]]'', which is associated with [[lesbian]]ism. ''Butch'' is also used within the lesbian community, without a negative connotation, but with a more specific meaning (Davis and Lapovsky Kennedy, 1989).

===Downside and failure of concept===
It is a subject of debate whether masculinity concepts followed historically should still be applied. Researchers such as Care International have argued that there is a harmful downside due to considerations such as the following:
* The relationship between masculinity and gender-based violence&lt;ref name="UNIFEM GENDER FACT SHEET No.5"&gt;UNIFEM GENDER FACT SHEET No.5&lt;/ref&gt;
* The disempowerment and impoverishment of women and the persistence of gender inequalities through men’s violence&lt;ref name="UNIFEM GENDER FACT SHEET No.5"/&gt;
* The loss of men's dignity and [[self-esteem]] when they are taught to behave violently

The images of boys and young men presented in the media may lead to the persistence of harmful concepts of masculinity. Men's rights activists argue that the media does not pay serious attention to men's rights issues and that men are often portrayed in a negative light, particularly in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, W. &amp; Sterba, J. P. (2008) Does Feminism Discriminate Against Men: A Debate (Point and Counterpoint), New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pressures associated===
In 1987, Eisler and Skidmore did studies on masculinity and created the idea of 'masculine stress'. They found four mechanisms of masculinity that accompany masculine gender role often result in emotional stress. They include:

* The emphasis on prevailing in situations requiring body and fitness
* Being perceived as emotional
* The need to feel adequate in regard to sexual matters and financial status

Because of social norms and pressures associated with masculinity, Men with spinal cord injuries have to adapt their self identity to the losses associated with SCI which may “lead to feelings of decreased physical and sexual prowess with lowered self-esteem and a loss of male identity. Feelings of guilt and overall loss of control are also experienced.”&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Susan L "Heroic masculinity following spinal cord injury: Implications for therapeutic recreation practice and research". Therapeutic Recreation Journal. FindArticles.com. 07 Apr, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Masculinity is something that some fear is becoming increasingly challenged, especially in the last century, with the emergence of [[Women's rights]] and the development of the role of women in society. In recent years many 'Man Laws' and similar [[masculinist]] manifestos have been published, as a way for men to re-affirm their masculinity. A popular example is the Miller Lite [[Man Laws]], and other various sites on the internet offering rules such as: "15. A real man does not need instruction manuals."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fuckingmanly.com/man-rules|title= List of Man Law Rules/Rules for Men |publisher= Fucking Manly|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of these rules are offered in a humorous fashion, they attempt to define masculinity, and indicate that proper gender is taught and performed rather than intuited.

===Risk-taking===
The driver crash rate per vehicle miles driven is higher for women than for men; although, men are much more likely to cause deaths in the accidents they are involved in.&lt;ref&gt;Johns Hopkins School Of Public Health (1998, June 18). [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/06/980618032130.htm Women Not Neccessarily Better Drivers Than Men.] ScienceDaily.&lt;/ref&gt; Men drive significantly more miles than women, so, on average, they are more likely to be involved in [[road traffic accident|motor vehicle accident]]s. Even in the narrow category of  young (16-20) driver fatalities with a high [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC), a male's risk of dying is higher than a female's risk at the Same BAC level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/98.010.PDF Crash Data and Rates for Age-Sex Groups of Drivers, 1996], Ezio C. Cerrelli, January 1998, National Center for Statistics &amp; Analysis - Research &amp; Development&lt;/ref&gt; That is, young women drivers need to be more drunk to have the same risk of dying in a fatal accident as young men drivers. Men are in fact three times more likely to die in all kinds of accidents than women. In the United States, men make up 92% of workplace deaths, indicating either a greater willingness to perform dangerous work, a societal expectation to perform this work, or that women are not hired for this work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0005.pdf CFOI Charts, 1992–2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
A growing body of evidence is pointing toward the deleterious impact of masculinity (and hegemonic masculinity in particular) on men's health help-seeking behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Galdas P.M., Cheater F. &amp; Marshall P. (2005) Men and health help-seeking behaviour: Literature review. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 49, 616-23&lt;/ref&gt; American men make 134.5 million fewer physician visits than American women each year. In fact, men make only 40.8% of all physician visits, that is, if women's visits for pregnancy are included, childbirth and associated obstetrical and gynecological visits. A quarter of the men who are 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician. Many men should go to annual heart checkups with physicians but do not, increasing their risk of death from [[heart disease]]. Men between the ages of 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from [[cardiovascular disease]] than women. Men are more likely to be diagnosed in a later stage of a [[terminal illness]] because of their reluctance to go to the doctor.

Reasons men give for not having annual physicals and not visiting their physician include [[fear]], [[denial]], [[embarrassment]], a dislike of situations out of their control, or not worth the time or cost.

====Media encouragement====
According to Arran Stibbe (2004), men's health problems and behaviors can be linked to the socialized gender role of men in our culture. In exploring magazines, he found that they promote traditional masculinity and claims that, among other things, men's magazines tend to celebrate "male" activities and behavior such as admiring guns, fast cars, sexually libertine women, and reading or viewing [[pornography]] regularly. In men's magazines, several "ideal" images of men are promoted, and that these images may even entail certain health risks.

====Alcohol consumption behavior====
Research on beer commercials by [[Lance Strate|Strate]] (Postman, Nystrom, Strate, And Weingartner 1987; Strate 1989, 1990) and by Wenner (1991) show some results relevant to studies of masculinity. In beer commercials, the ideas of masculinity (especially risk-taking) are presented and encouraged. The commercials often focus on situations where a man is overcoming an obstacle in a group. The men will either be working hard or playing hard. For instance the commercial will show men who do physical labor such as construction workers, or farm work, or men who are [[cowboy]]s. Beer commercials that involve playing hard have a central theme of mastery (over nature or over each other), risk, and adventure. For instance, the men will be outdoors [[fishing]], [[camping]], playing sports, or hanging out in [[bar (establishment)|bars]]. There is usually an element of [[Risk|danger]] as well as a focus on movement and speed. This appeals to and emphasizes the idea that real men overcome danger and enjoy speed (i.e. fast cars/driving fast). The bar serves as a setting for the measurement of masculinity (skills like [[billiards|pool]], [[physical strength|strength]] and drinking ability) and serves as a center for male socializing.

==Traditional Masculinity==

[[File:06-09-09(27).jpg|thumb|left|240px|Father with his son]]
Traditional avenues for men to gain honor were that of providing adequately for their families and exercising leadership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;George, A., “Reinventing honorable masculinity” Men and Masculinities&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional family structure consisted of the [[father]] as the bread-winner and the [[mother]] as the [[homemaker]]. During [[World War II]], women entered the workforce in droves to replace the soldiers who were sent overseas. While some returned home to resume their positions as homemakers if their husbands survived the war, and others remained in the workplace. Over the decades since, women have risen to high political and corporate positions. This shift has caused an increase in women becoming the primary income-earners and men the primary care-givers&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; --a process author [[Jeremy Adam Smith]] calls "the daddy shift" in his 2009 book of that title.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jeremy Adam. The Daddy Shift. Boston: Beacon Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, 159,000 dads were primary care-givers and this number is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://careerplanning.about.com/cs/altoptgenl/a/stay_home_dads.htm Stay-at-Home Dads], By Dawn Rosenberg McKay, About.com Guide&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed [[stay-at-home dad]]s, these men are performing duties in the home which are not being done by women. Regardless of age or nationality, men more frequently rank [[good health]], harmonious family life and good relationships with their spouse or partner as important to their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tricitypsychology.com/blog/men-defy-stereotypes-in-defining-masculinity/ Men defy stereotypes in defining masculinity], August 26, 2008, Tri-City Psychology Services&lt;/ref&gt;
