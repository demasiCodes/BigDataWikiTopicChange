'''Masculinity''' (also called '''manhood''' or '''manliness''') is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with boys and men.

==Overview==
Masculine qualities and roles are considered typical of, appropriate for, and expected of boys and men. The concept of masculinity varies historically and culturally; although the [[dandy]] was seen as a 19th-century ideal of masculinity, he is considered [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] by modern standards.&lt;ref name = "Reeser"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reeser | first = Todd W. | title = Masculinities in theory: an introduction | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4051-6859-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YMnn8Zf0heoC | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}} Masculine norms, as described in [[Ronald F.

The academic study of masculinity received increased attention during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the number of courses on the subject in the United States rising from 30 to over 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |last=Bradley |first=Rolla M. |date=2008|title=Masculinity and self perception of men identified as informal leaders |publisher= [[University of the Incarnate Word]] | url = https://athenaeum.uiw.edu/uiw_etds/190/|oclc=1004500685}} [https://search.proquest.com/openview/bb91cf3b301335a7d97da0d80aed98a6/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y View online preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; This has sparked investigation of the intersection of  masculinity with other axes of social discrimination and concepts from other fields, such as the [[social construction of gender difference]]&lt;ref name="Flood 2007 Viii"&gt;{{cite book | last = Flood | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Flood | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities |page=viii | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUON2SYps-QC | isbn = 9780415333436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (prevalent in a number of [[philosophical]] and [[sociological]] theories).

Both males and females can exhibit masculine traits and behavior. Those exhibiting both masculine and [[feminine]] characteristics are considered [[androgynous]], and feminist philosophers have argued that gender ambiguity may blur gender classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = [[Gender Trouble|Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity]] | publisher = Routledge | location = New York London | year = 2006 | origyear = 1990 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Laurie | first = Timothy | title = The ethics of nobody I know: gender and the politics of description | journal = Qualitative Research Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–78 | publisher = [[Emerald Group Publishing|Emerald]] | doi = 10.1108/QRJ-03-2014-0011 | date = 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/QRJ-03-2014-0011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/6262250/The_Ethics_of_Nobody_I_Know_Gender_and_the_Politics_of_Description Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since what constitutes masculinity has varied by time and place, according to [[Raewyn Connell]], it is more appropriate to discuss "masculinities" than a single overarching concept.&lt;ref name="Connell_2005" /&gt;{{rp|185}} Study of the history of masculinity emerged during the 1980s, aided by the fields of women's and (later) gender history. Before women's history was examined, there was a "strict gendering of the public/private divide"; regarding masculinity, this meant little study of how men related to the household, domesticity and family life.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Tosh, John (1999), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Br8JCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Introduction: masculinity and domesticity]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Tosh | editor-first = John | title = A man's place: masculinity and the middle-class home in Victorian England |page=2 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780300077797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although women's historical role was negated, despite the writing of history by (and primarily about) men, a significant portion of the male experience was missing. This void was questioned during the late 1970s, when women's history began to analyze gender and women to deepen the female experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Davis | first = Natalie Z. | title = "Women's history" in transition: the European case | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 3 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 83–103 | publisher = Feminist Studies, Inc. | doi = 10.2307/3177729 | jstor = 3177729  | date = Spring–Summer 1976 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/3177729 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Scott's seminal article, calling for gender studies as an analytical concept to explore society, power and discourse, laid the foundation for this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Scott | first = Joan W. | title = Gender: a useful category of historical analysis | journal = [[The American Historical Review]] | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1053–1075 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/ahr/91.5.1053 | jstor = 1864376 | date = December 1986 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/ahr/91.5.1053 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scott, gender should be used in two ways: productive and produced. Productive gender examined its role in creating power relationships, and produced gender explored the use and change of gender throughout history. This has influenced the field of masculinity, as seen in Pierre Bourdieu's definition of masculinity: produced by society and culture, and reproduced in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bourdieu | first = Pierre | title = Masculine domination | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780745622651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A flurry of work in women's history led to a call for study of the male role (initially influenced by psychoanalysis) in society and emotional and interpersonal life. Connell wrote that these initial works were marked by a "high level of generality" in "broad surveys of cultural norms". The scholarship was aware of contemporary societal changes aiming to understand and evolve (or liberate) the male role in response to feminism.&lt;ref name="Connell_2005" /&gt;{{rp|28}}John Tosh calls for a return to this aim for the history of masculinity to be useful, academically and in the public sphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Steedman, Carolyn (1992), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EzD4fdELEioC&amp;pg=PA614 Culture, cultural studies and the historians]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Grossberg | editor-first1 = Lawrence | editor-last2 = Nelson | editor-first2 = Cary | editor-last3 = Treichler | editor-first3 = Paula | title = Cultural studies | page = 617 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | isbn = 9780415903455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Odysseus sehnt sich nach Ithaka (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of Odysseus leaning on a ship|[[Odysseus]], hero of the ''Odyssey'']]
Ancient literature dates back to about 3000 BC, with explicit expectations for men in the form of laws and implied masculine ideals in myths of gods and heroes. In the [[Hebrew Bible]] of 1000 BC, King David of Israel told his son, "I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Bible Gateway passage: 1 Kings 2:2 - King James Version |url= https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+2:2&amp;version=KJV | website = biblegateway.com |publisher=Bible Gateway |access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after David's death. Throughout history, men have met exacting cultural standards. Kate Cooper wrote about ancient concepts of femininity, "Wherever a woman is mentioned a man's character is being judged – and along with it what he stands for."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Kate (1996), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=QVvn8vUMZdIC&amp;pg=PA19 Private lives, public meanings]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Cooper | editor-first = Kate | title = The virgin and the bride: idealized womanhood in late antiquity | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QVvn8vUMZdIC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 | page = 19 | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 9780674939509 | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' (about 1750 BC):
*Rule 3: "If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death."
*Rule 128: "If a man takes a woman to wife, but has no intercourse with her, this woman is no wife to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hammurabi | author-link = Hammurabi | others = L.W.

Legends of ancient heroes include the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The stories demonstrate qualities in the hero which inspire [[respect]], such as wisdom and courage: knowing things other men do not know and taking risks other men would not dare.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Medieval and Victorian eras ===
[[File:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Beowulf, holding a sword, blocks a dragon's fire with his shield.|Beowulf fighting the dragon]]

[[Jeffrey Richards]] describes a European "medieval masculinity which was essentially Christian and chivalric".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richards | first = Jeffrey | title = From Christianity to Paganism: The New Middle Ages and the Values of 'Medieval' Masculinity | journal = Cultural Values | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–234 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14797589909367162 | date = 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14797589909367162 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courage, respect for women of all classes and generosity characterize the portrayal of men in literary history. The [[Anglo-Saxon]]s [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and [[Beowulf]] are examples of medieval masculine ideals. According to David Rosen, the traditional view of scholars (such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]) that ''Beowulf'' is a tale of medieval [[heroism]] overlooks the similarities between Beowulf and the monster Grendel. The masculinity exemplified by Beowulf "cut[s] men off from women, other men, passion and the household".&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, David (1993), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pXgBaWrB4OYC&amp;pg=PA11 The armor of the man-monster in Beowulf]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Rosen | editor-first = David | title = The changing fictions of masculinity | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Urbana | page = 11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXgBaWrB4OYC | isbn = 9780252063091 | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Victorian era, [[Victorian masculinity|masculinity]] underwent a transformation from traditional heroism. Scottish philosopher [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in 1831: "The old ideal of Manhood has grown obsolete, and the new is still invisible to us, and we grope after it in darkness, one clutching this phantom, another that; [[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Werterism]], [[Byron]]ism, even [[Beau Brummell|Brummelism]], each has its day".&lt;ref&gt;Adams, James Eli (1995), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f7gwHwyxZJ4C&amp;pg=PA1 Introduction]", in {{cite book |editor-last=Adams |editor-first=James Eli | title = Dandies and desert saints: styles of Victorian masculinity |page=1 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, New York | isbn = 9780801482083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boxing was professionalized in America and Europe in the 19th century, and emphasized the physical and confrontational aspects of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher David Thrasher, ''Fight Sports and American Masculinity: Salvation in Violence from 1607 to the Present'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  Bare-knuckle fighting without gloves represented "the manly art" in 19th century America.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott J. Gorn, ''The Manly Art: Bare-Knuckle Prize Fighting in America'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Modern times}} Twentieth century to present ===

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a traditional family consisted of the father as  [[breadwinner model|breadwinner]] and the mother as [[homemaker]]. Despite women's increasing participation in the paid labor force and contributions to family income, men's identities remained centered on their working lives and specifically their economic contributions. Central to adult men's identities is the provider role, as masculinity is often measured by the size of one's paycheck/economic contribution to the family.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, R. 1974. Measuring masculinity by the size of a paycheck. In: J. Pleck &amp; J. Sawyer (Eds.) ''Men and masculinity'' (pp. 96 – 100). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinity is also secured by denying any semblance of softness, emotion, femininity, or any characteristic associated with women and femininity.&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, C. J. (2012). ''Dude, you're a fag : masculinity and sexuality in high school.'' Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overwhelmingly, the construction of masculinity most valued in the latter part of the twentieth century to today is one that is independent, sexually assertive, and athletic, among other normative markers of manhood.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kaufman, ed. 1987. ''Beyond patriarchy : essays by men on pleasure, power, and change''. New York : Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pappas, Nick T., Patrick C. McKenry, &amp; Beth Skilken Catlett. 2004. "Athlete Aggression on the Rink and off the Ice Athlete Violence and Aggression in Hockey and Interpersonal Relationships." ''Men and Masculinities'' 6:291-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grazian, David. 2007. "The Girl Hunt: Urban Nightlife and the Performance of Masculinity as Collective Activity." ''Symbolic Interaction'' ''30''(2), 221-243. doi:10.1525/si.2007.30.2.221&lt;/ref&gt; Social theorist [[Erving Goffman]]'s seminal work on stigma management presents a list of traits prescribed as categorically masculine for contemporary men:&lt;blockquote&gt;In an important sense there is only one complete unblushing male in America: a young, married, white, urban, northern, heterosexual Protestant father of college education, fully employed, or good complexion, weight and height, and a recent record in sports.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1963. ''Stigma: Notes On The Management Of Spoiled Identity''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:128&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is some evidence of masculinities undergoing shifts in the contemporary social landscape. Characteristic of present-day masculinity is men's willingness to counter stereotypes. Regardless of age or nationality, men more frequently rank good health, a harmonious family life and a good relationship with their spouse or partner as important to their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=26 August 2008 |title=Research and insights from Indiana University |url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/tips/page/normal/8690.html |location= |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |access-date=13 March 2017}}

In many cultures, displaying characteristics not typical of one's gender may be a social problem. In [[sociology]], this labeling is known as [[gender role|gender assumptions]] and is part of [[socialization]] to meet the [[mores]] of a society.

The relative importance of socialization and genetics in the development of masculinity is debated. Although [[social conditioning]] is believed to play a role, [[psychologist]]s and [[psychoanalysts]] such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] believed that aspects of "feminine" and "masculine" identity are [[subconscious]]ly present in all human males.{{efn|See [[innate bisexuality]] and [[anima and animus]] for more information.}}

The historical development of gender roles is addressed by [[behavioural genetics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[human ecology]], [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. All human cultures seem to encourage gender roles in literature, costume and song; examples may include the epics of [[Homer]], the [[Hengist and Horsa]] tales and the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] commentaries of [[Confucius]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} More specialized treatments of masculinity may be found in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and the [[Bushido|bushidō]] of ''[[Hagakure]]''.

===Nature versus nurture===
{{main|Nature versus nurture}}

The sources of [[gender identity]] are debated. Some believe that masculinity is linked to the male body; in this view, masculinity is associated with [[human penis|male genitalia]].&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Others have suggested that although masculinity may be influenced by biology, it is also a cultural construct. Proponents of this view argue that women can become men [[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|hormonally]] and [[Sex reassignment surgery|physically]],&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|3}} and many aspects of masculinity assumed to be natural are linguistically and culturally driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Sara | title = Third wave feminist linguistics and the analysis of sexism | journal = Discourse Analysis Online | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | publisher = [[Sheffield Hallam University]] | date = 2003 | url = http://extra.shu.ac.uk/daol/articles/closed/2003/001/mills2003001-paper.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the nurture side of the debate, it is argued that masculinity does not have a single source. Although the military has a vested interest in constructing and promoting a specific form of masculinity, it does not create it.&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|17–21}} Facial hair is linked to masculinity through language, in stories about boys becoming men when they begin to shave.&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}}

In contrast to earlier perspectives of the nature versus nurture debate, contemporary social scientists suggest masculinity to stem from both nature ''and'' nurture, as both biological predispositions and social factors intersect to give rise to masculine gender identities.&lt;ref name="footnote.co"&gt;''Fausto-Sterling, Anne. 2014. "Where Does Gender Come From?" Footnote.'' http://footnote.co/where-does-gender-come-from/&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars suggest that innate differences between the sexes are compounded and/or exaggerated by the influences of social factors.&lt;ref name="footnote.co"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wharton, Amy S. 2012.

Ed. by H. Crowley and S. Himmelweit. Polity/Open University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social construction of masculinity===
Social scientists conceptualize masculinity (and femininity) as a performance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Butler|Butler, Judith]] (2006) [1990]. ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity]]''. New York London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masculinities"&gt;[[Raewyn Connell|Connell, R.W.]] (2005). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC ''Masculinities''] (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Candace, and Don H. Zimmerman. 1987. “Doing Gender.” ''Gender &amp; Society'' 1:125–151&lt;/ref&gt; Gender performances may not necessarily be intentional and people may not even be aware of the extent to which they are performing gender, as one outcome of lifelong gender socialization is the feeling that one's gender is "natural" or biologically-ordained.

The social construction of gender also conceptualizes gender as a continuum. Theorists suggest one is not simply masculine or feminine, but instead may display components of both masculinity and femininity to different degrees and in particular contexts.

Masculine performance varies over the life course, but also from one context to another. For instance, the sports world may elicit more traditionally normative masculinities in participants than would other settings.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Michael A. 1992. ''Power at Play: Sports and the Problem of Masculinity''. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Men who exhibit a tough and aggressive masculinity on the sports field may display a softer masculinity in familial contexts. Masculinities vary by social class as well. Studies suggest working class constructions of masculinity to be more normative than are those from middle class men and boys.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Edward W. 2008. “Rednecks,” “Rutters,” and `Rithmetic: Social Class, Masculinity, and Schooling in a Rural Context." ''Gender &amp; Society'' 22 (6): 728-751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Karin A. 1996. ''Puberty, Sexuality, and the Self: Boys and Girls at Adolescence''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; As these contexts and comparisons illustrate, theorists suggest a multiplicity of masculinities, not simply one single construction of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Masculinities"/&gt;

==Hegemonic masculinity==
{{Main|Hegemonic masculinity}}

Traditional avenues for men to gain honor were providing for their families and exercising leadership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last= George | first = Annie | title = Reinventing honorable masculinity: discourses from a working-class Indian community | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 35&amp;ndash;52 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X04270379 |date= July 2006 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X04270379 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raewyn Connell]] has labeled traditional male roles and privileges [[hegemonic masculinity]], encouraged in men and discouraged in women: "Hegemonic masculinity can be defined as the configuration of gender practice which embodies the currently accepted answer to the problem of the legitimacy of [[patriarchy]], which guarantees the dominant position of men and the subordination of women".&lt;ref name="Connell_2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Masculinities | date = 2005 | edition = 2nd | location = Cambridge | publisher = Polity  | isbn=9780745634265 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}} Connell (1987) placed emphasis on heterosexuality and its influence on the construction of gender. From this perspective, in every social system there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealised form of masculinity and an apotheosised form of femininity that is considered as proper for men and women. This idealised form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalises certain performances of men, and pathologises, marginalises, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalised and subordinated), which according to the findings of a plethora of studies are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasised femininity, marginalised and subordinated masculinities).&lt;ref&gt;Kostas, M.

==Precarious manhood==
Researchers have argued that the "precariousness" of manhood contributes to traditionally-masculine behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = Jennifer K. | last2 = Vandello | first2 = Joseph A. | title = Precarious manhood and its links to action and aggression | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 82–86 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0963721411402669 | date = April 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721411402669 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Precarious" means that manhood is not inborn, but must be achieved. In many cultures, boys endure painful initiation rituals to become men. Manhood may also be lost, as when a man is derided for not "being a man". Researchers have found that men respond to threats to their manhood by engaging in stereotypically-masculine behaviors and beliefs, such as supporting hierarchy, espousing homophobic beliefs, supporting aggression and choosing physical tasks over intellectual ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vandello | first1 = Joseph A. | last2 = Bosson | first2 = Jennifer K. | last3 = Cohen | first3 = Dov | last4 = Burnaford | first4 = Rochelle M. | last5 = Weaver | first5 = Jonathan R. | title = Precarious manhood | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 1325–1339 | publisher = [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0012453 | date = December 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0012453 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Winegard and Geary wrote that the precariousness of manhood involves social status (prestige or dominance), and manhood may be more (or less) precarious due to the avenues men have for achieving status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Winegard | first1 = Bo M. | last2 = Winegard | first2 = Ben | last3 =  Geary | first3 = David C. | title = Eastwood’s brawn and Einstein’s brain: an evolutionary account of dominance, prestige, and precarious manhood | journal = [[Review of General Psychology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–48 | publisher = [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0036594 | date = March 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0036594 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men who identify with creative pursuits, such as poetry or painting, may not experience manhood as precarious but may respond to threats to their intelligence or creativity. However, men who identify with traditionally-masculine pursuits (such as football or the military) may see masculinity as precarious. According to Winegard, Winegard, and Geary, this is functional; poetry and painting do not require traditionally-masculine traits, and attacks on those traits should not induce anxiety. {{Dubious|date=August 2015}} Football and the military require traditionally-masculine traits, such as pain tolerance, endurance, muscularity and courage, and attacks on those traits induce anxiety and may trigger retaliatory impulses and behavior. This suggests that nature-versus-nurture debates about masculinity may be simplistic. Although men evolved to pursue prestige and dominance (status), how they pursue status depends on their talents, traits and available possibilities. In modern societies, more avenues to status may exist than in traditional societies and this may mitigate the precariousness of manhood (or of traditional manhood); however, it will probably not mitigate the intensity of male-male competition.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Women who participate in sports, especially male-dominated sports, are sometimes derided as being masculine. Even though most sports emphasize stereotypically masculine qualities, such as strength, competition, and aggression, women who participate in sports are still expected to conform to strictly feminine gender norms. This is known as the "female/athlete paradox". Although traditional gender norms are gradually changing, female athletes, especially those that participate in male-dominated sports such as boxing, weight lifting, American football, ice hockey, and motor sports, are still often viewed as deviating from the boundaries of femininity and may suffer repercussions such as discrimination or mistreatment from administrators, harassment by fans, and decreased media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paloian|first1=Andrea|title=The Female/Athlete Paradox: Managing Traditional Views of Masculinity and Femininity|url=https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2012/fall/female|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence points to the negative impact of hegemonic masculinity on men's health-related behavior, with American men making 134.5&amp;nbsp;million fewer physician visits per year than women. Men make 40.8 percent of all physician visits, including women's obstetric and gynecological visits. Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician, increasing their risk of death from [[heart disease]]. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from [[cardiovascular disease]] than women, and are more likely to be diagnosed with a [[terminal illness]] because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Galdas | first1 = Paul M. | last2 = Cheater | first2 = Francine M. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = Paul | title = Men and health help-seeking behaviour: Literature review | journal = [[Journal of Advanced Nursing]] | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 616–623 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03331.x | pmid = 15737222 | date = March 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03331.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effeminacy==
{{see also|Effeminacy#Gay men}}
Gay men are considered by some to "deviate from the masculine norm" and are [[benevolent prejudice|benevolently stereotyped]] as "gentle and refined", even by other gay men. According to gay human-rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to the well-intentioned claim that gays are "just the same" as straights, there is a difference. What is more, the distinctive style of gay masculinity is of great social benefit. Wouldn't life be dull without the flair and imagination of [[queer]] fashion designers and interior decorators? How could the NHS cope with no gay nurses, or the education system with no gay teachers? Society should thank its lucky stars that not all men turn out straight, macho and insensitive. The different hetero and homo modes of maleness are not, of course, biologically fixed.&lt;ref name=Tatchell&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tatchell|first1=Peter| author-link =Peter Tatchell|title=What straight men could learn from gay men - a queer kind of masculinity?|work=The Scavenger|url=http://www.thescavenger.net/glbtiq-sp-1239/glbtiq/170-what-straight-men-can-learn-from-gay-men-6789.html|accessdate=7 March 2015|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Psychologist Joseph Pleck argues that a hierarchy of masculinity exists largely as a [[dichotomy]] of homosexual and heterosexual males: "Our society uses the male heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy as a central symbol for all the rankings of masculinity, for the division on any grounds between males who are "real men" and have power, and males who are not".&lt;ref name=nomas.org&gt;{{cite web|last=Pleck|first=Joseph|title=Understanding patriarchy and men's power|url=http://nomas.org/understanding-patriarchy-and-mens-power/ | publisher = [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS) |accessdate=11 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Kimmel]] adds that the [[Trope (literature)|trope]] "You're so gay" indicates a lack of masculinity, rather than homosexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Kimmel | first1 = Michael S. | last2 = Lewis | first2 = Summer | author-link1 = Michael Kimmel | title = Mars and Venus, Or, Planet Earth?: Women and Men in a New Millenium [sic] | publisher = Kansas State University | format = DVD | url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57227710 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pleck, to avoid male oppression of women, themselves and other men, [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] structures, institutions and discourse must be eliminated from Western society.

In the documentary ''The Butch Factor'', gay men (one of them [[transgender]]) were asked about their views of masculinity. Masculine traits were generally seen as an advantage in and out of the [[closeted|closet]], allowing "butch" gay men to conceal their [[sexual orientation]] longer while engaged in masculine activities such as sports.

Feminine-looking men tended to [[Coming out|come out]] earlier after being labeled gay by their peers. More likely to face bullying and harassment throughout their lives,&lt;ref name=ifbutscoconuts/&gt; they are taunted by derogatory words (such as "[[sissy]]") implying feminine qualities.

[[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave]] [[pro-feminism]] paid greater attention to issues of sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and [[hegemonic masculinity]]. This shift led to increased cooperation between the [[Men's liberation movement|men's liberation]] and [[gay liberation]] movements developing, in part, because masculinity was understood as a [[Social constructionism|social construct]] and in response to the universalization of "men" in previous men's movements. Men's-rights activists worked to stop second-wave feminists from influencing the gay-rights movement, promoting [[hypermasculinity]] as inherent to gay sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jeffreys | first = Sheila | author-link = Sheila Jeffreys | title = Unpacking queer politics: a lesbian feminist perspective | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780745628387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Two concerns over the study of the history of masculinity are that it would stabilize the historical process (rather than change it) and that a cultural overemphasis on the approach to masculinity lacks the reality of actual experience. According to John Tosh, masculinity has become a conceptual framework used by historians to enhance their cultural explorations instead of a specialty in its own right.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tosh, John (2011), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0E5ARiVe9YUC&amp;pg=PA17 The history of masculinity: an outdated concept?]", in {{cite book |editor-last1= Arnold |editor-first1= John H. |editor-last2= Brady |editor-first2= Sean | title = What is masculinity?: historical dynamics from antiquity to the contemporary world | pages = 17&amp;ndash;34 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781137305602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This draws attention from reality to representation and meaning, not only in the realm of masculinity; culture was becoming "the bottom line, the real historical reality".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tosh critiques Martin Francis' work of in this light because popular culture, rather than the experience of family life, is the basis for Francis' argument.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Francis | first = Martin | title = A flight from commitment? Domesticity, adventure and the masculine imaginary in Britain after the Second World War | journal = [[Gender &amp; History]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 163–185 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0424.2007.00469.x | date = April 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0424.2007.00469.x | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis uses contemporary literature and film to demonstrate that masculinity was restless, shying away from domesticity and commitment, during the late 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Francis wrote that this flight from commitment was "most likely to take place at the level of fantasy (individual and collective)". In focusing on culture, it is difficult to gauge the degree to which films such as ''[[Scott of the Antarctic (film)|Scott of the Antarctic]]'' represented the era’s masculine fantasies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Michael Roper’s call to focus on the subjectivity of masculinity addresses this cultural bias, because broad understanding is set aside for an examination "of what the relationship of the codes of masculinity is to actual men, to existential matters, to persons and to their psychic make-up" (Tosh's human experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Roper|first = Michael | title = Slipping out of view: subjectivity and emotion in gender history | journal = [[History Workshop Journal]] | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–72 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/hwj/dbi006 | date = March 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/hwj/dbi006 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tosh, the culture of masculinity has outlived its usefulness because it cannot fulfill the initial aim of this history (to discover how manhood was conditioned and experienced) and he urged "questions of behaviour and agency".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His work on Victorian masculinity uses individual experience in letters and sketches to illustrate broader cultural and social customs, such as birthing or Christmas traditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Stefan Dudink believes that the methodological approach (trying to categorize masculinity as a phenomenon) undermined its [[Historiography|historiographic]] development.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dudink |first = Stefan | title = The trouble with men: Problems in the history of 'masculinity' | journal = [[European Journal of Cultural Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–431 | publisher = [[Sage Publishing|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/136754949800100307 | date = September 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/136754949800100307 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abigail Solomou-Godeau’s work on post-revolutionary French art addresses a strong, constant patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Solomon-Godeau | first = Abigail | title = Male trouble: a crisis in representation | publisher = Thames and Hudson | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780500280379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tosh’s overall assessment is that a shift is needed in conceptualizing the topic&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; back to the history of masculinity as a speciality aiming to reach a broader audience, rather than as an analytical tool of cultural and social history. The importance he places on public history hearkens back to the initial aims of gender history, which sought to use history to enlighten and change the present. Tosh appeals to historians to live up to the "social expectation" of their work,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which would also require a greater focus on subjectivity and masculinity. This view is contrary to Dudink’s; the latter called for an "outflanking movement" towards the history of masculinity, in response to the errors he perceived in the study.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This would do the opposite of what Tosh called for, deconstructing masculinity by not placing it at the center of historical exploration and using discourse and culture as indirect avenues towards a more-representational approach. In a study of the [[Low Countries]], Dudink proposes moving beyond the history of masculinity by embedding analysis into the exploration of nation and nationalism (making masculinity a lens through which to view conflict and nation-building).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dudink|first = Stefan | title = Multipurpose masculinities: gender and power in low countries histories of masculinity | journal = [[BMGN: Low Countries Historical Review]] | volume = 127 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–18 | publisher = Royal Netherlands Historical Society | doi = 10.18352/bmgn-lchr.1562 | date = March 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.18352/bmgn-lchr.1562 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Francis' work on domesticity through a cultural lens moves beyond the history of masculinity because "men constantly travelled back and forward across the frontier of domesticity, if only in the realm of the imagination"; normative codes of behavior do not fully encompass the male experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Media images of boys and young men may lead to the persistence of harmful concepts of masculinity. According to men's-rights activists, the media does not address men's-rights issues and men are often portrayed negatively in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Farrell | first1 = Warren | last2 = Sterba | first2 = James P. | author-link1 = Warren Farrell | title = Does feminism discriminate against men? | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780195312829 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jackson called hegemonic masculinity "economically exploitative" and "socially oppressive": "The form of oppression varies from patriarchal controls over women's bodies and reproductive rights, through ideologies of domesticity, femininity and compulsory heterosexuality, to social definitions of the value of work, the nature of skill and the differential remuneration of 'productive' and 'reproductive' labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Jackson | first = Peter | title = The cultural politics of masculinity: towards a social geography | journal = [[Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–213 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.2307/622614 | jstor = 622614 | date = April 1991 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/622614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological research===
According to a paper submitted by Tracy Tylka to the [[American Psychological Association]], "Instead of seeing a decrease in [[objectification]] of women in society, there has just been an increase in the objectification of both sexes. And you can see that in the media today." Men and women restrict food intake in an effort to achieve what they consider an attractively-thin body; in extreme cases, this leads to [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Grabmeier | first = Jeff | title = Pressure to be more muscular may lead men to unhealthy behaviors | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080618040952/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/maleobj.htm | archive-date = 18 June 2008 | url = http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/maleobj.htm | publisher = [[Ohio State University]] | date = 10 August 2006 | access-date = 29 July 2008 }}

In 1987 Eisler and Skidmore studied masculinity, creating the idea of "masculine stress" and finding three elements of masculinity which often result in emotional stress:
* The emphasis on prevailing in situations requiring body and fitness
* Being perceived as emotional
* The need for adequacy in sexual matters and financial status

Because of social norms and pressures associated with masculinity, men with spinal-cord injuries must adapt their self-identity to the losses associated with such injuries; this may "lead to feelings of decreased physical and sexual prowess with lowered self-esteem and a loss of male identity. Feelings of guilt and overall loss of control are also experienced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hutchinson | first1 = Susan L. | last2 = Kleiber | first2 = Douglas A. | title = Heroic masculinity following spinal cord injury: Implications for therapeutic recreation practice and research | journal = Therapeutic Recreation Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | publisher = Sagamore Journals | date = January 2000 | url = http://js.sagamorepub.com/trj/article/view/1110 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that men feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising.

In their book ''Raising Cain: Protecting The Emotional Life of Boys'', [[Dan Kindlon]] and Michael Thompson wrote that although all boys are born loving and empathic, exposure to gender socialization (the tough male ideal and [[hypermasculinity]]) limits their ability to function as emotionally-healthy adults.

The crisis has also been attributed to the questioning of male dominance and rights granted to men solely on the basis of sex following the [[feminist movement]].&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002" /&gt;{{rp|83–86}} British sociologist John MacInnes wrote that "masculinity has always been in one crisis or another", suggesting that the crises arise from the "fundamental incompatibility between the core principle of modernity that all human beings are essentially equal (regardless of their sex) and the core tenet of patriarchy that men are naturally superior to women and thus destined to rule over them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacInnes | first = John | authorlink = | title = The end of masculinity: the confusion of sexual genesis and sexual difference in modern society | year = 1998 | publisher = Open University Press | location = Philadelphia | page = 11 | isbn = 978-0-335-19659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Beynon, masculinity and men are often conflated and it is unclear whether masculinity, men or both are in crisis.  He writes that the "crisis" is not a recent phenomenon, illustrating several periods of masculine crisis throughout history (some predating the women's movement and [[post-industrial society]]), suggesting that due to masculinity's fluid nature "crisis is constitutive of masculinity itself".&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002" /&gt; Film scholar [[Leon Hunt]] also writes: "Whenever masculinity's 'crisis' actually started, it certainly seems to have been in place by the 1970s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Leon | year = 1998 | title = British low culture: from safari suits to sexploitation | publisher = Routledge | location = London, New York | page = 73 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3dvtQEetWrsC&amp;pg=PA73 | isbn = 978-0-415-15182-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Herbivore men}}
In 2008, the word "herbivore men" became popular in Japan and was reported worldwide. Herbivore men refers to young Japanese men who naturally detach themselves from masculinity. [[Masahiro Morioka]] characterizes them as men 1) having gentle nature, 2) not bound by manliness, 3) not aggressive when it comes to romance, 4) viewing women as equals, and 5) hating emotional pain. Herbivore men are severely criticized by men who love masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Morioka | first = Masahiro | title = A phenomenological study of "Herbivore Men" | journal = The Review of Life Studies | volume = 4 | pages = 1–20 | date = September 2013 | url = http://www.lifestudies.org/press/review.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.lifestudies.org/press/rls0401.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;
