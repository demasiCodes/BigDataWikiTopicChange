Ancient literature dates back to about 3000 BC, with explicit expectations for men in the form of laws and implied masculine ideals in myths of gods and heroes. According to the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' (about 1750 BC): 
*Rule 3: "If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death."
*Rule 128: "If a man takes a woman to wife, but has no intercourse with her, this woman is no wife to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hammurabi | author-link = Hammurabi | others = L.W.

In the [[Hebrew Bible]] of 1000 BC, when King David of Israel drew near to death, he told his son Solomon: "I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Bible Gateway passage: 1 Kings 2:2 - King James Version |url= https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+2:2&amp;version=KJV | website = biblegateway.com |publisher=Bible Gateway |access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval and Victorian eras ===

[[Jeffrey Richards]] describes a European "medieval masculinity which was essentially Christian and chivalric".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richards | first = Jeffrey | title = From Christianity to Paganism: The New Middle Ages and the Values of 'Medieval' Masculinity | journal = Cultural Values | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–234 | doi = 10.1080/14797589909367162 | date = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Courage, respect for women of all classes and generosity characterize the portrayal of men in literary history.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} According to David Rosen, the traditional view of scholars (such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]) that ''Beowulf'' is a tale of medieval [[heroism]] overlooks the similarities between Beowulf and the monster Grendel. The masculinity exemplified by Beowulf "cut[s] men off from women, other men, passion and the household".&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, David (1993), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=pXgBaWrB4OYC&amp;pg=PA11 The armor of the man-monster in Beowulf]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Rosen | editor-first = David | title = The changing fictions of masculinity | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Urbana | page = 11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXgBaWrB4OYC | isbn = 9780252063091 | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Victorian era, [[Victorian masculinity|masculinity]] underwent a transformation from traditional heroism. Scottish philosopher [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in 1831: "The old ideal of Manhood has grown obsolete, and the new is still invisible to us, and we grope after it in darkness, one clutching this phantom, another that; [[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Werterism]], [[Byron]]ism, even [[Beau Brummell|Brummelism]], each has its day".&lt;ref&gt;Adams, James Eli (1995), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=f7gwHwyxZJ4C&amp;pg=PA1 Introduction]", in {{cite book |editor-last=Adams |editor-first=James Eli |title=Dandies and desert saints: styles of Victorian masculinity |url=https://archive.org/details/dandiesdesertsai00adam/page/1 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/dandiesdesertsai00adam/page/1 1] |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, New York |isbn=9780801482083 |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boxing was professionalized in America and Europe in the 19th century; it emphasized the physical and confrontational aspects of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher David Thrasher, ''Fight Sports and American Masculinity: Salvation in Violence from 1607 to the Present'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  Bare-knuckle boxing without gloves represented "the manly art" in 19th-century America.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott J. Gorn, ''The Manly Art: Bare-Knuckle Prize Fighting in America'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

===&lt;span class="anchor" id="Modern times"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 20th century to present ===

At the beginning of the 20th century, most families in the western world consisted of a father working outside the home as [[breadwinner model|breadwinner]] and a mother as working [[homemaker]] in the home, often working together to raise children and/or taking care of elderly family members.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}} The roles were often divided quite sharply between providing resources (considered masculine) and maintenance and redistribution of resources (considered feminine).{{citation needed|date=July 2023}} Despite women's increasing participation in the paid labor force and contributions to family income, men's identities remained centered on their working lives and specifically their economic contributions.{{clarify|date=October 2019}} In 1963, social theorist [[Erving Goffman]]'s seminal work on stigma management presented a list of traits prescribed as categorically masculine for American men:&lt;blockquote&gt;In an important sense there is only one complete unblushing male in America: a young, married, white, urban, northern, heterosexual Protestant father of college education, fully employed, of good complexion, weight and height, and a recent record in sports.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1963. ''Stigma: Notes On The Management Of Spoiled Identity''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:128&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Writing in 1974, R. Gould asserted that the provider role was central to adult men's identities, as masculinity is often measured by the size of a man's economic contribution to the family.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, R. 1974. Measuring masculinity by the size of a paycheck. In: J. Pleck &amp; J. Sawyer (Eds.) ''Men and masculinity'' (pp. 96 – 100). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinity is also secured by denying any semblance of softness, emotion, femininity, or any characteristic associated with women.&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, C. J. (2012). ''Dude, you're a fag : masculinity and sexuality in high school.'' Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2019}} Overwhelmingly, the construction of masculinity most valued in the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st century is one that is independent, sexually assertive, and athletic, among other normative markers of manhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pappas | first1 = Nick T. | last2 = McKenry | first2 = Patrick C. | last3 = Skilken Catlett | first3 = Beth | year = 2004 | title = Athlete Aggression on the Rink and off the Ice Athlete Violence and Aggression in Hockey and Interpersonal Relationships | journal = Men and Masculinities | volume = 6 | pages = 291–312 | doi = 10.1177/1097184x03257433 | s2cid = 146594647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grazian | first1 = David | year = 2007 | title = The Girl Hunt: Urban Nightlife and the Performance of Masculinity as Collective Activity | journal = Symbolic Interaction | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 221–243 | doi = 10.1525/si.2007.30.2.221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2019}} There is some evidence of this construction developing slightly however.

===Social construction of masculinity===
Across cultures, characteristics of masculinity are similar in essence but varying in detail, another shared pattern is that non-typical behavior of one's sex or gender may be viewed as a social problem. In [[sociology]], this [[Label (sociology)|labeling]] is known as [[gender role|gender assumptions]] and is part of [[socialization]] to meet the [[mores]] of a society. Non-standard behavior may be considered indicative of [[homosexuality]], despite the fact that gender expression, [[gender identity]] and [[sexual orientation]] are widely accepted as distinct concepts.&lt;ref name=nacua&gt;{{cite web  |title=Gender identity and expression issues at colleges and universities| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140323020027/http://www.nacua.org/nacuanet/visual/nacuanotessample.html | archive-date = 23 March 2014 |url= http://www.nacua.org/nacuanet/visual/nacuanotessample.html |date=2 June 2005 |access-date=2 April 2007 |work=[[National Association of College and University Attorneys]] NACUAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=February 2018}}{{Where|date=February 2018}} When sexuality is defined in terms of object choice (as in early [[sexology]] studies), male homosexuality may be interpreted as [[effeminacy]].&lt;ref name=chrysler&gt;{{cite news | agency = [[Associated Press]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081211035529/http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid28980.asp | archive-date = 11 December 2008 |url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid28980.asp |title=Chrysler TV ad criticized for using gay stereotypes |work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | publisher = Here Press |date=7 April 2006 |access-date=7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Machismo]] is a form of masculinity that emphasizes power and is often associated with a disregard for consequences and responsibility.&lt;ref name = "Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Machismo (exaggerated masculinity) - Encyclopædia Britannica|url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1381820/machismo|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|edition=online|access-date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that masculinity is linked to the male body; in this view, masculinity is associated with [[human penis|male genitalia]].&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Others have suggested that although masculinity may be influenced by biology, it is also a cultural construct.&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Many aspects of masculinity assumed to be natural are linguistically and culturally driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Sara | title = Third wave feminist linguistics and the analysis of sexism | journal = Discourse Analysis Online | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | date = 2003 | url = http://extra.shu.ac.uk/daol/articles/closed/2003/001/mills2003001-paper.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reeser argues that although the military has a vested interest in constructing and promoting a specific form of masculinity, it does not create it.&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|17–21}} Facial hair is linked to masculinity through language, in stories about boys becoming men when they begin to shave.&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}}

Some social scientists conceptualize masculinity (and femininity) as a performance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Butler|Butler, Judith]] (2006) [1990]. ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity]]''. New York London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masculinities"&gt;[[Raewyn Connell|Connell, R.W.]] (2005).

Masculine performance varies over the life course, but also from one context to another. For instance, the sports world may elicit more traditionally normative masculinities in participants than would other settings.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Michael A. 1992. ''Power at Play: Sports and the Problem of Masculinity''. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Men who exhibit a tough and aggressive masculinity on the sports field may display a softer masculinity in familial contexts. Masculinities vary by social class as well. Studies suggest working class constructions of masculinity to be more normative than are those from middle class men and boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = Edward W | year = 2008 | title = Rednecks," "Rutters," and 'Rithmetic: Social Class, Masculinity, and Schooling in a Rural Context | journal = Gender &amp; Society | volume = 22 | issue = 6| pages = 728–751 | doi = 10.1177/0891243208325163 | s2cid = 145602445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Karin A. 1996.

[[Gay men]] are considered by some{{who|date=January 2021}} to be "effeminate and deviate from the masculine norm" and are sometimes [[benevolent prejudice|benevolently stereotyped]] as "gentle and refined", even by other gay men. According to gay human-rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to the well-intentioned claim that gays are "just the same" as straights, there is a difference. What is more, the distinctive style of gay masculinity is of great social benefit. Wouldn't life be dull without the flair and imagination of [[queer]] fashion designers and interior decorators? How could the NHS cope with no gay nurses, or the education system with no gay teachers? Society should thank its lucky stars that not all men turn out straight, macho and insensitive. The different hetero and homo modes of maleness are not, of course, biologically fixed.&lt;ref name=Tatchell&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tatchell|first1=Peter| author-link =Peter Tatchell|title=What straight men could learn from gay men - a queer kind of masculinity?|work=The Scavenger|url=http://www.thescavenger.net/glbtiq-sp-1239/glbtiq/170-what-straight-men-can-learn-from-gay-men-6789.html|access-date=7 March 2015|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Psychologist Joseph Pleck argues that a hierarchy of masculinity exists largely as a [[dichotomy]] of homosexual and heterosexual males: "Our society uses the male heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy as a central symbol for all the rankings of masculinity, for the division on any grounds between males who are "real men" and have power, and males who are not".&lt;ref name=nomas.org&gt;{{cite web|last=Pleck|first=Joseph|title=Understanding patriarchy and men's power|url=http://nomas.org/understanding-patriarchy-and-mens-power/ | publisher = [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS) |access-date=11 January 2017|date=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Kimmel]] adds that the [[Trope (literature)|trope]] "You're so gay" indicates a lack of masculinity, rather than homosexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Kimmel | first1 = Michael S. | last2 = Lewis | first2 = Summer | author-link1 = Michael Kimmel | title = Mars and Venus, Or, Planet Earth?: Women and Men in a New Millenium [sic] | publisher = Kansas State University | year = 2004 | oclc = 57227710 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pleck, to avoid male oppression of women, themselves and other men, [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] structures, institutions and discourse must be eliminated from Western society.

In the documentary ''The Butch Factor'', gay men (one of them [[transgender]]) were asked about their views of masculinity. Masculine traits were generally seen as an advantage in and out of the [[closeted|closet]], allowing "butch" gay men to conceal their [[sexual orientation]] longer while engaged in masculine activities such as sports.

Feminine-looking men tended to [[Coming out|come out]] earlier after being labeled gay by their peers. More likely to face bullying and harassment throughout their lives,&lt;ref name=ifbutscoconuts/&gt; they are taunted by derogatory words (such as "[[sissy]]") implying feminine qualities. Effeminate, "[[camp (style)|campy]]" gay men sometimes use what John R. Ballew called "camp humor", such as referring to one another by [[She (pronoun)|female pronouns]] (according to Ballew, "a funny way of defusing hate directed toward us [gay men]"); however, such humor "can cause us [gay men] to become confused in relation to how we feel about being men".&lt;ref name="Gay men and masculinity"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Ballew | first1 = John R. |title=Gay men and masculinity (blog) |url=http://bodymindsoul.org/articles/gay-sexuality/gay-men-and-masculinity/ | website = bodymindsoul.org | date = 12 May 2011 | publisher = John R.

{{blockquote|[Heterosexual] men are sometimes advised to get in touch with their "inner feminine." Maybe gay men need to get in touch with their "inner masculine" instead.

A study by the Center for Theoretical Study at [[Charles University in Prague]] and the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] found significant differences in shape among the faces of 66 heterosexual and gay men, with gay men having more "stereotypically masculine" features ("undermin[ing] stereotypical notions of gay men as more feminine looking.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Saul |first = Heather | title = Gay and straight men may have different facial shapes, new study suggests | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/gay-and-straight-men-may-have-different-facial-shapes-new-study-suggests-8928519.html |access-date=6 March 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=8 November 2013|quote=Their results found that homosexual men were rated as more stereotypically 'masculine' than heterosexual men, which they said undermined stereotypical notions of gay men as more feminine looking.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies with larger sample sizes have found that homosexual men were seen as significantly more feminine and less masculine than those of heterosexual men &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Lyons |first = Minna | title = Detection of sexual orientation ("gaydar") by homosexual and heterosexual women |journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | url = https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23813041/  |access-date= 22 June 2023 | date= 2014|volume = 43 |issue = 2 |pages = 345–352 |doi = 10.1007/s10508-013-0144-7 |pmid = 23813041 |s2cid = 254253005 |quote=… homosexual men were rated as more feminine and less masculine than heterosexual men.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a 2017 study utilized neural networks to see whether artificial intelligence would be able to differentiate accurately between more than 35,000 images of gay and straight faces. The results showed that the "classifier could correctly distinguish between gay and heterosexual men in 81% of cases, and in 71% of cases for women."

From this perspective, there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealized form of masculinity in every social system and an apotheosized form of femininity that is considered proper for men and women. This idealized form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalizes certain performances of men, and pathologizes, marginalizes, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalized and subordinated), which, according to a plethora of studies, are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasized femininity, marginalized and subordinated masculinities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kostas | first1 = M | year = 2018 | title = Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: Children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses | journal = Gender and Education | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 530–548 | doi = 10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 | s2cid = 54912000 | url = http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to describing forceful articulations of violent masculine identities, hegemonic masculinity has also been used to describe implicit, indirect, or coercive forms of gendered socialization, enacted through video games, fashion, humor, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie, Timothy; Hickey-Moody, Anna (2017), "[https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule Masculinity and ridicule]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Papenburg | editor-first = Bettina | title = Gender: laughter | pages= 215&amp;ndash;228 | publisher = Macmillan Reference | location = Farmington Hills, Michigan | year = 2017 | isbn = 9780028663265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, boys endure painful initiation rituals to become men. Manhood may also be lost, as when a man is derided for not "being a man". Researchers have found that men respond to threats to their manhood by engaging in stereotypically-masculine behaviors and beliefs, such as supporting hierarchy, espousing homophobic beliefs, supporting aggression and choosing physical tasks over intellectual ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vandello | first1 = Joseph A. | last2 = Bosson | first2 = Jennifer K. | last3 = Cohen | first3 = Dov | last4 = Burnaford | first4 = Rochelle M. | last5 = Weaver | first5 = Jonathan R. | title = Precarious manhood | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 1325–1339 | doi = 10.1037/a0012453 | pmid = 19025286 | date = December 2008 | s2cid = 6800516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=April 2023}}

Women who participate in sports, especially male-dominated sports, are sometimes derided as being masculine. Even though most sports emphasize stereotypically masculine qualities, such as [[physical strength|strength]], [[competition]], and [[aggression]], women who participate in sports are still expected to conform to strictly feminine gender norms. This is known as the "female athlete paradox". Although traditional gender norms are gradually changing, female athletes, especially those that participate in male-dominated sports such as [[boxing]], [[weight lifting]], [[American football]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[ice hockey]], and [[motorsport]], are still often viewed as deviating from the boundaries of femininity and may suffer negative repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paloian|first1=Andrea|title=The Female/Athlete Paradox: Managing Traditional Views of Masculinity and Femininity|url=https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2012/fall/female|work=Applied Psychology Opus|publisher=New York University|access-date=21 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216115443/https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2012/fall/female|archive-date=16 February 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Staurowsky2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Staurowsky |first1=Ellen J. |title=Women and Sport: Continuing a Journey of Liberation and Celebration |date=2016 |publisher=Human Kinetics |location=Champaign, IL |isbn=978-1450417594 |pages=41–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence points to the negative impact of hegemonic masculinity on men's health-related behavior, with American men making 134.5&amp;nbsp;million fewer physician visits per year than women. Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician, increasing their risk of death from [[heart disease]]. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from [[cardiovascular disease]] than women, and are more likely to be diagnosed with a [[terminal illness]] because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Galdas | first1 = Paul M. | last2 = Cheater | first2 = Francine M. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = Paul | title = Men and health help-seeking behaviour: Literature review | journal = [[Journal of Advanced Nursing]] | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 616–623 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03331.x | pmid = 15737222 | date = March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Arran Stibbe published an analysis of a well-known men's-health magazine in 2000.

==Criticism==
Study of the history of masculinity emerged during the 1980s, aided by the fields of women's and (later) gender history. Before women's history was examined, there was a "strict gendering of the public/private divide"; regarding masculinity, this meant little study of how men related to the household, domesticity and family life.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Tosh, John (1999), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Br8JCAAAQBAJ Introduction: masculinity and domesticity]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Tosh | editor-first = John | title = A man's place: masculinity and the middle-class home in Victorian England |page=2 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780300077797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although women's historical role was negated, despite the writing of history by (and primarily about) men, a significant portion of the male experience was missing. This void was questioned during the late 1970s, when women's history began to analyze gender and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Davis | first = Natalie Z. | title = "Women's history" in transition: the European case | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 3 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 83–103 | doi = 10.2307/3177729 | jstor = 3177729  | date = Spring–Summer 1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Scott's seminal article, calling for gender studies as an analytical concept to explore society, power and discourse, laid the foundation for this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Scott | first = Joan W. | title = Gender: a useful category of historical analysis | journal = [[The American Historical Review]] | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1053–1075 | doi = 10.1086/ahr/91.5.1053 | jstor = 1864376 | date = December 1986 | s2cid = 162012479 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scott, gender should be used in two ways: productive and produced. Productive gender examined its role in creating power relationships, and produced gender explored the use and change of gender throughout history. This has influenced the field of masculinity, as seen in Pierre Bourdieu's definition of masculinity: produced by society and culture, and reproduced in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bourdieu | first = Pierre | title = Masculine domination | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780745622651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A flurry of work in women's history led to a call for study of the male role (initially influenced by psychoanalysis) in society and emotional and interpersonal life. Connell wrote that these initial works were marked by a "high level of generality" in "broad surveys of cultural norms". The scholarship was aware of contemporary societal changes aiming to understand and evolve (or liberate) the male role in response to feminism.&lt;ref name="Connell_2005" /&gt;{{rp|28}}John Tosh calls for a return to this aim for the history of masculinity to be useful, academically and in the public sphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Steedman, Carolyn (1992), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=EzD4fdELEioC&amp;pg=PA614 Culture, cultural studies and the historians]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Grossberg | editor-first1 = Lawrence | editor-last2 = Nelson | editor-first2 = Cary | editor-last3 = Treichler | editor-first3 = Paula | title = Cultural studies | page = [https://archive.org/details/culturalstudies0000unse/page/617 617] | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | isbn = 9780415903455 | year = 1992 | url = https://archive.org/details/culturalstudies0000unse/page/617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two concerns over the study of the history of masculinity are that it would stabilize the historical process (rather than change it) and that a cultural overemphasis on the approach to masculinity lacks the reality of actual experience. According to John Tosh, masculinity has become a conceptual framework used by historians to enhance their cultural explorations instead of a specialty in its own right.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tosh, John (2011), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=0E5ARiVe9YUC&amp;pg=PA17 The history of masculinity: an outdated concept?]", in {{cite book |editor-last1= Arnold |editor-first1= John H. |editor-last2= Brady |editor-first2= Sean | title = What is masculinity?: historical dynamics from antiquity to the contemporary world | pages = 17&amp;ndash;34 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781137305602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This draws attention from reality to representation and meaning, not only in the realm of masculinity; culture was becoming "the bottom line, the real historical reality".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tosh critiques Martin Francis' work in this light because popular culture, rather than the experience of family life, is the basis for Francis' argument.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Francis | first = Martin | title = A flight from commitment? Domesticity, adventure and the masculine imaginary in Britain after the Second World War | journal = [[Gender &amp; History]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 163–185 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0424.2007.00469.x | date = April 2007 | s2cid = 144767677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis uses contemporary literature and film to demonstrate that masculinity was restless, shying away from domesticity and commitment, during the late 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Francis wrote that this flight from commitment was "most likely to take place at the level of fantasy (individual and collective)". In focusing on culture, it is difficult to gauge the degree to which films such as ''[[Scott of the Antarctic (film)|Scott of the Antarctic]]'' represented the era's masculine fantasies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Michael Roper's call to focus on the subjectivity of masculinity addresses this cultural bias, because broad understanding is set aside for an examination "of what the relationship of the codes of masculinity is to actual men, to existential matters, to persons and to their psychic make-up" (Tosh's human experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Roper|first = Michael | title = Slipping out of view: subjectivity and emotion in gender history | journal = [[History Workshop Journal]] | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–72 | doi = 10.1093/hwj/dbi006 | date = March 2005 |s2cid = 144245717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tosh, the culture of masculinity has outlived its usefulness because it cannot fulfill the initial aim of this history (to discover how manhood was conditioned and experienced) and he urged "questions of behaviour and agency".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His work on Victorian masculinity uses individual experience in letters and sketches to illustrate broader cultural and social customs, such as birthing or Christmas traditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Stefan Dudink believes that the methodological approach (trying to categorize masculinity as a phenomenon) undermined its [[Historiography|historiographic]] development.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dudink |first = Stefan | title = The trouble with men: Problems in the history of 'masculinity' | journal = [[European Journal of Cultural Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–431 | doi = 10.1177/136754949800100307 | date = September 1998 |s2cid = 145772531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abigail Solomou-Godeau's work on post-revolutionary French art addresses a strong, constant patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Solomon-Godeau | first = Abigail | title = Male trouble: a crisis in representation | publisher = Thames and Hudson | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780500280379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tosh's overall assessment is that a shift is needed in conceptualizing the topic&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; back to the history of masculinity as a speciality aiming to reach a broader audience, rather than as an analytical tool of cultural and social history. The importance he places on public history hearkens back to the initial aims of gender history, which sought to use history to enlighten and change the present. Tosh appeals to historians to live up to the "social expectation" of their work,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which would also require a greater focus on subjectivity and masculinity. This view is contrary to Dudink's; the latter called for an "outflanking movement" towards the history of masculinity, in response to the errors he perceived in the study.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This would do the opposite of what Tosh called for, deconstructing masculinity by not placing it at the center of historical exploration and using discourse and culture as indirect avenues towards a more-representational approach. In a study of the [[Low Countries]], Dudink proposes moving beyond the history of masculinity by embedding analysis into the exploration of nation and nationalism (making masculinity a lens through which to view conflict and nation-building).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dudink|first = Stefan | title = Multipurpose masculinities: gender and power in low countries histories of masculinity | journal = [[BMGN: Low Countries Historical Review]] | volume = 127 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–18 | doi = 10.18352/bmgn-lchr.1562 | date = March 2012 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Francis' work on domesticity through a cultural lens moves beyond the history of masculinity because "men constantly travelled back and forward across the frontier of domesticity, if only in the realm of the imagination"; normative codes of behavior do not fully encompass the male experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Media images of boys and young men may lead to the persistence of harmful concepts of masculinity. According to men's-rights activists, the media does not address men's-rights issues and men are often portrayed negatively in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Farrell | first1 = Warren | last2 = Sterba | first2 = James P. | author-link1 = Warren Farrell | title = Does feminism discriminate against men? | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780195312829 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jackson called hegemonic masculinity "economically exploitative" and "socially oppressive": "The form of oppression varies from patriarchal controls over women's bodies and reproductive rights, through ideologies of domesticity, femininity and compulsory heterosexuality, to social definitions of the value of work, the nature of skill and the differential remuneration of 'productive' and 'reproductive' labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Jackson | first = Peter | title = The cultural politics of masculinity: towards a social geography | journal = [[Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–213 | doi = 10.2307/622614 | jstor = 622614 | date = April 1991 | s2cid = 147461986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological research===
According to a paper submitted by Tracy Tylka to the [[American Psychological Association]], "Instead of seeing a decrease in [[objectification]] of women in society, there has just been an increase in the objectification of both sexes. And you can see that in the media today."

Research in the United Kingdom found, "Younger men and women who read fitness and fashion magazines could be psychologically harmed by the images of perfect female and male physiques."

{{See also|Toxic masculinity}}

In 1987, Eisler and Skidmore studied masculinity, creating the idea of "masculine stress" and finding three elements of masculinity which often result in emotional stress:
* The emphasis on prevailing in situations requiring body and fitness
* Being perceived as emotional
* The need for adequacy in sexual matters and financial status

Because of social norms and pressures associated with masculinity, men with spinal-cord injuries must adapt their self-identity to the losses associated with such injuries; this may "lead to feelings of decreased physical and sexual prowess with lowered self-esteem and a loss of male identity. Feelings of guilt and overall loss of control are also experienced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hutchinson | first1 = Susan L. | last2 = Kleiber | first2 = Douglas A. | title = Heroic masculinity following spinal cord injury: Implications for therapeutic recreation practice and research | journal = Therapeutic Recreation Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | date = January 2000 | url = http://js.sagamorepub.com/trj/article/view/1110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that men feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising. Brett Martin and Juergen Gnoth (2009) found that although feminine men privately preferred feminine models, they expressed a preference for traditional masculine models in public; according to the authors, this reflected social pressure on men to endorse traditional masculine norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Brett A.S. | last2 = Gnoth | first2 = Juergen | title = Is the Marlboro man the only alternative?

In their book ''Raising Cain: Protecting The Emotional Life of Boys'', [[Dan Kindlon]] and Michael Thompson wrote that although all boys are born loving and empathic, exposure to gender socialization (the tough male ideal and [[hypermasculinity]]) limits their ability to function as emotionally-healthy adults. According to Kindlon and Thompson, boys lack the ability to understand and express emotions productively because of the stress imposed by masculine gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Kindlon | first1 = Dan | last2 = Thompson | first2 = Michael | contribution = The road not taken: turning boys away from their inner life | editor-last1 = Kindlon | editor-first1 = Dan | editor-last2 = Thompson | editor-first2 = Michael | title = Raising Cain: protecting the emotional life of boys | pages = 1–20 | publisher = Ballantine Books | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780345434852 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&lt;span class="anchor" id="In crisis"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="anchor" id="Notion of "masculinity in crisis""&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Masculinity in crisis===
A theory of masculinity in crisis has emerged;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horrocks|first=Roger|title=Masculinities in Crisis: Myths, Fantasies, and Realities|year=1994|publisher=St Martin's Press|isbn=978-0333593226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k24dAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Marked Men: White Masculinity in Crisis |last= Robinson |first= Sally |year= 2000 |publisher= [[Columbia University Press]] |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-231-50036-4 |page= 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian archeologist Peter McAllister said, "I have a strong feeling that masculinity is in crisis. Men are really searching for a role in modern society; the things we used to do aren't in much demand anymore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Rogers|first = Thomas|title = The dramatic decline of the modern man|url = http://www.salon.com/2010/11/14/manthropology_interview/singleton/|newspaper = [[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date = 14 November 2010|access-date = 3 June 2012|archive-date = 12 July 2012|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120712150156/http://www.salon.com/2010/11/14/manthropology_interview/singleton/|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others see the changing labor market as a source of stress. [[Deindustrialization]] and the replacement of [[Smokestack industry|smokestack industries]] by technology have allowed more women to enter the labor force, reducing its emphasis on physical strength.&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002"&gt;{{citation | last = Beynon| first = John | contribution = Masculinities and the notion of 'crisis' | editor-last = Beynon| editor-first = John | title = Masculinities and culture | pages = 75–97 | publisher = Open University Press | location = Philadelphia| year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-335-19988-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86–89}}

The crisis has also been attributed to the questioning of male dominance and rights granted to men solely on the basis of sex following the [[feminist movement]].&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002" /&gt;{{rp|83–86}} British sociologist John MacInnes wrote that "masculinity has always been in one crisis or another", suggesting that the crises arise from the "fundamental incompatibility between the core principle of modernity that all human beings are essentially equal (regardless of their sex) and the core tenet of patriarchy that men are naturally superior to women and thus destined to rule over them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacInnes | first = John | title = The end of masculinity: the confusion of sexual genesis and sexual difference in modern society | year = 1998 | publisher = Open University Press | location = Philadelphia | page = 11 | isbn = 978-0-335-19659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Beynon, masculinity and men are often conflated and it is unclear whether masculinity, men or both are in crisis.  He writes that the "crisis" is not a recent phenomenon, illustrating several periods of masculine crisis throughout history (some predating the women's movement and [[post-industrial society]]), suggesting that due to masculinity's fluid nature "crisis is constitutive of masculinity itself".&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002" /&gt; Film scholar Leon Hunt also writes: "Whenever masculinity's 'crisis' actually started, it certainly seems to have been in place by the 1970s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Leon | year = 1998 | title = British low culture: from safari suits to sexploitation | publisher = Routledge | location = London, New York | page = 73 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3dvtQEetWrsC&amp;pg=PA73 | isbn = 978-0-415-15182-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the word "herbivore men" became popular in Japan and was reported worldwide. Herbivore men refers to young Japanese men who naturally detach themselves from masculinity. [[Masahiro Morioka]] characterizes them as men 1) having gentle nature, 2) not bound by manliness, 3) not aggressive when it comes to romance, 4) viewing women as equals, and 5) hating emotional pain.

=== East African cultures ===
During Margrethe Silberschmidt's research of urban and rural men in East Africa, she concludes that men experience disempowerment when they cannot not fulfill their role as breadwinner and feel inferior to women when they cannot provide for their family.&lt;ref name=":76"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Silberschmidt |first=Margrethe |date=2001-04-01 |title=Disempowerment of Men in Rural and Urban East Africa: Implications for Male Identity and Sexual Behavior |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X00001224 |journal=World Development |language=en |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=657–671 |doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(00)00122-4 |issn=0305-750X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in East Africa's cultural and economic framework can partially be attributed to British colonial rule because it altered the gender division of labor.&lt;ref name=":76"/&gt; There was an increase in wage labor which led to a demand for more skilled workers in an environment where there were primarily unskilled workers.&lt;ref name=":76"/&gt; Eventually, there was a shift to growing cash crops and the emphasis was put on men to be the breadwinner.&lt;ref name=":76"/&gt; A man's social value is traditionally connected to his ability to provide so when he can no longer do that, it negatively impacts his ego.&lt;ref name=":76"/&gt; Masculinity is seen as en entity to be protected, and when a man feels disempowered, he finds other ways to reaffirm their masculinity.&lt;ref name=":76"/&gt; Research that examines the struggles among men and look into their personal experiences can help to understand the social structures of masculinity.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=White |first=Sarah C |date=1997-06-01 |title=Men, masculinities, and the politics of development |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/741922357 |journal=Gender &amp; Development |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=14–22 |doi=10.1080/741922357 |issn=1355-2074 |pmid=12292610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Westernized influence in the media ===
Masculinities as depicted in the media of countries categorized as the [[Global South]] can depict stereotypical gender roles in various ways. In India, such roles have been pushed through [[Bollywood]] films.&lt;ref name="Raj"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Raj |first1=Adharsh |last2=Goswami |first2=Manash Pratim |date=June 2020 |title='Is Macho the In-thing?'

This has been observed in [[India]] with the expansion of availability of transnational men's magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mishra |first=Suman |date=December 2017 |title=Looking westwards: Men in transnational men's magazine advertising in India |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1742766517734254 |journal=Global Media and Communication |language=en |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=249–266 |doi=10.1177/1742766517734254 |s2cid=149389725 |issn=1742-7665}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is some evidence of Western and specifically, North American, influence in advertisements found in Chinese and Taiwanese men's magazines as well, it seems that more often than not, those countries' magazines have just adopted a globally uniform perception of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Shaw |first1=Ping |last2=Tan |first2=Yue |date=18 February 2014 |title=Race and Masculinity: A Comparison of Asian and Western Models in Men's Lifestyle Magazine Advertisements |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077699013514410 |journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=118–138 |language=en |doi=10.1177/1077699013514410|s2cid=145119356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme also presents itself in visual depictions of men in [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Myrttinen |first=Henri |date=2 October 2017 |title=Depictions and reflections: photographing visualizations of masculinities in Afghanistan and Democratic Republic of the Congo |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/14616742.2017.1364910 |journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=530–536 |doi=10.1080/14616742.2017.1364910 |s2cid=148885845 |issn=1461-6742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports media outlets have not necessarily promoted a completely "Westernized" version of masculinity, and white, male sports icons may have had an impact when presented alongside those players of other races, such as Asians or black people. A 2019 study found that in [[Major League Baseball]], for example, Korean players and their respective accomplishments tend to be pushed to the side when compared with white, male players in print media and online news outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Choi |first=Yeomi |date=29 January 2019 |title=Major League Baseball and Racialized Masculinities in Korean Digital Media |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167479519825618 |journal=Communication &amp; Sport |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=168–187 |language=en |doi=10.1177/2167479519825618|s2cid=150733468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novels may be affected by Westernized perceptions. Amjad Alsyouf argues that African novelists [[Tayeb Salih]] and [[Chinua Achebe]], for example, bring some Western influence to the gender roles portrayed in their respective novels.&lt;ref name="Alsyouf"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alsyouf |first=Amjad |title=Hegemonic Masculinity in Archetypal African Novels |date=1 December 2018 |url=https://journal.uny.ac.id/index.php/informasi/article/view/21657 |journal=Informasi |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=169–179 |doi=10.21831/informasi.v48i2.21657 |issn=2502-3837|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual portrayals in fashion ===
Masculinity is also an important concept in advertisement branding in the Islamic culture. In [[Kuwait]], [[Muslims|Muslim]] men must remain vigilant in making sure that their consumption decisions are representative of the socially accepted masculine norms — particularly in regard to their fashion choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Al-Mutawa |first=Fajer Saleh |date=1 January 2016 |title=Negotiating Muslim masculinity: androgynous spaces within feminized fashion |url=https://doi.org/10.1108/JFMM-11-2014-0080 |journal=Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=19–33 |doi=10.1108/JFMM-11-2014-0080 |issn=1361-2026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, advertising in fashion branding choices and its effectiveness has been examined in the context of Chinese male consumers' choices. Men interested in wearing luxury fashion brands were often more concerned with making sure their choices were visually representative of a more professional and refined person, as opposed to someone that simply looked tough or strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Jiang |first1=Jiani |last2=Huhmann |first2=Bruce A. |last3=Hyman |first3=Michael R. |date=20 November 2019 |title=Emerging masculinities in Chinese luxury social media marketing |url=https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/APJML-07-2018-0256/full/html |journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics |language=en |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=721–745 |doi=10.1108/APJML-07-2018-0256 |s2cid=212780718 |issn=1355-5855}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of focus on visual portrayals can also appear in media depictions. In the Japanese film ''Sooshokukeidanshi'', one of the main characters is made to appear like more of an outsider than the other male characters because of his unique style choices being seen as less traditionally masculine than the cultural expectation is, in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kroo |first=Judit |date=10 August 2018 |title=Gentle masculinity in East Asia: 'Herbivore Men' and interlocutor constructed language |url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/japc.00012.kro |journal=Journal of Asian Pacific Communication |language=en |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=251–280 |doi=10.1075/japc.00012.kro |s2cid=149917168 |issn=0957-6851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on youth ===
Adharsh Raj and Manash Pratim Goswami write that in India, young people often copy negative behaviors seen as being traditionally masculine in [[Bollywood]] films.&lt;ref name="Raj" /&gt; Turkish young people can also fall prey to such negative media influence, According to Özlem Akkaya.{{r|Akkaya}} In a 2018 study, young males often thought that the violent behavior displayed by the main character, "Behzat", in the Turkish television crime series, ''[[Behzat Ç. Bir Ankara Polisiyesi]]'', was relatable to what they already experienced in their own day to day lives (and therefore, saw violence as a seemingly reasonable thing to occur in the series).&lt;ref name="Akkaya"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Akkaya |first=Özlem |date=2018 |title="The Crisis of Masculinity" on the Screen: Conflicted Masculinities in Behzat Ç.

Amongst secondary school students in [[New Zealand]], a 2017 study found that when examining print media advertisements, young girls occasionally fall back into a preconceived idea of what constitutes "typical" masculine behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=King |first=Brian W. |date=2017 |title=Querying heteronormativity among transnational Pasifika teenagers in New Zealand: An Oceanic approach to language and masculinity |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josl.12237 |journal=Journal of Sociolinguistics |language=en |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=442–464 |doi=10.1111/josl.12237 |issn=1467-9841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fatherhood ===
In the [[Global South]], many societies still follow very patriarchal norms. Through media depictions and real-life scenarios, men are seen as being the head of the family — those that provide financially, have decision making power, and really are in charge. The image of the nuclear family being the societal norm is also ever-present in many places.

=== Efforts toward gender equality ===
While [[gender equality]] has not been achieved, changes are happening in regard to these commonly believed gender roles, particularly with gender justice work in the [[Global South]]. In [[New Delhi]], India, males are more frequently becoming involved in this work, while also trying to remain mindful of how their privileged status as men affects the public perception of what they are doing.&lt;ref name="Gilbertson"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilbertson |first=Amanda |date=1 February 2018 |title=Of Mindsets and Men: Tackling Masculinity, Patriarchy, and Privilege in Delhi |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1097184X18755493 |journal=Men and Masculinities |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=266–287 |language=en |doi=10.1177/1097184X18755493|s2cid=149213138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], the tide is also turning, and men's involvement in opposing violence against women is generally seen as being very positive, a good thing for all. However, there are some who still very much see conflict and violence against women as simply going hand in hand with those cultures.&lt;ref name="Wu"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wu |first=Joyce |date=3 October 2019 |title=Men and anti-violence initiatives: transnational feminist reflections from Afghanistan and Pakistan |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0966369X.2018.1502161 |journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=1369–1385 |doi=10.1080/0966369X.2018.1502161 |s2cid=150074837 |issn=0966-369X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some want to shift the focus from specifically viewing females as the ones deserving of stronger rights to everyone deserving the opportunity to be viewed as an equal; however, this can create the potential for men to fall back into the mindset of "male victimhood", as opposed to focusing on female [[oppression]].&lt;ref name="Gilbertson" /&gt; Although gender equality is becoming a more acknowledged topic in South Africa, for instance, fathers would often rather still hold on to the more traditional gender roles – and pass those ideas down to their sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lesch |first1=Elmien |last2=Brooks |first2=Shannon |date=1 August 2019 |title=Man Talk: Exploring Sexual Communication Between Fathers and Sons in a Minority South African Community |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-018-0988-3 |journal=Sex Roles |language=en |volume=81 |issue=3 |pages=173–191 |doi=10.1007/s11199-018-0988-3 |s2cid=149873689 |issn=1573-2762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) has also been developed and the results from countries in the Global South studied more in recent years.{{When|date=April 2023}} Although the survey indicated areas for further improvement, a significant recent finding comes in regard to men's childhood upbringing and their attitudes surrounding gender equality. If men were raised seeing more equal division of household labor tasks, older female relatives working in non-traditional occupations, less violence toward females, etc., those behaviors and attitudes had a tendency to carry over into their adult lives, according to the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Levtov |first1=Ruti Galia |last2=Barker |first2=Gary |last3=Contreras-Urbina |first3=Manuel |last4=Heilman |first4=Brian |last5=Verma |first5=Ravi |date=6 November 2014 |title=Pathways to Gender-equitable Men: Findings from the International Men and Gender Equality Survey in Eight Countries |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1097184X14558234 |journal=Men and Masculinities |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=467–501 |language=en |doi=10.1177/1097184X14558234|s2cid=145452643 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study found some evidence that youth have perhaps, inadvertently, made contributions toward greater acceptance of gender equality. Popular culture consumed by youth and those of lesser social status in East [[Asia]], including [[manga]], singing competitions, bands, and more are starting to showcase more modernized males that combine some stereotypically masculine and feminine aspects in their behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Louie |first=Kam |date=November 2012 |title=Popular Culture and Masculinity Ideals in East Asia, with Special Reference to China |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |language=en |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=929–943 |doi=10.1017/S0021911812001234 |issn=0021-9118|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Africa]], stricter governmental policies are being put into place regarding abuse and violence. Additionally, initiatives like the "One Man Can" program were formed, which aim to provide [[HIV]] prevention and an anti-violence program to men in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Dworkin |first1=Shari L. |last2=Hatcher |first2=Abigail M. |last3=Colvin |first3=Chris |last4=Peacock |first4=Dean |date=June 2013 |title=Impact of a Gender-Transformative HIV and Antiviolence Program on Gender Ideologies and Masculinities in Two Rural, South African Communities |url= |journal=Men and Masculinities |language=en |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=181–202 |doi=10.1177/1097184X12469878 |issn=1097-184X |pmc=3848879 |pmid=24311940}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'We Can End Violence against Women' campaign is another anti-violence initiative in [[Pakistan]], developed by the [[Oxfam |Oxfam GB]] group in South Asia. In 2019, the program garnered much voluntary male participation in its gender equality work out of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Wu" /&gt;
