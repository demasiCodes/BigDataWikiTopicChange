'''Ageism''' (also spelled "'''agism'''") is [[stereotyping]] of and discrimination against individuals or groups on the basis of their age. This may be casual or systematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Nelson |editor1-first=T.D. |year=2002|title=Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice against Older Persons|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=978-0-262-64057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quadagno"&gt;Quadagno, J.

New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in 1969 by [[Robert Neil Butler]] to describe discrimination against [[Old age|seniors]], and patterned on [[sexism]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = R. N. | year = 1969 | title = Age-ism: Another form of bigotry | journal = The Gerontologist | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 243–246 | doi=10.1093/geront/9.4_part_1.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler defined "ageism" as a combination of three connected elements. Among them were prejudicial attitudes towards older people, old age, and the [[Ageing|aging process]]; discriminatory practices against older people; and institutional practices and policies that perpetuate [[stereotype]]s about elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson J and Ferraro K, Thirty Years of Ageism Research.

While the term is also used in regards to prejudice and discrimination against [[adolescents]] and [[children]], such as denying them certain rights (e.g. [[voting]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freechild.org/discrimination-against-youth-voice/|title=Discrimination Against Youth Voice|author=|date=7 January 2016|website=freechild.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ignoring their ideas because they are considered "too young", or assuming that they should behave in certain ways because of their age,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php "Young and Oppressed"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728105250/http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php |date=28 July 2011 }}. youthrights.org. Retrieved on 11 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the term is predominantly used in relation to the treatment of older people. Older people themselves can be deeply ageist, having internalized a lifetime of negative stereotypes about aging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kingsreview.co.uk/magazine/theblog/2015/09/08/youthful-indiscretions/ "Youthful Indiscretions"]. kingsreview.co.uk.

It can also be passive and covert (e.g., a movie that shows only young people inhabiting a locality and no children, infants or old people are shown in the area to drive the notion that the place is "young and romantic").

==Classification==
===Distinction from other age-related bias===
Ageism in common parlance and age studies usually refers to negative discriminatory practices against old people, people in their middle years, teenagers and children. There are several forms of age-related bias. [[Adultism]] is a predisposition towards adults, which is seen as biased against children, youth, and all young people who are not addressed or viewed as adults.&lt;ref&gt;Lauter And Howe (1971) ''Conspiracy of the Young.'' Meridian Press.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Jeunism''' is the discrimination against older people in favor of younger ones. This includes political candidacies, jobs, and cultural settings where the supposed greater vitality and/or [[Human physical appearance|physical beauty]] of youth is more appreciated than the supposed greater moral and/or [[Rigor|intellectual rigor]] of adulthood. [[Adultcentricism]] is the "exaggerated [[egocentrism]] of [[adults]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Martelaer | first1 = K. | last2 = De Knop | first2 = P. | last3 = Theeboom | first3 = M. | last4 = Van Heddegem | first4 = L. | year = 2000 | title = The UN Convention as a Basis for Elaborating Rights of Children In Sport | journal = Journal of Leisurability | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 3–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Adultocracy'' is the [[Convention (norm)|social convention]] which defines "maturity" and "immaturity," placing adults in a dominant position over [[youth|young people]], both theoretically and practically.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://www.zmag.org/0009.htm Youth Liberation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213202808/http://www.zmag.org/0009.htm |date=13 February 2007 }} ''Z'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerontocracy]] is a form of oligarchical rule in which an entity is ruled by leaders who are significantly older than most of the adult population.&lt;ref&gt;Maddox, G. L. (1987). The Encyclopedia of aging (p. 284). New York: Springer Pub. Co..&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chronocentrism]] is primarily the belief that a certain state of humanity is superior to all previous and/or future times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lyon | first1 = P. | last2 = Pollard | first2 = D. | year = 1997 | title = Perceptions of the older employee: is anything really changing? | journal = Personnel Review | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 245–257 [249] | doi=10.1108/00483489710172051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a conceptual analysis of ageism, a new definition of ageism was introduced by Iversen, Larsen, &amp; Solem in 2009. This definition constitutes the foundation for higher reliability and validity in future research about ageism and its complexity offers a new way of systemizing theories on ageism: "Ageism is defined as negative or positive stereotypes, prejudice and/or discrimination against (or to the advantage of) elderly people on the basis of their chronological age or on the basis of a perception of them as being 'old' or 'elderly'. Ageism can be implicit or explicit and can be expressed on a micro-, meso- or macro-level" (Iversen, Larsen &amp; Solem, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iversen | first1 = T.N. | last2 = Larsen | first2 = L. | last3 = Solem | first3 = P.E. | year = 2009 | title = A conceptual analysis of ageism | journal = Nordic Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = 3| pages = 4–22 | doi=10.1027/1901-2276.61.3.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other conditions of fear or aversion associated with age groups have their own names, particularly: paedophobia, the fear of infants and children; ephebiphobia, the fear of youth,&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2006) ''Washington Youth Voice Handbook.'' CommonAction.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes also referred to as an irrational fear of adolescents or a prejudice against teenagers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stop-discrimination.info/6423.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;mc_glossary%5Bcategories%5D=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017120531/http://stop-discrimination.info/6423.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;mc_glossary%5Bcategories%5D=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 October 2007 |title=Stop Discrimination's Glossary (European Union) |work=stop-discrimination.info |accessdate=17 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gerontophobia]], the fear of elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;Branch, L., Harris, D. &amp; Palmore, E.B. (2005) ''Encyclopedia of Ageism.'' Haworth Press. {{ISBN|0-7890-1890-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit ageism===
[[Implicature|Implicit]] ageism is the term used to refer to the implicit or subconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors one has about older or younger people. These may be a mixture of positive and negative thoughts and feelings, but gerontologist [[Becca Levy]] reports that they "tend to be mostly negative."&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levy | first1 = B. R. | year = 2001 | title = Eradication of Ageism requires addressing the enemy within | journal = The Gerontologist | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 578–579 | doi=10.1093/geront/41.5.578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotyping===
[[stereotype|Stereotyping]] is a tool of cognition which involves categorizing into groups and attributing characteristics to these groups. Stereotypes are necessary for processing huge volumes of information which would otherwise overload a person and are generally accurate descriptors of group characteristics, though some stereotypes are inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stereotype Accuracy: Toward Appreciating Group Differences |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=September 1995 |isbn=978-1-55798-307-7 |editors= [[Yueh-Ting Lee]], Lee J. Jussim, and Clark R. McCauley}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they can cause harm when the content of the stereotype is incorrect with respect to most of the group or where a stereotype is so strongly held that it overrides evidence which shows that an individual does not conform to it. For example, age-based stereotypes prime one to draw very different conclusions when one sees an older and a younger adult with, say, back pain or a limp.  One might well assume that the younger person's condition is temporary and treatable, following an accident, while the older person's condition is chronic and less susceptible to intervention. On average, this might be true, but plenty of older people have accidents and recover quickly and very young people (such as infants, toddlers and small children) can become permanently disabled in the same situation. This assumption may have no consequence if one makes it in the blink of an eye as one is passing someone in the street, but if it is held by a health professional offering treatment or managers thinking about occupational health, it could inappropriately influence their actions and lead to age-related discrimination. Managers have been accused, by Erdman Palmore, as stereotyping older workers as being resistant to change, not creative, cautious, slow to make judgments, lower in physical capacity, uninterested in technological change, and difficult to train.&lt;ref&gt;Palmore, E. B. (1999).  Ageism: negative and positive (2nd ed., p. 108). New York: Springer Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is when people are rude to children because of their high pitched voice, even if they are kind and courteous. A review of the research literature related to age stereotypes in the workplace was recently published in the Journal of Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posthuma | first1 = R. A. | last2 = Campion | first2 = M. A. | year = 2009 | title = Age stereotyping in the workplace: Common stereotypes, moderators, and future research directions | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 158–188 | doi=10.1177/0149206308318617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to common and more obvious forms of stereotyping, such as racism and sexism, ageism is more resistant to change. For instance, if a child believes in an ageist idea against the elderly, fewer people correct them, and, as a result, individuals grow up believing in ageist ideas, even elders themselves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span, Second Edition|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ageism can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Ageist beliefs against the elderly are commonplace in today's society. For example, an older person who forgets something could be quick to call it a "senior moment," failing to realize the ageism of that statement. People also often utter ageist phrases such as "dirty old man" or "second childhood," and elders sometimes miss the ageist undertones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a classic study, researchers analyzed the effects of ageism among the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Aging free from stereotypes: Successful memory in China among the deaf|last = Levy|first = Becca|date = 1994|journal = Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Langer|first2 = Ellen}}&lt;/ref&gt; They performed memory tests on three selected groups: residents of China, deaf North Americans, and hearing North Americans. In the three groups, the Chinese residents were presumably the least exposed to ageism, with lifelong experience in a culture that traditionally venerates older generations. Lifelong deaf North Americans also faced less exposure to ageism in contrast to those with typical hearing, who presumably had heard ageist comments their whole life. The results of the memory tests showed that ageism has significant effects on memory.

The gap in the scores between the young and old North Americans with normal hearing were double those of the deaf North Americans and five times wider than those of the Chinese participants. The results show that ageism undermines ability through its self-fulfilling nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study was investigating the effect of the [[stereotype threat]], which has been explored as a possible reason for memory deficits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geronb/58.1.P3 |pmid=12496296 |title=The Impact of Stereotype Threat on Age Differences in Memory Performance |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=P3–11 |year=2003 |last1=Hess |first1=Thomas M. |last2=Auman |first2=Corinne |last3=Colcombe |first3=Stanley J. |last4=Rahhal |first4=Tamara A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the stereotype threat has been criticized.&lt;ref name="Ganley2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0031412 |pmid=23356523 |title=An examination of stereotype threat effects on girls' mathematics performance |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=1886–97 |year=2013 |last1=Ganley |first1=Colleen M |last2=Mingle |first2=Leigh A |last3=Ryan |first3=Allison M |last4=Ryan |first4=Katherine |last5=Vasilyeva |first5=Marina |last6=Perry |first6=Michelle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, when elders show larger independence and control in their lives, defying ageist assumptions, they are more likely to be healthier, both mentally and physically, than other people their age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research indicates that older people are stereotyped as scoring lower on measures of impulsivity, activism, antagonism and [[openness to experience|openness]] while younger people are stereotyped as scoring higher on these measures. This was found to be universal across cultures and was also found to be reasonably accurate (varying depending on how the accuracy was assessed and the type of stereotype), though differences were consistently exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0029712 |pmid=23088227 |pmc=3514646 |title=Stereotypes of age differences in personality traits: Universal and accurate? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=103 |issue=6 |pages=1050–1066 |year=2012 |last1=Chan |first1=Wayne |last2=McCrae |first2=Robert R |last3=De Fruyt |first3=Filip |last4=Jussim |first4=Lee |last5=Löckenhoff |first5=Corinna E |last6=De Bolle |first6=Marleen |last7=Costa |first7=Paul T |last8=Sutin |first8=Angelina R |last9=Realo |first9=Anu |last10=Allik |first10=Jüri |last11=Nakazato |first11=Katsuharu |last12=Shimonaka |first12=Yoshiko |last13=Hřebíčková |first13=Martina |last14=Graf |first14=Sylvie |last15=Yik |first15=Michelle |last16=Brunner-Sciarra |first16=Marina |last17=De Figueroa |first17=Nora Leibovich |last18=Schmidt |first18=Vanina |last19=Ahn |first19=Chang-kyu |last20=Ahn |first20=Hyun-nie |last21=Aguilar-Vafaie |first21=Maria E |last22=Siuta |first22=Jerzy |last23=Szmigielska |first23=Barbara |last24=Cain |first24=Thomas R |last25=Crawford |first25=Jarret T |last26=Mastor |first26=Khairul Anwar |last27=Rolland |first27=Jean-Pierre |last28=Nansubuga |first28=Florence |last29=Miramontez |first29=Daniel R |last30=Benet-Martínez |first30=Verónica |display-authors=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ageism can also manifests itself in perceptions of how dateable one is; which has culminated in terms such as the ''sexpiration date'', indicating the age after which one is no longer appealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Apt | first1 = Carol | last2 = Farley Hurlbert | first2 = David | year = 1994 | title = The sexual attitudes, behavior, and relationships of women with histrionic personality disorder | url = | journal = Journal of sex &amp; marital therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 125–134 | doi=10.1080/00926239408403423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prejudice===
Ageist [[prejudice]] is a type of emotion which is often linked to the cognitive process of stereotyping. It can involve the expression of derogatory attitudes, which may then lead to the use of discriminatory behavior. Where older or younger contestants were rejected in the belief that they were poor performers, this could well be the result of stereotyping.  But older people were also voted for on a stage in a game where it made sense to target the best performers.  This can only be explained by a subconscious emotional reaction to older people; in this case, the prejudice took the form of distaste and a desire to exclude oneself from the company of older people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195385052.001.0001 |first1=Richard A. |last1=Posthuma |first2=María Fernanda |last2=Wagstaff, |first3=Michael A. |last3=Campion |chapter=Age Stereotypes and Workplace Age Discrimination: A Framework for Future Research |pages=298–312 |chapterurl={{Google books|OSBpAgAAQBAJ|page=298|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=Walter C. |editor1-last=Borman |editor2-first=Jerry W. |editor2-last=Hedge |title=The Oxford Handbook of Work and Aging |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-19-538505-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotyping and prejudice against different groups in society does not take the same form.  Age-based prejudice and stereotyping usually involves older or younger people being pitied, marginalized, or patronized.  This is described as "'''benevolent prejudice"''' because the tendency to pity is linked to seeing older or younger people as "friendly" but "incompetent." [[Age Concern]]'s survey revealed strong evidence of "benevolent prejudice."  48% said that over-70s are viewed as friendly (compared to 27% who said the same about under-30s).  Meanwhile, only 26% believe over-70s are viewed as capable (with 41% saying the same about under-30s).&lt;ref name="Loretto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loretto | first1 = W. | last2 = Duncan | first2 = C. | last3 = White | first3 = P.J. | year = 2000 | title = Ageism and employment: Controversies, ambiguities, and younger people's perceptions | journal = Ageing &amp; Society | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 279–302 | doi=10.1017/s0144686x00007741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure for friendliness of under-30s is, conversely, an example of Hostile Prejudice. '''Hostile prejudice''' based on hatred, fear, aversion, or threat often characterizes attitudes linked to race, religion, disability, and sex. An example of hostile prejudice toward youth is the presumption without any evidence that a given crime was committed by a young person. Rhetoric regarding intergenerational competition can be motivated by politics. Violence against vulnerable older people can be motivated by subconscious hostility or fear; within families, this involves impatience and lack of understanding.  Equality campaigners are often wary of drawing comparisons between different forms of inequality.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The impact of "benevolent" and "hostile" prejudice tends to be different.  The warmth felt towards older or younger people and the knowledge that many have no access to paid employment means there is often public acceptance that they are deserving of preferential treatment—for example, less expensive movie and bus fares. But the perception of incompetence means older and younger people can be seen as "not up to the job" or "a menace on the roads," when there is little or exaggerated evidence to support this.  Prejudice also leads to assumptions that it is "natural" for older or younger people to have lower expectations, reduced choice and control, and less account taken of their views.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Digital ageism ===
Digital ageism refers to the prejudices faced by older adults in the digital world. A few examples of the subtle ways in which digital ageism operates in cultural representations, research, and everyday life: Generational segregation naturalizes youth as digitally adept and the old as digital dunces. There is no empirical evidence, though, for a digital divide between older and younger people, with the former never and the latter always capable to use digital media; a far more accurate description is that of a digital spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenhart; A. and Horrigan, J.B.|first=|date=2003|title=Re-visualizing the digital divide as a digital spectrum|url=|journal=IT &amp; Society|volume=1 |issue=5|pages=23–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.15847/obsOBS612012513 |doi-broken-date=2018-05-29 |url=http://obs.obercom.pt/index.php/obs/article/view/513 |first1=Eugène |last1=Loos |title=Senior citizens: Digital immigrants in their own country? |journal=Observatorio |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=2012 |pages=1–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loos, E.

For example, in a media diffusionist perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. (1995). Diffusion of Innovations. California: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; the practices of seniors are depicted as either negligible or as lagging, and the equation of diffusion with individual ownership can hide practical ‘work-arounds’ such as cell phone sharing or missed calls used by older couples on fixed incomes.&lt;ref&gt;Sawchuk, K. &amp; Crow, B.

=== Visual ageism ===
The term ''visual ageism'' was coined in 2018 by Loos and Ivan. They define ''visual ageism'' as “the social practice of visually underrepresenting older people or misrepresenting them in a prejudiced way”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Loos. E. F., &amp; Ivan, L. (2018). Visual Ageism in the Media. In: L. Ayalon &amp; C. Tesch-Roemer (Eds.), ''Contemporary perspectives on ageism'' (pp. 163-176)''.'' Berlin: Springer. [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-73820-8_11.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; We are facing a shift from visual ageism characterized by underrepresentation and the negative representation of older people to a representation of older age characterized by images of stereotypically third age older adults (enjoying life and living their golden years), while older adults in their fourth age (inactive and unable to live independently) remain invisible. A review of empirical studies conducted since 1950 in Europe and North America&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; reveals that print and television advertisements started this transition towards a more positive visual representation of older adults in their age during the last decade of the 20th century, followed by television programs some years later, while older adults in their fourth age remain invisible. This is probably due to the increase in third age rhetoric in the media, picturing older people as healthy and as potential consumers, enjoying life and living their golden years. Media representations of older people have moved from visual under- and misrepresentation (negative images)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Atkins | first1 = T. | last2 = Jenkins | first2 = M.

London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These days, visual ageism in the media tends to come wrapped in the guise of the positive attributes of third age representations of older people, while adults in their fourth age continue to be underrepresented. One possible explanation for this is that healthy third agers might prefer not to be associated with fourth agers, as they remind them too starkly of what lies ahead in their own near future. Although this discomfort or even fear about mortality is undeniably common, from a societal point of view this kind of (self)ageism is hurtful to fourth agers as a group and in a sense to third agers as well, as they risk to become fourth agers themselves one day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Discrimination==
Age discrimination is the result of actions taken to deny or limit opportunities to people on the basis of age. These are usually actions taken as a result of one's ageist beliefs and attitudes. Age discrimination occurs on both a personal and institutional level.&lt;ref name="Quadagno" /&gt;

On a personal level, an older person may be told that he or she is too old to engage in certain physical activities, like an informal game of basketball between friends and family. A younger person may be told they are too young to get a job or help move the dining room table. On an institutional level, there are policies and regulations in place that limit opportunities to people of certain ages and deny them to all others. The law, for instance, requires that all people must be at least 16 years old in order to obtain a driver's license in the United States. There are also government regulations that determine when a worker may retire. Currently, in the US, a worker must be between 65 and 67 years old (depending upon his or her birth year) before becoming eligible for full Social Security retirement benefits (age 62 for 70% benefits) but some company pension plans begin benefits at earlier ages.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

A 2006/2007 survey done by the Children's Rights Alliance for England and the National Children's Bureau asked 4,060 children and young people whether they have ever been treated unfairly based on various criteria (race, age, sex, sexual orientation, etc.).  A total of 43% of British youth surveyed reported experiencing discrimination based on their age, far eclipsing other categories of discrimination like sex (27%), race (11%), or sexual orientation (6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Carolyne |last1=Willow |first2=Anita |last2=Franklin |first3=Catherine |last3=Shaw |date=April 2007 |title=Meeting the obligations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in England: children and young people's messages to government |url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/id/eprint/10935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistently, a study based on the European Social Survey found that whereas 35% of Europeans reported exposure ageism, only 25% reported exposure to sexism and as few as 17% reported exposure to racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayalon|first=Liat|title=Perceived Age, Gender, and Racial/Ethnic Discrimination in Europe: Results from the European Social Survey|journal=Educational Gerontology|year=2014|volume=40|issue=7|pages=499–517|doi=10.1080/03601277.2013.845490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ageism has significant effects in two particular sectors: employment and health care. Age discrimination has contributed to disparities in health between men and women. Reducing ageism and sexism would promote improved doctor-patient relationships and reduce ageist stereotypes in the healthcare industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/josi.12157 |title=Ageism can be Hazardous to Women's Health: Ageism, Sexism, and Stereotypes of Older Women in the Healthcare System |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=86–104 |year=2016 |last1=Chrisler |first1=Joan C |last2=Barney |first2=Angela |last3=Palatino |first3=Brigida }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
The concept of ageism was originally developed to refer to prejudice and discrimination against older people and middle age, but has expanded to include children and teenagers.&lt;ref name="Loretto"/&gt; Like [[racism|racial]] and [[gender discrimination]], age discrimination, at least when it affects younger workers, can result in unequal pay for equal work.  Unlike racial and gender discrimination, however, age discrimination in wages is often enshrined in law. For example, in both the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/q-a.htm Questions and Answers About the Minimum Wage], US Department of Labor&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agepositive.gov.uk/news/minimum_wage.asp][[Age Positive]], [[Department for Work and Pensions]] in Sheffield and London&lt;/ref&gt; [[minimum wage]] laws allow for employers to pay lower wages to young workers.  Many state and local minimum wage laws mirror such an age-based, tiered minimum wage. As well, the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] was amended in 1986 to allow the [[United States Secretary of Labor]] to provide special certificates to allow an employer to pay less than the minimum wage to individuals whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury.&lt;ref name= s2884&gt;"[https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/senate-bill/2884?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22fair+labor+standards%5C%22%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1 S.2884 — 99th Congress (1985-1986)]". ''United States Congress''. October 16, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; These employees must still be paid wages that are related to the individual's productivity and commensurate with those paid to similarly located and employed non-handicapped workers.&lt;ref name= s2884/&gt; Midlife workers, on average, make more than younger workers do, which reflects educational achievement and experience of various kinds (job-specific, industry-specific, etc.). The age-wage peak in the United States, according to Census data, is between 45 and 54 years of age. Seniority in general accords with respect as people age, lessening ageism. Statistical discrimination refers to limiting the employment opportunities of an individual based on stereotypes of a group to which the person belongs. Limited employment opportunities could come in the form of lower pay for equal work or jobs with little [[social mobility]]. Younger female workers were historically discriminated against, in comparison with younger men, because it was expected that, as young women of childbearing years, they would need to leave the work force permanently or periodically to have children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Edmund S. |last1=Phelps |date=September 1972 |title=The Statistical Theory of Racism and Sexism |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=659–61 |jstor=1806107 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edmund_Phelps/publication/4728049_The_Statistical_Theory_of_Racism_and_Sexism/links/5494a5de0cf2ec1337581a8f/The-Statistical-Theory-of-Racism-and-Sexism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, midlife female workers may also experience discrimination based on their appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.scaman.2013.07.002 |title=Women managers, careers and gendered ageism |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Management |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=175–85 |year=2014 |last1=Jyrkinen |first1=Marjut }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may feel less visible and undervalued&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0144686X07007003 |title=Visible and invisible ageing: Beauty work as a response to ageism |journal=Ageing and Society |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=653–74 |year=2008 |last1=Clarke |first1=Laura Hurd |last2=Griffin |first2=Meridith }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a culture where emphasis is on maintaining an approved standard of beauty, e.g. ‘thin, pretty, White, and young’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/08952841.2015.1125698 |title=There's a cream for that: A textual analysis of beauty and body-related advertisements aimed at middle-aged women |journal=Journal of Women &amp; Aging |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=185–97 |year=2016 |last1=Del Rosso |first1=Teri }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same standard could have no effect on male colleagues of the same age.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Labor regulations also limit the age at which people are allowed to work and how many hours and under what conditions they may work.  In the United States, a person must generally be at least 14 years old to seek a job, and workers face additional restrictions on their work activities until they reach age 16.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/youthlabor/agerequirements.htm Youth &amp; Labor – Age Requirements], US Department of Labor&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies refuse to hire workers younger than 18. While older workers benefit more often from higher wages than do younger workers, they face barriers in promotions and hiring.  Employers also encourage [[Retirement|early retirement]] or [[layoff]]s disproportionately more for older or more experienced workers.

Some political offices have qualifications that discriminate on the basis of age as a proxy for experience, education, or accumulated wisdom. For example, the President of the United States must be at least 35 years old; a [[United States Senator]] must be at least 30; and a [[United States Congress]] member must be at least 25. In the UK, age discrimination against older people has been prohibited in employment since 2006. Since then, the number of age discrimination cases rose dramatically. The laws protect anyone over the age of 16 who is young as well as old. There were over 6,800 claims submitted to the Employment Tribunal in 2010/11 compared with just 900 in 2006/2007 (immediately after the Regulations came in force).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agediscrimination.info/{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the figures for 2011/2012 show a 47% fall in the number of claims, and commentators have suggested that the repeal of the [[Default Retirement Age]] may be the reason behind this.

Age discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in the United States. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'s first complainants were female flight attendants complaining of (among other things) age discrimination.&lt;ref name="Collins2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gail Collins|title=When Everything Changed: The Amazing Journey of American Women from 1960 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sQ1HhzuaYkEC&amp;pg=PT59|date=14 October 2009|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-07166-6|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, the EEOC declared age restrictions on flight attendants’ employment to be illegal sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=K Barry |url=http://femininityinflight.com/activism.html |title=Timeline of Discrimination |publisher=Femininity in Flight |date= |accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Joanna Lahey, professor at [[The Bush School of Government and Public Service]] at [[Texas A&amp;M]], found recently that firms are more than 40% more likely to interview a young adult job applicant than an older job applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Lahey, J. (2005) [https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html Do Older Workers Face Discrimination?] Boston College.&lt;/ref&gt; All states in the [[US]] prohibit youth under 14 from working with a handful of exceptions, and prohibit youth under 18 from working in hazardous occupations. They are also paid a lower minimum wage and not allowed to work full-time.

Also in Europe, pervasive levels of age discrimination are found in [[Belgium]], [[England]], [[France]], Spain, and Sweden. Job candidates revealing older age are found to get 39% (in Belgium) to 72% (in France) less job interview invitations compared to equal candidates revealing a younger name.&lt;ref name="Baert et al 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.joep.2016.10.002 |title=Getting grey hairs in the labour market.

=== Hollywood ===
Ageism in Hollywood, specifically in terms of women, is profound, from the way youth is praised to the lack of jobs for older actresses. The way youth is praised reflects directly on the way older women are presented in the media. President and CEO of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, O. Burtch Drake, spoke in terms of older women's representation throughout the media stating "older women are not being portrayed at all; there is no imagery to worry about."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kleyman, Paul. "Images of Aging." ''Encyclopedia of Aging''. Ed. David J. Ekerdt. Vol. 2. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2002. 679-685. ''Gale Virtual Reference Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; Women over fifty are not the center of attention and if an actress is older they are expected to act anything but their age.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  These same women who have been acting since their teenage years, who have always been told to act their age, now must change the dynamic of their job by not acting their age when they get to be considered old by society and the media. The standards set in film are fixated upon youth - sexuality, beauty, physicality.  Movies that portray women acting their own age (i.e. a 50-year-old acting 50 years old) seems exaggerated and unrealistic because it does not fit the norms associated with women in film and media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women are forced to feel that they must continuously improve upon their looks to be seen and they can be replaced by a younger model of themselves. "Silver ceiling" references the new type of ceiling older workers in the entertainment industry, especially women, are being faced with. Underemployment of older actresses surpasses that of older actors because of the typical pairing of older actors with younger actresses in films.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; BBC news anchor, Nigel Kay, found in a survey that "on television older men significantly outnumber older women by about 70 percent to 30 percent."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; An issue amongst older women is that their voices are not being heard, which is especially true for older actresses in Hollywood. The issues about employment they are bringing to light as well as the complaints they have are not being taken seriously and they are being excluded from conversations about Hollywood and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Being an Older Woman: A Study in the Social Production of Identity|last = Paoletti|first = Isabella|publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year = 1998|isbn = 0-8058-2120-1|location = New Jersey|pages = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the limited ages the film industry portrays and the lack of older actresses, society as a whole has a type of illiteracy about sexuality and those of old age. There is an almost inherent bias about what older women are capable of, what they do, and how they feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender, Social Inequalities, and Aging|last = Calasanti|first = Toni M.|publisher = AltaMira Press|year = 2001|isbn = 0-7591-0185-X|location = Walnut Creek|pages = 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst all ages of actresses there is the attempt to look youthful and fitting to the beauty standards by altering themselves physically, many times under the hands of plastic surgeons.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chivers | first1 = Sally | year = 2006 | title = Baby Jane Grew Up: The Dramatic Intersection Of Age With Disability | url = | journal = Canadian Review of American Studies | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 211–227 | doi=10.1353/crv.2006.0039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women become frightful of what they will be seen as if they have wrinkles, cellulite, or any other signifier of aging.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saucier | first1 = Maggi G | year = 2004 | title = Midlife And Beyond: Issues For Aging Women | url = | journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development | volume = 82 | issue = 4| pages = 420–425 | doi=10.1002/j.1556-6678.2004.tb00329.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As women reach their forties and fifties, pressure to adhere to societal beauty norms seen amongst films and media intensifies in terms of new cosmetic procedures and products that will maintain a "forever youthful" look.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In terms of sexuality, older women are seen as unattractive, bitter, unhappy, unsuccessful in films.  With older women not being represented in the media and film industries, specifically in Hollywood, thoughts of underachievement, ugliness, and disgust crowd the thoughts of older women as they fail to meet beauty norms.  This can cause depression, anxiety, and self-esteem issues in general.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "In one survey, women reported feeling more embarrassed about their age than by their masturbation practices or same-gender sexual encounters."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Women are forced to feel that they must continuously improve upon their looks to be seen and they can be replaced by a younger model of themselves.

The ideal that younger actresses are better than older actresses in Hollywood can be seen by the preferences of the people who are watching movies. Movie spectators display discrimination against older women in Hollywood. A study between 1926-1999 proved that older men in Hollywood had more leading roles than women who were the same age as them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Psychology At The Movies|last = Young|first = Skip Dine|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-470-97177-2|location = West Sussex|pages = 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many cases where leading actors play the attractive love interest for longer than women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This portrayal of women never aging but men aging can have a negative affect on not only actresses in Hollywood but also women who are not in the media.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  There are fewer older actresses that get leading roles than young actresses, this promotes the idea that women do not age and that older women are less attractive. This can be harmful to women because they will strive for something that is impossible to have, eternal youth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

What some people think of as old other people may not. An actress in Hollywood may not consider herself old but can be told she is too old for a part. A very well known example of this is what happened to the actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, "she was recently turned down for a role in a movie because she was too old to play the love interest for a 55-year-old man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Maggie Gyllenhaal on Hollywood Ageism: I Was Told 37 Is 'Too Old' for a 55-Year-Old Love Interest|url = http://www.thewrap.com/maggie-gyllenhaal-on-hollywood-ageism-i-was-told-37-is-too-old-for-a-55-year-old-love-interest/|website = TheWrap|accessdate = 9 December 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a woman is told she is old she can start to believe that she is. A woman can start acting as if she is older than she believes because she internalizes what other people are saying and what they think about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Social World of Old Women: Management of Self-Identity|last = Matthews|first = Sarah H.|publisher = Sage Publication|year = 1979|isbn = 0-8039-1225-0|location = Beverly Hills, CA|pages = 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In film the female body is depicted in different states of dress, and portrayed differently depending on the age of the actress. Their clothing is used as an identity marker of the character. Young women are put into revealing and sexy costumes whereas older women often play the part of a mother or grandmother clad in appropriate attire. This can include a bonnet or apron as she carries about her matronly duties.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Aging Bodies:The Aging Female Body|last = Markson|first = Elizabeth|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year = 2003|isbn = 0-7591-0236-8|location = Lanham, Maryland|pages = 78, 79, 80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead both men and women to perceive the female body in a certain way based on what is seen on screen. Annette Kuhn said twenty years ago that "One of the major theoretical contributions of the women's movement has been its insistence on the significance of cultural factors, in particular in the form of socially dominant representations of women and the ideological character of such representation, both in constituting the category 'woman' and in delimiting and defining what has been called the 'sex-gender system'"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women's bodies are often seen as an object to be looked at and desired by men. As women get older and enter their post-menopausal years, they no longer are examples of the ideal feminine model. Added to that is the idea that females become mentally unstable as they enter their older years. "They become quarrelsome, vexatious and overbearing, petty and stingy; that is to say they exhibit typically sadistic and anal-erotic traits that they did not possess earlier...(Freud 1958,323-24)"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ageism is not new to Hollywood and has been around since the time of silent films. When transitioning from silent movies to talking motion pictures, Charlie Chaplin (a well known silent movie actor) said in an interview that "It's beauty that matters in pictures-nothing else....Pictures! Lovely looking girls...What if the girls can't act?...Certainly I prefer to see, say, Dolores Costello [a 1920s silent movie star], in a thin tale than some aged actress of the stage (Walker 1979,132)".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the patient-physician interaction, physicians and other health care providers may hold attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that are associated with ageism against older patients. Studies have found that some physicians do not seem to show any care or concern toward treating the medical problems of older people. Then, when actually interacting with these older patients on the job, the doctors sometimes view them with disgust and describe them in negative ways, such as "depressing" or "crazy."&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = T. D. | year = 2005 | title = Ageism: Prejudice against our feared future self | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 61 | issue = 2| pages = 207–221 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00402.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For screening procedures, elderly people are less likely than younger people to be screened for cancers and, due to the lack of this preventative measure, less likely to be diagnosed at early stages of their conditions.&lt;ref name="Robb"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robb | first1 = C. | last2 = Hongbin | first2 = C. | last3 = Haley | first3 = W.

After being diagnosed with a disease that may be potentially curable, older people are further discriminated against. Though there may be surgeries or operations with high survival rates that might cure their condition, older patients are less likely than younger patients to receive all the necessary treatments. For example, health professionals pursue less aggressive treatment options in older patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Learning to be old: Gender, culture, and aging |edition=2nd |last = Cruikshank|first = Margaret|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Lanham, MD|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fewer adults are enrolled in tests of new prescription drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Disparate inclusion of older adults in clinical trials: Priorities and opportunities for policy and practice change|last = Herrera|first = Angelica P.|date = 2010|journal = American Journal of Public Health|doi = 10.2105/ajph.2009.162982 |pmid = 20147682|volume=100 |pages=S105–S112 |pmc=2837461}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been posited that this is because doctors fear their older patients are not physically strong enough to tolerate the curative treatments and are more likely to have complications during surgery that may end in death.

Other research studies have been done with patients with heart disease, and, in these cases, the older patients were still less likely to receive further tests or treatments, independent of the severity of their health problems. Thus, the approach to the treatment of older people is concentrated on managing the disease rather than preventing or curing it. This is based on the stereotype that it is the natural process of aging for the quality of health to decrease, and, therefore, there is no point in attempting to prevent the inevitable decline of old age.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robb" /&gt;

Furthermore, caregivers further undermine the treatment of older patients by helping them too much, which decreases independence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A primer on medication use in older adults for the non-clinician|last = Peron|first = Emily P.|date = 2011–2012|journal = Generations|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Ruby|first2 = Christine M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by making a generalized assumption and treating all elderly as feeble.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Differential medical treatment of elderly people can have significant effects on their health outcomes, a differential outcome which somehow escapes established protections.

In 2017, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in favor of Maria Ivone Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais, who had had an operation that was mishandled and rendered her unable to have sex. Portuguese judges had previously reduced damages to her in 2014, ruling then that the operation, which occurred when she was 50, had happened at "an age when sex is not as important as in younger years." The [[European Court of Human Rights]] rejected that decision, with the majority's ruling stating in part, "The question at issue here is not considerations of age or sex as such, but rather the assumption that sexuality is not as important for a 50-year-old woman and mother of two children as for someone of a younger age. That assumption reflects a traditional idea of female sexuality as being essentially linked to childbearing purposes and thus ignores its physical and psychological relevance for the self-fulfillment of women as people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By SEWELL CHANJULY 25, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/world/europe/sex-after-50-portugal-european-court.html |title=Sex for Women After 50 Is Important After All, European Court Rules - The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of ageism==
Ageism has significant effects on the elderly and young people. These effects might be seen within different levels: individual person, selected company, whole economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prokurat|first=Sergiusz|date=2012|title=Age Management as a Tool for the Demographic Decline in the 21st Century: An Overview of its Characteristics|url=http://www.jemi.edu.pl/vol-8-issue-4-2012/age-management-as-a-tool-for-the-demographic-decline-in-the-21st-century-an-overview-of-its-characteristics|journal=Journal of Entrepreneurship, Management and Innovation|volume=8/2012|pages=83–96|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypes and infantilization of older and younger people by patronizing language affects older and younger people's self-esteem and behaviors. After repeatedly hearing a stereotype that older or younger people are useless, older and younger people may begin to feel like dependent, non-contributing members of society. They may start to perceive themselves in terms of the [[looking-glass self]]—that is, in the same ways that others in society see them. Studies have also specifically shown that when older and younger people hear these stereotypes about their supposed incompetence and uselessness, they perform worse on measures of competence and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levy | first1 = B | year = 1996 | title = Improving memory in old age by implicit self-stereotyping | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 6| pages = 1092–1107 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.6.1092}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stereotypes then become [[self-fulfilling prophecies]]. According to [[Becca Levy]]'s [[Stereotype embodiment theory|Stereotype Embodiment Theory]], older and younger people might also engage in self-stereotypes, taking their culture's age stereotypes—to which they have been exposed over the life course—and directing them inward toward themselves. Then this behavior reinforces the present stereotypes and treatment of the elderly.&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;

Many overcome these stereotypes and live the way they want, but it can be difficult to avoid deeply ingrained prejudice, especially if one has been exposed to ageist views in childhood or adolescence.

Age discrimination laws at the national level were strengthened by the Age Discrimination Act 2004, which helps to ensure that people are not subjected to age discrimination in various areas of public life, including employment, the provision of goods and services, education, and the administration of Australian government laws and programs. The Act, however, does provide for exemptions in some areas, as well as providing for positive discrimination, that is, actions which assist people of a particular age who experience a disadvantage because of their age.&lt;ref name="ahrc" /&gt;

In 2011, for the first time a position of Age Discrimination Commissioner was created within the Australian Human Rights Commission. The new Commissioner's responsibilities include raising awareness among employers about the beneficial contributions that senior Australians as well as younger employees can make in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agediscrimination.info/News/Pages/ItemPage.aspx?Item=431 In Australia, new age discrimination laws have been passed by the Federal Parliament; a position of Age Discrimination Commissioner has been created in the Australian Human Rights Commission for the first time].

Every state in Australia has a probationary plate system for drivers.  This is allowed because the Age Discrimination Act says that, in some circumstances, treating someone differently because of their age won’t be against the law. This is known as an exemption and includes:

*things done in compliance with Commonwealth laws, including laws about taxation, social security and migration 
*things done in compliance with state and territory laws
*certain health and employment programmes
*youth wages or direct compliance with industrial agreements and awards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanrights.gov.au/know-your-rights-age-discrimination When is age discrimination not against the law?] humanrights.gov.au Retrieved 7 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advocacy campaigns==
{{Cleanup rewrite|it has a completely different focus than the rest of the article, which focuses on ageism against the elderly|section|date=August 2015}}
Many current and historical [[intergenerational equity|intergenerational]] and [[youth programs]] have been created to address the issue of Ageism. Among the advocacy organizations created in the United Kingdom to challenge age discrimination are [[Age UK]] and the [[British Youth Council]].

In the United States there have been several historic and current efforts to challenge Ageism. The earliest example may be the [[Newsboys Strike of 1899]], which fought ageist employment practices targeted against youth by large newspaper syndicates in the Northeast. During the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] Administration, [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was active in the national [[youth movement]], including the formation of the [[National Youth Administration]] and the defense of the [[American Youth Congress]]. She made several statements on behalf of youth and against Ageism. In one report entitled, "Facing the Problems of Youth," Roosevelt said of youth,

:"We cannot simply expect them to say, 'Our older people have had experience and they have proved to themselves certain things, therefore they are right.' That isn't the way the best kind of young people think. They want to experience for themselves. I find they are perfectly willing to talk to older people, but they don't want to talk to older people who are shocked by their ideas, nor do they want to talk to older people who are not realistic."&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, A.E. (1935) [http://newdeal.feri.org/er/er21.htm "Facing the Problems of Youth,"] ''National Parent-Teacher Magazine 29''(30). Retrieved 7/30/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] formed in 1960 to promote democratic opportunities for all people regardless of age, and the [[Gray Panthers]] was formed in 1970 by [[Maggie Kuhn]], with a goal of eliminating Ageism in all forms.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, M., Long, C. and Quinn, L. (1991) ''No Stone Unturned: the Life and Times of Maggie Kuhn.'' Ballantine Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Three O'Clock Lobby]] formed in 1976 to promote [[youth participation]] throughout traditionally ageist government structures in Michigan, while [[Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor]] started in 1970 to promote youth and fight Ageism.

[[Aid for the Elderly in Government Institutions]] (AEGIS) was a British [[pressure group]] that campaigned to improve the care of older people in long-stay wards of [[National Health Service]] [[psychiatric hospitals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.lse.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=AEGIS|title=AEGIS - AEGIS (Aid to the Elderly in Government Institutions)|website=LSE Library Services|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitewash"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Whitewash in the old folks’ wards|last=Robinson|first=Anne|date=5 April 1970|work=Sunday Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was founded by [[Barbara Robb]] in 1965,&lt;ref name="Whitewash" /&gt; and was active until Robb's death in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The patients’ campaigner|last=|first=|date=25 June 1976|work=Hampstead and Highgate Express|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent U.S. programs include [[Americans for a Society Free from Age Restrictions]], which formed in 1996 to advance the civil and human rights of young people through eliminating ageist laws targeted against young people, and to help youth counter Ageism in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=ASFAR |year=2006 |url=http://www.asfar.org/articles.php |title=Americans for a Society Free from Age Restrictions Articles of Incorporation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609192032/http://www.asfar.org/articles.php |archive-date=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Youth Rights Association]] started in 1998 to promote awareness of the legal and human rights of young people in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=National Youth Rights Association|year=2001|url=http://www.youthrights.org/docs/nyraarticlesofinc.pdf|title=National Youth Rights Association Articles of Incorporation (Partial)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Freechild Project]] was formed in 2001 to identify, unify and promote diverse opportunities for youth engagement in social change by fighting Ageism.

The metaphor is based on both the auto-Ageism and adultocracy exhibited by the [[Queen (Snow White)|evil queen]] of the [[Snow White]] fairy tale as well as the social Ageism symbolized by the mirror&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saberenvejecer.es/saberhacer_30.html|language=Spanish|title=Envellir bé · Successful Ageing · Saber Envejecer website – Know-how.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since 2008 'The Intergenerational Study' by Lydia Giménez-LLort and Paula Ramírez-Boix from the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] is aimed to find the basis of the link between grandparents and grandsons (positive family relationships) that are able to minimize the Ageism towards the elderly. Students of several Spanish universities have enrolled in this study which soon will be also performed in USA, Nigeria, Barbados, Argentina and Mexico. The preliminary results reveal that 'The Intergenerational study questionnaire' induces young people to do a reflexive and autocritic analysis of their intergenerational relationships in contrast to those shown towards other unrelated old people which results very positive to challenge Ageism. A cortometrage about 'The International Study' has been directed and produced by Tomás Sunyer from [[Los Angeles City College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saberenvejecer.es/investigar_25.html|language=Spanish|title=Envellir bé : Successful Ageing · Saber envejecer website – Research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
