The term was coined in 1969 by [[Robert Neil Butler]] to describe this discrimination, building on the terminology of [[sexism]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = R.

In Nelson T (ed). Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karlsson" /&gt;

The term "ageism" is also used to describe the oppression of younger people by older people. An example is a 1976 pamphlet published by [[Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor]], MI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shelley Ettinger |title=The Bottom Rung |journal=FPS: A Magazine of Young People's Liberation |date=September 1976 |issue=54 (Growing Up Gay) |page=8 |url=http://bcrw.barnard.edu/archive/lesbian/Growing_Up_Gay.pdf |publisher=Youth Liberation Press |location=Ann Arbor, MI |access-date=16 January 2022 |archive-date=16 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240816163229/http://bcrw.barnard.edu/archive/lesbian/Growing_Up_Gay.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, at a meeting of the Bracknell Forest Council in June 1983, councillor Richard Thomas pointed out that age discrimination works against younger and older people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Techera |first=Philip |date=13 January 2022 |title=NURS 3325 Module 1 Discussion Ageism |url=https://nursingpaperslayers.com/nurs-3325-module-1-discussion-ageism/ |access-date=29 September 2022 |website=NursingPaperSlayers |language=en-US |archive-date=29 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220929005424/https://nursingpaperslayers.com/nurs-3325-module-1-discussion-ageism/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the practice of denying younger people certain rights and privileges usually reserved for adults.

Ageism against the young also includes penalties, burdens, or requirements imposed exclusively (or to a greater degree) on young people than on older people, such as age-based military conscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hasbrouck |first1=Edward |title=Youth Liberation and Military Conscription |journal=Peace Chronicle |date=Summer 2021 |url=https://www.peacejusticestudies.org/chronicle/youth-liberation-and-military-conscription/ |publisher=Peace &amp; Justice Studies Assoc. |access-date=16 January 2022 |archive-date=16 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240816163238/https://www.peacejusticestudies.org/chronicle/youth-liberation-and-military-conscription/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a youth-oriented society, however, older people bear a large proportion of age bias and discrimination. Older people themselves can be ageist, having internalized a lifetime of negative stereotypes about aging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kingsreview.co.uk/magazine/theblog/2015/09/08/youthful-indiscretions/ "Youthful Indiscretions"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127232145/http://kingsreview.co.uk/magazine/theblog/2015/09/08/youthful-indiscretions/ |date=27 January 2016 }}. kingsreview.co.uk. Retrieved on 11 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Ageism is often connected to [[death anxiety|fears of death]] and disability- with avoiding, segregating, and rejecting older people functioning as a coping mechanism to avoid these concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/why-ageism-never-gets-old|title=Why Ageism Never Gets Old|last=Friend|first=Tad|date=13 November 2017|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=28 November 2017|issn=0028-792X|archive-date=22 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230322151442/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/20/why-ageism-never-gets-old|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a large overlap between ageism and [[ableism]], discrimination based on disability. 

==Classification==
===Distinction from other age-related bias===
&lt;!--[[File:Robert_N._Butler_2004.jpg|thumb|[[Robert N. Butler]] coined the term "ageism" in 1969.|290x290px]]--&gt;
Ageism in common linguistic and age studies usually refers to negative discriminatory practices against old people, people in their middle years, teenagers, and children. There are several forms of age-related bias. [[Adultism]] is a predisposition towards adults, which is seen as bias against children, youth, and all young people who are not addressed or viewed as adults.&lt;ref&gt;Lauter And Howe (1971) ''Conspiracy of the Young.'' Meridian Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes political candidacies, jobs, and cultural settings where the supposed greater vitality and physical beauty of youth are less appreciated than the supposed greater moral and intellectual rigor of adulthood. [[Adultcentrism]] is the exaggerated [[egocentrism]] of adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Martelaer | first1 = K. | last2 = De Knop | first2 = P. | last3 = Theeboom | first3 = M. | last4 = Van Heddegem | first4 = L. | year = 2000 | title = The UN Convention as a Basis for Elaborating Rights of Children in Sport | journal = Journal of Leisurability | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 3–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Adultocracy'' is the [[Convention (norm)|social convention]] which defines "maturity" and "immaturity", placing adults in a dominant position over [[youth|young people]], both theoretically and practically.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://www.zmag.org/0009.htm Youth Liberation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213202808/http://www.zmag.org/0009.htm |date=13 February 2007 }} ''Z'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerontocracy]] is a form of oligarchical rule in which an entity is ruled by leaders significantly older than most of the adult population.&lt;ref&gt;Maddox, G. L. (1987). The Encyclopedia of aging (p. 284). New York: Springer Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chronocentrism]] is the belief that a certain state of humanity is superior to all previous and/or future times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lyon | first1 = P. | last2 = Pollard | first2 = D. | year = 1997 | title = Perceptions of the older employee: is anything really changing? | journal = Personnel Review | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 245–257 [249] | doi=10.1108/00483489710172051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Iversen, Larsen, and Solem introduced a new definition of ageism based on a conceptual analysis of the term. This definition serves as a foundation for enhancing the reliability and validity of future research on ageism. It also provides a systematic approach to understanding the complexities of ageism. They define ageism as “negative or positive stereotypes, prejudice, and/or discrimination against (or to the advantage of) elderly people based on their chronological age or the perception of them as being 'old' or 'elderly.' Ageism can be implicit or explicit and may manifest on micro, meso, or macro levels” (Iversen, Larsen, and Solem, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iversen | first1 = T.N. | last2 = Larsen | first2 = L. | last3 = Solem | first3 = P.E. | year = 2009 | title = A conceptual analysis of ageism | journal = Nordic Psychology | volume = 61 | issue = 3| pages = 4–22 | doi=10.1027/1901-2276.61.3.4| s2cid = 145529534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other conditions of fear or aversion associated with age groups have their own names. Paedophobia is a fear of infants and children, ephebiphobia is the fear of youth&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2006) ''Washington Youth Voice Handbook.'' CommonAction.&lt;/ref&gt; and is also referred to as an irrational fear of adolescents or a prejudice against teenagers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stop-discrimination.info/6423.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;mc_glossary%5Bcategories%5D=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017120531/http://stop-discrimination.info/6423.0.html?&amp;no_cache=1&amp;mc_glossary%5Bcategories%5D=1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 October 2007 |title=Stop Discrimination's Glossary (European Union) |work=stop-discrimination.info |access-date=17 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gerontophobia]] is a fear of elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;Branch, L., Harris, D. &amp; Palmore, E.B. (2005) ''Encyclopaedia of Ageism.'' Haworth Press. {{ISBN|0-7890-1890-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit ageism===
Implicit ageism refers to thoughts, feelings, and judgments that operate without conscious awareness and are automatically produced in everyday life.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice against Older Persons |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-262-64057-2 |editor1-last=Nelson |editor1-first=T.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may be a mixture of positive and negative thoughts and feelings, but [[Gerontology|gerontologist]] [[Becca Levy]] reports that they "tend to be mostly negative".&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levy | first1 = B. R. | year = 2001 | title = Eradication of Ageism requires addressing the enemy within | journal = The Gerontologist | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 578–579 | doi=10.1093/geront/41.5.578| pmid = 11574700 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotyping===
Stereotyping is a tool of [[cognition]] that involves categorizing into groups and attributing characteristics to these groups. Stereotypes are necessary for processing huge volumes of information, which would otherwise overload a person. They are generally accurate descriptors of group characteristics, though some stereotypes are inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stereotype Accuracy: Toward Appreciating Group Differences |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=September 1995 |isbn=978-1-55798-307-7 |editor=[[Yueh-Ting Lee]] |editor2=Lee J. Jussim |editor3=Clark R. McCauley}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they can cause harm when the content of the stereotype is incorrect concerning most of the group or where a stereotype held too heavily overrides evidence which shows that an individual does not conform to it. For example, age-based stereotypes may cause one to draw very different conclusions when one sees an older and a younger adult with, for example, back pain or a limp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=roscigno |first=vincent j. |date=2010 |title=ageism in the american workplace |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41960075 |journal=Contexts |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=16–21 |doi=10.1525/ctx.2010.9.1.16 |jstor=41960075 |issn=1536-5042 |via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; One might assume that following an accident, the younger person's condition is temporary and treatable, while the older person's condition is chronic and less susceptible to intervention. While this might generally be true, many elderly individuals recover quickly from accidents, and conversely, very young people—such as infants, toddlers, and small children—can become permanently disabled under similar circumstances. This assumption may not matter in casual encounters, like passing someone on the street. However, if held by healthcare professionals or managers responsible for occupational health, it could lead to inappropriate actions and age-related discrimination.

Managers have been accused, by [[Erdman B. Palmore|Erdman Palmore]], of stereotyping older workers as being resistant to change, uncreative, cautious, slow to make judgments, lower in physical capacity, uninterested in technological change, and hard to train.&lt;ref&gt;Palmore, E. B. (1999).  Ageism: negative and positive (2nd ed., p. 108). New York: Springer Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is when people are rude to children because of their high-pitched voices, even if they are kind and courteous. In 2009, the ''[[Journal of Management]]'' published a review of the research literature on age stereotypes in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posthuma | first1 = R. A. | last2 = Campion | first2 = M. A. | s2cid = 145727680 | year = 2009 | title = Age stereotyping in the workplace: Common stereotypes, moderators, and future research directions | journal = Journal of Management | volume = 35 | pages = 158–188 | doi=10.1177/0149206308318617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to more overt forms of stereotyping, such as racism and sexism, ageism tends to be more resistant to change. For example, if a child holds ageist beliefs about the elderly, they are less likely to be corrected by others. Consequently, individuals may grow up internalizing these ageist ideas, including elderly individuals themselves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Berger |first=Kathleen Stassen |title=Invitation to the Life Span, Second Edition |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2014 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, ageism can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Ageist beliefs against the elderly are commonplace in today's society. For example, an older person who forgets something could be quick to call it a "senior moment", failing to realize the ageism of that statement. People also often utter ageist phrases such as "dirty old man" or "second childhood", and elders sometimes miss the ageist undertones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
In North America, the gap in the scores of the young and old with normal hearing was double those of the deaf.  It was five times wider than those of the Chinese participants. The results show that ageism undermines ability through its self-fulfilling nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study was investigating the effect of the [[stereotype threat]], a possible reason for memory deficits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geronb/58.1.P3 |pmid=12496296 |title=The Impact of Stereotype Threat on Age Differences in Memory Performance |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series B: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=3–11 |year=2003 |last1=Hess |first1=Thomas M. |last2=Auman |first2=Corinne |last3=Colcombe |first3=Stanley J. |last4=Rahhal |first4=Tamara A. |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the stereotype threat has experienced criticism.&lt;ref name="Ganley2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0031412 |pmid=23356523 |title=An examination of stereotype threat effects on girls' mathematics performance |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=1886–97 |year=2013 |last1=Ganley |first1=Colleen M |last2=Mingle |first2=Leigh A |last3=Ryan |first3=Allison M |last4=Ryan |first4=Katherine |last5=Vasilyeva |first5=Marina |last6=Perry |first6=Michelle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, when elders show greater independence and control in their lives, defying ageist presumptions, they are more likely to be healthier mentally and physically than other people of similar age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research indicates that older people are stereotyped as scoring lower on impulsivity, activism, antagonism and openness measures, while younger people are stereotyped as scoring higher. Research finds that these stereotypes are universal across cultures and are reasonably accurate (varying depending on the assessment method and the type of stereotype), though differences were consistently exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0029712 |pmid=23088227 |pmc=3514646 |title=Stereotypes of age differences in personality traits: Universal and accurate? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=103 |issue=6 |pages=1050–1066 |year=2012 |last1=Chan |first1=Wayne |last2=McCrae |first2=Robert R |last3=De Fruyt |first3=Filip |last4=Jussim |first4=Lee |last5=Löckenhoff |first5=Corinna E|author5-link= Corinna Löckenhoff |last6=De Bolle |first6=Marleen |last7=Costa |first7=Paul T |last8=Sutin |first8=Angelina R |last9=Realo |first9=Anu |last10=Allik |first10=Jüri |last11=Nakazato |first11=Katsuharu |last12=Shimonaka |first12=Yoshiko |last13=Hřebíčková |first13=Martina |last14=Graf |first14=Sylvie |last15=Yik |first15=Michelle |last16=Brunner-Sciarra |first16=Marina |last17=De Figueroa |first17=Nora Leibovich |last18=Schmidt |first18=Vanina |last19=Ahn |first19=Chang-kyu |last20=Ahn |first20=Hyun-nie |last21=Aguilar-Vafaie |first21=Maria E |last22=Siuta |first22=Jerzy |last23=Szmigielska |first23=Barbara |last24=Cain |first24=Thomas R |last25=Crawford |first25=Jarret T |last26=Mastor |first26=Khairul Anwar |last27=Rolland |first27=Jean-Pierre |last28=Nansubuga |first28=Florence |last29=Miramontez |first29=Daniel R |last30=Benet-Martínez |first30=Verónica |display-authors=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of 2020, there is still little research on the social status of elders across cultures.&lt;ref name="Karlsson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karlsson |first1=Carl-Johan |title=What Sweden's Covid failure tells us about ageism |journal=Knowable Magazine |date=7 July 2021 |doi-access=free |doi=10.1146/knowable-070621-1 |url=https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2021/what-swedens-covid-failure-tells-us-about-ageism |access-date=9 December 2021 |archive-date=25 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230125154341/https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2021/what-swedens-covid-failure-tells-us-about-ageism |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ageism can also manifest itself in perceptions of how dateable one is, which has culminated in terms such as the ''sexpiration date'', which indicates the age after which one is no longer sexually appealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Apt | first1 = Carol | last2 = Farley Hurlbert | first2 = David | year = 1994 | title = The sexual attitudes, behavior, and relationships of women with histrionic personality disorder | journal = Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 125–134 | doi=10.1080/00926239408403423| pmid = 8035469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prejudice===
Ageist [[prejudice]] is often linked to the cognitive process of stereotyping. It can involve the expression of derogatory attitudes, which may lead to the use of discriminatory behavior. For example, in contests, when older or younger contestants are rejected on the belief that they are poor performers, it could be the result of stereotyping. However, older people were also voted for in a game where it made sense to target the best performers. This can only be explained by a subconscious emotional reaction to older people. In this case, the prejudice took the form of distaste and a desire to exclude oneself from the company of older people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195385052.001.0001 |first1=Richard A. |last1=Posthuma |first2=María Fernanda |last2=Wagstaff |first3=Michael A. |last3=Campion |chapter=Age Stereotypes and Workplace Age Discrimination: A Framework for Future Research |pages=298–312 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSBpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA298 |editor1-first=Walter C. |editor1-last=Borman |editor2-first=Jerry W. |editor2-last=Hedge |title=The Oxford Handbook of Work and Aging |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-19-538505-2 |access-date=29 November 2017 |archive-date=16 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240816163231/https://books.google.com/books?id=OSBpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA298#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotyping and prejudice against different groups in society do not take the same form. Age-based prejudice and stereotyping usually involve older or younger people being pitied, marginalized, or patronized. This is described as [[benevolent prejudice]] because the tendency to pity is linked to seeing older or younger people as friendly but incompetent. In the survey conducted by [[Age Concern]], 48% of participants said that people above 70 years of age were viewed as friendly, compared to 27% who said the same about people under the age of 30. Meanwhile, only 26% believe people older than 70 are viewed as capable (with 41% saying the same about under-30s).&lt;ref name="Loretto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loretto | first1 = W. | last2 = Duncan | first2 = C. | last3 = White | first3 = P.J. | year = 2000 | title = Ageism and employment: Controversies, ambiguities, and younger people's perceptions | journal = Ageing &amp; Society | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–302 | doi = 10.1017/s0144686x00007741 | hdl = 20.500.11820/739c5d63-cf2c-4a79-a0c6-ed1664b4689f | s2cid = 54961733 | url = https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/11897989/DUNCAN_C_Ageism_and_Employment.pdf | access-date = 18 August 2019 | archive-date = 16 August 2024 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240816163235/https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/11897989/DUNCAN_C_Ageism_and_Employment.pdf | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital ageism===
{{See also|Digital literacy}}
Digital ageism refers to the prejudices faced by older adults in the digital world. An example of the subtle ways in which digital ageism operates in cultural representations, research, and everyday life could be how generational segregation naturalizes youth as digitally adept and the old as digital dunces. There is no empirical evidence for a digital divide between older and younger people.

===Ageism in statistics===
Ageism is also inadvertently embedded in the ways statistics are collected. For example, data collected based on large age categories (e.g., "60+") often places anyone over 60 into "the grey zone" which obscures differences.&lt;ref&gt;Sawchuk, K., &amp; Crow, B. (2010). Into the grey zone: Seniors, cell phones and milieus that matter. In B. Poppinga (ed.), Observing the mobile user experience: Proceedings of the 1st international workshop held in conjunction with NordiCHI (pp. 17–20). Oldenburg, Germany: HaptiMap.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dependency ratio]] has been criticized by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] as being based on the ageist assumption that older people are always dependent on care from younger workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Measure what you treasure: Ageism in Statistics |url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/OlderPersons/AgeismAgeDiscrimination/Submissions/UNs/UNFPA-2.pdf |website=OHCHR |access-date=5 October 2021 |date=2020 |archive-date=5 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005025527/https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/OlderPersons/AgeismAgeDiscrimination/Submissions/UNs/UNFPA-2.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual ageism ===
The term ''visual ageism'' was coined in 2018 by Loos and Ivan. They define ''visual ageism'' as "the social practice of visually underrepresenting older people or misrepresenting them in a prejudiced way".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Loos. E. F., &amp; Ivan, L. (2018). Visual Ageism in the Media. In: L. Ayalon &amp; C. Tesch-Roemer (Eds.), ''Contemporary perspectives on ageism'' (pp. 163–176)''.'' Berlin: Springer. [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-73820-8_11.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to the increase in [[Third age (retirement)|third age]] rhetoric in the media, picturing older people as healthy and as potential consumers, enjoying life and living their "golden years". Media representations of older people have moved from misrepresentation (negative images)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Atkins | first1 = T. | last2 = Jenkins | first2 = M.

London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Today, visual ageism in the media tends to come wrapped in the guise of the positive attributes of third age representations of older people, while adults in their fourth age continue to be underrepresented. One possible explanation for this is that healthy third agers might prefer not to be associated with fourth agers, as they remind them too starkly of what lies ahead in their own near future. Although this discomfort or even fear about mortality is undeniably common, from a societal point of view this kind of (self)ageism is hurtful to [[Old age|fourth agers]] as a group and in a sense to third agers as well, as they risk becoming fourth agers themselves one day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Discrimination==
{{See also|Age discrimination in the United States}}

Age discrimination is the result of actions taken to deny or limit opportunities to people based on age. These are usually actions taken as a result of one's ageist beliefs and attitudes. Age discrimination occurs on both a personal and institutional level.&lt;ref name="Quadagno"&gt;Quadagno, J. (2008). The field of social gerontology. In E. Barrosse (Ed.), Aging &amp; the life course: An introduction to social gerontology (pp. 2–23). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; On a personal level, an older person may be told that they are too old to engage in certain physical activities, like an informal game of basketball between friends and family. They may also be told (most common in today's Western society) that they are too old to date or to be sexually attractive to much younger people and to have a much younger partners, or encounter prejudices against age-differences in general, whether the relationship is sentimental/sexual or even platonic (this particular form of ageist bigotry and discrimination is even more relevant today or in recent times on [[social media]]).{{efn|Attributed to multiple references:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Prejudice against age-gap couples |url=https://www.wakemag.org/online/2019/12/9/prejudice-against-age-gap-couples |access-date=14 July 2022 |website=The Wake |date=9 December 2019 |language=en-US |archive-date=2 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221202092154/https://wakemag.org/online/2019/12/9/prejudice-against-age-gap-couples |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bishop |first=Katie |title=Age gaps: The relationship taboo that won't die |url=https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220317-age-gaps-the-relationship-taboo-that-wont-die |access-date=14 July 2022 |website=www.bbc.com |language=en |archive-date=16 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240816163242/https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220317-age-gaps-the-relationship-taboo-that-wont-die |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Why People Still Look Down on Couples with a Major Age Differences {{!}} Psychology Today |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-apes/202101/why-people-still-look-down-couples-major-age-differences |access-date=14 July 2022 |website=www.psychologytoday.com |language=en |archive-date=16 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240816163407/https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-apes/202101/why-people-still-look-down-couples-major-age-differences |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sela |first1=Yael |last2=Pham |first2=Michael N. |last3=Mogilski |first3=Justin K. |last4=Lopes |first4=Guilherme S. |last5=Shackelford |first5=Todd K. |last6=Zeigler-Hill |first6=Virgil |date=1 August 2018 |title=Why do people disparage May–December romances?

A 2006/2007 survey done by the Children's Rights Alliance for England and the National Children's Bureau asked 4,060 children and young people whether they have ever been treated unfairly based on various criteria (race, age, sex, sexual orientation, etc.). A total of 43% of British youth surveyed reported experiencing discrimination based on their age, far eclipsing other categories of discrimination like sex (27%), race (11%), or sexual orientation (6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Carolyne |last1=Willow |first2=Anita |last2=Franklin |first3=Catherine |last3=Shaw |date=April 2007 |title=Meeting the obligations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in England: children and young people's messages to government |url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/id/eprint/10935 |access-date=29 November 2017 |archive-date=8 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230708170121/https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/id/eprint/10935/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistently, a study based on the European Social Survey found that whereas 35% of Europeans reported exposure to ageism, only 25% reported exposure to sexism and as few as 17% reported exposure to racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ayalon|first=Liat|title=Perceived Age, Gender, and Racial/Ethnic Discrimination in Europe: Results from the European Social Survey|journal=Educational Gerontology|year=2014|volume=40|issue=7|pages=499–517|doi=10.1080/03601277.2013.845490 |s2cid=143802599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ageism has significant effects in two particular sectors: employment and health care. Age discrimination has contributed to disparities in health between men and women. Reducing ageism and sexism would promote improved doctor-patient relationships and reduce ageist stereotypes in the healthcare industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/josi.12157 |title=Ageism can be Hazardous to Women's Health: Ageism, Sexism, and Stereotypes of Older Women in the Healthcare System |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=86–104 |year=2016 |last1=Chrisler |first1=Joan C |last2=Barney |first2=Angela |last3=Palatino |first3=Brigida }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
The concept of ageism was originally developed to refer to prejudice and discrimination against older people and middle-aged people but has expanded to include children and teenagers.&lt;ref name="Loretto"/&gt; Midlife workers, on average, make more than younger workers do in income, which reflects educational achievement and experience. The age-wage peak in the United States, according to Census data, is between 45 and 54 years of age. As people age, seniority is often treated with respect, thereby lessening ageism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ageing: Ageism |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/ageing-ageism |access-date=30 September 2022 |website=www.who.int |language=en |archive-date=30 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220930023809/https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/ageing-ageism |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lockstep compensation|Seniority-based compensation]] can result in [[job lock]] and decreasing job mobility with increasing age.&lt;ref name="k199"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=de Hek | first1=Paul | last2=van Vuuren | first2=Daniel | title=Are older workers overpaid?

Many countries have a [[Retirement age#Retirement age by country and region|retirement age]].

The United States federal government restricts age discrimination under the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]] of 1967 (ADEA). That law provides certain employment protections to workers who are over the age of 40, who work for an employer who has 20 or more employees. For protected workers, the ADEA prohibits discrimination at all levels of employment, from recruitment and hiring, through the employment relationship, and through decisions for layoffs or termination of the employment relationship. An age limit may only be legally specified for protected workers in the circumstance where age has been shown to be a "[[bona fide occupational qualification]] [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business" (see {{usc|29|623(f)(1)}}). In practice, BFOQs for age are limited to the obvious (hiring a young actor to play a young character in a movie) or when public safety is at stake (for example, in the case of age limits for pilots and bus drivers). The ADEA does not stop an employer from favoring an older employee over a younger one, even when the younger one is over 40 years old.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{ussc|name=General Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v.

===Hollywood===
Ageism in [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]], specifically towards women, is profound, from the way youth is praised to the lack of jobs for older actresses. The way youth is praised reflects directly on the way older women are presented in the media. President and CEO of the [[American Association of Advertising Agencies]], O. Burtch Drake, spoke in terms of older women's representation in the media stating "older women are not being portrayed at all; there is no imagery to worry about."&lt;ref&gt;Kleyman, Paul. "Images of Aging." ''Encyclopedia of Aging''. Ed. David J. Ekerdt. Vol. 2. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2002. 679–685. ''Gale Virtual Reference Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; Women over 50 are often not the center of attention and if an actress is older they are expected to act anything but their age.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The standards set for women in film are fixated upon youth, sexuality, and beauty. Movies that portray older women acting their own age seem exaggerated and unrealistic because it does not fit the norms associated with women in film and media.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result, older actresses face weaker employment opportunities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Being an Older Woman: A Study in the Social Production of Identity|last = Paoletti|first = Isabella|publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year = 1998|isbn = 978-0-8058-2120-8|location = New Jersey|pages = [https://archive.org/details/beingolderwomans0000paol/page/47 47]|url = https://archive.org/details/beingolderwomans0000paol/page/47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the limited ages the film industry portrays and the lack of older actresses, society as a whole has a type of illiteracy about sexuality and those of old age. There is an almost inherent bias about what older women are capable of, what they do, and how they feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender, Social Inequalities, and Aging|last = Calasanti|first = Toni M.|publisher = AltaMira Press|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-7591-0185-2|location = Walnut Creek|pages = [https://archive.org/details/gendersocialineq0000cala/page/79 79]|url = https://archive.org/details/gendersocialineq0000cala/page/79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst all ages of actresses, there is the attempt to look youthful and fit conventional beauty standards by altering themselves physically, many times through plastic surgery.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chivers |first1=Sally | year = 2006 | title = Baby Jane Grew Up: The Dramatic Intersection of Age With Disability |journal=Canadian Review of American Studies | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 211–227 | doi=10.1353/crv.2006.0039| s2cid = 161637817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women become frightful of how they would be seen if they have wrinkles, cellulite, or any other signifier of aging.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saucier | first1 = Maggi G | s2cid = 53617608 | year = 2004 | title = Midlife And Beyond: Issues For Aging Women | journal = Journal of Counseling &amp; Development | volume = 82 | issue = 4| pages = 420–425 | doi=10.1002/j.1556-6678.2004.tb00329.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As women reach their 40s and 50s, the pressure to adhere to societal beauty norms seen in films and media intensifies in terms of new cosmetic procedures and products that will maintain a "forever youthful" look.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is evident in the rise of cosmetic [[Botulinum toxin|botox]] treatments, even for individuals otherwise in good health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Botox Nation |url=https://nyupress.org/9781479825264/botox-nation/ |access-date=2024-10-30 |website=NYU Press |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of sexuality, older women are often portrayed as unattractive, bitter, unhappy, and unsuccessful in films. With older women not being represented in the media and film industries, specifically in Hollywood, thoughts of underachievement, ugliness, and disgust crowd the thoughts of older women as they fail to meet beauty norms. This can cause depression, anxiety, and self-esteem issues in general.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "In one survey, women reported feeling more embarrassed about their age than by their masturbation practices or same-gender sexual encounters."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When a woman is told she is old, she can start to believe that she is. A woman can start acting as if she is older than she believes because she internalizes what other people say and think about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Social World of Old Women: Management of Self-Identity|last = Matthews|first = Sarah H.|publisher = Sage Publication|year = 1979|isbn = 978-0-8039-1225-0|location = Beverly Hills, CA|pages = [https://archive.org/details/socialworldofold00matt/page/166 166]|url = https://archive.org/details/socialworldofold00matt/page/166}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In film, the female body is depicted in different states of dress and portrayed differently depending on the age of the actress. Their clothing is used as an identity marker of the character. Young women are put into revealing and sexy costumes whereas older women often play the part of a mother or grandmother clad in a bonnet or apron.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Aging Bodies:The Aging Female Body|last = Markson|first = Elizabeth|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year = 2003|isbn = 978-0-7591-0236-1|location = Lanham, Maryland|pages = 78, 79, 80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from no longer representing the ideal female model, post-menopausal women are stereotyped as mentally unstable. "They become quarrelsome, vexatious and overbearing, petty and stingy; that is to say they exhibit typically sadistic and anal-erotic traits that they did not possess earlier" (Freud 1958,323–24).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Healthcare===
There is considerable evidence of discrimination against the elderly in health care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agediscrimination.info/News/Pages/ItemPage.aspx?Item=553 Complaints soar as 'age discrimination within NHS' leaves elderly neglected] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522093326/http://www.agediscrimination.info/News/Pages/ItemPage.aspx?Item=553 |date=22 May 2012 }}.

Retrieved on 11 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly true for aspects of the physician-patient interaction, such as screening procedures, information exchanges, and treatment decisions. In the patient-physician interaction, physicians and other healthcare providers may hold attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that are associated with ageism against older patients. Studies have found that some physicians do not seem to show any care or concern toward treating the medical problems of older people. Then, when interacting with these older patients on the job, the doctors sometimes view them with disgust and describe them in negative ways, such as "depressing" or "crazy".&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = T. D. | s2cid = 10632570 | year = 2005 | title = Ageism: Prejudice against our feared future self | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 61 | issue = 2| pages = 207–221 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00402.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For screening procedures, elderly people are less likely than younger people to be screened for cancers and, due to the lack of this preventive measure, less likely to be diagnosed at early stages of their conditions.&lt;ref name="Robb"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robb | first1 = C. | last2 = Hongbin | first2 = C. | last3 = Haley | first3 = W.

After being diagnosed with a disease that may be potentially curable, older people are further discriminated against. Though there may be surgeries or operations with high survival rates that might cure their condition, older patients are less likely than younger patients to receive all the necessary treatments. For example, health professionals pursue less aggressive treatment options in older patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Learning to be old: Gender, culture, and aging |edition=2nd |last = Cruikshank|first = Margaret|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year = 2009|location = Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fewer adults are enrolled in tests of new prescription drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Disparate inclusion of older adults in clinical trials: Priorities and opportunities for policy and practice change|last = Herrera|first = Angelica P.|date = 2010|journal = American Journal of Public Health|doi = 10.2105/ajph.2009.162982 |pmid = 20147682|volume=100 | issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S105–S112 |pmc=2837461}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been posited that this is because doctors fear their older patients are not physically strong enough to tolerate the curative treatments, and are more likely to have complications during surgery that may end in death.

Other research studies have been done with patients with heart disease, and, in these cases, the older patients were still less likely to receive further tests or treatments, independent of the severity of their health problems. Thus, the approach to the treatment of older people is concentrated on managing the disease rather than preventing or curing it. This is based on the stereotype that it is the natural process of aging for the quality of health to decrease, and, therefore, there is no point in attempting to prevent the inevitable decline of old age.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robb" /&gt;

Furthermore, caregivers further undermine the treatment of older patients by over-helping them, which may decrease independence and/or interfere with their autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A primer on medication use in older adults for the non-clinician|last1 = Peron|first1 = Emily P.|date = 2011–2012|journal = Generations|last2 = Ruby|first2 = Christine M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by making a generalized assumption and treating all elderly people as feeble.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Differential medical treatment of elderly people can have significant effects on their health outcomes; a differential outcome which somehow escapes established protections.

In 2017, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in favor of Maria Ivone Carvalho Pinto de Sousa Morais, who had had an operation that was mishandled and rendered her unable to have sex. Portuguese judges had previously reduced damages to her in 2014, ruling then that the operation, which occurred when she was 50, had happened at "an age when sex is not as important as in younger years." The [[European Court of Human Rights]] rejected that decision, with the majority's ruling stating in part, "The question at issue here is not considerations of age or sex as such, but rather the assumption that sexuality is not as important for a 50-year-old woman and mother of two children as for someone of a younger age. That assumption reflects a traditional idea of female sexuality as being essentially linked to childbearing purposes and thus ignores its physical and psychological relevance for the self-fulfillment of women as people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=SEWELL CHAN |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/world/europe/sex-after-50-portugal-european-court.html |title=Sex for Women After 50 Is Important After All, European Court Rules – The New York Times |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2017 |access-date=26 July 2017 |archive-date=25 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725232300/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/world/europe/sex-after-50-portugal-european-court.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the provenance of the rule is unclear, it is sometimes said to have originated in France.&lt;ref name="Rodale" /&gt; The rule appears in [[John Fox Jr.]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come (novel)|The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come]]'',&lt;ref name="Fox1903"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Fox|url=https://archive.org/details/littleshepherdk00yohngoog|title=The little shepherd of Kingdom Come|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1903|page=[https://archive.org/details/littleshepherdk00yohngoog/page/n241 222]|access-date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in American newspapers in 1931 attributed to [[Maurice Chevalier]],&lt;ref&gt;"Maurice Chevalier says....plus seven years". ''Detroit News'' item reprinted in ''Oakland'' (CA) ''News'', 27 August 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]],'' attributed to [[Elijah Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm X &amp; Alex Haley|url=https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofm00xmal|title=The Autobiography of Malcolm X|publisher=New York, Grove Press|year=1965|page=[https://archive.org/details/autobiographyofm00xmal/page/229 229]|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the rule as a lower-bound limit reflects some contemporary redefinition. In most sources prior to the very modern era, it was not only largely heterosexual-specific and gender-specific, but was presented as a formula to calculate the ''ideal'' age of a female partner at the beginning of a relationship, instead of a ''lower limit''. [[Frederick Locker-Lampson]]'s ''Patchwork'' from 1879 states the opinion "A wife should be half the age of her husband with seven years added."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Frederick Locker-Lampson |title=Patchwork |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max O'Rell]]'s ''Her Royal Highness Woman'' from 1901 gives the rule in the format "A man should marry a woman half his age, plus seven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Max O'Rell |chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33285 |title=Her Royal Highness Woman |chapter=Chapter IV: Advice to the Man Who Wants to Marry |access-date=18 January 2015 |archive-date=29 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329211304/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33285 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar interpretation is also present in the 1951 play ''The Moon Is Blue'' by [[F. Hugh Herbert]]: "Haven't you ever heard that the girl is supposed to be half the man's age, plus seven?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/moonisblueapla00herb Moon Is blue.: &amp;#91;A play&amp;#93;: Herbert, Frederick Hugh] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325160305/https://archive.org/details/moonisblueapla00herb |date=25 March 2016 }} at Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 study found that the rule was fairly accurate at predicting the minimum age of a woman that a man would marry or date. However, the rule was not found to be predictive of the minimum age of a man that a woman would marry or date, nor (by reversing the formula) of the maximum age that either sex would marry or date.&lt;ref name=didonato&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201405/the-half-your-age-plus-seven-rule-does-it-really-work|title=The Half-Your-Age-Plus-Seven Rule: Does It Really Work? |magazine= Psychology Today|date=2014 |access-date=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule implies that both individuals should be at least 14 years older than their age difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{math|''B'' ≥ ''A''/2 + 7}} implies that {{math|''B'' ≥ (''A''−''B'') + 14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of and major court cases/laws/regulations regarding ageism==
Ageism has significant effects on the elderly and young people. These effects might be seen within different levels: person, selected company, whole economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prokurat|first=Sergiusz|date=2012|title=Age Management as a Tool for the Demographic Decline in the 21st Century: An Overview of its Characteristics|url=http://www.jemi.edu.pl/vol-8-issue-4-2012/age-management-as-a-tool-for-the-demographic-decline-in-the-21st-century-an-overview-of-its-characteristics|journal=Journal of Entrepreneurship, Management and Innovation|volume=8/2012|pages=83–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypes and infantilization of older and younger people by patronizing language affects older and younger people's self-esteem and behaviors. After repeatedly hearing a stereotype that older or younger people are useless, older and younger people may begin to feel like dependent, non-contributing members of society. They may start to perceive themselves in terms of the [[looking-glass self]]—that is, in the same ways that others in society see them. Studies have also specifically shown that when older and younger people hear these stereotypes about their supposed incompetence and uselessness, they perform worse on measures of competence and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levy | first1 = B | s2cid = 14442482 | year = 1996 | title = Improving memory in old age by implicit self-stereotyping | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 71 | issue = 6| pages = 1092–1107 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.6.1092| pmid = 8979380 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These stereotypes then become [[self-fulfilling prophecies]]. According to [[Becca Levy]]'s [[Stereotype embodiment theory]], older and younger people might also engage in self-stereotypes, taking their culture's age stereotypes—to which they have been exposed over the life course—and directing them inward toward themselves. Then this behavior reinforces the present stereotypes and treatment of the elderly.&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;

Many overcome these stereotypes and live as they choose, but it can be difficult to avoid deeply ingrained prejudice, especially if one has been exposed to ageist views in childhood or adolescence.

===Catholic Church===
{{see also|Papal resignation|label 1=Voluntary papal resignation}}
There is no mandatory retirement age for [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s nor for the [[pope]], as [[Life tenure|they hold these positions for life]], but cardinals age 80 or over are prohibited from participating in the [[papal conclave]] as of 1970 because of the ''[[Ingravescentem aetatem]]''. The Code of Canon Law specifies in Canon 401 that ordinary bishops, nuncios, and bishops with Curial appointments (but not auxiliary bishops) must present their resignation to the Pope when they turn 75, but he need not accept it right away or at all. Canon 538 makes a similar stipulation of diocesan priests who are requested, but not obliged, to offer to resign from their appointments at 75. Note that in either case, resigning from the active exercise of the office means giving up the daily responsibilities of the offices, not ordination itself. Once a man is ordained a priest or a bishop, he retains that character until his death, whether he is still working or has since retired.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

In particular, the study found that younger generations perceived the pandemic as comparable to [[climate change]] as a crisis, and saw the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on older generations as "[[Karma|karmic]]" due to the latter's supposed failure in [[Climate change mitigation|mitigating climate change]].&lt;ref name="Boomer remover" /&gt; The term "Boomer remover" trended on Twitter as a nickname for the disease, appearing in over 65,000 tweets by March 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Whalen |first=Andrew |date=13 March 2020 |title=What is 'Boomer Remover' and why is it making people so angry? |url=https://www.newsweek.com/boomer-remover-meme-trends-virus-coronavirus-social-media-covid-19-baby-boomers-1492190 |access-date=7 July 2022 |website=[[Newsweek]] |language=en |archive-date=16 August 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240816170010/https://www.newsweek.com/boomer-remover-meme-trends-virus-coronavirus-social-media-covid-19-baby-boomers-1492190 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v Etobicoke (Borough of)]]'', [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on age discrimination. Harold Hall and Vincent Gray were firemen in the borough of [[Etobicoke]], Ontario. As part of the collective agreement between the borough and the union, all firefighters were required to retire at the age of 60. When Hall and Grey were forced to retire they brought a complaint for age discrimination under section 4(1) of the ''Ontario Human Rights Code'' which prohibited discrimination in recruitment or dismissal based on age among other grounds. The Court found that the employer did not sufficiently justify the policy as a [[bona fide occupational requirement|''bona fide'' occupational requirement]].

''[[McKinney v University of Guelph]]'' [1990] 3 SCR 229 is the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] case that decided that, for the purpose of determining the application of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', universities were not part of government. Therefore, the mandatory retirement age for university teachers did not violate equality rights under [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the ''Charter''. In reaching this holding, the Court refined the scope of the ''Charter'' as it applies to government bodies as well as the definition of "law" within the ambit of the ''Charter''.

''[[Douglas/Kwantlen Faculty Assn v Douglas College]]'', [1990] 3 S.C.R. 570 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision regarding the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal. [[Douglas College]]'s collective agreement included a provision for mandatory retirement at age 65. Two professors challenged this provision before the labour arbitration tribunal, claiming it violated the equality rights guarantee under [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15(1)]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. The professors argued that the college constituted a public institution and therefore was subject to the ''Charter'', and that the collective agreement constituted "law" within meaning of the ''Charter''. The arbitrator agreed and found that the law violated section 15(1) of the ''Charter''. The school appealed the decision on the grounds that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction to determine the constitutional issue. The [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] found that the tribunal had jurisdiction and upheld the decision of the tribunal. The school appealed the decision in the Supreme Court of Canada. Justice La Forest, writing for the majority, dismissed the appeal by the college. The majority held that although a tribunal has the power to treat any invalid law that it may be asked to apply as having no force or effect, it may not necessarily be able to apply the ''Charter'' or grant a remedy under section 24(1) of the ''Charter''. A tribunal only has power to the extent that it has been conferred to it by law.

The FEHA is the principal California statute prohibiting employment discrimination, covering employers, labor organizations, employment agencies, apprenticeship programs and/or any person or entity who aids, abets, incites, compels, or coerces the doing of a discriminatory act.

The federal government restricts age discrimination under the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]] of 1967 (ADEA). That law provides certain employment protections to workers who are over the age of 40, who work for an employer who has twenty or more employees. For protected workers, the ADEA prohibits discrimination at all levels of employment, from recruitment and hiring, through the employment relationship, and through decisions for layoffs or termination of the employment relationship. An age limit may only be legally specified for protected workers in the circumstance where age has been shown to be a "[[bona fide occupational qualification]] [BFOQ] reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business" (see {{usc|29|623(f)(1)}}). In practice, BFOQs for age are limited to the obvious (hiring a young actor to play a young character in a movie) or when public safety is at stake (for example, in the case of age limits for pilots and bus drivers). The ADEA does not stop an employer from favoring an older employee over a younger one, even when the younger one is over 40 years old.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;

In September 2016, California passed state bill AB-1687, an anti-ageism law taking effect on 1 January 2017, requiring "commercial online entertainment employment" services that allow paid subscribers to submit information and resumes (such as [[IMDbPro]]), to honor requests to have their ages and birthdays removed.

Additional protection against age discrimination comes from the Framework Directive 2000/78/EC. It prohibits discrimination on grounds of age in the field of employment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agediscrimination.info/legislation/Pages/ECLegislation.aspx EC Legislation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721184455/http://www.agediscrimination.info/legislation/Pages/ECLegislation.aspx |date=21 July 2011 }}.

''[[Mangold v Helm]]'' (2005) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62004CJ0144&amp;from=EN C-144/04] was a case before the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) about age discrimination in employment.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;E McGaughey, ''A Casebook on Labour Law'' (Hart 2019) ch 15, 657&lt;/ref&gt; Mangold was a 56-year-old German man employed on a fixed term contract in a permanent [[full-time job]]. The German government introduced the so-called Employment Promotion Act 1996 ({{langx|de|Beschäftigungsförderungsgesetz}}) which allowed fixed term contracts for a two-year maximum, and otherwise were unlawful unless they could be objectively justified. But even this protection was removed (apparently to "promote employment") if the employee was over 60. Further amendments then changed the age to 52. Mr. Mangold claimed that the lack of protection, over age 52, was unjustified age discrimination. The ECJ held in its judgment the German law contravened the [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]], even though it did not have to be implemented until the end of 2006. It said that, in general terms, legislation that lets employers treat people differently because of their age “offends the principle” in international law of eliminating discrimination on the basis of age. {{Citation needed|reason=Every citation must be justified by a verified source|date=March 2024}} The ECJ ruled that national courts must set aside any provision of national law which conflicts with the directive even before the period for implementation has expired.

''[[Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH &amp; Co KG]]'' (2010) {{CELEX|62007J0555|text=C-555/07}} is a leading [[EU labour law]] case, which held that there is a [[General principles of European Union law|general principle of law]] in all European Union member states, against discrimination, and in favour of equal treatment.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;E McGaughey, ''A Casebook on Labour Law'' (Hart 2019) ch 12, 534&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned Ms. Kücükdeveci, who argued that the German service related statutory minimum notice period, because it disregarded employment before the age of 25, was unjustifiably discriminatory against young people. The European Court of Justice (Grand Chamber) held that the legislation was contrary to the [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]] 2000/78/EC, but also following ''[[Mangold v Helm]]'' a general principle of equality which permeates all of EU law, to which the Directive merely gave expression. This is more so because the Charter of Fundamental Rights article 21(1) says the same and that has the same legal value as the treaties under TEU art 6(1). Accordingly, in paragraphs [23]-[31], it was held that the legislation in BGB §622 was discriminatory. There was not a sufficient objective justification for the measure, because although the German government's professed aim of wishing to bolster youth employment was legitimate, its measure was disproportionate. In paragraphs [44]-[56] the ECJ further held that national courts have a duty to disapply any provision of national legislation contrary to the principle of equal treatment. They should not be compelled to make a reference to the ECJ first. One should note that the EU law can only be applied when there is a cross-border issue.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Case C-555/07 |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62007CJ0555&amp;from=GA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mangold v Helm]]'' (2005) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:62004CJ0144&amp;from=EN C-144/04] was a case before the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) about age discrimination in employment.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; Mangold was a 56-year-old German man employed on a fixed term contract in a permanent [[full-time job]]. The German government introduced the so-called Employment Promotion Act 1996 ({{langx|de|Beschäftigungsförderungsgesetz}}) which allowed fixed term contracts for a two-year maximum, and otherwise were unlawful unless they could be objectively justified. But even this protection was removed (apparently to "promote employment") if the employee was over 60. Further amendments then changed the age to 52. Mr. Mangold claimed that the lack of protection, over age 52, was unjustified age discrimination. The ECJ held in its judgment the German law contravened the [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]], even though it did not have to be implemented until the end of 2006. It said that, in general terms, legislation that lets employers treat people differently because of their age “offends the principle” in international law of eliminating discrimination on the basis of age. {{Citation needed|reason=Every citation must be justified by a verified source|date=March 2024}} The ECJ ruled that national courts must set aside any provision of national law which conflicts with the directive even before the period for implementation has expired.

''[[Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH &amp; Co KG]]'' (2010) {{CELEX|62007J0555|text=C-555/07}} is a leading [[EU labour law]] case, which held that there is a [[General principles of European Union law|general principle of law]] in all European Union member states, against discrimination, and in favour of equal treatment.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The case concerned Ms. Kücükdeveci, who argued that the German service related statutory minimum notice period, because it disregarded employment before the age of 25, was unjustifiably discriminatory against young people. The European Court of Justice (Grand Chamber) held that the legislation was contrary to the [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]] 2000/78/EC, but also following ''[[Mangold v Helm]]'' a general principle of equality which permeates all of EU law, to which the Directive merely gave expression. This is more so because the Charter of Fundamental Rights article 21(1) says the same and that has the same legal value as the treaties under TEU art 6(1). Accordingly, in paragraphs [23]-[31], it was held that the legislation in BGB §622 was discriminatory. There was not a sufficient objective justification for the measure, because although the German government's professed aim of wishing to bolster youth employment was legitimate, its measure was disproportionate. In paragraphs [44]-[56] the ECJ further held that national courts have a duty to disapply any provision of national legislation contrary to the principle of equal treatment. They should not be compelled to make a reference to the ECJ first. One should note that the EU law can only be applied when there is a cross-border issue.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

The survey suggested that the UK is riven by intergenerational splits, with half of the people admitting they do not have a single friend over 70; this compares with only a third of Portuguese, Swiss and Germans who say that they do not have a friend of that age or older.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agediscrimination.info/News/Pages/ItemPage.aspx?Item=546 UK among Europe's worst countries for Ageism and age discrimination].

In 2011, the artist Michael Freedman, an outspoken advocate against age discrimination within the art world, said that "I am really pissed off with the organisers of the majority of the competitions that seek artists to enter them. Many restrict entrants to those who are under 35! I have never seen a reason for this" and that "mature students, like me, come to art late in life, so why are we penalised and demotivated?

The [[Newsboys Strike of 1899]] fought ageist employment practices targeted against the youth by large newspaper syndicates in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] of America. The strikers demonstrated across the city for several days, effectively stopping circulation of the two papers, along with the news distribution for many [[New England]] cities. The [[Strike action|strike]] lasted two weeks, causing Pulitzer's ''[[New York World]]'' to decrease its circulation from 360,000 papers sold per day to 125,000.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, David.

[[Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor]] was an organization based in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. It existed from 1970 to 1979, and is often cited in more recent academic literature as one of the leading forerunners of several [[youth movement]]s in the United States, including the [[youth rights movement]], [[youth voice|youth voice movement]], and the [[youth-led media|youth media movement]].

[[Three O'Clock Lobby]] formed in 1976 to promote [[youth participation]] throughout traditionally ageist government structures in Michigan.

Old Lesbians Organizing for Change was founded in 1987; the mission of the organization is to "eliminate the oppression of ageism and to stand in solidarity against all oppressions" through "[the] cooperative community of Old Lesbian feminist activists from many backgrounds working for justice and the well-being of all old lesbians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8z89fjx/|title=Finding Aid for the Old Lesbians Organizing for Change records 1986–1992 LSC.2203|website=oac.cdlib.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their initial meeting was inspired by the publication of the book ''Look Me in the Eye: Old Women, Aging and Ageism'' by [[Barbara Macdonald]] and Cynthia Rich in 1983.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web

Since 2008 "The Intergenerational Study" by Lydia Giménez-Llort and Paula Ramírez-Boix from the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] aims to find the basis of the link between grandparents and grandsons (positive family relationships) that can minimize the ageism towards the elderly. Students of several Spanish universities have enrolled in this study which soon will be also performed in the US, Nigeria, Barbados, Argentina, and Mexico. The preliminary results reveal that "The Intergenerational study questionnaire" induces young people to do a reflexive and autocritic analysis of their intergenerational relationships in contrast to those shown towards other unrelated old people which results very positive to challenge ageism. A cortometraje about "The International Study" has been directed and produced by Tomás Sunyer from [[Los Angeles City College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saberenvejecer.es/investigar_25.html|language=es|title=Envellir bé : Successful Ageing · Saber envejecer website – Research.|access-date=13 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423185650/http://www.saberenvejecer.es/investigar_25.html|archive-date=23 April 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 interview, actor [[Pierce Brosnan]] cited ageism as one of the contributing factors as to why he was not asked to continue his role as [[James Bond]] in the Bond film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', released in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Cox|first = John|date = 5 November 2005|url = http://commanderbond.net/article/2994|title = Brosnan Bares All For Playboy|website = CommanderBond.net|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060702020428/http://commanderbond.net/article/2994|archive-date = 2 July 2006|access-date = 15 April 2019|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, successful singer and actress [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] spoke out in her 50s about ageism and her fight to defy the norms of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 18 June 2008|url = http://www.carefair.com/html/Madonna_Not_Giving_In_to_Ageism_5301.html|title = Madonna not giving in to Ageism|publisher = Care Fair|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081013071815/http://www.carefair.com/html/Madonna_Not_Giving_In_to_Ageism_5301.html|archive-date = 13 October 2008|access-date = 17 January 2009|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Radio 1 Madonna controversy|BBC Radio 1 were accused of ageism]] after the station did not add her new single to their playlist.
