Although theoretically the word can refer to the discrimination against any age group (e.g. prejudice specifically targeted at fortysomethings), ageism usually comes in one of two forms: discrimination against [[adolescence|youth]], and discrimination against the [[elderly]].

In the early [[1970s]], [[Maggie Kuhn]] formed the ''[[Gray Panthers]]'', an [[organization]] with a goal of eliminating ageism in all forms.

Many groups have been set up in various countries to combat age discrimination, including:
*[[United Kingdom|UK]]
**[[Age Concern]]
**[[Help the Aged]]
*[[United States|USA]]
**[[ASFAR]]
**[[Gray Panthers]]
**[[National Youth Rights Association]]
