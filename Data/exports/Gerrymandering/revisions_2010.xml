'''Gerrymandering''' is a form of [[boundary delimitation]] (redistricting) in which [[electoral district]] or [[constituency]] boundaries are deliberately modified for electoral purposes, thereby producing a contorted or unusual shape. The resulting district is known as a '''gerrymander'''; however, that word can also refer to the process.

Gerrymandering may be used to achieve desired electoral results for a particular party, or may be used to help or hinder a particular group of [[constituent (politics)|constituent]]s, such as a political, racial, linguistic, religious or class group.

When used to allege that a given party is gaining disproportionate power, the term ''gerrymandering'' has negative connotations. However, a gerrymander may also be used for purposes that some perceive as positive, notably in US federal voting district boundaries which produce a proportion of constituencies with an African-American or other minority in the majority (these are thus called "minority-majority districts").

==Origin of the term==
[[Image:The Gerry-Mander Edit.png|thumb|right|right|200px|First printed in March 1812, this political cartoon was drawn in reaction to the state senate electoral districts drawn by the Massachusetts legislature to favour the Democratic-Republican Party candidates of Governor Elbridge Gerry over the Federalists. The caricature satirises the bizarre shape of a district in Essex County, Massachusetts as a dragon. Federalist’s newspapers editors and others at the time likened the district shape to a salamander, and the word ''gerrymander'' was a blend of that word and Governor Gerry's last name.]]
The word gerrymander (originally written Gerry-mander) was used for the first time in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'' newspaper on March 26, 1812.  The word was created in reaction to a redrawing of Massachusetts state senate election districts under the then governor [[Elbridge Gerry]] (pronounced {{IPA-en|ˈɡɛri|}}; 1744–1814).  In 1812, Governor Gerry signed a bill that redistricted Massachusetts to benefit his [[Democratic-Republican Party]].  When mapped, one of the contorted districts in the Boston area was said to resemble the shape of a [[salamander]].  The exact author of the term gerrymander may never be definitively established.  It is widely believed by historians that Federalist newspaper editors [[Nathan Hale (journalist)|Nathan Hale]], Benjamin and John Russell were the instigators, but the historical record gives no definitive evidence who created or uttered the word for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth C. Martis, “The Original Gerrymander” Political Geography, Vol. 27, No. 4, November 2008, 833-839.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was a [[portmanteau]] of the governor's last name and the word salamander.

Appearing with the term, and helping to spread and sustain its popularity, was a political cartoon depicting a strange animal with claws, wings and a dragon-type head satirising the map of the odd shaped district.  This cartoon was most likely drawn by [[Elkanah Tisdale]] an early Nineteenth Century painter, designer and engraver who was living in Boston at the time.&lt;ref&gt;There is no evidence that the famous American portrait painter, [[Gilbert Stuart]], had any involvement with either the design, drawing, or naming of the cartoon, or coining of the term.  Detailed biographies and academic journal articles about Stuart make no reference to gerrymandering.  The myth of Stuart’s association with the original gerrymander has been reproduced and spread, without verification or sources, from one reference book and internet site to another.  Modern scholars of Stuart are in agreement that no proof exists to credit him with the term or cartoon and that he had the propensity not to be involved with such issues.  Kenneth C. Martis, “The Original Gerrymander” Political Geography, Vol. 27, No. 4, November 2008, 833-839.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Tisdale also had the engraving skills to cut the woodblocks which printed the original cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;O’Brien, D. C.  “Elkanah Tisdale: Designer, Engraver and Miniature Painter” Connecticut Historical Bulletin, Vol. 49 No. 2, 1984, 83-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  These woodblocks survive and are preserved in the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress.  Original woodblocks for printing “Gerrymander” political cartoon.  Geography and Map Reading Room.  LCCN Permalink: &lt;http://lccn.loc.gov/2003620165&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
The word gerrymander was reprinted numerous times in Federalist newspapers in Massachusetts, New England and nation wide during the remainder of 1812.&lt;ref&gt;The word gerrymander was used again in two Boston area papers the very next day.  The first usage outside of the immediate Boston area came in the Newburyport Herald (Massachusetts) on March 31st and the first use outside of the state of Massachusetts came in the Concord Gazette (New Hampshire) on April 14, 1812.  The first use outside of New England came in the ''New York Gazette &amp; General Advertiser'' on May 19th.  In what may be the first use of the term to describe the redistricting in another state (Maryland) occurred in the Federal Republican (Georgetown, Washington, DC) on October 12, 1812.  All-in-all there are at least 80 known citations of the word from March through December 1812 in American newspapers.  Kenneth C. Martis, “The Original Gerrymander” Political Geography, Vol. 27, No. 4, November 2008, 833-839.&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests some organised activity of the Federalists to disparage Governor Gerry in particular and the growing Democratic-Republican party in general.  Gerrymandering soon began to be used to describe not only the original Massachusetts example, but other cases of district shape manipulation for partisan gain in other states.  According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] institutionalisation of the word became complete with its first appearance in a dictionary (1848) and first appearance in an encyclopedia (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, J. A., Weiner, E. S. C.  Gerrymander.  Oxford English Dictionary.  New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the letter ''g'' of the eponymous ''Gerry'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ɡ/}} as in ''go'', the word ''gerrymander'' is most commonly pronounced {{IPA-en|ˈdʒɛrimændər|}}, with a {{IPA|/dʒ/}} as in ''gentle''.

==Voting systems==
Gerrymandering is used most often in favour of ruling incumbents&lt;ref&gt;Michel Balinski, "Fair Majority Voting (or How to Eliminate Gerrymandering)" ''Amer. Math. Monthly'' '''115''' 2 (2008): 97. "Incumbent candidates, in tailored districts, are almost certain of reelection (over 98% in 2002, over 94% in 2006)".&lt;/ref&gt; or a specific political party. Societies whose legislatures use a single-winner [[voting system]] are the most likely to have political parties that gerrymander for advantage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Most notably, gerrymandering is particularly effective in [[Voting system#Nonproportional and semiproportional methods|non-proportional systems]] that tend towards fewer parties, such as ''[[first past the post]]''.

Most democracies have partly proportional electoral systems, where several political parties are proportionally represented in the national parliaments, in proportion to the total numbers of votes of the parties in the regional or national elections. In these more or less [[proportional representation]] systems, gerrymandering has little or less significance.

Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Canada]], authorise non-partisan organisations to set constituency boundaries in an attempt to prevent gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is most common in countries where elected politicians are responsible for defining constituency boundaries. They have obvious self interest in determining boundaries to their and their party's interest.

Gerrymandering should not be confused with [[Apportionment (politics)#Malapportionment|malapportionment]], whereby the number of eligible voters per elected representative can vary widely. Nevertheless the ''~mander'' suffix has been applied to particular malapportionments, such as the "[[Playmander]]" in South Australia and the "[[Bjelkemander]]" in [[Queensland]]. Sometimes political representatives use both gerrymandering and malapportionment to try to maintain power.{{clearleft}}

==Packing and cracking==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2010}}
The two aims of gerrymandering are to maximise the effect of supporters' votes and to minimise the effect of opponents' votes. One strategy, ''packing'', is to concentrate as many voters of one type into a single electoral district to reduce their influence in other districts. In some cases this may be done to obtain representation for a community of common interest, rather than to dilute that interest over several districts to a point of ineffectiveness. A second strategy, ''cracking'', involves spreading out voters of a particular type among many districts in order to deny them a sufficiently large voting block in any particular district. The strategies are typically combined, creating a few "forfeit" seats for packed voters of one type in order to secure even greater representation for voters of another type.

Gerrymandering is effective because of the [[wasted vote effect]]. By packing opposition voters into districts they will already win (increasing excess votes for winners) and by cracking the remainder among districts where they are moved into the minority (increasing votes for eventual losers), the number of wasted votes among the opposition can be maximised. Similarly, with supporters holding narrow margins in the unpacked districts, the number of wasted votes among supporters is minimised.

While the wasted vote effect is strongest when a party wins by narrow margins across multiple districts, gerrymandering narrow margins can be risky when voters are less predictable.  To minimise the risk of demographic or political shifts swinging a district to the opposition, politicians can instead create more packed districts, leading to more comfortable margins in unpacked ones.

==Simple example of how a minority can gain supermajority representation via Gerrymandering ==
{{unsourced|section|date=November 2010}}
{{Original research|section|date=November 2010}} 
Representative democracy typically asserts the principal that a minority
of voters should not be able to capture a majority&lt;br /&gt; 
or supermajority of legislative seats. Gerrymandering can threaten this principle.  
&lt;br /&gt; Via Gerrymandering,  a '''minority of the population can create''' a stable [[self-reinforcing]] '''supermajority''' for themselves in the government.&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
  
Consider the following simple example :&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
Three districts A,B, and C.&lt;br /&gt;    
100 voters.&lt;br /&gt;    
Majority in a district wins the district.&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
Two parties :&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
X has 60 % of the voters nationally.&lt;br /&gt;    
Y has 40 % of the voters nationally.&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
(X has a supermajority of support in the population).&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
District Allocation :&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
A        
34 Voters from X, 0 from Y. (X wins district A)&lt;br /&gt;    
    
B    
13 Voters from X, 20 from Y. (Y wins district B)&lt;br /&gt;    
    
C        
13 Voters from X, 20 from Y. (Y wins district C)&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
Results : &lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
'''TWO THIRDS of the legislative seats go to the minority party Y'''.&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
All districts are quite stable - "[[safe seat]]s" - with a high probability&lt;br /&gt;     
that the outcome is known in advance. Each party's favourite for their&lt;br /&gt;    
safe districts will almost surely be elected.&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
Party Y can continue to use gerrymandering to subvert democracy&lt;br /&gt;    
since it has a [[supermajority]] of the legislative seats.&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
It is unlikely that this will change unless Party Y loses its&lt;br /&gt;    
ability to poll districts and gerrymander accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
Party Y can also starve Party X and its supporters of resources&lt;br /&gt;    
(and perhaps of rights) since it controls two thirds of the &lt;br /&gt;    
legislature.&lt;br /&gt;    
&lt;br /&gt;    
As this example illustrates, gerrymandering can significantly undermine the principle &lt;br /&gt;
of [[majority rule]] fundamental to [[representative democracy]].
&lt;br /&gt;
(see [[oligarchy]], [[minority rule]] for contrast)

==Effects of gerrymandering==
[[Image:Gerrymandering 9-6.png‎|thumb|175px|right|'''How Gerrymandering can influence electoral results on a [[Voting system#Nonproportional and semiproportional methods|non-proportional system]].'''&lt;br&gt;Example for a state with 3 equally sized districts, 15 voters and 2 parties: ''Plum'' (squares) and ''Orange'' (circles).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In '''(a)''', creating 3 mixed-type districts yields a 3–0 win to ''Plum'' — a disproportional result considering the state-wide 9:6 ''Plum'' majority.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In '''(b)''', ''Orange'' wins the urban district while ''Plum'' wins the rural districts — the 2-1 result reflects the state-wide vote ratio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In '''(c)''', gerrymandering techniques ensure a 2-1 win to the state-wide minority ''Orange'' party.]]
&lt;!-- We should mention the claim that contention over districts creates a major distraction for the legislature --&gt;

===Reduction in electoral competition and voter turnout===
The most immediate and obvious effect of gerrymandering is that elections become less competitive in all districts, particularly packed ones. As electoral margins of victory become significantly greater and politicians have safe seats, the incentive for meaningful campaigning is reduced.

As the chance of influencing electoral results by voting is reduced, [[voter turnout]] is likely to decrease. Correspondingly, political campaigns are less likely to expend resources to encourage turnout. &lt;!-- an example fact here regarding turnout stats or efforts to encourage turnout in competitive/noncompetitive elections would be great --&gt;With a reduction in competition, a candidate puts more effort into securing party [[nomination]] for a given district rather than gaining approval of the general electorate. In a gerrymandered district, the candidate is virtually assured of a win once nominated. In 2004, for example, when California's 3rd [[Congressional District]] became an [[open seat]] after Republican Congressman [[Doug Ose]] ran for higher office, the state's three strongest Republican congressional candidates campaigned vigorously against one another for nomination in the district's [[primary election]]. Several other districts were uncontested with no Republican nominees making even a token campaign effort.

===Increased incumbent advantage and campaign costs===
The effect of gerrymandering for incumbents is particularly advantageous, as incumbents are far more likely to be reelected under conditions of gerrymandering. For example, in 2002, according to political scientists [[Norman Ornstein]] and [[Thomas E. Mann|Thomas Mann]], only four challengers were able to defeat incumbent members of the US Congress, the lowest number in modern American history.&lt;ref name="7_buck_trust.html"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centrists.org/pages/2004/07/7_buck_trust.html |title=Iowa's Redistricting Process: An Example of the Right Way to Draw Legislative |publisher=Centrists.Org |date=2004-07-22 |accessdate=2009-08-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incumbents are likely to be of the majority party orchestrating a gerrymander, and incumbents are usually easily renominated in subsequent elections, including incumbents among the minority.

This demonstrates that gerrymandering can have a deleterious effect on the principle of democratic accountability. With uncompetitive seats/districts reducing the fear that incumbent politicians may lose office, they have less incentive to represent the interests of their constituents, even when those interests conform to majority support for an issue across the electorate as a whole. Incumbent politicians may look out more for their party's interests than for those of their constituents.

Gerrymandering can have an impact on campaign costs for district elections. If districts become increasingly stretched out, candidates must pay increased costs for transportation and trying to develop and present [[campaign advertising]] across a district.{{Citation needed|reason=Apr 2008|date=April 2008}} The incumbent's advantage in securing campaign funds is another benefit of his or her having a gerrymandered secure seat.

===Less descriptive representation===
Gerrymandering also has significant effects on the [[representation (politics)|representation]] received by voters in gerrymandered districts. Because gerrymandering is designed to increase the number of wasted votes among the electorate, the relative representation of particular groups can be drastically altered from their actual share of the voting population. This effect can significantly prevent a gerrymandered system from achieving proportional and [[descriptive representation]], as the winners of elections are increasingly determined by who is drawing the districts rather than the preferences of the voters.

Gerrymandering may be advocated to improve representation within the legislature among otherwise underrepresented minority groups by packing them into a single district. This can be controversial, as it may lead to those groups' remaining marginalised in the government as they become confined to a single district. Candidates outside that district no longer need to represent them to win election.

As an example, much of the redistricting conducted in the United States in the early 1990s involved the intentional creation of additional "majority-minority" districts where racial minorities such as African Americans were packed into the majority. This "[[maximisation policy]]" drew support by both the Republican Party (who had limited support among African Americans and could concentrate their power elsewhere) and by minority representatives elected as Democrats from these constituencies, who then had safe seats. &lt;!-- cite a famous politician or political scientist that has a good quote of this here --&gt;

===Incumbent gerrymandering===
Gerrymandering can also be done to help incumbents as a whole, effectively turning every district into a packed one and greatly reducing the potential for competitive elections. This is particularly likely to occur when the minority party has significant obstruction power—unable to enact a partisan gerrymander, the legislature instead agrees on ensuring their own mutual reelection.

In an unusual occurrence in 2000, for example, the two dominant parties in the state of California [[Politics of California#Bi-partisan gerrymandering|cooperatively redrew]] both state and Federal legislative districts to preserve the status quo, ensuring the electoral safety of the politicians from unpredictable voting by the electorate. This move proved completely effective, as no State or Federal legislative office changed party in the [[U.S. House election, 2004|2004 election]], although 53 congressional, 20 state senate, and 80 state assembly seats were potentially at risk.

In 2006, the term "70/30 District" came to signify the equitable split of two evenly split (i.e. 50/50) districts. The resulting districts gave each party a guaranteed seat and retained their respective power base.

===Prison-based gerrymandering===
Prison-based gerrymandering occurs when prisoners are counted as residents of a particular district increasing the district's population with non-voters when assigning political apportionment. This phenomenon, according to prisoners' rights organisation, violates the principle of [[one person, one vote]]. [[Prison Policy Initiative]] argues that although many prisoners come from (and return to) urban communities, they are counted as "residents" of the rural districts that contain large prisons, diluting urban voters' political clout and artificially inflating the political representation for rural districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news/2006/05/20/NYT-gerrymandering Prison-Based Gerrymandering—New York Times editorial], New York Times,  May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Others contend that prisoners should not be counted as residents of their original districts when they neither reside there nor are legally eligible to vote; also, the rural areas usually house prisons to keep the prisoners ''away'' from the cities, and thus should reap the benefits of housing the people that the urban areas want to keep away from themselves.

==Changes to achieve competitive elections==
[[Image:map22007.gif|thumb|250px|Electoral divisions: Sydney area]]
Due to many issues associated with gerrymandering and its impact on competitive elections and democratic accountability, numerous countries have enacted reforms making the practice either more difficult or less effective. Countries such as the UK, Australia, Canada and most of those in Europe have transferred responsibility for defining constituency boundaries to neutral or cross-party bodies.

In the United States, however, such reforms are controversial and frequently meet particularly strong opposition from groups that benefit from gerrymandering. In a more neutral system, they might lose considerable influence.

===Redistricting by neutral or cross-party agency===
The most commonly advocated electoral reform proposal targeted at gerrymandering is to change the redistricting process. Under these proposals, an independent and presumably objective commission is created specifically for redistricting, rather than having the legislature do it. This is the system used in the United Kingdom, where the independent [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commissions]] determine the boundaries for [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and regional legislatures, subject to ratification by the body in question (almost always granted without debate). A similar situation exists in Australia where the independent [[Australian Electorial Commission|Australian Electoral Commission]], and its state based counterparts, determines electoral boundaries for federal, state and local jurisdictions.

To help ensure neutrality, members of a redistricting agency may be appointed from relatively apolitical sources such as retired judges or longstanding members of the civil service, possibly with requirements for adequate representation among competing political parties. Additionally, members of the board can be denied access to information that might aid in gerrymandering, such as the demographic makeup or voting patterns of the population. As a further constraint, [[consensus]] requirements can be imposed to ensure that the resulting district map reflects a wider perception of fairness, such as a requirement for a supermajority approval of the commission for any district proposal. Consensus requirements, however, can lead to deadlock, such as occurred in [[Missouri]] following the 2000 census. There, the equally numbered partisan appointees were unable to reach consensus in a reasonable time, and consequently the courts had to determine district lines.

In the US state of [[Iowa]], the nonpartisan Legislative Services Bureau (LSB, akin to the US [[Congressional Research Service]]) determines boundaries of electoral districts. Aside from satisfying federally mandated contiguity and population equality criteria, the LSB mandates unity of counties and cities. Consideration of political factors such as location of incumbents, previous boundary locations, and political party proportions is specifically forbidden. Since Iowa's counties are chiefly regularly shaped [[polygons]], the LSB process has led to districts that follow county lines.&lt;ref name="7_buck_trust.html"/&gt;

In 2005, the US state of [[Ohio]] had a ballot measure to create an independent commission whose first priority was competitive districts, a sort of "reverse gerrymander". A complex mathematical formula was to be used to determine the competitiveness of a district. The measure failed voter approval chiefly due to voter concerns that communities of interest would be broken up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2005/11/08/oh/state/issue/4/ |title=Issue 4: Independent Redistricting Process – Ohio State Government |publisher=Smartvoter.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing the voting system===
Because gerrymandering relies on the wasted vote effect, the use of a different voting system with fewer wasted votes can help reduce gerrymandering. In particular, the use of [[multimember district]]s alongside voting systems establishing proportional representation such as [[Single Transferable Voting]] can reduce wasted votes and gerrymandering.  Semi-proportional voting systems such as [[single non-transferable vote]] or [[cumulative voting]] are relatively simple and similar to ''first past the post'' and can also reduce the proportion of wasted votes and thus potential gerrymandering.  Electoral reformers have advocated all three as replacement systems.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Richard L. Engstrom, The Single Transferable Vote: An Alternative Remedy for Minority Vote Dilution, 27 U.S.F.L.Rev. 781, 806 (1993) (arguing that the Single Transferable Voting systems maintain minority electoral opportunities); Steven J. Mulroy, Alternative Ways Out: A Remedial Road Map for the Use of Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Act Remedies, 77 N.C.L.Rev. 1867, 1923 (1999) (concluding that ranked-ballot voting systems avoid minority vote dilution); Steven J. Mulroy, The Way Out: A Legal Standard for Imposing Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Remedies, 33 Harv.C.R.-C.L.L.Rev. 333, 350 (1998) (arguing that preferential voting systems enhance minority representation); and Alexander Athan Yanos, Note, Reconciling the Right to Vote With the Voting Rights Act, 92 Colum.L.Rev. 1810, 1865-66 (1992) (arguing that Single Transferable Voting serves to preserve the minority party's right to representation).&lt;/ref&gt;

Electoral systems with different forms of proportional representation are now found in nearly all European countries. In this way, they have multi-party systems (with many parties represented in the parliaments) with higher voter attendance in the elections{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}, fewer wasted votes, and a wider variety of political opinions represented.

Electoral systems with election of just one winner in each district (i.e., "winner-take-all" electoral systems), and no proportional distribution of extra mandates to smaller parties, tend to create two-party systems ([[Duverger's Law]]). In these, just two parties effectively compete in the national elections and thus the national political discussions are forced into a narrow two-party frame, where loyalty and forced statements inside the two parties distort the political debate.

===Changing the size of districts and the elected body===
If a proportional or semi-proportional voting system is used then increasing the number of winners in any given district will reduce the number of wasted votes. This can be accomplished both by merging separate districts together and by increasing the total size of the body to be elected. Since gerrymandering relies on exploiting the wasted vote effect, increasing the number of winners per district can reduce the potential for gerrymandering in proportional systems. Unless all districts are merged, however, this method cannot eliminate gerrymandering entirely.

In contrast to proportional methods, if a nonproportional voting system with multiple winners (such as [[plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]) is used, then increasing the size of the elected body while keeping the number of districts constant will not reduce the amount of wasted votes, leaving the potential for gerrymandering the same. While merging districts together under such a system can reduce the potential for gerrymandering, doing so also amplifies the tendency of block voting to produce [[landslide victory|landslide victories]], creating a similar effect to gerrymandering by concentrating wasted votes among the opposition and denying them representation.

If a system of single-winner elections is used, then increasing the size of the elected body will implicitly increase the number of districts to be created. This change can actually make gerrymandering easier when raising the number of single-winner elections, as opposition groups can be more efficiently packed into smaller districts without accidentally including supporters, further increasing the number of wasted votes amongst the opposition.

===Using fixed districts===
Another way to avoid gerrymandering is simply to stop redistricting altogether and use existing political boundaries such as state, county, or provincial lines. While this prevents future gerrymandering, any existing advantage may become deeply ingrained. The [[United States Senate]], for instance, has more competitive elections than the House of Representatives due to the use of existing state borders rather than gerrymandered districts—Senators are elected by their entire state, while Representatives are elected in legislatively drawn districts.

The use of fixed districts creates an additional problem, however, in that fixed districts do not take into account changes in population. Individual voters can come to have very different degrees of influence on the legislative process. This [[malapportionment]] can greatly affect representation after long periods of time or large population movements. In the United Kingdom during the [[Industrial Revolution]], several constituencies which had been fixed since they gained representation in the Parliament of England became so small that they could be won with only a handful of voters (''[[rotten borough]]s''). Similarly, in the US the state legislature of Alabama refused to redistrict for more than 60 years, despite major changes in population patterns. By 1960 less than a quarter of the state's population controlled the majority of seats in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Michael McDonald, US Elections Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary [http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm Dept. of Public and International Affairs George Mason University], accessed 6 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; However, this practice of using fixed districts for state legislatures was effectively banned in the United States after the ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' Supreme Court decision, establishing a rule of [[one man, one vote]].

===Objective rules to create districts===
Another means to reduce gerrymandering is to create objective, precise criteria to which any district map must comply. Courts in the United States, for instance, have ruled that congressional districts must be contiguous in order to be constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Reynolds v. Sims|Reynolds v. Sims]] states that "a state legislative apportionment scheme may properly give representation to various political subdivisions and provide for compact districts of contiguous territory if substantial equality among districts is maintained." See also [[Reynolds v. Sims|the Wikipedia article]].&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, is not a particularly binding constraint, as very narrow strips of land with few or no voters in them may be used to connect separate regions for inclusion in one district.

====Minimum district to convex polygon ratio====
One method is to define a '''minimum district to [[convex polygon]] ratio'''. To use this method, every proposed district is circumscribed by the smallest possible convex polygon (similar to the concept of a [[convex hull]], think of stretching a rubberband around the outline of the district). Then, the area of the district is divided by the area of the polygon; or, if at the edge of the state, by the portion of the area of the polygon within state boundaries. The advantages of this method are that it allows a certain amount of human intervention to take place (thus solving the Colorado problem of [[#Shortest_splitline_algorithm|splitline districting]]); it allows the borders of the district to follow existing jagged subdivisions, such as neighbourhoods or voting districts (something isoperimetric rules would discourage); and it allows concave coastline districts, such as the Florida gulf coast area. It would mostly eliminate bent districts, but still permit long, straight ones. However, since human intervention is still allowed, the gerrymandering issues of packing and cracking would still occur, just to a lesser extent.  Also, it would not allow convex coastline districts, although this could be remedied by a secondary calculation using a "polygon" with a border being a defined distance from the shore.

====Shortest splitline algorithm====
The [[Center for Range Voting]] has proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/GerryExamples.html |title=Gerrymandering and a cure - shortest splitline algorithm |publisher=RangeVoting.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a way to draw districts by a simple [[algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org|title=RangeVoting.org - Center for Range Voting}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm uses only the shape of the state, the number N of districts wanted, and the population distribution as inputs. The algorithm (slightly simplified) is:
# Start with the boundary outline of the state.
# Let N=A+B where A and B are as nearly equal whole numbers as possible. (For example, 7=4+3.)
# Among all possible dividing lines that split the state into two parts with population ratio A:B, choose the ''shortest''.
# We now have two hemi-states, each to contain a specified number (namely A and B) of districts. Handle them recursively via the same splitting procedure.
This district-drawing algorithm has the advantages of simplicity, ultra-low cost, lack of intentional bias, and it produces simple boundaries that do not meander needlessly. It has the disadvantage of ignoring geographic features such as rivers, cliffs, and highways and cultural features such as tribal boundaries. This landscape oversight causes it to produce districts differently than those an unbiased human would produce. Ignoring geographic features can induce very simple boundaries.

Another criticism of the system is that splitline districts sometimes divide and diffuse the voters in a large metropolitan area. This condition is most likely to occur when one of the first splitlines cuts through the metropolitan area. It is often considered a drawback of the system because residents of the same city are assumed to be a community of common interest. This is most evident in the splitline allocation of [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rangevoting.org/SSHR/co_final.png&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2007, shortest-splitline redistricting pictures are now available for all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/SplitLR.html |title=Splitline districtings of all 50 states + DC + PR |publisher=RangeVoting.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minimum isoperimetric quotient====
It is possible to define a specific minimum [[isoperimetric quotient]],&lt;ref name="siam.org"&gt;[http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/1237.pdf James Case "Flagrant Gerrymandering: Help from the Isoperimetric Theorem?"]&lt;/ref&gt; proportional to the ratio between the area and the square of the perimeter of any given congressional voting district. Although technologies presently exist to define districts in this manner, there are no rules in place mandating their use, and no national movement to implement such a policy. Such rules would prevent incorporation of jagged natural boundaries, such as rivers or mountains. When such boundaries are required (such as at the edge of a state), certain districts may not be able to meet the required minima.  Enforcing a minimum [[isoperimetric quotient]], would encourage districts with a high ratio between area and perimeter.&lt;ref name="siam.org"/&gt;

==Use of databases and computer technology==
{{See also|Geographic information system}}
The introduction of modern computers alongside the development of elaborate [[voter database]]s and special districting software has made gerrymandering a far more precise science. Using such databases, political parties can obtain detailed information about every household including political party registration, previous campaign donations, and the number of times residents voted in previous elections and combine it with other predictors of voting behaviour such as age, income, race, or education level. With this data, gerrymandering politicians can predict the voting behaviour of each potential district with an astonishing degree of precision, leaving little chance for creating an accidentally competitive district.

==National examples of gerrymandering==
Among western democracies, Israel and the Netherlands employ electoral systems with only one (nationwide) voting district for election of national representatives. This virtually precludes gerrymandering.

===Brazil===
Since the end of the Empire Era (1822/1889), Brazil adopts the proportional system for the national, States and local legislative elections, with some variations. However, it is said that, during the military dictatorship (1964/1985), specially in the General Ernesto Geisel Presidency,  States were incorporated (Guanabara State into Rio de Janeiro State - 1975) or splited (Mato Grosso/Mato Grosso do Sul - 1979), both without popular referendum, in order to prevent the rising of the opposition party (MDB).

===Canada===
Early in Canadian history, both the federal and provincial levels used gerrymandering to try to maximise partisan power. When [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] were admitted to Confederation in 1905, their original district boundaries were set forth in the respective [[Alberta Act|Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan Act]]s. These boundaries had been devised by federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] members to ensure the election of provincial Liberal governments.

Since responsibility for drawing federal and provincial electoral boundaries was handed over to independent agencies, this problem has largely been eliminated at these levels of government. Manitoba was the first province to authorise a non-partisan group to define constituency boundaries in the 1950s. In 1964, the federal government delegated the drawing of boundaries for national seats to the "arm's length" [[Elections Canada]].

As a result, gerrymandering is not generally a major issue in Canada except at the civic level. Although city wards are recommended by independent agencies, city councils occasionally overrule them. This is much more likely where the city is not homogenous and different neighbourhoods have sharply different opinions about city policy direction.

In 2006, a controversy arose on [[Prince Edward Island]] over the provincial government's decision to throw out an electoral map drawn by an independent commission. Instead they created two new maps. The government adopted the second of these, designed by the [[caucus]] of the governing party. Opposition parties and the media attacked Premier [[Pat Binns]] for what they saw as gerrymandering of districts. Among other things, the government adopted a map that ensured that every current [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] from the premier's party had a district to run in for re-election, whereas in the original map, several had been redistricted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2006/11/16/binns-fall.html?ref=rss "No Christmas election: Binns"]. [[cbc.ca]], November 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, in the [[Prince Edward Island general election, 2007|2007 provincial election]] only seven of 20 incumbent Members of the Legislative Assembly were re-elected (seven did not run for re-election), and the government was defeated.

The current federal electoral district boundaries in [[Saskatchewan]] have also been labelled as gerrymandered—the province's two major cities, [[Saskatoon]] and [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], are both "cracked" into four districts each when the populations of the cities proper would justify about three and two and a half all-urban (or mostly urban) districts respectively;&lt;ref&gt;Based on the average population per federal riding ''in Saskatchewan'', which is considerably less than in the more populous provinces&lt;/ref&gt; the map instead groups parts of the [[New Democratic Party]]-friendly cities with large [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]]-leaning rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/scripts/fedrep/searchengine/search_by_maps.asp|title=Current electoral map of Saskatchewan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, the districts were created in their largely present form in the mid-1990s, it was alleged that they were intended to give the NDP and Liberals, two very anti-Reform parties, a better chance of winning additional seats that included large sections of the province's rural hinterlands at the expense of the then-extant [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]]. If that was the intention, it backfired: in 1997, the Reform Party won three of the four Saskatoon seats despite their failure to earn a plurality of the city vote in any of the three ridings. In 2000, its successor, the [[Canadian Alliance]], added the remaining Saskatoon seat plus one in Regina, and, in 2004, the Canadian Alliance's successor, the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], added the NDP's two remaining Regina seats to shut the NDP out of the province. Since then, the Conservatives have held the seven districts in question, while the NDP holds no seats in the province despite a strong proportion of the vote especially in the cities. Polling data shows the Tories could probably not have swept either of these cities had they contained either completely or mostly urban constituencies. Not surprisingly, neither the federal Conservatives nor the new centre-right [[Saskatchewan Party]] with similar views expressed in power any interest in changing the map, even if it was not their creation.

===Chile===
After Chileans voted General [[Augusto Pinochet]] out of power in a 1988  [[plebiscite]], the military government began working on a law to define the new electoral system for the 1989 elections. The [[Electoral division of Chile|60 electoral districts]] for the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] (lower house) were designed so that—if the results of the 1988 plebiscite were extrapolated to the coming parliamentary elections—in no district would the NO option outpoll the YES option by more than two to one. (The NO option was for removing Pinochet from power and to trigger democratic elections.) The rationale for this—in a system in which only two candidates are elected per district and where a coalition needed twice the vote of the opponent to gain both district seats—was that the voters who favoured the NO option would vote for the [[Concert of Parties for Democracy|Centre-Left coalition]], which opposed the Pinochet dictatorship, and the ones that favoured the YES option would be inclined to vote for the candidates of the [[Alliance for Chile|right]], which supported the military government.

In the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] —where a whole [[Regions of Chile|administrative region]] consists of one or two constituencies— gerrymandering of districts had a limited effect. The dictatorship, therefore, to ensure that the winning majority (the Center-Left coalition, as it was expected) would be unable to reach the [[quorum]] necessary to change the [[Constitution of Chile|Constitution]] by itself, allocated a number of seats to appointed senators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/docs/chile.htm The Chilean Electoral System].&lt;/ref&gt; These unelected senators were eliminated in the 2005 constitutional reforms, but the electoral map has remained largely untouched. (In 2007 a new region was created, which altered the composition of two senatorial constituencies. The first election to be affected by this slight change will take place in 2013.)

===Germany===
When the electoral districts in Germany were redrawn in 2000, the ruling Social Democratic Party ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) was accused of gerrymandering to marginalise the socialist [[Left Party (Germany)|PDS]] party. The SPD combined traditional PDS strongholds in eastern Berlin with new districts made up of more populous areas of western Berlin, where the PDS had very limited following.

After having won four seats in Berlin in the 1998 national election, the PDS was able to retain only two seats altogether in the 2002 elections. Under German electoral law, a political party has to win either more than five percent of the votes, or at least three directly elected seats, to qualify for top-up seats under the [[Additional Member System]]. The PDS vote fell below five percent thus they failed to qualify for top-up seats and were confined to just two members of the [[Bundestag]], the German federal parliament (elected representatives are always allowed to hold their seats as individuals).  Had they won a third constituency, the PDS would have gained at least 25 additional seats, which would have been enough to hold the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the Bundestag.

In the election of 2005, the Left Party (successor of the PDS) gained 8.7% of the votes and thus qualified for top-up seats.

&lt;!--Ugly paragraph and very confusing – needs more explanation--&gt;However, the number of Bundestag seats of parties which traditionally get over 5% of the votes cannot be affected very much by gerrymandering, because seats are awarded to these parties on a proportional basis. Only when a party wins so many districts in any one of the 16 federal states that those seats alone count for more than its proportional share of the vote in that same state does the districting have some influence on larger parties—those extra seats, called "[[Overhang seat|Überhangmandate]]", remain.

===Greece===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Gerrymandering has been rather common in Greek history since organised parties with national ballots only appeared after the 1926 Constitution. The only case before that was the creation of the Piraeus electoral district in 1906, in order to give the Theotokis party a safe district. The most infamous case of gerrymandering was in the 1956 elections, which was incidentally the first election where women voted. While in all other post World War II national elections the districts were based on the [[prefecture]] (νομός) for 1956 the country was split in districts of varying sizes, others being the size of prefectures, others the size of sub-prefectures (επαρχία) and others somewhere in between. In small districts the winning party would take all seats, in intermediate size it would take most and there was proportional representation in the largest districts. The districts though were chosen in such a way that small districts were those that traditionally voted for the right while large districts were those that voted against the right. This system has become known as the three-phase (τριφασικό) system or the baklava system (because, as baklava is split into full pieces and corner pieces, the country was also split into disproportionate pieces). The opposition, being composed of the center and the left, formed a coalition with the sole intent to change the electoral law to be more representative and call new elections, despite the fact that only seven years earlier the center and the left had fought each other in the [[Greek Civil War]]. Despite the opposition winning the popular vote (1,620,007 votes against 1,594,992), the right wing [[National Radical Union|ERE]] won the majority of seats (165 to 135) and was to lead the country for the next two years.

===Ireland===
Until the 1980s [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] boundaries in the state of Ireland were drawn not by an independent commission but by government ministers. Successive arrangements by governments of all political characters have been attacked as gerrymandering. Ireland uses the [[Single Transferable Vote]] and as well as the actual boundaries drawn the main tool of gerrymandering has been the number of seats per constituency used, with three-seat constituencies normally benefiting the strongest parties in an area, whereas four-seat constituencies normally helped the second strongest party.

In 1947 the rapid rise of new party [[Clann na Poblachta]] threatened the position of the governing party [[Fianna Fáil]]. The government of [[Éamon de Valera]] introduced the [[Electoral Amendment Act, 1947]] which increased the size of the Dáil from 138 to 147 and increased the number of three-seat constituencies from fifteen to twenty-two. The result has been described as "a blatant attempt at gerrymander which no [[Northern Ireland|Six County]] Unionist could have bettered."&lt;ref name="coogan637"&gt;Tim Pat Coogan, ''De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' (Hutchinson, London, 1993) hardback. page 637 ISBN 0-09-175030-X&lt;/ref&gt; The following February the [[Irish general election, 1948|1948 general election]] was held and Clann na Poblachta secured ten constituencies instead of the nineteen they would have received proportional to their vote.&lt;ref name="coogan637" /&gt;

In the mid-1970s, the Minister for Local Government, [[James Tully (Irish politician)|James Tully]], attempted to arrange the constituencies to ensure that the governing [[Fine Gael]]–[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] [[Government of the 20th Dáil|National Coalition]] would win a parliamentary majority. The [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974]] was planned as a major reversal of previous gerrymandering by Fianna Fáil (then in opposition). Tully ensured that there were as many as possible three-seat constituencies where the governing parties were strong, in the expectation that the governing parties would each win a seat in many constituencies, relegating Fianna Fáil to one out of three. In areas where the governing parties were weak, four-seat constituencies were used so that the governing parties had a strong chance of still winning two. The election results created substantial change, as there was a larger than expected collapse in the vote. Fianna Fáil won a landslide victory in the [[Irish general election, 1977]], two out of three seats in many cases, relegating the National Coalition parties to fight for the last seat. Consequently, the term '''[[Tullymandering]]''' was used to describe the phenomenon of a failed attempt at gerrymandering.

===Latvia===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
In 1989 and 1990 elections, some accused the [[Popular Front of Latvia]] (PFL) of gerrymandering in favour of ethnic Latvians. For example, in 1990 the nearly pure Latvian-ethnic [[Ventspils district]] (with about 0.6% of population) was awarded three constituencies out of 201 (1.5%), with two of PFL candidates running unopposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saeima.lv/Informacija/velesanas/apgabali.html Constituencies in 1990 elections]—see Ugāles, Tārgales, Ziru constituencies, # 199—201&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, most native Russians were [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|denied citizenship]] and therefore had no voting rights. Naturalization of native Russians began in 1995. In 1993 the country returned to proportional representation.

===Lithuania===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
After declaring independence from the USSR in 1990, in 1994 the then-government reorganised the county and municipal boundaries in the [[Vilnius region|south-east of the country]] to reduce the influence of the [[Polish minority in Lithuania|Polish majority]] in the area. This was done by connecting the majority-Polish areas in the Vilnius, Trakai and Šalčininkai municipalities to municipalities without major Polish populations, such as Elektrėnai, Ukmergė and Širvintos. The result is that [[Vilnius County]] has a total Polish minority of 29.01%, which contain municipalities like Vilnius and Šalčininkai, which have a much larger percentage of the population (61.3% and 80% respectively). This was done to ensure continued discrimination and [[Lithuanisation]] of the Polish minority, and to ensure that no autonomous Polish districts would get a high-enough percentage number of support in the county.

===Malta===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Allegedly, the Labour Party that won in 1981 even though the Nationalist Party got the most votes had done so because of its gerrymandering. A 1987 constitutional amendment prevented that situation from reoccurring.

===Nepal===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
After the restoration of democracy in 1990, Nepali politics has well exercised the practice of gerrymandering with the view to take advantage in the election. It was well practised by Nepali Congress, which remained in power in most of the time. Learning from this, the reshaping of constituency was done for constituent assembly. Kathmandu was divided into ten seats by making appropriate for 6 seats for UML the powerhouse of the past election and four for NC.

===Northern Ireland===
Gerrymandering is widely considered to have been introduced after the establishment of [[Irish Home Rule|Home Rule]] in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1921, favouring [[Irish unionism|Unionists]] who tended to be Protestant, to the detriment of [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalists]] who were mostly [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic]]. However [[Stephen Lucius Gwynn|Stephen Gwynn]] had noted as early as 1911 that since the introduction of the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]]:
:"In [[County Armagh|Armagh]] there are 68,000 Protestants, 56,000 Catholics. The County Council has twenty-two Protestants and eight Catholics. In [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], Catholics are a majority of the population, 82,000 against 68,000; but the electoral districts have been so arranged that Unionists return sixteen as against thirteen Nationalists (one a Protestant). This Council gives to the Unionists two to one majority on its Committees, and out of fifty-two officials employs only five Catholics. In [[County Antrim|Antrim]], which has the largest Protestant majority (196,000 to 40,000), twenty-six Unionists and three Catholics are returned. Sixty officers out of sixty-five are good Unionists and Protestants."&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn S.L. ''The Case for Home Rule'' (1911) pp.104-105. (http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/E900030.html book text here; accessed Aug 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] created new electoral boundaries for the [[Londonderry County Borough Council]] to ensure election of a [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]] council in a city where [[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] had a large majority and had won previous elections.&lt;ref name="whyte"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |title=CAIN: Issues – Discrimination: John Whyte, 'How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921–1968?' |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially local parties drew the boundaries, but in the 1930s the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|province-wide government]] redrew them to reinforce the gerrymander.&lt;ref name="whyte" /&gt;

In 1929, the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] passed a bill shifting the Parliament's electoral system from the relatively proportional [[single transferable vote]] (STV) to the less proportional first past the post or [[plurality voting]] system. The only exception was for the election of four Stormont MPs to represent the [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University of Belfast]]. Many scholars believe that the boundaries were gerrymandered to underrepresent Nationalists.{{Who|date=October 2008}} Some geographers and historians, for instance Professor [[John H. Whyte]], disagree.&lt;ref name="whyte" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/hnihoc.htm |title=Northern Ireland House of Commons, 1921–1972 |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have argued that the electoral boundaries for the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] were not gerrymandered to a greater level than that produced by any single-winner election system, and that the actual number of Nationalist MPs barely changed under the revised system (it went from 12 to 11 and later went back up to 12). Most observers have acknowledged that the change to a single-winner system was a key factor, however, in stifling the growth of smaller political parties, such as the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and [[Independent Unionist]]s.

The university seats were abolished in 1969 and replaced with four safe Unionist seats as opposed to a 2-2 tie with Nationalist seats, another gerrymander.

The United Kingdom suspended the Parliament of Northern Ireland and its government in 1972. It restored the single transferable vote (STV) for elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly in the following year, using the same definitions of constituencies as for the Westminster Parliament. Currently in Northern Ireland, all elections use the STV except those for positions in the [[Westminster Parliament]], which follow the pattern in the rest of the United Kingdom by using "first past the post."

===Singapore===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Singapore]] --&gt;
In recent decades, critics have accused the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) of unfair electoral practices to maintain significant majorities in the [[Parliament of Singapore]]. Among the complaints are that the government uses gerrymandering.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yawning Bread]], "Electoral boundary changes: as opaque as ever", March 2006. http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/yax-553.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Elections Department]] was established as part of the executive branch under the [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Prime Minister of Singapore]], rather than as an independent body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmo.gov.sg/AboutPMOffice/OurDepartments/ Prime Minister's Office], Our Departments&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused it of giving the ruling party the power to decide polling districts and polling sites through electoral engineering, based on poll results in previous election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=ve4vY9ZosRMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Electoral+engineering+in+Singapore&amp;source=web&amp;ots=-k5mbicG3e&amp;sig=tQSkykbxlsBMdfgz5N8rE6kokrI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Electoral Engineering: Voting Rules and Political Behavior], Pippa Norris&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition parties have alleged that the Elections Department decisions have given unfair advantage to the ruling party and have affected the outcome of some electoral battles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yoursdp.org/index.php/truth-about/elections About Elections], Singapore Democratic Party&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wp.sg/wp/beliefs/manifesto.php Manifesto], The Workers' Party of Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics point out the dissolution of the Group Representation Constituencies (GRC) of [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency|Cheng San GRC]] and [[Eunos Group Representation Constituency|Eunos GRC]]. Each was dissolved by the Elections Department with voters redistributed to other constituencies after opposition parties gained ground in elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forum.rp.sg/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=863|title=Republic Polytechnic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such action was controversial. Critics have speculated about the possibility of the Elections Department's dissolving next the [[Aljunied Group Representation Constituency|Aljunied GRC]] in the next General Elections, likely in 2010 or 2011. The opposition Workers' Party gained ground there in the General Elections in 2006, when it earned approximately 44% of the votes.

PAP strongholds, such as [[Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency|Tanjong Pagar GRC]] and [[Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency|Ang Mo Kio GRC]], where Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong respectively contest, have seldom been contested by the opposition. When Ang Mo Kio GRC was last contested in 2006, the PAP has [[Singaporean general election, 2006#Electorate|won]] 66% of the votes.

===Sudan===
In the most recent election of 2010, there were numerous examples of gerrymandering throughout the entire country of Sudan. A report from the Rift Valley Institute uncovered violations of Sudan's electoral law, where constituencies were created that were well below and above the required limit. According to Sudan's National Elections Act of 2008, no constituency can have a population that is 15% greater or less than the average constituency size. The Rift Valley Report uncovered a number of constituencies that are in violation of this rule. Examples include constituencies in Jonglei, Warrap, South Darfur, and several other states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riftvalley.net/resources/file/Electoral%20Designs%20-%20Report%20on%20elections%20in%20Sudan.pdf Rift Valley Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
On July 5, 2010, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced plans to hold a referendum on a change to the voting system, which would take place with a re-drawing of the boundaries of seats for election to the Westminster Parliament. These changes were described by Shadow Justice Secretary Jack Straw as an "attempt to gerrymander the boundaries of the house".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/politics/10516429.stm BBC News website 05/07/10]&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals would base the size of constituencies on the number of electors rather than the population. Many constituencies won by Labour in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] are in areas of low voter registration, and that during Labour's time in power many Conservatives complained of how it takes far fewer votes to elect a Labour than a Conservative MP: a phenomenon that has been exacerbated by the failure of boundary changes to keep up with a general population drift from urban Labour seats to suburban or rural Conservative seats.

The United States has a long tradition of gerrymandering which precedes the 1789 election of the [[1st United States Congress|First U.S. Congress]]. In 1788, [[Patrick Henry]] and his [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalist]] allies were in control of the [[Virginia]] [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]]. They drew the boundaries of [[Virginia's 5th congressional district]] in an unsuccessful attempt to keep [[James Madison]] out of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Labunski, Richard. ''James Madison and the Struggle for the Bill of Rights'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, each state legislature has used gerrymandering to try to control the political makeup of its delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives. Partisan legislators typically try to maximise the number of congressional delegation seats under the control of the legislature's majority party.

The practice of gerrymandering the borders of new states continued past the Civil War and into the late 19th century. The Republican Party used its control of Congress to secure the admission of more states in territories friendly to their party - the admission of [[Dakota Territory]] as two states instead of one being a notable example. By the rules for representation in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], each new state carried at least three electoral votes regardless of its population.&lt;ref&gt;Compare a map of the United States in 1860 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1860.jpg] with a map from 1870 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1870.jpg]. &lt;!-- These images need to be put in wikimedia commons, rather than external links--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

All redistricting in the United States has been contentious because it has been controlled by political parties vying for power. As a consequence of the decennial [[census]] required by the [[United States Constitution]], districts for members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] typically need to be redrawn. In many states, state legislatures have redrawn boundaries for state legislative districts at the same time.
[[Image:TheGerry-mander.jpg|thumb|250px|right|"The Gerry-mander" first appeared in this cartoon-map in the ''[[Boston Gazette]]'', 26 March 1812.]]
When faced with losing power, however, members of some legislatures simply refused to redistrict. Early struggles for power were between rural and urban interests, as well as between political parties. The state legislature of Alabama, for instance, refused to redistrict from 1901 to the 1960s, despite changing conditions in a state that was industrialising and where population was rapidly moving to cities. This allowed state politics to heavily favour rural interests. In 1960, approximately a quarter of the state's population controlled the state legislature. When the state legislature could not agree on boundaries, a federal court worked with a new non-partisan body to conclude defining new districts in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Michael McDonald, U.S. Elections Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary [http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm George Mason University, Dept. of Public and International Affairs], accessed 6 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Intense political battles over contentious redistricting typically take place within state legislatures responsible for creating the electoral maps. Since passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, federal courts may be involved to ensure that historical patterns of discrimination are not perpetuated.

This process can create strange bedfellows interested in securing reelection; in some states, Republicans have cut deals with opposing black Democratic state legislators to create majority-black districts. By packing black Democratic voters into a single district, they can essentially ensure the election of a black Congressman or reelection of a black state legislator due to the packed concentration of Democratic voters—however, the surrounding districts are more safely Republican in areas like the South, where white conservatives have increasingly shifted from the Democratic to the Republican Party in national elections in the last four decades.

In Pennsylvania, the Republican-dominated state legislature used gerrymandering to help defeat Democratic representative [[Frank Mascara]]. Mascara was elected to Congress in 1994. In 2002, the Republican Party altered the boundaries of his original district so much that he was pitted against fellow Democratic candidate [[John Murtha]] in the election. The shape of Mascara's newly drawn district formed a finger that stopped at his street, encompassing his house, but not the spot where he parked his car. Murtha won the election in the newly formed district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0611.morris.html | title= The Race to Gerrymander | author=Rachel Morris | publisher=[[The Washington Monthly]]|date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State legislatures have used gerrymandering along racial or ethnic lines both to decrease and increase minority representation in state governments and congressional delegations. In the state of Ohio, a conversation between Republican officials was recorded that demonstrated that redistricting was being done to aid their political candidates. Furthermore, the discussions assessed race of voters as a factor in redistricting, because African-Americans had backed Democratic candidates. Republicans apparently removed approximately 13,000 African American voters from the district of Jim Raussen, a Republican candidate for the House of Representatives, in an attempt to tip the scales in what was once a competitive district for Democratic candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/iteam/cdd905.html | title= Republican Party Politics (Part II) | author=AP | publisher=[[WCPO]]|date=29 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, bipartisan gerrymandering is the norm.  State legislators from both parties sometimes agree to draw congressional district boundaries in a way that ensures the re-election of most or all incumbent representatives from both parties.

International election observers from the [[OSCE]] Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, who were invited to observe and report on the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 national elections]], expressed criticism of the U.S. congressional redistricting process and made a recommendation that the procedures be reviewed to ensure genuine competitiveness of Congressional election contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://osce.org/documents/odihr/2005/03/13658_en.pdf |title=XI |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voting Rights Act of 1965====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
After [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the granting of citizenship and suffrage to freedmen, state legislatures developed new constitutions with provisions to make voter registration and elections more complicated, such as [[poll taxes]], residency requirements, [[literacy tests]] and [[grandfather clause]]s. These were designed for and effectively succeeded in [[disfranchisement after the Civil War|disfranchising]] most African Americans and many poor whites in southern states. In areas where African American and other minorities succeeded in registering, some states created districts that were gerrymandered to reduce the voting impact of minorities.

With the Civil Rights Movement and passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, additional federal enforcement and protections of suffrage for all citizens were enacted. Gerrymandering for the purpose of reducing the political influence of a racial or ethnic minority group was prohibited. Poll taxes for federal elections were prohibited by ratification of the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] in 1964, and a later Supreme Court case struck down poll taxes as a prerequisite for any election. Gerrymandering for political gain has remained possible under the Constitution.
[[Image:NC12 109.gif|thumb|200px|''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[redistricting]] and racial gerrymandering of [[North Carolina's 12th congressional district]] ''(pictured)''.]]
After the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, some states created "majority-minority" districts. This practice, also called "affirmative gerrymandering", was supposed to redress historic discrimination and ensure that ethnic minorities would gain some seats in government. Since the 1990s, however, gerrymandering based solely on racial data has been ruled unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], first in ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' (1993) and subsequently in ''[[Miller v. Johnson]]'' (1995).

The constitutionality of using racial considerations to create districts remains difficult to assess, despite past injustices. In ''[[Hunt v. Cromartie]]'' (1999), the Supreme Court approved a racially focused gerrymandering of a congressional district on the grounds that the definition was not pure racial gerrymandering but instead partisan gerrymandering, which is constitutionally permissible. With the increasing racial polarisation of parties in the South in the U.S. as conservative whites move from the Democratic to the Republican Party, gerrymandering may become partisan and also achieve goals for ethnic representation.

In a few circumstances the use of goal-driven district boundaries may be used for positive social goals. When the state legislature considered representation for [[Arizona]]'s Native American reservations, they thought each needed their own House member, because of historic conflicts between the [[Hopi]] and [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] nations. Since the Hopi reservation is completely surrounded by the Navajo reservation, the legislature created an unusual district configuration which features a fine filament along a river course several hundred miles in length to attach two Navajo regions, [[Arizona's 2nd congressional district]].

The [[California state legislature]] created a [[California's 23rd congressional district|congressional district]] that extends over a narrow coastal strip for several miles. It ensures that a common community of interest will be represented, rather than the coastal areas being dominated by inland concerns.

====Recent steps====
In a [[League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry|decision]] on June 28, 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] upheld most of a Texas congressional map engineered in 2003 by former [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/28/scotus.texasredistrict/index.html | title= High court upholds most of Texas redistricting map | author=AP | publisher=[[CNN]]|date=28 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7–2 decision allows state legislatures to redraw and gerrymander districts as often as they like (not just after the decennial census). Thus they may work to protect their political parties' standing and number of seats, so long as they do not harm racial and ethnic minority groups. A 5–4 majority declared [[Texas's 23rd congressional district|one Congressional district]] unconstitutional in the case because of harm to an ethnic minority.

Rather than allowing more political influence, some states' citizens are considering shifting redistricting authority from politicians and giving it to non-partisan commissions. The states of Washington,&lt;ref&gt;[[Washington State Redistricting Commission]] {{Cite web|url=http://www.redistricting.wa.gov |title=Washington State Redistricting Commission |publisher=Redistricting.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona,&lt;ref&gt;[[Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission]] {{Cite web|url=http://www.azredistricting.org |title=Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission |publisher=Azredistricting.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and California &lt;ref&gt;[[California Proposition 11 (2008)|Proposition 11]], passed in 2008, and [[California Proposition 20 (2010)|Proposition 20]], passed in 2010&lt;/ref&gt; have created [[standing committee]]s for the redistricting following the [[2010 census]]. Rhode Island&lt;ref&gt;[[Rhode Island Reapportionment Commission]] [http://www.riredistricting.org Temporarily Disabled&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;[[New Jersey Redistricting Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; have developed ''[[ad hoc]]'' committees, but developed the past two decennial reapportionments tied to new census data.  Florida's amendments 5 and 6, meanwhile, established rules for the creation of districts but did not mandate an independent commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.palmbeachpost.com/yourvote/ballot_question/florida/2010/amendment-5-and-6-2010/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
In the 2010 Legislative Elections, held on September 26 of that year, a definite example of Gerrymandering was executed, (which had been approved by the single party National Assembly a few months before in an adendum to the Electoral Law). The PSUV (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela), Chavez's single political party, drew 48% of the votes, while the MUD (Mesa de la Unidad Democrática), and the PPT (Partido Patria Para Todos), which in unison oppose Chavez's Regime, drew 52% of the votes. Because of the recent and - by some accounts illegal - Gerrymandering of electoral legislative districts, the PSUV was awarded over 60% of the spots in the National Assembly, (98 Senators); while the MUD and the PPT got only 67. Chavez's regime has held power for more than 11 years in Venezuela, but the recent results from the aforementioned Legislative Election was, according to most experts, a clear sign of discontent among the population. Chavez will have to face a Presidential Election in December 2012.
