'''Equal opportunity''' is a term which has differing definitions and there is no consensus as to the precise meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Rabe, Johan. 2001. Equality, Affirmative Action, and Justice. Books on Demand. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Some use it as a descriptive term for an approach intended to provide a certain [[social environment]] in which people are not excluded from the activities of society, such as [[education]], [[employment]], or [[health care]], on the basis of [[immutable]] traits. Equal opportunity practices include measures taken by organizations to ensure fairness in the employment process.a basic definition of equality is the idea of equal treatment and respect.

In job advertisements and descriptions, the fact that the employer is an equal opportunity employer is sometimes indicated by the abbreviations EOE or MFDV which stands for Male, Female, Disabled, Veteran.
