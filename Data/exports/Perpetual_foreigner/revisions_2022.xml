The '''perpetual foreigner''' [[stereotype]] is a [[Racism|racist]] or [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] form of [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]] in which [[Naturalization |naturalized]] and even [[Jus soli|native-born citizens]] (including families that have lived in a country for generations) are perceived by some members of the majority as foreign because they belong to a minority [[ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[racial group]].&lt;ref&gt;

As argued by Omi (2008), “this image is reflective of the process of racializing people in terms of their presumed affiliation with foreign places” (par. 7). This perpetual foreigner view is demonstrated in a survey by Kang (2001) which showed that 28% of Americans believed that Chinese Americans were more loyal to China than the United States.(...) This example serves to demonstrate that the “perpetual foreigner” stereotype is not just applied to recent Asian immigrant groups but also to fourth-generation Asian immigrants who have gained a certain level of economic success in Canada.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naturalization]] laws vary, and some countries follow a rule of [[Jus sanguinis|''jus sanguinis'']]. Some countries have many refugees or other [[resident alien]]s. A [[diaspora]] such as the [[overseas Chinese]] is often regarded as belonging to their ancestral homeland rather than to the country in which they live.

[[Crimean Tatars]] are an indigenous people of Crimea with clearly established pre-Golden Horde Scythian, Greek, and [[Goths|Goth]] roots, but authorities and nativists long have treated them as perpetual foreigners. When Crimean Tatars [[deportation of the Crimean Tatars|who had been forcibly exiled in the Stalin era]] attempted to return to Crimea before [[perestroika]], they were frequently met with severe hostility by officials who took violent measures to keep them out and had orders to prevent them from returning to their native land.

[[Volga Germans]] had citizenship in the Soviet Union and later in the Russian Federation, but also in Germany under [[jus sanguinis]]. During World War II they were distrusted as foreigners and many were deported to Siberia. After the fall of the Soviet Union many returned to their ancestral homeland, Germany, where they are often seen as Russians.
