The '''perpetual foreigner''' [[stereotype]] is a [[Racism in the United States|racialized]] form of [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[xenophobia]] in which [[Naturalization|naturalized]] and even [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|native-born citizens]] (including families which have lived in the country for generations) are perceived as foreign because they belong to [[minority group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z559DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40|title=Cartographies of Race and Social Difference|last=Dei|first=George J.

In personal interactions, it can take the form of an act of [[microaggression]] in which a member of a minority group may be asked, "Where are you from?", or it can take the form of an explicit act of aggression in which a member of a minority group may be told, "Go back to where you came from".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jyzcuvgTaIMC&amp;pg=PA37|title=Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation|last=Sue|first=Derald Wing|date=2010-02-09|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780470594155|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[African Americans|Black Americans]] are often told "go back to Africa" as a racial insult, despite the fact that on average, they have a longer family history in the United States than [[white Americans]] do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/community-conversations-blog/article232844217.html|title=I was told to ‘Go Back to Africa.’ Here’s why I’m not going anywhere, Mr. Trump|last=Hines|first=Bea L.|date=July 19, 2019|work=Miami Herald|accessdate=21 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] defines workplace comments like "[[Go back where you came from]]" as a potentially illegal form of ethnic harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eeoc-go-back-where-you-came-from-discrimination-federal-law-trump-tweets/|title=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission specifically lists "go back to where you came from" as example of discrimination|last=Silverstein|first=Jason|date=July 17, 2019|work=CBS News|accessdate=19 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The message conveys a sense that the person is "not supposed to be there, or that it isn't their place," and it is often encountered when the minority person is "speaking out in predominantly white spaces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/aoc-trump-tlaib-omar-pressley.html|title=The Painful Roots of Trump’s ‘Go Back’ Comment|last=Rogers|first=Katie|date=July 16, 2019|work=The New York Times|accessdate=17 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crimean Tatars]] are an indigenous people of Crimea and have clearly established pre-Golden Horde Scythian, Greek, and Goth roots, yet authorities and nativists long have treated them as perpetual foreigners. When Crimean Tatars forcibly exiled in the Stalin era attempted to return to Crimea before perestroika, they were frequently met with severe hostility by officials to took violent measures to keep them out, on orders to prevent them from returning to their native land. Meanwhile, Russian publications literally referred to deported Crimean Tatars returning to the places of their birth as foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jbHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|title=Constructing Ethnopolitics in the Soviet Union: Samizdat, Deprivation and the Rise of Ethnic Nationalism|last=Zisserman-Brodsky|first=D.|date=2003|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9781403973627|location=|pages=82-83|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comments.ua/politics/341390-vlasti-krima-schitayut-krimskih.html|title=Власти Крыма считают крымских татар диаспорой|date=2012-05-30|website=Комментарии Украина|language=ru|access-date=2019-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
