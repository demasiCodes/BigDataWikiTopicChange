{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts}}
A '''clan''' is a group of [[people]] united by [[Consanguinity|actual]] or [[Fictive kinship|perceived]] [[kinship]]&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Clan|volume=6|pages=419–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ancestry|descent]]. Even if lineage details are unknown, clan members may be organized around a founding member or [[apical ancestor]]. Clans, in indigenous societies, tend to be [[Exogamy|exogamous]], meaning that their members cannot marry one another. Clans preceded more centralized forms of community organization and government, and exist in every country. Members may identify with a [[coat of arms]] or other symbol to show that they are an independent clan. The kinship-based bonds may also have a symbolic ancestor, whereby the clan shares a "stipulated" common ancestor that is a symbol of the clan's unity. When this "ancestor" is non-human, it is referred to as a [[totem]], which is frequently an animal.

== Etymology ==
The English word "clan" is derived from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] {{lang|gd|clann}}&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; meaning "children", "offspring", "progeny" or "descendants"; it is not from the word for "family" or "clan" in either [[Irish language|Irish]]&lt;ref name="Focloir Dineen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dineen |first=Patrick S. |title=Foclóir Gaeďilge agus Béarla |trans-title=Dictionary of Irish and English |year=1927 |publisher=The Educational Company of Ireland |location=Dublin and Cork, Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Focloir De Bhaldraithe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ó Dónaill |first=Niall |title=Foclóir Gaeilge–Béarla |trans-title=Irish–English Dictionary |year=1992 |publisher=An Gúm |location=Dublin, Ireland |isbn=1-85791-037-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Scottish Gaelic. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word "clan" was introduced into English in around 1425, as a descriptive label for the organization of society in the [[Scottish Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=clan |title=Clan |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the Irish and Scottish Gaelic terms for kinship groups is cognate to English ''clan''; Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|clann}}'' means "descendants":
* ''{{lang|ga|fine}}'' {{IPA-ga|ˈfʲɪnʲə|}} means (English) "clan"
* ''{{lang|ga|teaghlach}}'' means "family" in the sense of the nuclear family, or can include more distant relatives living in the same house
* ''{{lang|ga|líon tí}}'' means either "family" in the sense of "household", or everyone who lives in the house, including non-relatives
* ''{{lang|ga|muintir}}'' means "family" in the broad sense of "kinsfolk"&lt;ref name="Focloir De Bhaldraithe"/&gt;

== Clans as political units ==
In different cultures and situations, a clan usually has different meaning than other kin-based groups, such as [[tribe]]s and [[Band society|bands]]. Often, the distinguishing factor is that a clan is a smaller, integral part of a larger [[society]] such as a [[tribe]], [[chiefdom]], or a [[Sovereign state|state]]. In some societies, clans may have an official leader such as a [[Tribal chief|chief]], [[Matriarchy|matriarch]] or [[patriarch]]; or such leadership role is performed by elders. In others, leadership positions may have to be achieved. 

Examples include [[Irish clans|Irish]], [[Scottish clan|Scottish]], [[Chinese clan|Chinese]], [[Bon-gwan|Korean]], and [[Japanese clans]], which exist as [[kin group]]s within their respective nations. Note, however, that tribes and bands can also be components of larger societies. The early [[Norse clans]], the {{lang|non|ætter}}, are often translated as "house" or "line". The Biblical ''tribes'' of Israel were composed of many clans.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''1&amp;nbsp;Chronicles''&amp;nbsp;4 and ''Numbers''&amp;nbsp;26 in the Old Testament.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab clans]] are sub-tribal groups within Arab society. Native American and [[First Nations]] peoples, often referred to as "tribes", also have clans. For instance, [[Ojibwa]] bands are smaller parts of the [[Ojibwa people]] or tribe in [[North America]]. The many Native American peoples are distinguished by language and culture, and most have clans and bands as the basic kinship organizations. In some cases tribes recognized each other's clans; for instance, both the [[Chickasaw]] and [[Choctaw]] tribes of the Southeast United States had fox and bear clans, who felt a kinship that reached beyond their respective tribes. 

Apart from these different historical traditions of kinship, conceptual confusion arises from colloquial usages of the term. In post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] countries, for example, it is quite common to speak of "clans" in reference to informal networks within the economic and political sphere. This usage reflects the assumption that their members act towards each other in a particularly close and mutually supportive way, approximating the solidarity among kinsmen. Similar usage of the term applies to specific groups of various cultures and nationalities involved in organized [[crime family|crime]]. [[Poland|Polish]] clans differ from most others as they are a collection of [[families]] who bear the same [[coat of arms]], as opposed to claiming a common descent (see [[Polish heraldry]]). There are multiple closely related clans in the [[Indian subcontinent]], especially [[South India]].
