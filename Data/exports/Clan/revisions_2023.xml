{{Anthropology of kinship|concepts}}
A '''clan''' is a group of people united by [[Consanguinity|actual]] or [[Fictive kinship|perceived]] [[kinship]]&lt;ref name="komal EB1911"&gt;
{{cite EB1911|wstitle= Clan|volume=6|pages=419–421}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Ancestry|descent]]. Even if lineage details are unknown, clans may claim descent from founding member or [[apical ancestor]]. Clans, in indigenous societies, were not [[Endogamy|endogamous]], meaning that their members can not marry one another. Clans preceded{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} more centralized forms of community organization and government, and exist in every country.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} Members may identify with a [[coat of arms]] or other symbol. Kinship-based groups may also have a symbolic ancestor, whereby the clan shares a "stipulated" common ancestor who serves as a symbol of the clan's unity.

== Etymology ==
The English word "clan" is derived from old Irish {{lang|gd|clann}}&lt;ref name="komal EB1911" /&gt; meaning "children", "offspring", "progeny" or "descendants"; it is not from the word for "family" or "clan" in either [[Irish language|Irish]]&lt;ref name="Focloir Dineen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dineen |first=Patrick S. |title=Foclóir Gaeďilge agus Béarla |trans-title=Dictionary of Irish and English |year=1927 |publisher=The Educational Company of Ireland |location=Dublin and Cork, Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Focloir De Bhaldraithe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ó Dónaill |first=Niall |title=Foclóir Gaeilge–Béarla |trans-title=Irish–English Dictionary |year=1992 |publisher=An Gúm |location=Dublin, Ireland |isbn=1-85791-037-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Scottish Gaelic. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word "clan" was introduced into English in around 1425, as a descriptive label for the organization of society in Ireland and the [[Scottish Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/clan |title=Clan |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the Irish and Scottish Gaelic terms for kinship groups is cognate to English ''clan''; Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|clann}}'' means "descendants":
* ''{{lang|ga|fine}}'' {{IPA-ga|ˈfʲɪnʲə|}} means (English) "clan"
* ''{{lang|ga|teaghlach}}'' means "family" in the sense of the nuclear family, or can include more distant relatives living in the same house
* ''{{lang|ga|líon tí}}'' means either "family" in the sense of "household", or everyone who lives in the house, including non-relatives
* ''{{lang|ga|muintir}}'' means "family" in the broad sense of "kinsfolk"&lt;ref name="Focloir De Bhaldraithe"/&gt;

== Clans as political units ==
In different cultures and situations, a clan usually has different meaning than other kin-based groups, such as [[tribe]]s and [[Band society|bands]]. Often, the distinguishing factor is that a clan is a smaller, integral part of a larger [[society]] such as a [[tribe]], [[chiefdom]], or a [[Sovereign state|state]]. In some societies, clans may have an official leader such as a [[Tribal chief|chief]], [[Matriarchy|matriarch]] or [[patriarch]]; or such leadership role is performed by elders. In others, leadership positions may have to be achieved.

Examples include [[Irish clans|Irish]], [[Scottish clan|Scottish]], [[Chinese clan|Chinese]], [[Bon-gwan|Korean]], and [[Japanese clans]], which exist as distinct social groupings within their respective nations. Note, however, that tribes and bands can also be components of larger societies. The early [[Norse clans]], the {{lang|non|ætter}}, are often translated as "house" or "line". The Biblical ''tribes'' of Israel were composed of many clans.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''1&amp;nbsp;Chronicles''&amp;nbsp;4 and ''Numbers''&amp;nbsp;26 in the Old Testament.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab clans]] are sub-tribal groups within Arab society. Native American and [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] peoples, often referred to as "tribes", also have clans. For instance, [[Ojibwa]] bands are smaller parts of the [[Ojibwa people]] or tribe in [[North America]]. The many Native American peoples are distinguished by language and culture, and most have clans and bands as the basic kinship organizations. In some cases tribes recognized each other's clans; for instance, both the [[Chickasaw]] and [[Choctaw]] tribes of the Southeast United States had fox and bear clans, who felt a kinship that reached beyond their respective tribes.

Apart from these different historical traditions of kinship, conceptual confusion arises from colloquial usages of the term. In post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] countries, for example, it is quite common to speak of "clans" in reference to informal networks within the economic and political sphere. This usage reflects the assumption that their members act towards each other in a particularly close and mutually supportive way, approximating the solidarity among kinsmen. Similar usage of the term applies to specific groups of various cultures and nationalities involved in organized [[crime family|crime]]. [[Poland|Polish]] clans differ from most others as they are a collection of [[families]] who bear the same [[coat of arms]], as opposed to claiming a common descent (see [[Polish heraldry]]). There are multiple closely related clans in the [[Indian subcontinent]], especially [[South India]].

[[Romani people]] have many clans which are called vitsa in Romani.

=== Scottish Clans ===
Scottish clans are social groupings that have played a pivotal role in the history and culture of Scotland. Unlike some other clans that focus solely on common descent or a shared coat of arms, Scottish clans are unique in their elaborate systems of tartans, insignias, and mottos. Clan culture in Scotland also extends to community events such as clan gatherings and Highland Games. Each clan may have an official leader known as a "Chieftain" or "Chief."

Members of Scottish clans often have a shared interest in preserving their historical and cultural landmarks, as well as the natural environment and wildlife of Scotland. The clan system in Scotland has also been influenced by key historical events like the Highland Clearances and the Jacobite uprisings, which have left lasting impacts on clan structures and Scottish diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clan.com/help/clans-families-crests-insignia|title=The Unique Features and History of Scottish Clans|date=2023-09-29|website=CLAN.com|access-date=2023-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clannism===
'''Clannism''' (in Somali culture, '''qabiilism''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farah|first1=Abdulkadir Osman|title=Transnationalism And Civic Engagement|date=25 October 2012|page=25|isbn=9781912234776|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3goDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=%22qabiilism%22&amp;pg=PA25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a system of society based on clan affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banana|first1=Canaan|title=The church in the struggle for Zimbabwe|date=1996|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Islamic world]], the [[Near East]], [[North Africa|North]] and [[East Africa]] in general, and [[Somali culture]] specifically, is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asuelime|first1=Lucky|title=Selected Themes in African Political Studies: Political Conflict and Stability|url=https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-319-06001-9|date=2014|page=[https://archive.org/details/springer_10.1007-978-3-319-06001-9/page/n19 15]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and traditionally centered on  [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] clans or tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warah|first1=Rasna|title=Selected Themes in African Political Studies: Political Conflict and Stability|date=2014|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
