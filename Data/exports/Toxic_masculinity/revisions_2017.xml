Such "toxic" masculine norms include dominance, devaluation of women, extreme self-reliance, and the suppression of [[emotion]]s.

[[Conformity]] with certain traits viewed as traditionally male, such as [[misogyny]], [[homophobia]], and [[violence]], can be considered "toxic" due to harmful effects on others in society, while related traits, including self-reliance and the stifling of emotions, are correlated with harm to men themselves through psychological problems such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], increased [[stress (psychology)|stress]], and [[substance abuse]]. Other traditionally masculine traits such as devotion to work, pride in excelling at sports, and providing for one's family, are not considered to be toxic.

Toxic masculine norms are characteristic of the unspoken code of behavior among men in [[Incarceration in the United States|American prisons]]. The term ''toxic masculinity'' has also been used by some in the [[mythopoetic men's movement]] in contrast to a "real" or "deep" masculinity that they say men have lost touch with in modern society.

==Overview==
[[File:I Won't Cry Daddy.jpg|thumb|right|From a young age, boys are typically taught to suppress their emotions and act "tough" in order to conform with masculine stereotypes.{{refn|name=Feuer et al}}]]
The concept of ''toxic masculinity'' as used in the [[social sciences]] indicates that traditional American and European society tends to promote a certain set of [[masculine]] behaviors that can be harmful to men, women, and society overall.{{refn|name=Hess}}{{refn|name=Kaplan}} Terry Kupers, a professor at [[The Wright Institute]] school of psychology, defines toxic masculinity as "the constellation of socially regressive male traits that serve to foster domination, the devaluation of women, homophobia and wanton violence".{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}{{refn|name=Kupers 2010}} The concept of toxic masculinity is not intended to demonize men or male attributes, but rather to emphasize the harmful effects of [[conformity]] to certain traditional masculine ideal behaviors such as dominance, self-reliance, and [[competition]].{{refn|name=Hess}}{{refn|name=Kaplan}}

According to Kupers, the term ''toxic masculinity'' serves to outline aspects of [[hegemonic masculinity]] that are socially destructive, "such as misogyny, homophobia, greed, and violent domination". Kupers states that other aspects of hegemonic masculinity such as "pride in [one's] ability to win at sports, to maintain solidarity with a friend, to succeed at work, or to provide for [one's] family",  are not part of the concept of toxic masculinity.{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}

According to the psychologist [[Ronald F. Levant]], the [[socialization]] of boys into gender roles idealizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of [[emotion]] can begin as early as infancy. Such norms are transmitted by parents, other male relatives, and members of the community. Many media representations of masculinity on websites such as [[YouTube]] promote similar stereotypical "[[alpha-male]]" gender roles.{{refn|name=Weir}} 

[[Bullying]] of boys by their peers and [[domestic violence]] experienced by boys at home can also be expressions of toxic masculinity, which creates [[hierarchies]] that benefit some males and harm others.{{refn|name=Keith}} 

In American [[prison]]s, toxic masculinity is reflected in the behavior of both male staff and inmates. The qualities of extreme self-reliance, domination of other men through violence, and avoiding the appearance of either [[femininity]] or weakness, become necessary [[coping skills]] and comprise an unspoken code among prisoners.{{refn|name=Kupers 2004}}{{refn|name=Kupers 2007}} The conditions of prison life, defined by harsh [[punishment]], suppression of emotions, social isolation, and aggression, likely play a role in [[suicide]] among male prisoners.{{refn|name=Kupers 2004}}{{refn|name=Mankowski &amp; Smith}}

==Health effects==

Men who adhere to traditionally masculine cultural norms, such as risk-taking, [[violence]], dominance, primacy of work, disdain for [[homosexuality]], need for emotional control, desire to win, and pursuit of [[social status]], tend to be more likely to experience psychological problems such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[stress (psychology)|stress]], [[body image]] problems, [[substance abuse]], and poor social functioning.{{refn|name=Wong et al.}} The effect tends to be stronger in men who also emphasize "toxic" masculine norms, such as self-reliance, seeking power over women, and sexual promiscuity or "playboy" behavior.{{refn|name=Kaplan}}{{refn|name=Panko}}

The social value of self-reliance has diminished over time as modern society has moved more toward interdependence.{{refn|name=Weir}} Both self-reliance and the stifling of emotional expression can work against [[mental health]], as they make it less likely for men to seek psychological help or to possess the ability to deal with difficult emotions.{{refn|name=Weir}} Preliminary research suggests that cultural pressure for men to be stoic and self-reliant may also shorten men's lifespans by causing them to be less likely to discuss health problems with their physicians.{{refn|name=Horowitz}}{{refn|name=Ellis}}

Toxic masculinity is also implicated in socially-created [[public health]] problems, such as elevated rates of [[skin cancer]] among men,{{refn|name=Nicholas}}{{Verify source|date=May 2017}} and the role of “trophy-hunting” sexual behavior in rates of transmission of [[HIV]] and other [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Muparamoto |first=Nelson |date=December 2012 |title=‘Trophy-hunting scripts’ among male university students in Zimbabwe |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nelson_Muparamoto/publication/234057289_%27Trophy-hunting_scripts%27_among_male_universitystudents_in_Zimbabwe/links/0fcfd511b8da31f16f000000/Trophy-hunting-scripts-among-male-university-students-in-Zimbabwe.pdf |journal=African Journal of AIDS Research |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=319–326 |doi=10.2989/16085906.2012.754831 |issn=1608-5906 |pmid=25860190}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=June 2017}}

==Men's movements==

Some authors associated with the [[mythopoetic men's movement]] have used the term ''toxic masculinity'' to contrast societal expectations that men be violent, competitive, independent, and unfeeling with a "real" or "deep" masculinity that they say men have lost touch with in modern society.{{refn|name=Ferber}}{{refn|name=Longwood}} [[Shepherd Bliss]] proposed a return to [[agrarianism]] as an alternative to the "potentially toxic masculinity" of the warrior ethic.{{refn|name=Hartman}}

Psychiatrist [[Frank Pittman]] wrote about the ways in which men are harmed by traditional masculine norms, including through shorter lifespans and greater incidence of violent death and ailments such as [[lung cancer]] and [[cirrhosis]] of the liver. He suggested in 1993 that such toxic masculinity originates in men being raised by women in the absence of male role models. Feminist author [[John Stoltenberg]], on the other hand, approached toxic masculinity from an [[antimasculinist]] perspective.{{refn|name=Dowd}}
