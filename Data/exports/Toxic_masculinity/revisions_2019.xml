The concept of '''toxic masculinity''' is used in [[psychology]] and media discussions of [[masculinity]] to refer to certain cultural norms that are associated with harm to society and to [[men]] themselves. Traditional stereotypes of men as socially dominant, along with related traits such as [[misogyny]] and [[homophobia]], can be considered "toxic" due in part to their promotion of violence, including [[sexual assault]] and [[domestic violence]]. The socialization of boys often normalizes violence, such as in the saying "boys will be boys" with regard to [[bullying]] and aggression.

Self-reliance and [[emotion]]al repression are correlated with increased psychological problems in men such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], increased [[stress (psychology)|stress]], and [[substance abuse]]. Toxic masculine traits are characteristic of the unspoken code of behavior among men in [[Incarceration in the United States|American prisons]], where they exist in part as a response to the harsh conditions of prison life.

Other traditionally masculine traits such as devotion to work, pride in excelling at sports, and providing for one's family, are not considered to be "toxic". The concept was originally used by authors associated with the [[mythopoetic men's movement]] such as [[Shepherd Bliss]] to contrast stereotypical notions of masculinity with a "real" or "deep" masculinity that they say men have lost touch with in modern society.

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''toxic masculinity'' originated in the [[mythopoetic men's movement]] of the 1980s and 1990s.{{refn|name=Salter}} It later found wide use in both academic and popular writing.{{refn|name=Ging}} Popular and media discussions in the 2010s have used the term to refer to traditional and stereotypical norms of [[masculinity]] and manhood. According to the sociologist [[Michael Flood]], these include "expectations that boys and men must be active, aggressive, tough, daring, and dominant".{{refn|name=Flood}}

==Psychology and gender roles==
[[File:I Won't Cry Daddy.jpg|thumb|right|According to [[social learning theory]], teaching boys to suppress vulnerable emotions, as in the saying "big boys don't cry", is a significant part of gender socialization in Western society.{{refn|name=Levant 1996}}{{refn|name=Lindsey}}]]

In [[psychology]], ''toxic masculinity'' refers to traditional cultural [[masculine]] norms that can be harmful to men, women, and society overall; this concept of toxic masculinity is not intended to demonize men or male attributes, but rather to emphasize the harmful effects of [[conformity]] to certain traditional masculine ideal behaviors such as dominance, self-reliance, and [[competition]].{{refn|name=Hess, Peter}}{{refn|name=Kaplan}} Toxic masculinity is thus defined by adherence to traditional male [[gender role]]s that restrict the kinds of [[emotion]]s allowable for boys and men to express, including social expectations that men seek to be dominant (the "[[alpha male]]") and limit their emotional range primarily to expressions of [[anger]].{{refn|name=Liu 2016}} Some traditionally prescribed masculine behaviors can produce such harmful effects as violence (including [[sexual assault]] and [[domestic violence]]), promiscuity, risky and/or socially irresponsible behaviors including [[substance abuse]], and dysfunction in relationships.{{refn|name=Levant 1996}}{{refn|name=Liu &amp; Shepard}}

In a [[gender studies]] context, [[Raewyn Connell]] refers to toxic practices that may arise out of what she terms [[hegemonic masculinity]], rather than essential traits.{{refn|name=Ging}} Connell argues that such practices, such as physical violence, may serve to reinforce men's dominance over women in Western societies. She stresses that such practices are a salient feature of hegemonic masculinity, although not always the defining features.{{refn|name=Ging}}{{refn|name=Connell &amp; Messerschmidt 2005}}

In a [[psychoanalytic]] context, Terry Kupers describes toxic masculinity as "the need to aggressively compete and dominate others"&lt;ref&gt;Kupers, quoted in {{harvp|Ging|2017|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as "the constellation of socially regressive male traits that serve to foster domination, the devaluation of women, homophobia and wanton violence".{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}{{refn|name=Kupers 2010}}  According to Kupers, toxic masculinity serves to outline aspects of hegemonic masculinity that are socially destructive, "such as misogyny, homophobia, greed, and violent domination". He contrasts these traits with more positive aspects of hegemonic masculinity such as "pride in [one's] ability to win at sports, to maintain solidarity with a friend, to succeed at work, or to provide for [one's] family".{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}

According to Kupers, toxic masculine norms are a feature of life for men in American [[prison]]s, where they are reflected in the behavior of both staff and inmates. The qualities of extreme self-reliance, domination of other men through violence, and avoiding the appearance of either [[femininity]] or weakness, comprise an unspoken code among prisoners.{{refn|name=Kupers 2004}}{{refn|name=Kupers 2007}} Suppressing vulnerable emotions is often adopted in order to successfully cope with the harsh conditions of prison life, defined by [[punishment]], social isolation, and aggression. These factors likely play a role in [[Prisoner suicide|suicide among male prisoners]].{{refn|name=Kupers 2004}}{{refn|name=Mankowski &amp; Smith}}

Toxic masculinity can also take the form of [[bullying]] of boys by their peers and [[domestic violence]] directed toward boys at home.{{refn|name=Keith}} The often violent [[socialization]] of boys produces [[psychological trauma]] through the promotion of aggression and lack of interpersonal connection. Such trauma is often disregarded, such as in the saying "boys will be boys" with regard to bullying.{{refn|name=Liu 2017}} The promotion of idealized masculine roles emphasizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of emotion can begin as early as infancy. Such norms are transmitted by parents, other male relatives, and members of the community.{{refn|name=Levant 1996}}{{refn|name=Weir}} Media representations of masculinity on websites such as [[YouTube]] often promote similar stereotypical gender roles.{{refn|name=Weir}}

Feminist author [[John Stoltenberg]] has argued that all traditional notions of masculinity are toxic and ultimately reinforce the oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Wilbert L. |title=All Masculinity Is Toxic |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmk3ej/all-masculinity-is-toxic |website=Vice |accessdate=12 April 2019 |date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|name=Dowd}}

==Health effects==
The [[American Psychological Association]] has warned that "traditional masculinity ideology" is associated with negative effects on mental and physical health.{{refn|name=Salam}}{{refn|name=Fortin}} Men who adhere to traditionally masculine cultural norms, such as risk-taking, [[violence]], dominance, primacy of work, need for emotional control, desire to win, and pursuit of [[social status]], tend to be more likely to experience psychological problems such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[stress (psychology)|stress]], [[body image]] problems, [[substance abuse]], and poor social functioning.{{refn|name=Wong et al.}} The effect tends to be stronger in men who also emphasize "toxic" masculine norms, such as self-reliance, seeking power over women, and sexual promiscuity or "playboy"{{clarify|date=July 2018}} behavior.{{refn|name=Kaplan}}{{refn|name=Panko}}

The social value of self-reliance has diminished over time as modern American society has moved more toward interdependence.{{refn|name=Weir}} Both self-reliance and the stifling of emotional expression can work against [[mental health]], as they make it less likely for men to seek psychological help or to possess the ability to deal with difficult emotions.{{refn|name=Weir}} Preliminary research suggests that cultural pressure for men to be stoic and self-reliant may also shorten men's lifespans by causing them to be less likely to discuss health problems with their physicians.{{refn|name=Horowitz}}{{refn|name=Ellis}}

Toxic masculinity is also implicated in socially-created [[public health]] problems, such as elevated rates of [[skin cancer]] among men,{{refn|name=Nicholas}}{{Verify source|date=May 2017}} and the role of “trophy-hunting” sexual behavior in rates of transmission of [[HIV]] and other [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Muparamoto |first=Nelson |date=December 2012 |title=‘Trophy-hunting scripts’ among male university students in Zimbabwe |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nelson_Muparamoto/publication/234057289_%27Trophy-hunting_scripts%27_among_male_universitystudents_in_Zimbabwe/links/0fcfd511b8da31f16f000000/Trophy-hunting-scripts-among-male-university-students-in-Zimbabwe.pdf |journal=African Journal of AIDS Research |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=319–326 |doi=10.2989/16085906.2012.754831 |issn=1608-5906 |pmid=25860190}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=June 2017}}

Psychiatrist [[Frank Pittman]] wrote about the ways in which men are harmed by traditional masculine norms, suggesting this includes shorter lifespans, greater incidence of violent death, and ailments such as [[lung cancer]] and [[cirrhosis]] of the liver.{{refn|name=Dowd}}

==Men's movements==
Some authors associated with the [[mythopoetic men's movement]] have referred to the social pressures placed upon men to be violent, competitive, independent, and unfeeling as a "toxic" form of masculinity, in contrast to a "real" or "deep" masculinity that they say men have lost touch with in modern society.{{refn|name=Ferber}}{{refn|name=Longwood}} The academic [[Shepherd Bliss]] proposed a return to [[agrarianism]] as an alternative to the "potentially toxic masculinity" of the warrior ethic.{{refn|name=Hartman}} Sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] writes that Bliss's notion of toxic masculinity can be seen as part of the mythopoetic movement's response to male feelings of powerlessness at a time when the [[feminist movement]] was challenging traditional male authority:

{{quote|Thus Shepherd Bliss, for example, rails against what he calls 'toxic masculinity'{{emdash}}which he believes is responsible for most of the evil in the world{{emdash}}and proclaims the unheralded goodness of the men who fight the fires and till the soil and nurture their families.{{refn|name=Kimmel}}}}
