'''Victim blaming''' occurs when the victim of a [[crime]] or any wrongful act are held entirely or partially responsible for the harm that befell them.

People familiar with [[victimology]] are much less likely to see the victim as responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0886260511403752 |title=Is Knowledge Power?

L. |journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a greater tendency to blame victims of rape than victims of robbery in cases where victims and perpetrators know one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1785–97 |doi=10.1177/0886260510372945 |title=Blaming the Victim and Exonerating the Perpetrator in Cases of Rape and Robbery: Is There a Double Standard? |year=2010 |last1=Bieneck |first1=S. |last2=Krahe |first2=B. |journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence |volume=26 |issue=9 |pmid=20587449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coining of the phrase; Racism==
[[William Ryan (psychologist)|William Ryan]] coined the phrase "blaming the victim" in his 1971 book ''Blaming the Victim''.&lt;ref&gt;ISBN 9780394417264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole07"&gt;Cole (2007) pp.111, 149, 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dows98p24"&gt;Downs (1998) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick87p219"&gt;Kirkpatrick (1987) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent03"&gt;Kent (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Ryan described victim blaming as an [[ideology]] used to justify [[racism]] and [[social injustice]] against [[African American|black people]] [[Racism in the United States|in the United States]].&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick87p219"/&gt; Ryan wrote the book to refute [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]]'s 1965 work ''The [[Negro]] Family: The Case for National Action'' (usually simply referred to as the [[Moynihan Report]]).

Moynihan had concluded that three centuries of horrible treatment at the hands of whites, and in particular the uniquely cruel structure of [[American slavery]] as opposed to its Latin American counterparts, had created a long series of chaotic disruptions within the black family structure which, at the time of the report, manifested itself in high rates of unwed births, absent fathers, and [[single mother household]]s in black families. Moynihan then correlated these familial outcomes, which he considered undesirable, to the relatively poorer rates of employment, educational achievement, and financial success found among the black population.  Moynihan advocated the implementation of government programs designed to strengthen the black [[nuclear family]].

Ryan objected that Moynihan then located the [[proximate cause]] of the plight of black Americans in the prevalence of a family structure in which the father was often sporadically, if at all, present, and the mother was often dependent on government aid to feed, clothe, and provide medical care for her children. Ryan's critique cast the Moynihan theories as attempts to divert responsibility for poverty from [[Social class in the United States|social structural]] factors to the behaviors and cultural patterns of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lilt.ilstu.edu/gmklass/pos334/archive/ryan.htm Illinois state U. archives].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ryan, William |title=Blaming the Victim |publisher=Vintage |year=1976 |isbn=0-394-72226-4 }}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The phrase "blaming the victim" was quickly adopted by advocates for crime victims, in particular rape victims accused of abetting their victimization (see [[Victimology]]), although this usage is conceptually distinct from the sociological critique developed by Ryan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==History==
Although Ryan popularized the phrase, the phenomenon of victim blaming is well established in human psychology and history;&lt;ref name="Robinson02p141"/&gt; for instance there are plenty of examples in the [[Old Testament]] in which tragedies and catastrophes are justified and blamed on the victims for their faults as sinners.&lt;ref name="Robinson02p141"&gt;Robinson (2002) p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 [[Theodor W. Adorno]] defined what would be later called "blaming the victim," as "one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character".&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, TW (1947) ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'' in ''[[Kenyon Review]]'' Vol.ix (1), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
James Martin Harding (1997) [http://books.google.com/books?id=OT8yfsEUcw8C&amp;pg=PA143 ''Adorno and "A writing of the ruins": essays on modern aesthetics and Anglo-American literature and culture''], p.143 quotation: "The mechanisms of this ideological affinity between Baraka and Wagner can be seen in a short critique of Wagner that Adorno wrote directly after the Second World War—at a time when Adorno was perhaps his most direct in singling out the proto-fascist tendencies in Wagner's corpus and character. Adorno criticizes Wagner's having bated his conductor Herman Levi so that he would seem to bear the responsibility for Wagner's subsequent insulting dismissal of him. This, for Adorno, is a classic example of blaming the victim. The anti-Semitic sub-text to the dismissal, viz., that as a Jew Levi supposedly desired and brought the dismissal upon himself, "bears witness to the existence of one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character even in Wagner's time: the paranoid tendency of projecting upon others one's own violent aggressiveness and then indicting, on the basis of this projection, those whom one endows with pernicious qualities" (Adorno "Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler" 158)."
&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly thereafter Adorno and three other professors at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] formulated their influential and highly debated ''[[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]]'' (F for fascist), published in ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950), which included among the [[fascist]] traits of the scale the "contempt for everything discriminated against or weak."&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=X3L5R3kiOh4C&amp;pg=PA63 Adorno and the political] By Espen Hammer p.63&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical expression of victim blaming is the "asking for it" idiom, e.g. "she was asking for it" said of a victim of violence or sexual assault.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicky Ali Jackson|title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OcDBZ0uNNVIC&amp;pg=PA715|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=22 February 2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-94221-5|pages=715–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposing views===
[[Roy Baumeister]], a social and personality psychologist, argued that blaming the victim is not necessarily always fallacious. He argued that showing the victim's possible role in an altercation may be contrary to typical explanations of violence and cruelty, which incorporate the trope of the innocent victim. According to Baumeister, in the classic telling of "the myth of pure evil," the innocent, well-meaning victims are going about their business when they are suddenly assaulted by wicked, malicious evildoers. Baumeister describes the situation as a possible distortion by both the perpetrator and the victim; the perpetrator may minimize the offense while the victim maximizes it, and so accounts of the incident shouldn't be immediately taken as objective truths.

In context, Baumeister refers to the common behavior of the aggressor seeing themselves as more of the "victim" than the abused, justifying a horrific act by way of their "moral complexity". This usually stems from an "excessive sensitivity" to insults, which he finds as a consistent pattern in abusive husbands. Essentially, the abuse the perpetrator administers is generally excessive, in comparison to the act/acts that they claim as to have provoked them. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumeister|first=Roy|title=Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty|year=1999|publisher=Holt|isbn=0-8050-7165-2}}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary victimization of sexual assault victims==
A rape victim is especially [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] in cultures with strong customs and [[taboo]]s regarding sex and sexuality. For example, society may view a rape victim (especially one who was previously a [[virgin]]) as "damaged". Victims in these cultures may suffer [[solitude|isolation]], be disowned by friends and family, be prohibited from marrying, be divorced if already married, or even killed. This phenomenon is known as secondary victimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svfreenyc.org/survivors_factsheet_49.html#6 |title=Factsheets: Trauma of Victimization – Secondary Injuries |publisher=Svfreenyc.org |date=21 August 2012 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary victimization is the re-[[Psychological trauma|traumatization]] of the [[sexual assault]], [[abuse]], or [[rape]] victim through the responses of individuals and institutions. Types of secondary victimization include victim blaming and inappropriate post-assault behavior or language by medical personnel or other organizations with which the victim has contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|10606433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary victimization is especially common in cases of [[date rape drug|drug-facilitated]], [[date rape|acquaintance]], [[military sexual trauma]] and [[statutory rape]].

==Rape shield laws==
{{main|Rape shield law}}
In the United States and Canada, rape is unique in that it is the only crime in which there are statutory protections designed in favor of the accuser. These were enacted in response to the common defense tactic of "putting the accuser on trial". Typical rape shield laws prohibit cross-examination of the accuser (alleged victim) with respect to certain issues, such as her or his prior sexual history, or the manner in which she or he was dressed at the time of the rape. Most states and the federal rules, however, provide exceptions to the rape shield law where evidence of prior sexual history is used to provide an alternative explanation for physical evidence, where the defendant and the alleged victim had a prior consensual sexual relationship, and where exclusion of evidence would violate the defendant's constitutional rights.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Examples==
In 2005, Australian Muslim preacher [[Feiz Mohammad]] gave a speech in Australia that was covered in Europe and the U.S. {{cn|date=May 2013}} in which he blamed women themselves for being rape victims.&lt;ref name="theaustralian1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/aussie-cleric-feiz-mohammad-calls-for-beheading-of-dutch-mp-geert-wilders/story-fn3dxity-1225914033334 |title=Aussie cleric Feiz Mohammad calls for beheading of Dutch MP Geert Wilders |publisher=The Australian |date= 3 September 2010|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sify.com/news/oz-muslim-leaders-criticise-islamic-cleric-s-call-for-beheading-dutch-politician-news-others-kjgp4gfddgg.html |author= |title=Oz Muslim leaders criticise Islamic cleric's 'call for beheading' Dutch politician |publisher=Sify.com |date=6 September 2010 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He said:  "A victim of rape every minute somewhere in the world. Why? No one to blame but herself. She displayed her beauty to the entire world... Strapless, backless, sleeveless, showing their legs, nothing but satanic skirts, slit skirts, translucent blouses, miniskirts, tight jeans: all this to tease man and appeal to his carnal nature.&lt;ref name=women&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Muslim-cleric-women-incite-mens-lust-with-satanic-dress/2005/04/23/1114152362381.html "Muslim cleric: women incite men's lust with 'satanic dress'"], by Miranda Devine, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 24 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/10/28/1161749357803.html |title=How a vile sermon of ignorance has done Australia a big favour |author=Miranda Devine |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date= |accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case that became famous in 2011, an 11-year-old rape victim who suffered repeated gang rapes in Cleveland, Texas, was accused by the defense attorney of being a seductress who lured men to their doom.&lt;ref name="slate1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams |first=Sam |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/11/29/cleveland_texas_rape_case_defense_attorney_calls_pre_teen_victim_a_spider.html |title=Cleveland, Texas rape case: Defense attorney calls pre-teen victim a spider, but that's his job |publisher=Slate |date=29 November 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Like the spider and the fly. Wasn't she saying, 'Come into my parlor, said the spider to the fly?' ", he asked a witness.&lt;ref name="slate1"/&gt; The ''New York Times'' ran an article uncritically reporting on the way many in the community blamed the victim, for which the newspaper later apologized.&lt;ref name="slate1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlla/ny-times-defends-victim-blaming-coverage-of-child-rape-case_b24236 |author= |title=NY Times Defends Victim Blaming Coverage of Child Rape Case |publisher=Mediabistro.com |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case that attracted worldwide coverage, when [[2012 Delhi gang rape case|a woman was raped and killed in India in December 2012]], some Indian government officials and political leaders blamed the victim for her outfit and being out late at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/01/04/amid-rape-fiasco-indias-leaders-keep-up-insensitive-remarks/ |author= |title=Amid rape fiasco, India’s leaders keep up insensitive remarks |publisher=Washington Post |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
