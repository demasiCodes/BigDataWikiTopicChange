'''Victim blaming''' occurs when the victim(s) of a [[crime]], an [[accident]], or any type of [[abusive]] maltreatment are held entirely or partially responsible for the transgressions committed against them. Blaming the victim has traditionally emerged especially in [[Racism|racist]] and [[Sexism|sexist]] forms.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Meyerson and Michael Joseph Roberto ''[http://richgibson.com/fascismcrisis.htm Fascism and the Crisis of Pax Americana]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, this attitude may exist independently from these radical views and even be at least half-official in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=379–84 |doi=10.2471/BLT.10.083972 |title=Strengthening of local vital events registration: lessons learnt from a voluntary sector initiative in a district in southern India |year=2011 |last1=Mony |first1=Prem |last2=Sankar |first2=Kiruba |last3=Thomas |first3=Tinku |last4=Vaz |first4=Mario |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization |volume=89 |issue=5 |pmid=21556306 |pmc=3089385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People familiar with [[victimology]] are much less likely to see the victim as responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0886260511403752 |title=Is Knowledge Power?

== History and concept ==

[[William Ryan]] coined the phrase "blaming the victim" in his 1971 book ''Blaming the Victim'' (ISBN 9780394417264).&lt;ref name="Cole07"&gt;Cole (2007) pp.111, 149, 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dows98p24"&gt;Downs (1998) p.24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick87p219"&gt;Kirkpatrick (1987) p.219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent03"&gt;Kent (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, Ryan describes victim blaming as an [[ideology]] used to justify [[racism]] and [[social injustice]] against [[African American|black people]] [[Racism in the United States|in the United States]].&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick87p219"/&gt; Ryan wrote this book to refute [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]]'s 1965 work ''The [[Negro]] Family:  The Case for National Action'' (usually simply referred to as the [[Moynihan Report]]). Moynihan concluded that three centuries of horrible treatment at the hands of whites, and in particular the uniquely cruel structure of American slavery as opposed to its Latin American counterparts, had created a long series of chaotic disruptions within the black family structure which, at the time of the report, manifested itself in high rates of unwed births, absent fathers, and single-mother households in black families. Moynihan then correlated these familial outcomes, which he considered undesirable, to the relatively poorer rates of unemployment, educational achievement, and financial success found among the black population.

Ryan objected that Moynihan then located the proximate cause of the plight of black Americans in the prevalence of a family structure in which the father was often sporadically, if at all, present, and the mother was often dependent on government aid to feed, clothe, and provide medical care for her children. Moynihan advocated the implementation of government programs designed to strengthen the black nuclear family. Ryan's critique cast the Moynihan theories as attempts to divert responsibility for poverty from [[Social structure of the United States|social structural]] factors to the behaviors and cultural patterns of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lilt.ilstu.edu/gmklass/pos334/archive/ryan.htm Illinois state U. archives].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ryan, William |title=Blaming the Victim |publisher=Vintage |year=1976 |isbn=0-394-72226-4 }}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase was quickly adopted by advocates for crime victims, in particular rape victims accused of abetting their victimization, although this usage is conceptually distinct from the sociological critique developed by Ryan. Although Ryan popularized the phrase, the phenomenon of victim blaming is a well established in human psychology and history;&lt;ref name="Robinson02p141"/&gt; for instance there are plenty of examples in the Christian and Ebraic [[Old Testament]], in which tragedies and catastrophes are justified and blamed on the victims for their faults as sinners.&lt;ref name="Robinson02p141"&gt;Robinson (2002) p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 [[Theodor Adorno]] defined what would be later called "blaming the victim," as "one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character".&lt;ref&gt;
Adorno, TW (1947) ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'' in ''Kenyan Review'' Vol.ix (1), p. 158
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
James Martin Harding (1997) [http://books.google.com/books?id=OT8yfsEUcw8C&amp;pg=PA143 ''Adorno and "A writing of the ruins": essays on modern aesthetics and Anglo-American literature and culture''], p.143 quotation: {{quotation|The mechanisms of this ideological affinity between Baraka and Wagner can be seen in a short critique of Wagner that Adorno wrote directly after the Second World War--at a time when Adorno was perhaps his most direct in singling out the proto-fascist tendencies in Wagner's corpus and character. Adorno criticizes Wagner's having bated his conductor Herman Levi so that he would seem to bear the responsibility for Wagner's subsequent insulting dismissal of him. This, for Adorno, is a classic example of blaming the victim. The anti-Semitic sub-text to the dismissal, viz., that as a Jew Levi supposedly desired and brought the dismissal upon himself, "bears witness to the existence of one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character even in Wagner's time: the paranoid tendency of projecting upon others one's own violent aggressiveness and then indicting, on the basis of this projection, those whom one endows with pernicious qualities" (Adorno "Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler" 158).}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly after Adorno and others at the Berkley research group formulated their influential and highly debated ''[[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]]'' (F for fascist), published in ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950), which included among the [[fascist]] traits of the scale the "contempt for everything discriminated against or weak."&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=X3L5R3kiOh4C&amp;pg=PA63 Adorno and the political] By Espen Hammer p.63&lt;/ref&gt; After Adorno, also other authors, like professor [[Kriss Ravetto]], have described victim blaming as a characteristic fascist trait.&lt;ref&gt;Kriss Ravetto (2001) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=pOyPsK8yClsC The unmaking of fascist aesthetics]'' (Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 2001), ISBN 13: 978-0-8166-3743-0{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical infamous expression of victim blaming is the "asking for it" idiom, used in phrases like "a raped woman in a short skirt was asking for it."

===Baumeister's argument===
[[Roy Baumeister]], a social and personality psychologist, argues that blaming the victim is not necessarily fallacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumeister|first=Roy|title=Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty|year=1999|publisher=Holt|isbn=0805071652}}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that showing the victim's responsibility can be insightful contrary to typical explanations of violence and cruelty, which incorporate the trope of the innocent victim. According to Baumeister, in the classic telling of "the myth of pure evil," the innocent, well-meaning victims are going about their business when they are suddenly assaulted by wicked, malicious evildoers. In actuality, the situation is more complicated and it is mostly—though not always—the case that the victim has done something to provoke the ire of the "evildoer" ([[Just-world phenomenon]]) or to aid the offender's actions, although the subsequent actions may outweigh the scale of the "victim's" initial offense.

==Secondary victimization==
A rape victim is especially stigmatizing in cultures with strong customs and [[taboos]] regarding sex and sexuality. For example, society may view a rape victim (especially one who was previously a [[virgin]]) as "damaged". Victims in these cultures may suffer [[solitude|isolation]], be disowned by friends and family, be prohibited from marrying, be divorced if already married, or even killed. This phenomenon is known as secondary victimization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svfreenyc.org/survivors_factsheet_49.html#6 Factsheets: Trauma of Victimization - Secondary Injuries]&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondary victimization is the re-traumatization of the [[sexual assault]], [[abuse]], or [[rape]] victim through the responses of individuals and institutions. Types of secondary victimization include victim blaming and inappropriate post-assault behavior or language by medical personnel or other organizations with which the victim has contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|10606433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary victimization is especially common in cases of [[date rape drug|drug-facilitated]], [[date rape|acquaintance]], [[military sexual trauma]] and [[statutory rape]].

==Rape shield laws==
{{main|Rape shield law}}
In the United States and Canada, rape is unique in that it is the only crime in which there are statutory protections designed in favor of the accuser. These were enacted in response to the common defense tactic of "putting the accuser on trial". Typical rape shield laws prohibit cross-examination of the accuser (alleged victim) with respect to certain issues, such as his or her prior sexual history, or the manner in which he or she was dressed at the time of the rape. Most states and the federal rules, however, provide exceptions to the rape shield law where evidence of prior sexual history is used to provide an alternative explanation for physical evidence, where the defendant and the alleged victim had a prior consensual sexual relationship, and where exclusion of evidence would violate the defendant's constitutional rights.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

== Just-world hypothesis ==
{{Main|Just-world hypothesis}}
The just world hypothesis describes the phenomenon that people believe that the world is one in which actions have appropriate and predictable consequences. This phenomenon has been widely studied by social psychologists since [[Melvin J. Lerner]] conducted seminal work on the belief in a just world in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="An Overview"&gt;Lerner, M.J. &amp; Montada, L. (1998). An Overview: Advances in Belief in a Just World Theory and Methods, in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World'' (1-7). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Much psychological research on this has focused on victim blaming and derogation.
