'''Victim blaming''' occurs when the victim of a [[crime]] or any wrongful act is held entirely or partially responsible for the harm that befell them.&lt;ref&gt;http://crcvc.ca/docs/victim_blaming.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The study of [[victimology]] seeks to mitigate the perception of victims as responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0886260511403752 |title=Is Knowledge Power?

==Coining of the phrase; racism==
William Ryan coined the phrase "blaming the victim" in his 1971 book ''Blaming the Victim''.&lt;ref&gt;ISBN 9780394417264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole07"&gt;Cole (2007) pp.111, 149, 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dows98p24"&gt;Downs (1998) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick87p219"&gt;Kirkpatrick (1987) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent03"&gt;Kent (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Ryan described victim blaming as an [[ideology]] used to justify [[racism]] and [[social injustice]] against [[African American|black people]] [[Racism in the United States|in the United States]].&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick87p219"/&gt; Ryan wrote the book to refute [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]]'s 1965 work ''The [[Negro]] Family: The Case for National Action'' (usually simply referred to as the [[Moynihan Report]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Lu0G3TaZ4KoJ:www.blackpast.org/primary/moynihan-report-1965+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&lt;/ref&gt;

Moynihan had concluded that three centuries of horrible treatment at the hands of whites, and in particular the uniquely cruel structure of [[American slavery]] as opposed to its Latin American counterparts, had created a long series of chaotic disruptions within the black family structure which, at the time of the report, manifested itself in high rates of unwed births, absent fathers, and [[single mother household]]s in black families. Moynihan then correlated these familial outcomes, which he considered undesirable, to the relatively poorer rates of employment, educational achievement, and financial success found among the black population.  Moynihan advocated the implementation of government programs designed to strengthen the black [[nuclear family]].{{citation needed|date = August 2014}}

Ryan objected that Moynihan then located the [[proximate cause]] of the plight of black Americans in the prevalence of a family structure in which the father was often sporadically, if at all, present, and the mother was often dependent on government aid to feed, clothe, and provide medical care for her children. Ryan's critique cast the Moynihan theories as attempts to divert responsibility for poverty from [[Social class in the United States|social structural]] factors to the behaviors and cultural patterns of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lilt.ilstu.edu/gmklass/pos334/archive/ryan.htm Illinois state U. archives].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ryan, William |title=Blaming the Victim |publisher=Vintage |year=1976 |isbn=0-394-72226-4 }}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although Ryan popularized the phrase, other scholars had identified the phenomenon of victim blaming.&lt;ref name="Robinson02p141"&gt;Robinson (2002) p.141&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1947 [[Theodor W. Adorno]] defined what would be later called "blaming the victim," as "one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character".&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, TW (1947) ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'' in ''[[Kenyon Review]]'' Vol.ix (1), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
James Martin Harding (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OT8yfsEUcw8C&amp;pg=PA143 ''Adorno and "A writing of the ruins": essays on modern aesthetics and Anglo-American literature and culture''], p.143 quotation: "The mechanisms of this ideological affinity between Baraka and Wagner can be seen in a short critique of Wagner that Adorno wrote directly after the Second World War—at a time when Adorno was perhaps his most direct in singling out the proto-fascist tendencies in Wagner's corpus and character. Adorno criticizes Wagner's having bated his conductor Herman Levi so that he would seem to bear the responsibility for Wagner's subsequent insulting dismissal of him. This, for Adorno, is a classic example of blaming the victim. The anti-Semitic sub-text to the dismissal, viz., that as a Jew Levi supposedly desired and brought the dismissal upon himself, "bears witness to the existence of one of the most sinister features of the Fascist character even in Wagner's time: the paranoid tendency of projecting upon others one's own violent aggressiveness and then indicting, on the basis of this projection, those whom one endows with pernicious qualities" (Adorno "Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler" 158)."
&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly thereafter Adorno and three other professors at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] formulated their influential and highly debated ''[[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]]'' (F for fascist), published in ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950), which included among the [[fascist]] traits of the scale the "contempt for everything discriminated against or weak."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X3L5R3kiOh4C&amp;pg=PA63 Adorno and the political] By Espen Hammer p.63&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical expression of victim blaming is the "asking for it" idiom, e.g. "she was asking for it" said of a victim of violence or sexual assault.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicky Ali Jackson|title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OcDBZ0uNNVIC&amp;pg=PA715|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=22 February 2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-94221-5|pages=715–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary victimization of sexual assault victims==

Secondary victimization is the re-[[Psychological trauma|traumatization]] of the [[sexual assault]], abuse, or rape victim through the responses of individuals and institutions. Types of secondary victimization include victim blaming, disbelieving the victim's story, minimizing the severity of the attack, and [[medical ethics|inappropriate]] post-assault treatment by medical personnel or other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Sexual assault|Sexual]] [[Sexual assault|assault]] victims experience stigmatization based on rape myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rape Myths and Facts {{!}} wellwvu {{!}} West Virginia University|url = https://well.wvu.edu/articles/rape_myths_and_facts|website = well.wvu.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A female rape victim is especially [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] in [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cultures with strong customs and [[taboo]]s regarding sex and sexuality. For example, a society may view a female rape victim (especially one who was previously a [[virgin]]) as "damaged". Victims in these cultures may suffer [[solitude|isolation]], physical and psychological [[Psychological abuse|abuse]], [[slut-shaming]], public humiliation rituals, be disowned by friends and family, be prohibited from marrying, be divorced if already married, or even be killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svfreenyc.org/survivors_factsheet_49.html#6 |title=Factsheets: Trauma of Victimization – Secondary Injuries |publisher=Svfreenyc.org |date=21 August 2012 |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in many developed countries, including the United States, [[misogyny]] remains culturally ingrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Power in Structured Misogyny: Implications for the Politics... : Advances in Nursing Science|url = http://journals.lww.com/advancesinnursingscience/Abstract/1980/02030/Power_in_Structured_Misogyny__Implications_for_the.3.aspx|website = LWW|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Male Hegemony through Education: Construction of Gendered Identities|url = http://hipatiapress.info/hpjournals/index.php/generos/article/view/316|website = hipatiapress.info|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beauty and Misogyny: Harmful Cultural Practices in the West|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YlWcBQAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2014-12-03|isbn = 9781317675440|first = Sheila|last = Jeffreys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of a [[sexism]]-based allegation against female victims of sexual assault is that wearing [[provocative]] clothing stimulates [[sexual assault|sexual aggression]] in men who believe that women wearing body-revealing clothes are actively trying to [[seduction|seduce]] a sexual partner. Such accusations against victims stem from the assumption that sexually revealing clothing conveys [[consent]] for sexual actions, irrespective of willful verbal [[consent]].  Research has yet to prove that attire is a significant causal factor in determining who is assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moor|first=Abigail|title=She Dresses to Attract, He Perceives Seduction: A Gender Gap in Attribution of Intent to Women’s Revealing Style of Dress and its Relation to Blaming the Victims of Sexual Violence|journal=.” Journal of International Women’s Studies|date=2010|volume=11|issue=4|pages=115–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beiner 2007 125–152"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beiner|first=Theresa|title=Sexy Dressing Revisited: Does Target Dress Play a Part in Sexual Harassment Cases?|journal=Duke Journal of Gender Law &amp; Policy| date=2007| volume=14| pages=125–152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victim blaming is also exemplified when a victim of sexual assault is faulted for performing actions which reduce the victim's ability to resist, or refuse consent, such as consuming alcohol.&lt;ref name="Don't blame women's drinking for rape"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitaker|first1=Matthew|title=Don't blame women's drinking for rape|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/06/opinion/whitaker-women-drinking-rape/|website=CNN Opinion|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims advocacy groups and medical professionals are educating young adults on the definition of consent, and the importance of refraining from victim blaming.  Most institutions have adopted the concept of [[Consent#Affirmative consent|affirmative consent]] and that refraining from sexual activity while under the influence, is the safest choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Myths and Facts About Sexual Assault and Consent|url = https://www.stsm.org/myths-and-facts-about-sexual-assault-and-consent|website = Sexual Trauma Services of the Midlands|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings on Rape Myth Acceptance have supported feminist claims that [[sexism]] is at the root of female rape victim blaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stop Blaming the Victim: A Meta-Analysis on Rape Myths|url = http://m.jiv.sagepub.com/content/25/11/2010.short|journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence|pages = 2010–2035|volume = 25|issue = 11|doi = 10.1177/0886260509354503|first = E.|last = Suarez|first2 = T. M.|last2 = Gadalla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence surveys on male victims of sexual assault states that male rape victim blaming is usually done so because of [[social constructs]] of masculinity. The article quotes "A man who fails to physically overcome his attacker is likewise seen as contributing to his own victimization; he must have secretly wanted it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Male Rape Victim and Perpetrator Blaming|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/25/6/969.abstract|website=Sage Journal of Interpersonal Violence|publisher=Sage Journal Publications|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some effects of these kind of rape cases include a loss of masculinity, confusion about their sexual orientation, and a sense of failure in behaving as men should.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sexual Preference, Gender, and Blame Attributions in Adolescent Sexual Assault|last = Davies|first = Michelle|date = 2011|journal = Journal of Social Psychology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Austen|first2 = Kerry|issue = 151.5|last3 = Rogers|first3 = Paul|pages = 592–607}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Victims of an unwanted sexual encounter usually develop psychological problems such as depression or sexual violence specific PTSD known as Rape Trauma Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sexual Preference, Gender, and Blame Attributions in Adolescent Sexual Assault|last = Davies|first = Michelle|date = 2011|journal = Journal of Social Psychology|last2 = Austen|first2 = Kerry|issue = 151.5|pages = 592–607|last3 = Rogers|first3 = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sexualized Violence Against Women and Children: A Psychology and Law Perspective|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eLSfxOiTsTkC|publisher = Guilford Press|date = 2004-01-01|isbn = 9781593850616|language = en|first = B. J.|last = Cling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposing views==
[[Roy Baumeister]], a social and personality psychologist, argued that blaming the victim is not necessarily always fallacious. He argued that showing the victim's possible role in an altercation may be contrary to typical explanations of violence and cruelty, which incorporate the trope of the innocent victim. According to Baumeister, in the classic telling of "the myth of pure evil," the innocent, well-meaning victims are going about their business when they are suddenly assaulted by wicked, malicious evildoers. Baumeister describes the situation as a possible distortion by both the perpetrator and the victim; the perpetrator may minimize the offense while the victim maximizes it, and so accounts of the incident shouldn't be immediately taken as objective truths.

In context, Baumeister refers to the common behavior of the aggressor seeing themselves as more of the "victim" than the abused, justifying a horrific act by way of their "moral complexity". This usually stems from an "excessive sensitivity" to insults, which he finds as a consistent pattern in abusive husbands. Essentially, the abuse the perpetrator administers is generally excessive, in comparison to the act/acts that they claim as to have provoked them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baumeister|first=Roy|title=Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty|year=1999|publisher=Holt|isbn=0-8050-7165-2}}{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
In a case that became infamous in 2011, an 11-year-old female rape victim who suffered repeated gang rapes in [[Cleveland, Texas]], was accused by a defense attorney of being a seductress who lured men to their doom.&lt;ref name="slate1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams |first=Sam |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/11/29/cleveland_texas_rape_case_defense_attorney_calls_pre_teen_victim_a_spider.html |title=Cleveland, Texas rape case: Defense attorney calls pre-teen victim a spider, but that's his job |publisher=Slate |date=29 November 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Like the spider and the fly. Wasn't she saying, 'Come into my parlor' , said the spider to the fly?", he asked a witness.&lt;ref name="slate1"/&gt; The ''New York Times'' ran an article uncritically reporting on the way many in the community blamed the victim, for which the newspaper later apologized.&lt;ref name="slate1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlla/ny-times-defends-victim-blaming-coverage-of-child-rape-case_b24236 |author= |title=NY Times Defends Victim Blaming Coverage of Child Rape Case |publisher=Mediabistro.com |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case that attracted worldwide coverage, when [[2012 Delhi gang rape|a woman was raped and killed]] in India in December 2012, some Indian government officials and political leaders blamed the victim for various things, mostly based in conjecture. Many of the people involved later apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/01/04/amid-rape-fiasco-indias-leaders-keep-up-insensitive-remarks/ |author= |title=Amid rape fiasco, India’s leaders keep up insensitive remarks |publisher=Washington Post |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a British judge described a woman as 'very unwise' for drinking too much prior to being raped by two men, noting that she had been 'throwing herself at a number of young men'. He nonetheless particularly faulted the convicted men for taking of advantage of someone who was 'vulnerable and defenseless'.&lt;ref name="Judge brands rape victim 'foolish' for drinking too much"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Martin|title=Judge brands rape victim 'foolish' for drinking too much|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11411745/Judge-brands-rape-victim-foolish-for-drinking-too-much.html|website=Telegraph|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
