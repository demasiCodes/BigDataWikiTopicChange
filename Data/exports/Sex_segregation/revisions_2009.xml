'''Sex segregation''' is the separation of people according to their [[gender]]. 

The pejorative term '''gender apartheid''' (or '''sexual apartheid''') has been applied to segregation of people by gender, implying that it is [[sexual discrimination]].  In some circumstances, gender segregation is a controversial policy, with critics contending that in most or all circumstances it is a violation of [[human rights]], and supporters arguing that it is necessary to maintain [[decency]], sacredness, [[modesty]], female [[safety]]&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;[[Amnesty International]] includes segregated toilets among the measures to ensure the safety of girls/boys in schools. ''[http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGACT770232007&amp;lang=e Six steps to stop violence against schoolgirls]'', Document ACT 77/008/2007, November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  or the family unit.

==Public facilities==
In the interest of [[modesty]], [[Toilet#Public toilets|public toilet]]s, public [[shower]]s, [[dorm]]itories, [[changing room]]s, [[prison]]s and other areas are usually sex segregated.

In some countries, trains have designated [[women-only passenger car]]s.

==Sports==
[[Sport]]s are usually segregated on a gender basis. Some sports that do not rely on physical contact, such as [[bowling]] or [[golf]], may have separate sporting events. In archery, though, it is normal for both sexes and all ages to shoot alongside each other: in a handicap tournament they will, in fact, be competing against each other.

To cater to the religious requirements of various [[faith]]s, and for other preference reasons, sometimes separation is achieved by allocating times or facilities for the exclusive use of one gender, usually of women. This is sometimes done with public [[sauna]]s, [[swimming pool]]s and [[Gym|gymnasium]]s.  

Many countries now have laws outlawing discrimination on the basis of sex, and regard the refusal to provide facilities on an equal basis to both men and women as [[sexual discrimination]], but exceptions are usually permitted.

Historically, certain occupations tended to be exclusively for men and others for women. Occupations such as nursing and secretarial tended to be almost exclusively for women. This is referred to as occupational segregation. 

With the movement to [[sexual equality]], formal barriers have been removed. However, certain occupations still continue to be dominated by one gender or the other.

==Education==
For religious or other cultural reasons, schools might be segregated on a gender basis. There have been studies conducted to analyse whether [[single-sex education|single-sex schools]] or [[Mixed-sex education|co-ed schools]] produce better educational outcomes, but each has its advocates and critics. Even in co-ed schools, certain classes, such as [[sex education]], are sometimes segregated on the basis of gender. On the other hand, even in single-sex schools the [[teaching]] staff usually are both men and women. Some schools decide to segregate students only in core subjects this is called [[parallel education]].

New research in Israel shows that both boys' and girls' performance can increase at school with a higher ratio of girls to boys in the classroom. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftau.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=6859 "Keep Boys and Girls Together, New Research Suggests"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Louisiana following the forced race integration of public schools, the schools were segregated by sex. St. Bernard and Jefferson Parishes (surrounding New Orleans) instituted sex segregation to reduce the likelihood of black and white students dating.  The last year of sex segregation in Jefferson Parish public schools was 1975.

==Religion==

===Islam===
{{See|Sex segregation in Islam|Purdah|Awrah}}

[[Islam]] discourages social interaction between unmarried strange men and women. Sex segregation is strictly enforced in some Islamic countries by [[religious police]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=5869 SAUDI ARABIA Catholic priest arrested and expelled from Riyadh - Asia News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2399885.stm BBC NEWS | Middle East | Saudi minister rebukes religious police]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Muslim world, [[Purdah|preventing women from being seen by men]] is closely linked to the concept of [[Namus]].&lt;ref name=book-sch&gt;Werner Schiffauer, "Die Gewalt der Ehre. Erklärungen zu einem deutsch-türkischen Sexualkonflikt." ("The Force of the Honour"), Suhrkamp: Frankfurt am Main, 1983. ISBN 3-518-37394-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dilek Cindoglu, "[[Virginity test]]s and [[hymenorrhaphy|artificial virginity]] in modern Turkish medicine," pp. 215–228, in ''Women and sexuality in Muslim societies'', P. Ýlkkaracan (Ed.), Women for Women’s Human Rights, Istanbul, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Namus  is an [[ethical]] category, a [[virtue]], in [[Middle East]]ern [[Muslim]] [[patriarchal]] character. It is a strongly [[gender]]-specific category of relations within a family described in terms of [[honor]], [[attention]], [[respect]]/respectability, and [[modesty]]. The term is often translated as "honor".&lt;ref name=book-sch&gt;Werner Schiffauer, "Die Gewalt der Ehre. Erklärungen zu einem deutsch-türkischen Sexualkonflikt." ("The Force of the Honour"), Suhrkamp: Frankfurt am Main, 1983. ISBN 3-518-37394-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dilek Cindoglu, "[[Virginity test]]s and [[hymenorrhaphy|artificial virginity]] in modern Turkish medicine," pp. 215–228, in ''Women and sexuality in Muslim societies'', P. Ýlkkaracan (Ed.), Women for Women’s Human Rights, Istanbul, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
Orthodox [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s have separate men's and women's sections, typically separated by a wall or curtain called a [[mechitza]].&lt;ref name="separation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/shul.htm|title=Synagogues, Shuls and Temples|work=jewfaq.org|accessdate=2007-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel there are a few buses, serving [[Haredi|ultra-orthodox]] Jewish neighbourhoods of [[Jerusalem]], which are segregated by sex, with either men or women sitting in the front and either men or women sitting in the back of the bus.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Alder, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6584661.stm "Israel's 'modesty buses' draw fire"], ''[[BBC News]]'', [[24 April]] [[2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The terms "gender apartheid" and "sexual apartheid" have also been used to describe differential treatment of women in institutions such as the [[Church of England]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,580180,00.html Women clergy accuse Church of sexual apartheid | The Guardian | Guardian Unlimited&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. See, for example, Patricia Budd Kepler in her 1978 ''Theology Today'' article "Women Clergy and the Cultural Order".&lt;ref&gt;[http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jan1978/v34-4-article6.htm Theology Today - Vol 34, No. 4 - January 1978 - ARTICLE - Women Clergy And The Cultural Order&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In churches, men and women sit together in most [[Western Catholic]] parishes, while in many [[Eastern Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] parishes, there is a sex segregation. This is not as common in the New World as it is in the Old World, especially in more rural areas where men will sit on the right (near Christ's icon) and women will sit on the left (near Mary's icon).
