[[Toilet#Public_toilets|Public bathroom]]s, public [[shower]]s, [[dorm]]itories, and other areas are often sex segregated. Entrances and worship areas of some [[Islam]]ic [[mosque]]s are sex segregated. [[Sex education]] in [[public school]]s is often sex segregated. [[Private school]]s are sometimes entirely sex segregated or contain an entirely sex segregated student body.

On the [[Cairo metro]], the first car of each train is reserved for women.
