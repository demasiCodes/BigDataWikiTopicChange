The model further posits that employers discriminate against minority applicants to avoid interacting with them, regardless of the applicant's productivity, and that employers are willing to pay a financial penalty to do so. It is one of the two leading theoretical explanations for labor market discrimination, the other being [[Statistical discrimination (economics)|statistical discrimination]].&lt;ref name=letters&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baert |first=Stijn |last2=Pauw |first2=Ann-Sophie De |title=Is ethnic discrimination due to distaste or statistics? |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165176514003565 |journal=Economics Letters |volume=125 |issue=2 |pages=270–273 |doi=10.1016/j.econlet.2014.09.020|hdl=1854/LU-5704419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/12/business/economic-scene-sticks-stones-can-break-bones-but-wrong-name-can-make-job-hard.html |title=Economic Scene; Sticks and stones can break bones, but the wrong name can make a job hard to find. |last=Krueger |first=Alan B. |date=2002-12-12 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-02-03 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The taste-based model further supposes that employers' preference for employees of certain groups is unrelated to their preference for more productive employees.&lt;ref name=from/&gt; According to this model, employees that are members of a group that is discriminated against may have to work harder for the same wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/553 |title=Lecture Note: The Economics of Discrimination — Theory |last=Autor |first=David |date=2003-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==History==
The taste-based discrimination model was first proposed by [[Gary Becker]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=from&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Neilson |first=William |last2=Ying |first2=Shanshan |title=From taste-based to statistical discrimination |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167268116301093 |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization |volume=129 |pages=116–128 |doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2016.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becker argued that the reasons for such discrimination should be determined by psychologists and sociologists, not by economists, and he sought only to determine the consequences of discrimination as manifested in economic decision-making.&lt;ref name=iess&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Discrimination, Taste For  |encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences  |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/discrimination-taste |date=2008 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early version of this model was criticized for failing to explain the continued existence of discriminating firms, because it predicts that these firms will be less profitable than their non-discriminating counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Siddique |first=Zahra |title=Evidence on Caste Based Discrimination |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0927537111000807 |journal=Labour Economics |volume=18 |pages=S146–S159 |doi=10.1016/j.labeco.2011.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the taste-based model has since become the predominant economic explanation for discriminatory practices.&lt;ref name=iess/&gt;
==Distinguishing taste-based and statistical discrimination==
It is difficult for economists to distinguish between taste-based and statistical discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Moser |first=Petra |title=Taste-based discrimination: evidence from a shift in ethnic preferences after WWI |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014498311000672 |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=167–188 |doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2011.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, however, researchers from the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] conducted a study of the [[Fantasy Premier League]] which allowed them to control for statistical discrimination, because all information about potential employees' productivity is publicly disclosed. They found no evidence of taste-based discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://voxeu.org/article/there-taste-discrimination |title=Is there a ‘taste for discrimination’? |last=Bryson |first=Alex |last2=Chevalier |first2=Arnaud |date=2014-08-15 |website=VoxEU.org |access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
