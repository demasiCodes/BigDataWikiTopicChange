The '''sexual revolution''' refers to the well documented changes in [[sexual morality]] and [[human sexual behavior|sexual behavior]] throughout the [[Western world]] that continue to evolve. 

The Feminist Movement and The Gay Rights Movement are both closely related - if not the founding basis, and most enduring and successful elements of the sexual revolution.

Prior to the Sexual Revolution, Gay Civil Marriage in Massachusetts and Sexual Orientation/Affectional protections in the workplace may not have been realized.

The Sexual Revolution spurred the equality gains of women in the worlds dating and marriage.  

In general use, the sexual revolution is attributed to the changing trends in social thought, witnessed from the 1960s into the early 1970s. {{Fact|date=August 2007}} Although the term has been used at least since the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;The term appeared as early as 1929; the book ''Is Sex Necessary?'', by Thurber &amp; White, has a chapter titled ''The Sexual Revolution: Being a Rather Complete Survey of the Entire Sexual Scene''.&lt;/ref&gt;

One suggested trigger for the modern revolution was the development of the [[The Pill|birth control pill]] in 1960, which gave women access to easy and reliable [[contraception]]. Another likely factor was vast improvements in [[obstetrics]], which greatly reduced the number of women who die in [[childbirth]] and thus increases the life expectancy of women. Other data suggest the "[[revolution]]" was more directly influenced by the financial independence gained by many women who entered the workforce during and after [[World War II]], making the revolution more about individual equality rather than biological independence. Many people, however, feel that one specific cause cannot be selected for this large phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt; Alan Petigny, "Illegitimacy, Postwar Psychology, and the Reperiodization of the Sexual Revolution" Journal of Social History, fall 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Counter forces such as Fraenkel (1992) claim that the "sexual revolution" that the experiences of the West since the late 60s, is indeed a misconception and that [[sex]] is not actually enjoyed freely, it is just observed in all the fields of culture (that's a [[repressive desublimation]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Marcuse]] (1964) ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'', pp.59, 75-82 [http://books.google.it/books?id=63QdLKsuqCwC] [http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/newsevents/1970/709PlayboyInt.htm#reprdesub] [http://www4.hmc.edu:8001/humanities/beckman/PhilNotes/marcuse.htm] [http://www.emsf.rai.it/brani/brani.asp?d=164]&lt;/ref&gt;).  In his writing Marcuse explores the concept that Establishment sanctioned forms of sensual release, what he calls "repressive desublimation", complete our enslavement on the instinctual level. 

Vicarious enjoyment of violence (through TV and movies), relaxed social mores and commercialized forms of mass culture (professional sports, concerts, etc.) tie us libidinally to the Establishment capitalist system. After a weekend of such sensual release we return docilely to our work stations. We sin for pleasure and work for redemption,2 all within the parameters established by our “institutional fathers”: 

The relaxation of sexual taboos alleviates the sense of guilt and binds (though with considerable ambivalence) the “free” individuals libidinally to the institutionalized fathers. They are powerful but also tolerant fathers, whose management of the nation and its economy delivers and protects the liberties of the citizens.
 
Marcuse expanded the Freudian concept of the “internalization of authority” from the individual to a cultural scale to explain how our instinctual erotic drives are transformed both through sublimation and repressive desublimation until the work ethic and altered "Pleasure Principle" of the consumer society have become second nature: “biological.”

In order to move from that to an actual sexual liberation, it is necessary a change in our [[mental structure]]s and our [[moral inhibition]]s. 

The [[Judeo-Christian]] morals still basically hold, and the small social changes are exaggerated because they are seen in that light. Many atheists, find that they have [[secularized]] and [[internalized]] the same old morals.&lt;ref name="p19"&gt;Fraenkel 92, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historians argue that the ongoing Sexual Revolution in the new century is continued liberalization after a conservative period that existed between the 1930s and 1950s. They note that the [[Cold War]] sparked a socially conformist identity which tended to be self-conscious of its appearance to the outside world. Within the United States, this conformity took on [[puritanism|puritanical]] overtones which contradicted natural or even culturally-established human sexual behaviors. It was this period of ''Cold War puritanism'', some say, which led to a cultural rebellion in the form of the "sexual revolution". Despite this, however, before the 1920s the Victorian era was much more conservative than even the 1930s and 1950s. Due to the invention of TV and the increasingly wide use of it in the 50s, by the 1960s a vast majority of Americans had television. This mass communication device, along with other media outlets such as radio and magazines, could broadcast information in a matter of seconds to millions of people, while only a few wealthy people would control what millions of people would watch. Some have now theorized that perhaps that these media outlets helped spread new ideas among the masses. A prime example of this occurred during the early 1960s when [[the Beatles]] (virtually unknown at the time) came to America and were introduced on the [[Ed Sullivan show]]. Once the show was over they were an instant hit. Forty million Americans had watched it that night and thus morals in one perspective changed instantly; although obviously it would take longer for this to occur. The mass media's broadcasting of new ideas to the population was radical, and during the late 1960s the counterculture was becoming well known on radio, newspapers, TV and other media outlets.

While the extent to which the ''sexual revolution'' involved major changes in sexual behavior is debated, many observers suggest that the main change was not that people had more sex or different types of sex, it was simply that they talked about it more openly than previous generations had done - which in itself can be described as revolutionary by supportive historians.

Historian [[David Allyn]] argues it was a time of "coming-out": about premarital sex, [[masturbation]], erotic fantasies, pornography use, and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt; David Allyn, "Make Love, Not War: The Sexual Revolution, An Unfettered History" Routledge, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Although this may be true, some historians have doubts on this due to the lack of contraceptives en masse before the common era. This would have made it extremely difficult to cover up pre-marital relations due to extremely high risk of pregnancy.

It is clear that sexual behavior ''did'' change radically for the vast majority of women, but only a generation after the "revolution" had begun. Women reaching sexual maturity after about 1984 have behaviors much more in common with the men of a generation earlier. Some had more partners (two to three times), starting at an earlier age (by three to five years), than women of the 1970s. Nevertheless this rather radical change in ''actual'' behavior is rarely reported on, being regarded as no longer newsworthy.

==Historical development==
The sexual revolution can be seen as an outgrowth of a process in recent history, though its roots may be traced back as far as the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ([[Marquis de Sade]]) and the [[Victorian era]] ([[A. C. Swinburne]]'s scandalous ''Poems and Ballads'' of 1866). It was a development in the [[modern world]] which saw the significant loss of power by the [[values]] of a [[morality]] rooted in the [[Christian]] tradition and the rise of [[permissive society|permissive societies]], of attitudes that were accepting of greater sexual freedom and experimentation that spread all over the world and were captured in the phrase ''[[free love]]''.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s [[Sweden]] was an international leader in what is now referred to as the "sexual revolution," with [[gender equality]] particularly promoted during this time.

==Modern revolutions==
The [[Industrial Revolution]] during the [[nineteenth century]] and the growth of [[science]] and [[technology]], [[medicine]] and [[health care]], resulted in better [[contraceptives]] being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of [[rubber]] made possible the design and production of [[condoms]] that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent [[pregnancy]] at little cost. Advances in [[steel]] production and [[immunology]] made [[abortion]] readily available. Advances in [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and knowledge of [[biology]], and human [[physiology]] and all sorts of new [[medication|drugs]] led to the discovery and perfection of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first oral contraceptives]] also known as "The Pill". New drugs like [[Viagra]] helped [[impotent]] men have an [[erection]] and increased the potency of others. Purchasing an [[aphrodisiac]] and various [[sex toy]]s became "normal". [[Sado-masochism]] ("[[Sadism and masochism|S&amp;M]]") gained popularity, and "no-fault" unilateral [[divorce]] became legal and easier to obtain in many countries during the 1960s and 1970s.

All these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in world [[literacy]] and decline in religious observances. Old values such as the biblical notion of "be fruitful and multiply" for example, were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the life-styles of modernizing [[westernized]] cultures.

Another thing that helped bring about this more modern revolution of sexual freedom was the writing of [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], who took the philosophy of Karl Marx and other such philosophers, and mixed together this chant for freedom of sexual rights and release in our modern culture.

However when speaking of sexual revolution, historians make a distiction between the first and the second sexual revolution. In the first sexual revolution(1870-1910)the victorian morality lost its universal appeal. It did however not lead to the rise of a "permissive society". examplary for this period is the rise and differentation in forms of regulating sexuality.

==Freudian school==
[[Doctor (title)|Doctor]] [[Sigmund Freud]] of [[Vienna]] believed the roots of human behavior were in the [[libido]]. [[Psychoanalysis]] revolutionized an entire culture's self image. [[Victorian morality|Victorian prudishness]] was shoved aside by a new [[consciousness]] of a [[sex drive]]. Men had an [[Oedipus complex]] and women had [[penis envy]] according to Freud. The mother's breast was the source of all later [[erotic]] [[sensation]]. This new [[philosophy]] was the new intellectual and cultural underpinning [[ideology]] of the new age of sexual frankness. Nonetheless, much of his research is widely discredited by professionals in the field.

[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] Freud scholars Otto Gross and [[Wilhelm Reich]] (who famously coined the phrase "Sexual Revolution") developed a sociology of sex in the 1920s and 1930s.

==Kinsey and Masters &amp; Johnson==
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Alfred C. Kinsey]] published two surveys of modern sexual behavior. In 1948, Alfred C. Kinsey and his co-workers, responding to a request by female students at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] for more information on human sexual behavior, published the book ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]''. They followed this five years later with ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]''. These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality.

It is said that at the time, [[public morality]] severely restricted open discussion of sexuality as a human characteristic, and specific sexual practices, especially sexual behaviors that did not lead to procreation. Kinsey's books contained studies about controversial topics such as the frequency of homosexuality, and the sexuality of minors ages two weeks to thirteen years. Scientists working for Kinsey reported data which led to the conclusion that we are capable of sexual stimulation from birth.

These books laid the groundwork for [[Masters and Johnson]]'s life work. A study called ''[[Human Sexual Response]]'' in 1966 revealed the nature and scope of the sex practices of young Americans.

== ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'', ''Tropic of Cancer'', and ''Fanny Hill'' ==
In the United States in the years 1959 through 1966, bans on three books with explicit erotic content were challenged and overturned.

Prior to this time, a patchwork of regulations (as well as local customs and vigilante actions) governed what could and could not be published. For example the [[United States Customs Service]] "banned" [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by refusing its importation into the USA. The [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' carried great weight among Catholics and amounted to an effective and instant boycott of any book appearing on it. Boston's [[Watch and Ward Society]], a largely Protestant creation inspired by [[Anthony Comstock]], made "[[banned in Boston]]" a national by-word.

In 1959, [[Grove Press]] published an unexpurgated version of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D. H. Lawrence]]. The [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] confiscated copies sent through the mail. Lawyer [[Charles Rembar]] sued the New York city postmaster, and won in New York and then on federal appeal. In 1965, [[Tom Lehrer]] was to celebrate the erotic appeal of the novel in his cheerfully satirical song "Smut" with the couplet "Who needs a hobby like tennis or [[philately]]?/I've got a hobby: rereading ''Lady Chatterley''."

[[Henry Miller]]'s 1934 novel, ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', had explicit sexual passages and could not be published in the United States; an edition was printed by the [[Obelisk Press]] in Paris and copies were smuggled into the United States. ([[As of 2003]], used book dealers asked $7500 and up for copies of this edition.) In 1961, Grove Press issued a copy of the work, and lawsuits were brought against dozens of individual booksellers in many states for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s 1973 decision in [[Miller v. California]]. In this decision, the court defined obscenity by what is now called the [[Miller test]].

In 1965, Putnam published [[John Cleland]]'s 1750 novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]''. This was the turning point, because [[Charles Rembar]] appealed a restraining order against it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and won. In ''Memoirs v. Massachusetts'', 383 U.S. 413, the court ruled that sex was "a great and mysterious motive force in human life," and that its expression in literature was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Only books primarily appealing to "prurient interest" could be banned. In a famous phrase, the court said that obscenity is "utterly without redeeming social importance" &amp;mdash; meaning that, conversely, any work with redeeming social importance was not obscene, even if it contained isolated passages that could "deprave and corrupt" some readers.

This decision was especially significant, because, of the three books mentioned, ''Fanny Hill'' has by far the largest measure of content that seems to appeal to prurient interest, and the smallest measures of [[literary merit]] and "redeeming social importance". Whereas an expurgated version of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' had actually once been published, no expurgated version of ''Fanny Hill'' has ever been (and it is difficult even to imagine what such a work could possibly consist of). By permitting the publication of ''Fanny Hill,'' the Supreme Court set the bar for any ban so high that Rembar himself called the 1966 decision "the end of obscenity."

== Mead's ''Coming of Age in Samoa'' ==
{{Main|Margaret Mead|Coming of Age in Samoa}}
The publication of renowned anthropologist and student of Franz Boas, [[Margaret Mead]]'s "Coming of Age in Samoa" brought the sexual revolution to the public scene, as her thoughts concerning sexual freedom pervaded academia. Published in 1928, Mead's ethnography focused on the psychosexual development of adolescent children on the island of [[Samoa]] in French Polynesia. She recorded that their adolescence was not in fact a time of "storm and stress" as Erikson's stages of development suggest, but that the sexual freedom experienced by the adolescents actually permitted them an easy transition from childhood to adulthood.

Her findings were later challenged by anthropologist [[Derek Freeman]] who later investigated her claims of promiscuity and conducted his own ethnography of Samoan society. Mead called for a change in suppression of sexuality in America and her work directly resulted in the advancement of the sexual revolution in the 1930s.

== Nonfiction sex manuals ==
The court decisions that legalized the publication of ''Fanny Hill'' had an even more important effect: freed from fears of legal action, nonfiction works about sex and sexuality started to appear.

In 1962, [[Helen Gurley Brown]] published ''[[Sex and the Single Girl]]: The Unmarried Woman's Guide to Men, Careers, the Apartment, Diet, Fashion, Money and Men.'' The title itself would have been unthinkable a decade earlier. (In 1965 she went on to transform ''Cosmopolitan'' magazine into a life manual for young career women).

In 1969, [[Terry Garrity|Joan Garrity]], identifying herself only as "J.", published ''[[The Sensuous Woman|The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman]],'' replete with everything from exercises for improving the dexterity of the tongue, to how to have anal sex.

The same year saw the appearance of Dr. [[David Reuben (sex author)|David Reuben]]'s book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)]].'' Despite the dignity of Reuben's medical credentials, this book was light-hearted in tone. For many readers, it delivered quite literally on its promise. Despite the book's one-sided and predjudiced statements about gay men, one middle-aged matron from a small town in Wisconsin was heard to say "Until I read this book, I never actually knew precisely what it was that homosexuals ''did''".

In 1970, the Boston Women's Health Collective published ''Women and their Bodies'' (which became far better known a year later under its subsequent title, ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]''). Not an erotic treatise or sex manual, the book nevertheless included frank descriptions of sexuality, and contained illustrations that could have caused legal problems just a few years earlier.

[[Alex Comfort]]'s ''[[The Joy of Sex]]: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making.'' appeared in 1972. In later editions though, Comfort's libertarianism was tamed as a response to [[AIDS]].

In 1975 [[Will McBride (photographer)|Will McBride]]'s ''Zeig Mal!'', [[Show Me!]], written with psychologist Helga Fleichhauer-Hardt for children and their parents, appeared in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic. Appreciated by many parents for its frank depiction of pre-adolescents discovering and exploring their sexuality, it scandalized others and eventually it was pulled from circulation in the United States and some other countries. It was followed up in 1989 by ''Zeig Mal Mehr!'' ("Show Me More!").

These books had a number of things in common. They were factual and, in fact, educational. They were available to a mainstream readership. They were stacked high on the tables of discount bookstores, they were book club selections, and their authors were guests on late-night talk shows. People were seen reading them in public. In a respectable middle-class home, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine and ''Fanny Hill'' might be present but would usually be kept out of sight. But at least some of these books might well be on the coffee table. Most important, all of these books acknowledged and celebrated the conscious cultivation of erotic pleasure.

The contribution of such books to the sexual revolution cannot be overstated. Earlier books such as ''What Every Girl Should Know'' ([[Margaret Sanger]], 1920) and ''A Marriage Manual'' (Hannah and Abraham Stone, 1939) had broken the utter silence in which many people, women in particular, had grown up. By the 1950s, in the United States, it had finally become rare for women to go into their wedding nights literally not knowing what to expect. But the open discussion of sex as pleasure, and descriptions of sexual practices and techniques, was truly revolutionary. There were practices which, perhaps, some had heard of. But many adults did not know for sure whether they were realities, or fantasies found only in pornographic books. Were they "normal," or were they examples of [[psychopathology]]? (When we use words such as ''[[fellatio]]'' we are still using the terminology of [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]]'s ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]''). Did married ladies do these things, or only prostitutes? The Kinsey report revealed that these practices were, at the very least, surprisingly frequent. These other books asserted, in the words of a 1980 book by Dr. Irene Kassorla, that ''Nice Girls Do -- And Now You Can Too''.

== Medicine and sex ==
The development of [[antibiotic]]s in the 1940s made most of the severe [[venereal disease]]s of the time curable, reducing the threat of sexually transmitted diseases such as [[syphilis]].

In the early 1960s, [[The Pill]] became available; at first for married women only, but demand and changes in attitudes later led to it becoming available to unmarried women as well.

With the twin threats of disease and pregnancy removed, many of the traditional constraints on sexual behavior were disregarded.

With the notion that sexually transmitted diseases were easily treatable, much of the [[post-WW2 baby boom]] generation experimented with sex without the need for [[marriage]].

== Contraception ==
As [[birth control]] become more available, men and women gained unprecedented control of their reproductive capabilities. The 1916 invention of thin, disposable [[latex]] [[condom]]s for men led to widespread affordable condoms by the 1930s; the demise of the [[Comstock laws]] in 1936 set the stage for promotion of available effective contraceptives such as the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] and [[cervical cap]]; the 1960s introduction of the [[IUD]] and [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] for women gave a sense of freedom from [[barrier contraception]].

==The sexual revolution in the UK==
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the new generation growing up after the [[Second World War]] had grown tired of the rationing and austerity of the 1940s and 1950s and the Victorian values of their elders, so the 1960s were a time of rebellion against the fashions and social mores of the previous generation.

An early inkling of changing attitudes came in 1960, when the government of the day tried unsuccessfully to prosecute [[Penguin Books]] for obscenity, for publishing the [[D.H. Lawrence]] novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'', which had been banned since the 1920s for its racy (for the time) content.

As evidence of how old-fashioned the attitudes of the establishment were, the prosecution counsel [[Mervyn Griffith-Jones]] famously stood in front of the jury and asked, in his closing statement: "Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?".

When the case collapsed, the novel went on to become a best seller, selling 2 million copies. The Pill became available free of charge on the [[National Health Service]] in the 1960s, at first restricted to married women, but late in the decade its availability was extended to all women.

==Free love==
Beginning in [[San Francisco]] in the mid 1960s, a new culture of "[[free love]]" emerged, with thousands of young people becoming "[[hippies]]" who preached the power of [[love]] and the beauty of [[sex]] as part of ordinary student life. This is part of a [[counterculture]] that exists to the present. By the 1970s it was acceptable for colleges to allow co-educational housing where male and female students mingled freely.

Free love continued in different forms throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, but its more assertive manifestations ended abruptly (or disappeared from public view) in the mid 1980s when the public first became aware of [[AIDS]], a deadly sexually transmitted disease.

==Explicit sex on screen==
Swedish filmmakers like [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Vilgot Sjöman]] contributed to sexual liberation with sexually themed films that challenged conservative international standards. The 1951 film ''[[Hon dansade en sommar]]'' (''She Danced a Summer AKA One Summer of Happiness'') starring [[Ulla Jacobsson]] and [[Folke Sundquist]] depicted scenes that were at the time considered too sexual, but by today's standards would be fairly mild. This film, as well as Bergman's ''[[Sommaren med Monika]]'' (''The Summer with Monika''), caused an international uproar, not least in the US where the films were charged with violating standards of decency. Vilgot Sjöman's film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'', also created an international uproar, but it was very popular in the United States. Another of his films, ''491'', highlighted homosexuality among other things. ''[[Kärlekens språk]]'', (''The Language of Love''), was an informative documentary about sex and sexual techniques that featured the first real act of sex in a mainstream film, and inevitably it caused intense debate around the world, including in the US. From these films the concept of "the Swedish sin", (licentiousness) developed, even though Swedish society was at the time still fairly conservative regarding sex, and the international concept of Swedish sexuality was and is largely exaggerated. The films caused debate there as well. The films eventually helped the publics attitudes toward sex progress, especially in Sweden and other northern European countries, which today tend to be more sexually liberal than others.

Explicit sex on screen and acceptance of [[frontal nudity]] by men and women on stage became the norm in many American and European countries, as the twentieth century ended. Special places of entertainment offering [[striptease]] and [[lap dancing]] proliferated. The famous [[Playboy Bunny|Playboy Bunnies]] set a trend. Men came to be entertained by [[toplessness|topless]] women at night-clubs which also hosted "[[peep show]]s."

==Pre-marital sex==
Once heavily stigmatized, [[pre-marital sex]] became more widespread during the [[sexual revolution]].  The increased availability of [[birth control]] (and the quasi-legalization of [[abortion]] in some places) helped reduce the chance that pre-marital sex would result in unwanted children.  By the mid 1970s the majority of newly married American couples had experienced sex before marriage.

==The politics of sex==
[[Politics]] in the USA has become intertwined with sexually related issues, called the "politics of sex". A woman's desire for an abortion pitted traditionalist [[Pro-Life]] activists against [[Pro-Choice]] activists permitting abortions. Sex between people of the same gender, the [[homosexuality]] that was strictly taboo in times when the [[Christian Church]] still exercised much influence in [[society]], yet is still stigmatized to this day. Women and men who lived with each other without [[marriage]] sought "[[palimony]]" equal to the [[alimony]] a [[divorced]] husband pays his ex-wife. Teenagers assumed their right to a sexual life with whomever they pleased, and bathers fought to be [[topless]] or nude at beaches.

==The normalization of pornography==
{{See|History of pornography}}
The fact that [[pornography]] was no longer stigmatized by the end of the 1980s, and more mainstream movies depicted [[sexual intercourse]] as "entertainment," was indicative of how normalized sexual revolution had become in society. Magazines depicting nudity, such as the popular ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, won some acceptance as mainstream journals, in which public figures felt safe expressing their fantasies. Feminists have had mixed responses to pornography.  Some figures in the [[feminist]] movement, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], challenged the depiction of women as objects in these pornographic magazines.  

The [[gay porn]] industry also became much more widespread throughout the western world, even permeating areas better known for the repression of non-normative sexualities, such as [[Northern Africa]], [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s pornography depicting [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] acts was rare and illegal in some US states.
