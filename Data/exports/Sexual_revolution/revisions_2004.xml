==Introduction==

The sexual revolution was principally caused by a series of events that allowed women to gain control of their own reproduction. With [[oral contraceptives]] becoming widely available and the sexually-transmitted diseases present at the time mostly being easily treatable, much of the maturing [[post-WW2 baby boom]] generation experimented with sex outside the boundaries of [[marriage]]. Sex was much more explicitly discussed in books, music, and other media, with the publication of guides to sexual techniques. Sexual topics that were previously considered unsuitable for discussion, such as [[oral sex]], [[orgasm]], and [[homosexuality]], were openly talked about.

Some historians argue that the sexual revolution was not a complete break from earlier Western sexual attitudes but rather a liberalization after a conservative period that only existed between the [[1930s]] and [[1950s]]. They note that the [[Cold War]] sparked a socially conformist identity which tended to be self-conscious of its appearance to the outside world. Within the United States, this conformism took on [[puritanism|puritanical]] overtones which contradicted natural or even, ironically, culture-established human sexual behaviours. It was this period of ''Cold War puritanism'', some say, which logically led to a cultural rebellion in the form of the "sexual revolution."

The extent to which the sexual revolution involved major changes in sexual behaviour, however, is questionable. Many observers have suggested that the main change was not that people had more sex or different types of sex, it was simply that they talked about it more openly than previous generations had done.

That said, it is clear that sexual behaviour ''did'' change radically for the vast majority of women, but only a generation after the "revolution" had begun. Women reaching sexual maturity after about [[1984]] have behaviours much more in common with the men of a generation earlier. They had more partners (two to three times), starting at an earlier age (by three to five years), than women of the generation of the [[1970s]]. Nevertheless this rather radical change in ''actual'' behaviour is rarely reported on, being regarded as no longer newsworthy.

British writer [[Philip Larkin]]'s poem "Annus Mirabilis" ([[1974]]) captures the spirit of the Sexual Revolution rather well. Here is the first [[stanza]]:

:Sexual intercourse began
:In nineteen sixty-three
:(which was rather late for me) -
:Between the end of the "[[Lady Chatterley's Lover|Chatterley]]" ban
:And the [[Beatles]]' first [[vinyl record|LP]].

(Read the [http://alt.venus.co.uk/weed/writings/poems/plam.htm whole poem].)

Social attitudes toward sexuality became notably more conservative in the [[1980s]] in part because of the fear of [[AIDS]].

==Historical Development==

The sexual revolution was an outgrowth of a process in recent history. It was a development in the [[modern world]] which saw the collapse of the [[values]] of a [[morality]] rooted in the [[Judaeo-Christian tradition]] and the rise of [[permissive society|permissive societies]], of attitudes that were accepting of greater sexual freedom and experimentation that spread all over the world and were captured in the phrase ''[[free love]]''.

This was a perhaps a throwback to over 2,000 years ago during the times of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Rome]] that provided the [[Graeco-Roman]] component of Western culture. During those times there was a different sexual and moral code. There were specific gods of love like the Greek [[Eros (god)|Eros]], from whom the word "erotic" is derived, and the Roman [[Cupid]], who is the center of the modern [[Valentine's Day]]. In [[Greek mythology]] these characters seduced, romanced, made love, lusted, cheated, and even raped each other in very graphic and colorful ways. This can be contrasted with the teachings of the Christian Church.

The power of [[religion]] as wielded by the [[Catholic]], [[Orthodox]], and [[Protestant]] [[churches]] of Europe was radically undermined by the [[French Revolution]] of [[1789]] which saw the [[First Estate]] the clergy and the [[Second Estate]] made up of the ancien regime (nobles) give way to the power of the [[Third Estate]] of the [[peasants]] and [[bourgeoisie]] which surged towards a [[secular]] way of life.

==Modern Revolutions==

The [[Industrial Revolution]] during the [[nineteenth century]] and the growth of [[science]] and [[technology]], [[medicine]] and [[health care]], resulted in better [[contraceptives]] being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of [[rubber]] made possible the design and production of [[condoms]] that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent [[pregnancy]] at little cost. Advances in [[steel]] production and [[immunology]] made [[abortion]] readily available. Advances in [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and knowledge of [[biology]], and human [[physiology]] and all sorts of new [[drugs]] led to the discovery and perfection of [[oral contraceptives]] also known as "[[The Pill]]". New drugs like [[Viagra]] helped [[impotent]] men have an [[erection]] and increased the potency of others. Purchasing an [[aphrodisiac]] and various [[sex toy]]s became "normal". [[Sado-masochism]] ("[[S&amp;M]]") gained popularity, and "no-fault" unilateral [[divorce]] became legal and easier to obtain in many countries during the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]].

All these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in world [[literacy]] and decline in religious observances. Old values such as the notion of "be fruitful and multiply" rooted in the Bible, for example, were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the life-styles of modernizing [[westernized]] cultures.

==Discoveries==

Discoveries in the field of [[photography]] and [[cinematography]] the perfection of the [[camera]], for recording moving and still real-life pictures of real people revolutionized the spread of mass movie and photographic images. The rise of the [[cinema|movie]] industry in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] combined with new techniques in [[marketing]] and [[advertising]] as well as studies of the [[psychology]] of [[consumers]], creating mass [[markets]] for attractive images first in [[monochrome]] of "[[black-and-white]]", then later in [[color]] and [[Technicolor]].

==Freud==

[[Doctor]] [[Sigmund Freud]] of [[Vienna]] unmasked the roots of human behavior as being rooted in the [[libido]]. This new modern "science" of [[psychoanalysis]] revolutionized an entire culture's self image. [[Victorian morality|Victorian prudishness]] was shoved aside by a new [[consciousness]] of a [[sex drive]]. Men had an [[Oedipus complex]] and women had [[penis envy]] according to Freud. The mother's breast was the source of all later [[erotic]] [[sensation]]. This new [[philosophy]] was the new intellectual and cultural underpinning [[ideology]] of the new age of sexual frankness.

==Movie stars are born==

Beautiful women and extremely handsome men were rigorously selected to become [[movie star|movie stars]] and when they were cast in [[Cinema|movies]] with [[romantic]] scenes of [[love]], [[kissing]], [[hugging]], and [[flirting]], an entire culture was transformed as it became more acceptable to show feelings of [[affection]] in public. The very [[conservative]] mood leading up to the [[twentieth century]] gave way to a growing [[erotic]] ''milieu'' as popularized by the movie industry emanating from the studios of places like [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].

[[Nudity]] on screen was at first rare. But with the passage of time people became more tolerant of [[partial nudity]] for men and the display of female actress's [[breasts]], at first to adult audiences, and later to more general ones. The invention of [[television]] made it possible for scenes of [[love]] and [[romance]] to be broadcast into any home with a "TV". A whole ''genre'' of actors who were particularly well-endowed with [[charisma]] and &amp;#8220;[[sex appeal]]" arose. Thus an entire culture arose which was steeped in and eroticized by movie and TV culture, far removed from the more inhibiting times of an "old fashioned" morality rooted in "Bible-thumping" religion.

Famous names in [[entertainment]] became not just "stars" but also "goddesses". Beautiful women such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Raquel Welch]], [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Madonna (singer)|Madonna]] and later young imitators, were explicit in casting a sexual aura about themselves as actresses and to the [[celebrity]]-hungry [[mass media|media]]. A [[love scene]] in every movie was accepted as the norm.

==Kinsey and Masters &amp; Johnson==

In the late [[1940s]] and early [[1950s]], [[Alfred C. Kinsey]] published two surveys of modern sexual behavior. In [[1948]], Alfred C. Kinsey and his co-workers, responding to a request by female students at [[Indiana University]] for more information on human sexual behavior, published the book ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]''. They followed this five years later with ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]''. These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality.

It is said that at the time, public morality severely restricted open discussion of sexuality as a human characteristic, and specific sexual practices, especially sexual behaviors that did not lead to procreation. Kinsey's books, which among other things reported findings on the frequency of various sexual practices including homosexuality, caused a furor. Many people felt that the study of sexual behavior would undermine the family structure and damage American society.

These books laid the groundwork for [[Masters and Johnson]]'s life work. A ground breaking study called ''[[Human Sexual Response]]'' in [[1966]] revealed the nature and scope of the sex practices of young Americans.

== ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'', ''Tropic of Cancer'', and ''Fanny Hill'' ==

In the United States in the years [[1959]] through [[1966]], bans on three books with explicit erotic content were challenged and overturned.

Prior to this time, a patchwork of regulations (as well as local customs and vigilante actions) governed what could and could not be published. For example, it was the [[United States Customs Service|U.&amp;nbsp;S. Customs]] authority that "banned" [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses]]'' by refusing its importation into the country. The [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' carried great weight among Catholics and amounted to an effective and instant boycott of any book appearing on it. Boston's [[Watch and Ward Society]], a largely Protestant creation inspired by [[Anthony Comstock]], made "[[banned in Boston]]" a national by-word.

In [[1959]], [[Grove Press]] published an unexpurgated version of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D. H. Lawrence]]. The [[United States Postal Service|U.&amp;nbsp;S. Post Office]] confiscated copies sent through the mail. Lawyer [[Charles Rembar]] sued the New York city postmaster and won in New York and then on federal appeal. In 1965, [[Tom Lehrer]] was to celebrate the erotic appeal of the novel in his cheerfully satirical song "[[Smut]]" with the couplet "Who needs a hobby like tennis or [[philately]]?/I've got a hobby: rereading ''Lady Chatterley''."

[[Henry Miller]]'s [[1934]] novel, ''[[Tropic of Cancer]]'', had explicit sexual passages and could not be published in the United States; an edition was printed by the [[Obelisk Press]] in Paris and copies were smuggled into the United States. ([[As of 2003]], used book dealers asked $7500 and up for copies of this edition.) In [[1961]], Grove Press issued a copy of the work and lawsuits were brought against dozens of individual booksellers in many states for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled in the by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.&amp;nbsp;S. Supreme Court]]'s [[1973]] decision in [[Miller v. California]]. In this decision, the court defined obscenity by what is now called the [[Miller test]]. The Wikipedia article on [[pornography]] notes that "In the United States, hardcore pornography is legal unless it meets the Miller test of obscenity, which it almost never does."

In [[1965]], Putnam published [[John Cleland]]'s [[1750]] novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]''. This was the turning point, because [[Charles Rembar]] appealed a restraining order against it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and won.  In ''Memoirs'' v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413, the court ruled that sex was "a great and mysterious motive force in human life," and that its expression in literature was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Only books primarily appealing to "prurient interest" could be banned. In a famous phrase, the court said that obscenity is "utterly without redeeming social importance"&amp;mdash;meaning that, conversely, any work with redeeming social importance was not obscene, even if it contained isolated passages that could "deprave and corrupt" some readers.

This decision was especially significant, because, of the three books mentioned, ''Fanny Hill'' has by far the largest measure of content that seems to appeal to prurient interest, and the smallest measures of literary merit and "redeeming social importance." Whereas an expurgated version of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' had actually once been published, no expurgated version of ''Fanny Hill'' has ever been (and it is difficult even to imagine what such a work could possibly consist of). In Lehrer's song, the speaker sings:
:I thrill
:To any book like ''Fanny Hill''
:And I suppose I always will
:If it is swill
:And really fil-
:thy.
By permitting the publication of ''Fanny Hill,'' the Supreme Court set the bar for any ban so high that Rembar himself called the [[1966]] decision "the end of obscenity."

== The nonfiction sex manuals ==

The court decisions that legalized the publication of ''Fanny Hill'' had an even more important effect: freed from fears of legal action, nonfiction works about sex and sexuality started to appear.

In [[1962]], [[Helen Gurley Brown]] published ''[[Sex and the Single Girl]]: The Unmarried Woman's Guide to Men, Careers, the Apartment, Diet, Fashion, Money and Men.'' The title itself would have been unthinkable a decade earlier. (In [[1965]] she went on to transform ''Cosmopolitan'' magazine into a life manual for young career women).

In [[1969]], [[Joan Garrity]], identifying herself only as "J.", published ''[[The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman]],'' replete with such things as exercises for improving the dexterity of the tongue.

The same year saw the appearance of Dr. [[David Reuben]]'s book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)]].'' Despite the dignity of Reuben's medical credentials, this book was light-hearted in tone. For many readers, it delivered quite literally on its promise. One middle-aged matron from a small town in Wisconsin was heard to say "Until I read this book, I never actually knew precisely what it was that homosexuals ''did.''"

In [[1970]], the [[Boston Women's Health Collective]] published ''Women and their Bodies'' (which became far better known a year later under its subsequent title, ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]''). Not an erotic treatise or sex manual, the book nevertheless included frank descriptions of sexuality, and contained illustrations that could have caused legal problems just a few years earlier.

[[1972]] brought [[Alex Comfort]]'s ''[[The Joy of Sex]]: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making.''

These books had a number of things in common. They were factual and, in fact, educational. They were available to a mainstream readership. They were stacked high on the tables of discount bookstores, they were book club selections, and their authors were guests on late-night talk shows. People were seen reading them in public. In a respectable middle-class home, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine and ''Fanny Hill'' might be present but would usually be kept out of sight. But at least some of these books might well be on the coffee table. Most important, all of these books acknowledged and celebrated the conscious cultivation of erotic pleasure.

The contribution of such books to the sexual revolution cannot be overstated. Earlier books such as ''[[What Every Girl Should Know]]'' ([[Margaret Sanger]], [[1920]]) and ''A Marriage Manual'' ([[Hannah and Abraham Stone]], [[1939]]) had broken the utter silence in which many people, women in particular, had grown up. By the [[1950s]], in the United States, it had finally become rare for women to go their wedding night literally not knowing what to expect. But the open discussion of sex as pleasure, and descriptions of sexual practices and techniques, was truly revolutionary. There were practices which, perhaps, some had heard of. But many adults did not know for sure whether they were realities, or fantasies found only in pornographic books. Were they "normal," or were they examples of [[psychopathology]]?  (When we use words such as ''[[fellatio]]'' we are still using the terminology of [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing]]'s ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]''). Did married ladies do these things, or only prostitutes? The Kinsey report revealed that these practices were, at the very least, surprisingly frequent. These other books asserted, in the words of a 1980 book by Dr. [[Irene Kassorla]], that ''[[Nice Girls Do -- And Now You Can Too!]]''

== Elvis rocks the boat ==

During the [[1950s]] one particular singer and actor, [[Elvis Presley]] introduced a very fast style of dancing and performing, using his body gyrations in a sexually suggestive manner. He was dubbed "Elvis the Pelvis" for his trade-mark hip movements. Millions of young women became his fans and he was their "[[Idol]]". On [[stage]] and in [[concert]] thousands of young females would squeal, shriek, and cry at his performances. He has been noted as being a prime factor in the "loss of inhibition" and "[[youth rebellion]]" of the 1950s and 1960s.

== Medicine and sex ==

The development of [[antibiotic]]s in the [[1940s]] made most of the severe [[venereal disease]]s of the time curable, removing the threat of sexually transmitted diseases such as [[syphilis]].

Twenty years later, [[The Pill]] became available; at first for married women only, but demand soon lead to it becoming available to unmarried women as well.

With the twin threats of disease and pregnancy removed, many of the traditional constraints on sexual behavior seemed unjustified.

The advent of [[genital herpes]] and [[AIDS]] have started the pendulum swinging in the reverse direction, but modern trends are towards [[harm reduction]] through education and [[safer sex]] rather than a return to sexual puritanism.

==The sexual revolution in the UK==

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the new generation growing up after the [[Second World War]], had grown tired of the rationing and austerity of the [[1940s]] and [[1950s]] and the Victorian values of their elders. And so the [[1960s]] were a time of rebellion against the drab fashions and social mores of the previous generation.

The first inkling of the changing attitudes came in [[1960]], when the government of the day tried unsuccessfully to prosecute [[Penguin Books]] for obscenity, for publishing the [[D.H. Lawrence]] novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' which had been banned since the [[1920s]], for its racy (for the time) content.

As evidence of how old fashioned the attitudes of the establishment were, the prosecution council Mervyn Griffith-Jones famously stood up in front of the jury in his closing statement and asked "Is it a book you would wish your wife or servants to read".

When the case collapsed, the novel went on to become a best seller, selling 2 million copies. The Pill became available on the [[NHS]] in the [[1960s]], first restricted to married women, but soon available to all women.



==Free love==

A new culture of "[[free love]]" with tens of thousands of young people becoming "[[hippies]]" arose who preached the power of [[love]] and the beauty of [[sex]] as part of ordinary student life. This was part of a [[counter culture]] that exists to the present. It became acceptable for colleges to allow co-educational housing where male and female students commingled freely.

==Explicit sex on screen==

Explicit sex on [[Cinema|screen]] and acceptance of [[frontal nudity]] by men and women on stage became the norm in many American and European countries, as the twentieth century ended. Special places of entertainment of [[striptease]] and [[lap dancing]] proliferated. The famous [[Playboy Bunny|Playboy Bunnies]] set a trend. Men came to be entertained by [[topless]] women at night-clubs which also hosted "[[peep show]]s."

==Pre-marital sex==

[[Pre-marital sex]] was openly adopted and if pregnancies did occur then [[abortion]] was easily available. This led to perceptions of the times being an "age of [[promiscuity]]", [[decadence]] and [[hedonism]], and there was even a backlash in America as people sought to return to [[family values]]. Music which influenced the young became more sexually explicit.

==The politics of sex==

[[Politics]] in the USA has become intertwined with sexually-related issues, called the "politics of sex". A woman's right to an abortion pitted traditionalist [[Pro-Life]] activists against [[Pro-Choice]] permitting abortions. Sex between people of the same gender, the [[homosexuality]] that was strictly taboo in times when the Church dominated [[society]], was no longer stigmatized. [[Lesbian]] and [[gay]] women and men demanded and received many rights previously reserved for [[heterosexual]] couples. Women and men who lived with each other without [[marriage]] sought "[[palimony]]" equal to the [[alimony]] a [[divorced]] husband pays his ex-wife. Teenagers assumed their right to a sexual life with whoever they pleased. And bathers fought for the right to be [[topless]] or nude at beaches.

==''Playboy'' magazine and redefining pornography==

[[Pornography]] was not as stigmatized, and more mainstream movies depicted [[sexual intercourse]] as "entertainment", with hardly a stir of protest indicative of how far the sexual revolution had come. Magazines depicting nudity and sexual acts, some very sophisticated such as the leading ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine won acceptance as respectable journals where public figures felt safe expressing their opinions, arguing successfully that they were guaranteed [[freedom of speech]] by the [[United States Constitution]]. The [[feminist]] movement started with cries of "burn the [[Brassiere|bra]]", and later objected to the depiction of women as "objects" in such venues as pornographic magazines and at such contests as the annual "[[Miss World]]" and "[[Miss Universe]]" contests.

==Internet and cybersex==

The rise of the [[Internet]] and the usage of [[computers]] by young children in huge numbers has caused alarm that the vast amounts of [[pornography|sexually explicit material]] [[online]] is a threat to society. Internet companies provide [[filter]]s, but this has not stopped young and old from seeking out sex on the [[World Wide Web]]. A new phenomenon of [[cybersex]] in [[chatrooms]] and via [[instant messaging]] has become popular. This is similar to the rise of [[phone sex]] and "adult" [[videocassette]]s where another modern invention is put to use in the age of the sexual revolution.

=="Monicagate" and The Starr Report==

President [[Bill Clinton]] faced [[impeachment]] in [[1998]] based on the [[Starr Report]], stemming from a stream of such acts which he denied. The names [[Gennifer Flowers]], [[Paula Jones]], and [[Monica Lewinsky]] have become ingrained in the public consciousness as symbols of free-wheeling sex, yet the public took it all in stride by the year [[2000]] and seemed to be rather unsurprised. This is perhaps an excellent illustration of how greatly attitudes have really changed.
