==Introduction==

With [[oral contraceptives]] becoming widely available and the sexually-transmitted diseases present at the time mostly being easily treatable, much of the maturing [[Baby Boom|baby boomer]] generation experimented with sex, outside the boundaries of [[marriage]].  Sex was much more explicitly discussed in books, music, and other media, with the publication of guides to sexual techniques.  Sexual practices that were previously considered unsuitable for discussion, such as [[oral sex]], [[orgasm]], and [[homosexuality]], were openly talked about.  

Some historians argue that the sexual revolution was not a complete break from earlier Western sexual attitudes but rather a liberalization after a conservative period that only existed between the [[1930s]] and [[1950s]]. They note that the [[Cold War]] sparked a socially conformist identity which tended to be self-conscious of its appearance to the outside world. Within the United States, this conformism took on [[puritanism|puritanical]] overtones which contradicted natural or culture-established human sexual behaviours. It was this period of ''Cold War puritanism'', some say, that logically led to a cultural rebellion in the form of the "sexual revolution."

The extent to which the sexual revolution involved major changes in sexual behaviour, however, is questionable. Many observers have suggested that the main change was not that people had more sex or different types of sex, it was simply that they talked about it more openly than previous generations had done. In a nutshell, this point of view maintains that grandma had fun too;she just didn't tell anyone.

That said, it is clear that sexual behaviour ''did'' change radically for the vast majority of women, but only a generation after the "revolution" had begun. Women reaching sexual maturity after about 1984 have behaviours much more in common with the men of a generation earlier. They had more partners (two to three times), starting at an earlier age (by three to five years), than women of the generation of the 1970s. Nevertheless this rather radical change in ''actual'' behaviour is rarely reported on, being regarded as no longer newsworthy.

British writer [[Philip Larkin]]'s poem "Annus Mirabilis" ([[1974]]) captures the spirit of the Sexual Revolution rather well. Here is the first [[stanza]]:

:Sexual intercourse began
:In nineteen sixty-three
:(which was rather late for me) -
:Between the end of the "[[Lady Chatterley's Lover|Chatterley]]" ban
:And the [[Beatles]]' first [[LP]].

Social attitudes toward sexuality became notably more conservative
in the [[1980s]] in part because of the fear of [[AIDS]].

==Historical Development==

The sexual revolution was an outgrowth of a process in recent history. It was a development in the [[modern world]] which saw the collapse of the [[values]] of a [[morality]] rooted in the [[Judaeo-Christian tradition]] and the rise of attitudes that were accepting of greater sexual freedom and experimentation that spread all over the [[world]] and captured in the phrase ''[[free love]]''.

This was a perhaps a throwback to over 2,000 years ago during the times of [[ancient Greece]] and [[Rome]] that provided the [[Graeco-Roman]] component of Western culture. During those times there was a different sexual and moral code. There were specific gods of love like the Greek [[Eros]], from whom the word "erotic" is derived, and the Roman [[Cupid]] , who is the center of the modern [[Valentines Day]]. In [[Greek mythology]] these characters seduced, romanced, made love, lusted, cheated, and even raped each other in very graphic and colorful ways. This can be contrasted with the teachings of the Christian Church.

The power of [[religion]] as wielded by the [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] [[churches]] of Europe was radically undermined by the [[French Revolution]] of [[1789]] which saw the [[First Estate]] of the [[nobles]]  and the [[Second Estate]] of the Church give way to the power of the [[Third Estate]] of the [[peasants]] which surged towards a [[secular]] way of life. 

==Modern Revolutions==

The [[Industrial Revolution]] during the [[nineteenth century]] and the growth of [[science]] and [[technology]], [[medicine]] and [[health care]], resulted in better [[contraceptives]] being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of [[rubber]] made possible the design and production of [[condoms]] that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent [[pregnancy]] at little cost. Advances in [[steel]] production and [[immunology]] made an [[abortion]] a safe and harmless way of ending pregnancies. Advances in [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and knowledge of [[biology]], and human [[physiology]] and all sorts new [[drugs]] lead to the discovery and perfection of [[oral contraceptives]] also known as "[[The Pill]]". New drugs like [[Viagra]] helped [[impotent]] men have an [[erection]] and increased the potency of others. Purchasing an [[aphrodisiac]] and various [[sex toy]]s became "normal". [[Sado-masochism]] ("[[S&amp;M]]") gained popularity. 

All these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in world [[literacy]] and decline in religious observances. Old values such as the notion of "be fruitful and multiply" rooted in the Bible, for example, were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the life-styles of modernizing [[westernized]] cultures.

==Discoveries==

Discoveries in the field of [[photography]] and [[cinematography]] the perfection of the [[camera]], for recording moving and still real-life pictures of real people revolutionized the spread of mass movie and photographic images. The rise of the [[movie]] industry in [[Hollywood]] combined with new techniques in [[marketing]] and [[advertising]] as well as studies of the [[psychology]] of [[consumers]], created mass [[markets]] for attractive images first in [[monochrome]] of "[[black-and-white]]", later in [[color]] and [[technicolor]] and added to perfection in the [[sound system]] of [[cinema]] or [[movies]]. 

==Freud==

[[Doctor]] [[Sigmund Freud]] of [[Vienna]] unmasked the roots of human behavior as being rooted in the [[libido]] . This new modern "science" of [[psychoanalysis]] revolutionized an entire culture's self image. [[Victorian]] prudishness was shoved aside by a new [[consciousness]] of a [[sex drive]]. Men had an [[Oedipus Complex]] and women had [[penis envy]] according to Freud. The mother's breast was the source of all later [[erotic]] [[sensation]]. This new [[philosophy]] was the new intellectual and cultural underpinning [[ideology]] of the new age of sexual frankness.

==Movie Stars are born==

Beautiful women and extremely handsome men were rigorously selected to become [[movie stars]] and when they were cast in [[film]]s with [[romantic]] scenes of [[love]], [[kissing]], [[hugging]], and [[flirting]], an entire culture was transformed as it became more acceptable to show feelings of [[affection]] in public. The very [[conservative]] mood leading up to the [[twentieth century]] gave way to a growing [[erotic]] ''milieu'' as popularized by the movie industry emanating from the studios of places like [[Hollywood]].

[[Nudity]] on screen was at first rare. But with the passage of time people became more tolerant of [[partial nudity]] for men and the display of female actress's [[breasts]], at first to adult audiences, and later to more general ones. The invention of [[television]] made it possible for scenes of [[love]] and [[romance]] to be broadcast into any home with a "TV". A whole ''genre'' of actors arose who were particularly well-endowed with [[charisma]] and " [[sex appeal]]". Thus an entire culture arose which was steeped in and eroticized by movie and TV culture, far removed from the more inhibiting times of an "Old Fashioned" morality rooted in "Bible-thumping" religion.

Famous names in [[entertainment]] became not just "Stars" but also "Goddesses". Beautiful women such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Raquel Welch]], [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Madonna (singer)|Madonna]] and later young imitators, were explicit in casting a sexual aura about themselves as actresses and to the [[celebrity]]-hungry [[mass media|media]]. A [[love scene]] in every movie was accepted as the norm.

==Kinsey and Masters &amp; Johnson==

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Alfred C. Kinsey]] published two surveys of modern sexual behavior. In [[1948]], Alfred C. Kinsey and his co-workers, responding to a request by female students at [[Indiana University]] for more information on human sexual behavior, published the book ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]''. They followed this five years later with ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]''. These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality. 

It is said that at the time, public morality severely restricted open discussion of sexuality as a human characteristic, and specific sexual practices, especially sexual behaviors that did not lead to procreation. Kinsey's books, which among other things reported findings on the frequency of various sexual practices including homosexuality, caused a furor. Many people felt that the study of sexual behavior would undermine the family structure and damage American society. 

These books laid the groundwork for [[Masters and Johnson]]'s life work. A ground breaking study called [[Human Sexual Response]] in [[1966]] revealed the nature and scope of the sex practices of young Americans.

==Elvis Rocks the boat==

During the 1950s one particular singer and actor, [[Elvis Presley]] introduced a very fast style of dancing and performing, using his body gyrations in a sexually suggestive manner. He was dubbed "Elvis the Pelvis" for his trade-mark hip movements. Millions of young women became his fans and he was their "[[Idol]]". On [[stage]] and in [[concert]] thousands of young females would squeal, shriek, and cry at his performances. He has been noted as being a prime factor in the "loss of inhibition" and "[[youth rebellion]]" of the 1950s and 1960s.

==The sexual revolution in the UK==

In the [[UK]] the new generation growing up after the [[Second World War]], had grown tired of the rationing and austerity of the 1940s and 50s and the [[Victorian]], values of their elders. And so the 1960s were a time of rebelion against the drab fashions and social mores of the previous generation.

The first incling of the changing attitudes came in [[1960]], when the government of the day tried unsucessfuly to prosecute [[Penguin books]] for obscenity, for publishing the [[D.H. Lawrence]] novel [[Lady Chatterley's Lover]] which had been banned since the 1920s, for its racy (for the time) content. 

As evidence of how old fashioned the attitudes of the establishment were, the prosecution council Mervyn Griffith-Jones famously stood up in front of the jury in his closing statement and asked "Is it [Lady Chatterley's Lover] a book you would wish your wife or servants to read".

When the case collapsed, the novel went on to become a best seller, selling 2 million copies. [[The pill]] became available on the [[NHS]] in the 1960s, at first for married women only, but pressure soon lead to it becoming available to unmarried women as well.

==The Beatles &amp; Rolling Stones==

A singing musical group called "[[The Beatles]]" from [[Great Britain]] took the world by storm. Their longish hairstyles and their "hip", "cool", and "groovy" behavior was instantly imitated by millions of young people. They were followed by [[The Rolling Stones]]. At this very same time, a "[[counter culture]]" was born which began to openly preach the need to "make love not war" especially in the [[United States]] which was fighting the highly unpopular [[Vietnam War]] hated by young people.

==Free Love==

A new culture of "[[Free love]]" with tens of thousands of young people becoming "[[hippies]]" arose who preached the power of [[love]] and the beauty of [[sex]] as part of ordinary student life. This was part of a [[counter culture]] that exists to the present. It became acceptable for colleges to allow co-educational housing where male and female students commingled freely.

==Explicit Sex on Screen==

Explicit sex on [[screen]] and acceptance of [[frontal nudity]] by men and women on stage became the norm in many American and European countries, as the twentieth century ended. Special places of entertainment of [[striptease]] and [[lap dancing]] proliferated. The famous [[Playboy Bunny|Playboy Bunnies]] set a trend. Men came to be entertained by [[topless]] women at night-clubs which also hosted "[[peep show]]s".

==Pre-marital sex==

[[Pre-marital sex]] was openly adopted and if pregnancies did occur then [[abortion]] was easily available. This led to perceptions of the times being an "age of [[promiscuity]]", [[decadence]] and [[hedonism]], and there was even a backlash in America as people sought to return to [[family values]]. Music which influenced the young became more and more sexually graphic and explicit, to the point of denigrating women.

==The Politics of Sex==

[[Politics]] in the USA has become inter-twined with sexually-related issues, called the "politics of sex". A woman's right to an abortion pitted traditionalist [[Pro-Life]] activists against [[Pro-Choice]] permitting abortions. Sex between people of the same gender, the [[homosexuality]] that was strictly taboo in times when the Church dominated [[society]], was no longer stigmatized. [[Lesbian]] and [[gay]] women and men demanded and received many rights previously reserved for [[heterosexual]] couples. Women and men who lived with each other without [[marriage]] sought "[[palimony]]" equal to the [[alimony]] a [[divorced]] husband pays his ex-wife. Teenagers assumed their right to a sexual life with whomever they pleased. And bathers fought for the right to be [[topless]] or nude at beaches.

==Playboy Magazine and Redefining Pornography==

[[Pornography]] was not as stigmatized, and more mainstream movies depicted [[sexual intercourse]] as "entertainment", with hardly a stir of protest indicative of how far the sexual revolution had come. Magazines depicting nudity and sexual acts, some very sophisticated such as the leading ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine won acceptance as respectable journals where public figures felt safe expressing their opinions, arguing successfully that they were guaranteed [[freedom of speech]] by the [[United States Constitution]]. The [[feminist]] movement started with cries of "burn the [[bra]]", and later objected to the depiction of women as "objects" in such venues as pornographic magazines and at such contests as the annual "[[Miss World]]" and "[[Miss Universe]]" contests.

==Internet &amp; Cyber Sex==

The rise of the [[Internet]] and the usage of [[computers]] by young children in huge numbers has caused alarm that the vast amounts of visually explicit images of sex and sexual behavior [[online]] is a threat to society. Internet companies provide [[filters]], but this has not stopped young and old from seeking out sex on the [[world wide web]] . A new phenomenon of [[cyber sex]] in [[chatrooms]] and via [[instant messaging]] has become popular. This is similar to the rise of [[phone sex]] where another modern invention is put to use in the age of the sexual revolution. 

=="Monicagate" and The Starr Report==

President [[Bill Clinton]] faced [[impeachment]] in [[1998]] based on the [[Starr Report]], stemming from a stream of such acts which he denied. The names [[Jennifer Flowers]], [[Paula Jones]], and [[Monica Lewinsky]] have become ingrained in the public consciousness as symbols of free-wheeling  sex, yet the public took it all in stride by the year [[2000]] and seemed to be rather unsurprised. This is perhaps an excellent illustration of how greatly attitudes have really changed.
