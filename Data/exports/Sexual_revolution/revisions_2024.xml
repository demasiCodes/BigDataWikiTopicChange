The '''sexual revolution''', also known as the '''sexual liberation''', was a [[social movement]] that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to [[sexuality]] and [[interpersonal relationship]]s throughout the developed [[Western world]] from the 1960s to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="allyn"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Allyn|first=David|author-link=David Allyn|title=Make Love, Not War: The Sexual Revolution|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|year=2000|isbn=0-316-03930-6|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of [[sexual intercourse]] outside of traditional heterosexual, monogamous relationships, primarily marriage.{{sfn|Escoffier|2003|p=47}} The legalization of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] as well as other forms of [[Birth control|contraception]], [[public nudity]], [[pornography]], [[premarital sex]], [[homosexuality]], [[masturbation]], [[Sexual identity|alternative forms of sexuality]], and [[abortion]] all followed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Germaine Greer]] and [[The Female Eunuch]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx |title=Abc-Clio |publisher=Greenwood.com |access-date=November 5, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709181001/http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx |archive-date=July 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===First sexual revolution===
{{Further|Roaring Twenties}}
Several other periods in Western culture have been called the "first sexual revolution", to which the 1960s revolution would be the second (or later). The term "sexual revolution" itself has been used since at least the late 1920s. The term appeared as early as 1929; the book ''[[Is Sex Necessary? Or, Why You Feel the Way You Do]]'' by [[James Thurber]] and [[E. B. White]], has a chapter titled "The Sexual Revolution: Being a Rather Complete Survey of the Entire Sexual Scene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/issexnecessaryor00thur |title=Is sex necessary? or, why you feel the way you do |last1=Thurber |first1=James |author1-link=James Thurber |last2=White |first2=E.

When speaking of the sexual revolution, historians&lt;ref&gt;The First Sexual Revolution: The Emergence of Male Heterosexuality in Modern America. Kevin White (New York: New York University Press: 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; make a distinction between the first and the second sexual revolution. In the first sexual revolution (1870–1910), Victorian morality lost its universal appeal. However, it did not lead to the rise of a "permissive society". Exemplary for this period is the rise and differentiation in forms of regulating sexuality.

Classics professor Kyle Harper uses the phrase "first sexual revolution" to refer to the displacement of the norms of [[sexuality in Ancient Rome]] with those of Christianity as it was adopted throughout the Roman Empire. Romans accepted and legalized prostitution, [[bisexuality]], and [[pederasty]]. Male [[promiscuity]] was considered normal and healthy as long as masculinity was maintained, associated with being the penetrating partner. In contrast, female chastity was required for respectable women, to ensure the integrity of family bloodlines. These attitudes were replaced by Christian prohibitions on homosexual acts and any sex outside marriage, including with slaves and prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.firstthings.com/article/2018/01/the-first-sexual-revolution |title=The First Sexual Revolution / How Christianity transformed the ancient world |author=Kyle Harper |date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=December 2021}}

History professor Faramerz Dabhoiwala cites the [[Age of Enlightenment]]—approximately the 18th century—as a major period of transition in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Sex: A History of the First Sexual Revolution |author=Faramerz Dabhoiwala |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199892419}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the philosophy of liberalism developed and was popularized, and migration to cities increased opportunities for sex and made enforcement of rules more difficult than in small villages. Sexual misconduct in the Catholic Church undermined the credibility of religious authorities, and the rise of urban police forces helped distinguish crime from [[sin]]. Overall, toleration increased for heterosexual sex outside marriage, including prostitution, mistresses, and pre-marital sex. Though these acts were still condemned by many as [[libertine]], infidelity became more often a civil matter than a criminal offense receiving capital punishment. [[Masturbation]], [[homosexuality]], and [[rape]] were generally less tolerated. Women went from being considered as lustful as men to passive partners, whose purity was important to reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/the-origins-of-sex-a-history-of-the-first-sexual-revolution/ |title=The Origins of Sex: A History of the First Sexual Revolution |date=February 14, 2012 |website=HistoryExtra |access-date=March 22, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators such as history professor Kevin F. White have used the phrase "first sexual revolution" to refer to the [[Roaring Twenties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The First Sexual Revolution: The Emergence of Male Heterosexuality in Modern America |author=Kevin F. White |year=1992 |publisher=New York University Press |isbn=978-0814792582}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victorian Era]] attitudes were somewhat destabilized by [[World War I]] and alcohol [[prohibition in the United States]]. At the same time the [[women's suffrage]] movement obtained voting rights, the subculture of the [[flapper girl]] included pre-marital sex and "petting parties".

===Formation===
Indicators of non-traditional sexual behavior (e.g., gonorrhea incidence, births out of wedlock, and births to teenagers) began to rise dramatically in the mid to late 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=Andrew|date=2013|title=The Wages of Sin: How the Discovery of Penicillin Reshaped Modern Sexuality|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=42 | issue = 1 |pages=5–13|doi=10.1007/s10508-012-0018-4|pmid=23054260|s2cid=24253086}}&lt;/ref&gt; It brought about profound shifts in attitudes{{whose|date=November 2018}} toward women's sexuality, homosexuality, pre-marital sexuality, and the freedom of sexual expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Psychologists and scientists such as [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Alfred Kinsey]] influenced the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/08/wilhelm-reich-free-love-orgasmatron  |last=Turner |first=Christopher |title=Wilhelm Reich: The Man Who Invented Free Love |date=July 8, 2011 |website=The Guardian |access-date=March 22, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sexual Behavior in the Human Male |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=1948 |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=896–897 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.93.6.896 |last1=Brown |first1=Theodore M. |last2=Fee |first2=Elizabeth |pmid=12773347 |pmc=1447862 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, changing mores were both stimulated by and reflected in literature and films, and by the social movements of the period, including the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the women's movement, and the gay rights movement.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt; The counterculture contributed to the awareness of radical cultural change that was the social matrix of the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}}

The sexual revolution was initiated by those who shared a belief in the detrimental impact of sexual repression, a view that had previously been argued by [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and the [[surrealism|Surrealist movement]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The counterculture wanted to explore the body and mind, and free the personal self from the moral and legal sexual confines of modern America, as well as from the 1940s–50s morals in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Slack, "Liberalism Radicalized: The Sexual Revolution, Multiculturalism, and the Rise of Identity Politics," {{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/liberalism-radicalized-the-sexual-revolution-multiculturalism-and-the-rise-of-identity-politics |title=Liberalism Radicalized: The Sexual Revolution, Multiculturalism, and the Rise of Identity Politics |access-date=October 10, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002014520/http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/liberalism-radicalized-the-sexual-revolution-multiculturalism-and-the-rise-of-identity-politics |archive-date=October 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual revolution of the 1960s grew from a conviction that the erotic should be celebrated as a normal part of life and not repressed by family, industrialized sexual morality, religion and the state.&lt;ref name="America Divided"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isserman|first=Maurice|title=America Divided|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-976506-5|pages=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the [[The Pill|birth control pill]] in 1960 gave women access to easy and more reliable [[contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/book-excerpts/health-article/a-brief-history-of-birth-control/ |title=A Brief History of Birth Control in the U.S. |date=December 14, 2013 |website=Our Bodies Our Selves: Information Inspires Action |access-date=March 22, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another likely cause was a vast improvement in [[obstetrics]], greatly reducing the number of women who died due to childbearing, thus increasing the [[life expectancy]] of women. A third, more indirect cause was the large number of children born in the 1940s and throughout the 1950s all over the western world—the "[[Baby Boom Generation]]"—many of whom would grow up in relatively prosperous and safe conditions, within a middle class on the rise and with better access to education and entertainment than ever before. By their demographic weight and their social and educational background, they came to trigger a shift in society towards more permissive and informalized attitudes.

The discovery of [[penicillin]] led to significant reductions in [[syphilis]] mortality, which, in turn, spurred an increase in non-traditional sex during the mid to late 1950s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/did-penicillin-kickstart-sexual-revolution |title=Did Penicillin Kickstart the Sexual Revolution? |date=January 29, 2013 |access-date=October 4, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005104342/http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/did-penicillin-kickstart-sexual-revolution |archive-date=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an increase in sexual encounters between unmarried adults.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Callum G. "Sex, Religion, and the Single Woman c.1950–75: The Importance of a 'Short' Sexual Revolution to the English Religious Crisis of the 1960s." 20th-Century British History, 22, 2, 2010, pp. 189–215&lt;/ref&gt; Divorce rates were dramatically increasing and marriage rates were significantly decreasing in this time period.

==Academic influences==
===Freudian school===
[[Sigmund Freud]] of [[Vienna]] believed human behavior was motivated by unconscious [[drive theory|drives]], primarily by the [[libido]] or "Sexual Energy". Freud proposed to study how these unconscious drives were [[Psychological repression|repressed]] and found expression through other cultural outlets. He called this therapy "[[psychoanalysis]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychoanalysis |title=Psychoanalysis |website=Psychology Today |access-date=March 22, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Freud's ideas were sometimes ignored or provoked resistance within Viennese society, his ideas soon entered the discussions and working methods of anthropologists, artists and writers all over Europe, and from the 1920s in the United States. His conception of a primary [[libido|sexual drive]] that would not be ultimately curbed by law, education or standards of decorum spelled a serious challenge to [[Victorian morality|Victorian prudishness]], and his theory of [[psychosexual development]] proposed a model for the development of sexual orientations and desires; children emerged from the [[Oedipus complex]], a sexual desire towards their parent of the opposite sex.&lt;ref name="mind" /&gt; The idea of children having their parents as their early sexual targets was particularly shocking to Victorian and early 20th-century society.

According to Freud's theory, in the earliest stage of a child's psychosexual development, the [[oral stage]], the mother's breast became the formative source of all later [[erotic]] sensation.&lt;ref name="mind"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/psychosexual.html |title=Freud's 5 Stages of Psychosexual Development |last=McLeod |first=Saul |date=2019 |website=SimplyPsychology |access-date=March 22, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his research remains widely contested by professionals in the field, though it has spurred critical developments in the humanities.

Two [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] proponents of Freud, [[Otto Gross]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]] (who famously coined the phrase "Sexual Revolution"), developed a sociology of sex in the 1910s through the 1930s in which the animal-like competitive reproductive behavior was seen as a legacy of ancestral human evolution reflecting in every social relation, as per the Freudian interpretation. Hence, the liberation of sexual behavior was considered by them to be a means to social revolution.

===Mead's ''Coming of Age in Samoa''===
{{Main|Margaret Mead|Coming of Age in Samoa}}
The 1928 publication of anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]]'s ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' brought the sexual revolution to the public scene, as her thoughts concerning sexual freedom pervaded academia. Mead's [[ethnography]] focused on the psychosexual development of adolescents in [[Samoa]]. She recorded that their adolescence was not, in fact, a time of "storm and stress" as Erikson's stages of development suggest, but that the sexual freedom experienced by the adolescents actually permitted them an easy transition from childhood to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/primary-sources/329.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331062513/https://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/primary-sources/329 |archive-date=2015-03-31 |url-status=live |title=Coming of Age in Samoa (Photograph and Scholarly Text) |last=Mead |first=Margaret |author-link=Margaret Mead |website=Children &amp; Youth in History |access-date=February 4, 2023}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mead's findings were later criticized by anthropologist [[Derek Freeman]], who investigated her claims of promiscuity and conducted his own ethnography of Samoan society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sullivan|first=Gerald|chapter=Freeman, Derek (1916–2001)|date=2006|chapter-url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/anthropology/n356.xml|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Anthropology|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412952453.n356|isbn=9780761930297|access-date=March 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unwin's ''Sex and Culture''===
{{Excerpt|Sex and Culture|only=paragraphs}}

===Kinsey and Masters and Johnson===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[Alfred&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Kinsey]] published two surveys of modern sexual behavior. In 1948 Kinsey published the book ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]''. He followed this five years later with ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]''. These books began a revolution in social awareness of, and public attention given to, human sexuality.

Kinsey based his findings in both these books on interviews that he and his team of researchers conducted with thousands of Americans, beginning in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gathorne-Hardy |first=Jonathan |title=Sex the Measure of All Things: A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey |publisher=Indian University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0253337348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interviews were extensive and could last for several hours; they were supplemented by diaries and other documents that the interviewees were willing to have copied, and sometimes film of them masturbation or having sex with others, if they volunteered and it was practical.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kinsey found in the course of these interviews that many sexual behaviors which had previously been seen as marginal or "abnormal" were in fact more common than previously recognized and were part of the normal spectrum of human sexual behavior; for instance, he is the source of the widely quoted statistic that 4% of the male population is primarily homosexual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He advocated using this information to reform sex-related laws, which at the time were often draconian (for example two men having consensual sex in private [[Lawrence v. Texas|was considered a crime]]).

Kinsey's books became bestsellers when published, and laid the groundwork for researchers [[Masters and Johnson|William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson]] to study the nature and scope of sexual practices among young Americans. Their books, ''Human Sexual Response'' and ''Human Sexual Inadequacy'', published in 1966 and 1970 respectively, were also best-sellers, and are now considered classic texts in the field.

==Popular culture==

===Erotic novels===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
In the United States in the years 1959 through 1966, bans on three books with explicit erotic content were challenged and overturned. This also occurred in the United Kingdom starting with the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959|1959 Obscene Publications Act]] and reaching a peak with the ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''&amp;nbsp;court case.

Prior to this time, a patchwork of regulations (as well as local customs and vigilante actions) governed what could and could not be published. For example, the [[United States Customs Service]] banned [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by refusing to allow it to be imported into the United States. The [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' carried great weight among Catholics and amounted to an effective and instant boycott of any book appearing on it. Boston's [[Watch and Ward Society]], a largely Protestant creation inspired by [[Anthony Comstock]], made "[[banned in Boston]]" a national by-word.

In 1959 [[Grove Press]] published an unexpurgated version of the 1928 novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' by [[D.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;Lawrence]]. The [[United States Postal Service|U.S.&amp;nbsp; Post Office]] confiscated copies sent through the mail. Lawyer [[Charles Rembar]] sued the New York City Postmaster, and won in New York and then on federal appeal.

[[Henry Miller]]'s 1934 novel, ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', had explicit sexual passages and could not be published in the United States; an edition was printed by the [[Obelisk Press]] in Paris and copies were smuggled into the United States. In 1961 Grove Press issued a copy of the work, and dozens of booksellers were sued for selling it. The issue was ultimately settled by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S.&amp;nbsp; Supreme Court's]] 1964 decision in ''Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein''.

In 1963 Putnam published [[John Cleland]]'s 1750&amp;nbsp;novel ''[[Fanny Hill]]''. [[Charles Rembar]] appealed a restraining order against it all the way to the U.S.&amp;nbsp; Supreme Court and won. In ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts]]'', 383&amp;nbsp; U.S.&amp;nbsp;413, the court ruled that sex was "a great and mysterious motive force in human life", and that its expression in literature was protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

By permitting the publication of ''Fanny Hill'', the U.S.&amp;nbsp; Supreme Court set the bar for any ban so high that Rembar himself called the 1966&amp;nbsp; decision "the end of obscenity". Only books primarily appealing to "prurient interest" could be banned. In a famous phrase, the court said that obscenity is "utterly without redeeming social importance"—meaning that a work with any redeeming social importance or [[literary merit]] was arguably not obscene, even if it contained isolated passages that could "deprave and corrupt" some readers.

===Explicit sex on screen and stage===
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}
Swedish filmmakers like [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Vilgot Sjöman]] contributed to sexual liberation with sexually themed films that challenged conservative international standards. The 1951 film ''[[Hon dansade en sommar]]'' (''She Danced One Summer AKA One Summer of Happiness'') displayed explicit nudity, including bathing in a lake.

This film, as well as Bergman's ''[[Sommaren med Monika]]'' (''The Summer with Monika'', 1951) and ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|Tystnaden]] (The Silence'', 1963), caused an international uproar, not least in the United States, where the films were charged with violating standards of decency. Vilgot Sjöman's film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'', also was very popular in the United States. Another of his films, ''[[491 (film)|491]]'', highlighted homosexuality. ''[[Language of Love|Kärlekens språk]]'' (''The Language of Love'') was an informative documentary about sex and sexual techniques that featured the first real act of sex in a mainstream film.

From these films, the myth of "Swedish sin" (licentiousness and seductive nudity) arose. The image of "hot love and cold people" emerged, with sexual liberalism seen as part of the modernization process that, by breaking down traditional borders, would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Carl |last1=Marklund |title=Hot Love and Cold People. Sexual Liberalism as Political Escapism in Radical Sweden |year=2009 |journal=NORDEUROPAforum |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=83–101 |url=http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2009-1/marklund-carl-83/XML/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217062419/http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/nordeuropaforum/2009-1/marklund-carl-83/XML/ |archive-date=December 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sweden and nearby countries at the time, these films, by virtue of being made by directors who had established themselves as leading names in their generation, helped delegitimize the idea of habitually demanding that films should avoid overtly sexual subject matter. The films eventually progressed the public's attitude toward sex, especially in Sweden and other northern European countries, which today tend to be more sexually liberal than others.

===Nonfiction===
The court decisions that legalized the publication of ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' had an even more important effect: freed from fears of legal action, nonfiction works about sex and sexuality started to appear more often. These books were factual and in fact, educational, made available in mainstream bookstores and [[Book sales club|mail-order book clubs]] to a mainstream readership, and their authors were guests on late-night talk shows. Earlier books such as ''What Every Girl Should Know'' ([[Margaret Sanger]], 1920) and ''A Marriage Manual'' (Hannah and Abraham Stone, 1939) had broken the silence and, by the 1950s, in the United States, it had become rare for women to go into their wedding nights not knowing what to expect.

The open discussion of sex as pleasure, and descriptions of sexual practices and techniques, was revolutionary. There were practices that some had heard of, but many adults did not know if they were realities or fantasies found only in pornographic books. The Kinsey report revealed that these practices were, at the very least, surprisingly frequent. These other books asserted, in the words of a 1980 book by [[Irene Kassorla]], that ''Nice Girls Do – And Now You Can Too''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kassorla |first=Irene |title=Nice Girls Do -- And Now You Can Too! |publisher=Stratford Press |year=1980 |isbn=0-936906-01-4 |location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, [[Helen Gurley Brown]] published ''[[Sex and the Single Girl]]: The Unmarried Woman's Guide to Men, Careers, the Apartment, Diet, Fashion, Money and Men.''

In 1969 [[Terry Garrity|Joan Garrity]], identifying herself only as "J.", published ''[[The Sensuous Woman|The Way to Become the Sensuous Woman]]'', with information on exercises to improve the dexterity of one's tongue and how to have anal sex.

The same year saw the appearance of [[David Reuben (sex author)|David Reuben's]] book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]''. Despite the dignity of Reuben's medical credentials, this book was light-hearted in tone.

In 1970 the Boston Women's Health Collective published ''Women and Their Bodies'', reissued a year later as ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]''). Though not an erotic treatise or sex manual, the book included frank descriptions of sexuality, and contained illustrations that could have caused legal problems just a few years earlier.

[[Alex Comfort]]'s ''[[The Joy of Sex]]: A Gourmet Guide to Love Making'' appeared in 1972. In later editions, Comfort's exuberance was tamed in response to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Stuever |first=Hank |date=2003-02-25 |title='Joy of Sex': Back on Top? |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2003/02/25/joy-of-sex-back-on-top/50041e8e-2742-48c1-92a0-c11cd517897a/ |access-date=2023-11-21 |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 [[Will McBride (photographer)|Will McBride's]] ''Zeig Mal!'' ([[Show Me!]]), written with psychologist Helga Fleichhauer-Hardt for children and their parents, appeared in bookstores on both sides of the Atlantic. Appreciated by many parents for its frank depiction of pre-adolescent sexual discovery and exploration, it scandalized others and was pulled from circulation in the United States and some other countries. The book was followed in 1989 by ''Zeig Mal Mehr!'' ("Show Me More!").

===New emergence of pornography===
{{Further|History of pornography|Golden Age of Porn}}
The somewhat more open and commercial circulation of pornography was a new phenomenon. Pornography operated as a form of "cultural critique" insofar as it transgresses societal conventions. [[Manuel Castells]] claims that the online communities, which emerged (from the 1980s) around early bulletin-board systems, originated from the ranks of those who had been part of the counterculture movements and alternative way of life emerging out of the sexual revolution.&lt;ref name=Pronography&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garlick |first=Steve |title=A New Sexual Revolution? Critical Theory, Pornography, and the Internet |journal=Canadian Review of Sociology |date=August 2011 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=221–239 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.2011.01264.x |pmid=22214041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lynn Hunt]] points out that early modern "pornography" (18th century) is marked by a "preponderance of female narrators", that the women were portrayed as independent, determined, financially successful (though not always socially successful and recognized) and scornful of the new ideals of female virtue and domesticity, and not objectification of women's bodies as many view pornography today. The sexual revolution was not unprecedented in identifying sex as a site of political potential and social culture. It was suggested that the interchangeability of bodies within pornography had radical implications for the meaning of gender differences, roles and norms.&lt;ref name=Pronography /&gt;

In 1971 ''[[Playboy]]'' stopped airbrushing pubic hair out of its centerfold picture spreads; this new addition caused the magazine to hit its all-time peak circulation of more than seven million copies in 1972 and men started having more choices when it came to magazines.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

In 1972 ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' became a popular movie for heterosexual couples. The movie played all over America and was the first porn movie to earn a gross of a million dollars.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

Pornography was less stigmatized by the end of the 1980s, and more mainstream movies depicted [[sexual intercourse]] as entertainment. Magazines depicting nudity, such as the popular ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazines, won some acceptance as mainstream journals, in which public figures felt safe expressing their fantasies.

Some figures in the [[feminist]] movement, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], challenged the depiction of women as objects in these pornographic or "urban men's" magazines. Other feminists such as [[Betty Dodson]] went on to found the [[pro-sex feminist]] movement in response to anti-pornography campaigns.

In India, an organization named Indians For Sexual Liberties is advocating the legalization of the porn business in India. The organization's founder, Laxman Singh, questioned the reasoning behind deeming as illegal the depiction of legal acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |title='Sexual freedom' parade at Jantar Mantar this weekend – Times of India |website=[[The Times of India]] |date=April 11, 2012 |access-date=August 8, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230150423/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Sexual-freedom-parade-at-Jantar-Mantar-this-weekend/articleshow/12616275.cms |archive-date=December 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Chicago resident [[Hugh Hefner]] founded ''[[Playboy]]'', a magazine which aimed to target males between the ages of 21 and 45.&lt;ref name=hefsex /&gt; The coverpage and nude centerfold in the first edition featured [[Marilyn Monroe]], then a rising [[sex symbol]].&lt;ref name=marilyn&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rvwH7euUccIC&amp;q=playboy&amp;pg=PA75|page = 75|author = Les Harding|title = They Knew Marilyn Monroe: Famous Persons in the Life of the Hollywood Icon|isbn = 9780786490141|date = August 23, 2012| publisher=McFarland }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/01/554854492/marilyn-monroe-helped-hugh-hefner-but-not-by-choice|title=Marilyn Monroe Helped Hugh Hefner, But Not By Choice|work=NPR |date=October 1, 2017 |first1=Lulu |last1=Garcia-Navarro  |access-date=May 21, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring cartoons, interviews, short fiction, Hefner's "Playboy Philosophy" and unclothed female "Playmates" posing provocatively, the magazine became immensely successful.&lt;ref name=hefsex /&gt;

In 1960, Hefner expanded [[Playboy Enterprises]], opening the first [[Playboy Club]] in Chicago,&lt;ref name=hefsex /&gt; which grew to a chain of nightclubs and resorts.  The private clubs offered relaxation for members, who were waited on by [[Playboy Bunny|Playboy Bunnies]].&lt;ref name=hefsex /&gt;

==Modern revolutions==
{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}
The [[Industrial Revolution]] during the nineteenth century and the growth of science and technology, medicine and health care, resulted in better [[contraceptives]] being manufactured. Advances in the manufacture and production of rubber made possible the design and production of [[condom]]s that could be used by hundreds of millions of men and women to prevent pregnancy at little cost. Advances in [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and [[biology]], and human [[physiology]] led to the discovery and perfection of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first oral contraceptives]], popularly known as "the Pill."

All these developments took place alongside and combined with an increase in the world [[literacy]] and a decline in religious observance. Old values such as the biblical notion of "be fruitful and multiply" were cast aside as people continued to feel alienated from the past and adopted the lifestyles of progressive modernizing cultures.

Another contribution that helped bring about this modern revolution of sexual freedom were the writings of [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], who took the philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] and similar philosophers.

"[[No-fault divorce|No-fault]]" unilateral divorce became legal and easier to obtain in many countries during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

The women's movement redefined sexuality, not in terms of simply pleasing men but recognizing women's sexual satisfaction and sexual desire. ''[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]'' (1970) by [[Anne Koedt]] illustrates an understanding of a women's sexual anatomy including evidence for the [[Clitoris|clitoral]] orgasm, arguing against Freud's "assumptions of women as inferior appendage to man, and her consequent social and psychological role."&lt;ref name="Vaginal Orgasm"&gt;{{cite web|last=Koedt |first=Anne |title=The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm |url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |access-date=December 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106211856/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html |archive-date=January 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The women's movement was able to develop lesbian feminism, freedom from heterosexual act, and freedom from reproduction. Feminist [[Betty Friedan]] published the ''[[Feminine Mystique]]'' in 1963, concerning the many frustrations women had with their lives and with separate spheres which established a pattern of inequality.

The [[Gay Rights Movement]] started when the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969 crystallized a broad grass-roots mobilization. New gay liberationist gave political meaning to "coming out" by extending the psychological-personal process into public life. During the 1950s the most feared thing of the homosexual culture was "coming out", the homosexual culture of the 1950s did everything they could to help keep their sexuality a secret from the public and everyone else in their lives, but Alfred Kinsey's research on homosexuality alleged that 39% of the unmarried male population had had at least one homosexual experience to orgasm between adolescence and old age.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt;

Many feminist thinkers believed that assertion of the primacy of sexuality would be a major step towards the ultimate goal of women's liberation, thus women were urged to initiate sexual advances, enjoy sex and experiment with new forms of sexuality.&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hooks|first=Bell|title=Feminist Theory, From Margin To Centre|year=1984|publisher=South End Press classics|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-89608-613-5|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist movements insisted and focused on the sexual liberation for women, both physical and psychological. The pursuit of sexual pleasure for women was the core ideology, which subsequently was to set the foundation for female independence. Although whether or not sexual freedom should be a feminist issue is currently a much-debated topic,&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression" /&gt; the feminist movement overtly defines itself as the movement for social, political, and economic equality of men and women.&lt;ref name="What is Feminism"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baumgardner and Richards|title=What Is Feminism|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/whatisfem.htm|access-date=March 27, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406000204/http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/whatisfem.htm|archive-date=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist movements are also involved the fight against sexism and since sexism is a highly complex notion,&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cudd|first=Ann|title=Feminist Theory A Philosophical Anthology|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-1660-2|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to separate the feminist critique toward sexism from its fight against sexual oppression.

The feminist movement has helped create a social climate in which LGBT people and women are increasingly able to be open and free with their sexuality,&lt;ref name="Ending Female Sexual Oppression 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hooks|first=Bell|title=Feminist Theory, From Margin To Centre|year=1984|publisher=South End Press classics|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-89608-613-5|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enabled a spiritual liberation of sorts with regards to sex. Rather than being forced to hide their sexual desires or feelings, women and LGBT people have gained and continue to gain increased freedom in this area.  Consequently, the feminist movement to end sexual oppression has and continues to directly contribute to the sexual liberation movement.

==Contraception==
As [[birth control]] became widely accessible, men and women began to have more choice in the matter of having children than ever before. The 1916 invention of thin, disposable [[latex]] [[condom]]s for men led to widespread affordable condoms by the 1930s; the demise of the [[Comstock laws]] in 1936 set the stage for the promotion of available effective contraceptives such as the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] and [[cervical cap]]; the 1960s introduction of the [[IUD]] and [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]] for women gave a sense of freedom from [[barrier contraception]]. The Catholic Church under Pope Paul VI (1968) published ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' (Of Human Life), which was a declaration that banned the use of artificial contraception. Churches allowed for the [[Calendar-based contraceptive methods|rhythm method]], which was a method of regulating fertility that pushed men and women to take advantage of the "natural cycles" of female fertility, during which women were "naturally infertile." The opposition of Churches (e.g.&amp;nbsp;''[[Humanae vitae]]'') led people who felt alienated from or not represented by religion to form parallel movements of [[secularization]] and exile from religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |title=Fri, Jul 25, 2008 – 'Humanae Vitae' birth control ban set off a wave of dissent |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=July 7, 2008 |access-date=November 5, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122234704/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2008/0725/1216917534395.html |archive-date=November 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women gained much greater access to birth control in the ''Griswold'' "girls world" decision in 1965.

The 1965 Supreme Court case ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' ruled that the prohibition of contraception was unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated peoples' rights to [[marital privacy]]. In addition, in the 1960s and 1970s, the birth control movement advocated for the legalization of abortion and large scale education campaigns about contraception by governments. The ''Griswold v. Connecticut'' case and subsequent birth control movements created a precedent for later cases granting rights to birth control for unmarried couples ''([[Eisenstadt v. Baird]]), 1972)'', rights to abortion for any woman (''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 1973), and the right to contraception for juveniles ([[Carey v. Population Services International]], 1977). The Griswold case was also influential in and cited as precedent for landmark cases dealing with the right to homosexual relations (''[[Lawrence v. Texas]],'' 2003) and the right to same-sex marriage (''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]],'' 2015).

==Free love==
{{Main|Free love}}
[[Free love]] is a [[social movement]] that accepts all forms of love. The movement's initial goal was to separate the [[State (polity)|state]] from sexual matters such as marriage, [[birth control]], and [[adultery]]. It stated that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy|McElroy, Wendy]]. "The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism." Libertarian Enterprise .19 (1996): 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free love continued in different forms throughout the 1970s and into the early 1980s, but its more assertive manifestations faced increased pushback in the mid-1980s, when the public first became aware of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], a deadly sexually-transmitted disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brink |first1=Susan |title=From free love to safe sex |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jun-05-he-aids5-story.html |access-date=August 8, 2021 |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=June 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-marital sex==
[[Premarital sex]], heavily stigmatized for some time, became more widely accepted. The increased availability of [[birth control]] (and the legalization of abortion in some places) helped reduce the chance that pre-marital sex would result in unwanted children. By the mid-1970s the majority of newly married American couples had experienced sex before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis and facts about how technological advance in contraception changed the cost/benefit analysis for engaging in premarital sex, see Fernández-Villaverde, Greenwood, and Guner (2014) "From Shame to Game in One Hundred Years: An Economic Model of the Rise in Premarital Sex and its De-Stigmatization," ''[[Journal of the European Economic Association]]'', '''12''' (1): 25–61. The research is summarized in this video: {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR366Gq-5Sg |title=From Shame to Game in One Hundred Years - Nezih Guner |website=[[YouTube]] |date=July 5, 2010 |access-date=July 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026114212/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR366Gq-5Sg |archive-date=October 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the change was the development of relationships between unmarried adults, which resulted in earlier sexual experimentation reinforced by a later age of marriage. On average, Americans were gaining sexual experience before entering into monogamous relationships. The increasing divorce rate and the decreasing stigma attached to divorce during this era also contributed to sexual experimentation.&lt;ref name=GLBTQ /&gt; By 1971, more than 75% of Americans thought that premarital sex was acceptable, a threefold increase from the 1950s, and the number of unmarried Americans aged twenty to twenty-four more than doubled from 1960 to 1976. Americans were becoming less and less interested in getting married and settling down and as well less interested in monogamous relationships. In 1971, 35% of the country said they thought marriage was obsolete.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

The idea of marriage being outdated came from the development of casual sex between Americans. With the development of the birth control pill and the legalization of abortion in 1973, there was little threat of unwanted children out of wedlock. Also, during this time every known sexually transmitted disease was readily treatable.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

[[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinger clubs]] were organizing in places ranging from the informal suburban home to disco-sized emporiums that offered a range of [[Extramarital sex|sexual possibilities with multiple partners]]. In New York City in 1977, Larry Levenson opened [[Plato's Retreat]], which eventually shut down in 1985 under regular close scrutiny by public health authorities.&lt;ref name="Easy Come, Easy Go" /&gt;

==Legacy==
{{POV section|date=November 2021}}

Fraenkel (1992) believes that the "sexual revolution", which the West supposedly experienced in the late 1960s, is a misconception/misnomer, and that sex is never actually enjoyed freely as such, being rather ''observed'' in all fields of culture: a stance adopted toward human behavior referable to the concept of "[[repressive desublimation]]". According to this concept or interpretation (first evolved by [[Marxist]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]]), the 'sexual revolution' would be an instance of a conservative force masquerading under the guise of liberation – a force sapping energies (here sexual) which would otherwise be available for a true social [[critique]] of a given behavior – and thus an impediment to any real political change which might emancipate the individual from "[[totalitarian democracy]]". (See also [[Bread and circuses]], [[False consciousness]] and [[Frankfurt School]].) Put baldly, the pursuit of "sexual freedom" may be construed as a distraction from the pursuit of ''actual'' freedom.{{Sfn|Marcuse|1964|pp=59, 75–82}}

Allyn argues that the sexual optimism of the 1960s waned with the economic crises of the 1970s, the massive commercialization of sex, increasing reports of child exploitation, disillusionment with the counter-culture and the [[New Left]], and a combined left-right backlash against sexual liberation as an ideal. The discovery of [[herpes]] escalated anxieties rapidly and set the stage for the nation's panicked response to AIDS.&lt;ref name="allyn"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2019}}

Among [[radical feminists]], the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on [[monogamy]], had been largely gained by men at women's expense.&lt;ref name="Willis 1984 121"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willis|first=Ellen|author-link=Ellen Willis|title=Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism |journal=Social Text |volume=9/10: The 1960s without Apology |issue=9/10|pages=91–118|year=1984|doi=10.2307/466537|jstor=466537}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution'', [[Sheila Jeffreys]] asserted that the sexual revolution on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression, an assertion that has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism.&lt;ref name="Zoftig 1982 88"&gt;{{citation | last = Zoftig | first = Sarah | contribution = Coming out | editor-last = SAMOIS | editor-link = Samois | title = Coming to power: writings and graphics on lesbian S/M: S/M, a form of eroticism based on a consenual exchange of power | page = [https://archive.org/details/comingtopowerwri00samo/page/88 88] | publisher = Alyson Publications | location = Boston, Massachusetts | year = 1982 | isbn = 9780932870285 | edition = 2nd | postscript = . | url = https://archive.org/details/comingtopowerwri00samo/page/88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance 1992 302"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vance | first = Carole S. | title = Pleasure and danger: exploring female sexuality | page = 302 | publisher = Pandora Press  | location = London New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780044408673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{citation | last = Egerton | first = Jane | contribution = Sheila Jeffreys | editor-last = Gilbert | editor-first = Harriett | editor-link = Harriett Gilbert | title = The sexual imagination from Acker to Zola: a feminist companion | page = [https://archive.org/details/sexualimaginatio0000unse/page/133 133] | publisher = Jonathan Cape | location = London | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780224035354 | postscript = . | url = https://archive.org/details/sexualimaginatio0000unse/page/133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denfeld 1995 35"&gt;{{citation | last = Denfeld | first = Rene | author-link = Rene Denfeld | contribution = The antiphallic campaign: male bashing and sexual politics | editor-last = Denfeld | editor-first = Rene | editor-link = Rene Denfeld | title = The new Victorians: a young woman's challenge to the old feminist order | pages = 35 | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | location = St Leonards, New South Wales | year = 1995 | isbn = 9781863737890 | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[feminist sex wars]] broke out due to disagreements [[Feminist views on pornography|on pornography]], [[Feminist views on prostitution|on prostitution]], and [[Feminist views on BDSM|on BDSM]], as well as [[Feminist views on sexuality|sexuality in general]].

Although the rate of teenage sexual activity is hard to record, the prevalence of [[teenage pregnancy]] in Western countries such as Canada and the UK have seen a steady decline since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexualityandu.ca/resource-library/statistics/teen-pregnancy-rates |title=Resource Library |access-date=July 28, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930135322/http://www.sexualityandu.ca/resource-library/statistics/teen-pregnancy-rates |archive-date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8340988/Teenage-pregnancies-at-lowest-level-since-1980s.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Martin | last=Beckford | title=Teenage pregnancies at lowest level since 1980s | date=February 23, 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627003556/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8340988/Teenage-pregnancies-at-lowest-level-since-1980s.html | archive-date=June 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1991 there were 61.8 children born per 1,000 teenage girls in the United States.
