It also refers to the practice of [[neutral country|neutral countries]] in time of [[war]] to hold belligerent [[armed forces]] and equipment which enter their territory, under the [[Second Hague Convention]].

==United States==
In reaction to the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] by [[Japan]] in [[1941]], [[United States]] [[Executive Order 9066]] on February 19, [[1942]] allowed military commanders to designate areas "from which any or all persons may be excluded."  Under this order all Japanese and [[Japanese American|Americans of Japanese ancestry]] were removed from Western coastal regions to guarded camps in [[Oregon]], [[Washington]], and [[Arizona]], German and Italian citizens (although not Americans of German or Italian ancestry) were removed from the East Coast, and roughly 1/3 of the US was declared an exclusionary zone.

Almost 120,000 Japanese Americans and resident Japanese aliens would eventually be removed from their homes as part of the single largest forced relocation in U.S. history.

See [[Japanese internment in the United States]].

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] at least 2 US citizens, [[José Padilla]] and another, have been detained without charge, trial or [[prisoner of war]] status by order of the [[President]] as "enemy combatants", without [[Congress]] even passing a [[statute]] allowing internment. 

Hundreds of detainees are also imprisoned at [[Camp Delta]] in [[Guantanamo Bay]]. They have all been denied prisoner of war status and most have yet to be charged with a crime. [[Human Rights Watch]] says they must legally be treated as prisoners of war since an independent tribunal has not ruled that any of them are unlawful combatants on an individual basis. Those who have been charged face Military Commissions (rather than the [[court martial]]s or [[civilian]] federal courts to which they are entitled) condemned by many as unfair, since the President charges you and hears your appeal.

The majority of the detainees are suspected [[Afghan]] soldiers and [[Al Qaeda]] militants captured by US troops in [[Afghanistan]]. However, several were [[kidnap]]ped or illicitly transferred from other countries with which the [[US]] is not at war. A British national was captured by the the CIA in Pakistan, apparently with the collusion of security forces. His transfer was a violation of Pakistani law because he was not [[extradite]]d. Several men were abducted by the CIA in Bosnia after a Human Rights Court (which had been set up with US help in the aftermath of ethnic cleansing and war) ruled that the Americans must release them.

==Britain==
During [[World War II]], about 8,000 people were interned in Britain, many on the [[Isle of Man]].  They included enemy aliens, refugees who had fled from [[Germany]], and suspected British [[Nazi]] sympathisers, such as [[British Union of Fascists]] leader [[Oswald Mosley]]. British nationals were detained under [[Defence Regulation 18B]]. Initially they were shipped overseas, but that was halted when a [[Germany|German]] [[U boat]] sank the ''SS Arandora Star'' in July [[1940]] with the loss of 800 internees, though this was not the first loss that had occurred.  The last internees were released late in [[1945]], though many were released in [[1942]].  In Britain, internees were housed in camps and prisons.  Some camps had tents rather than buildings with internees sleeping directly on the ground.  Men and women were separated and most contact with the outside world was denied.  A number of prominent Britons including writer [[H. G. Wells]] campaigned against the internment of refugees.

Initially the British government rounded up 74,000 German and Austrian aliens, but within 6 months the 112 alien tribunals had individually summoned and examined 64,000 aliens, designated them as "friendly aliens" and freed them from internment with no special restrictions, eventually only 2,000 of the remainder were interned.

Overseas, British citizens were also interned by the Axis powers.

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the [[Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] was passed allowing the indefinite detention without charge, trial or [[prisoner of war]] status, of foreigners designated "suspected international terrorists" by the [[Home Secretary]], but cannot be deported under existing immigration powers because they may face [[human rights abuses]]. In order to pass this statute, the British government declared a [[state of emergency]] and opted out of part of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] referring to the right to liberty. The internees can choose to leave Britain voluntarily, if any other country lets them in.

==Northern Ireland==
One of most famous example of modern ''internment''&amp;mdash;and one which made world headlines&amp;mdash;occurred in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1971, when hundreds of nationalists and republicans were arrested by the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] on the orders of the then [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[Brian Faulkner]]. Historians generally view that period of internment as inflaming sectarian tensions in Northern Ireland while failing in its stated aim of arresting members of the paramilitary [[Provisional IRA]], because many of the people arrested were completely unconnected with that organisation but had had their names appear on the list of those to be interned through bungling and incompetence. The backlash against internment and its bungled application contributed to the decision of the British government under Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] to suspend the [[Stormont government]]al system in Northern Ireland and replace it with ''direct rule'' from London, under the authority of a British [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]].

From 1971 internment began, beginning with the arrest of 342 suspected republican guerrillas and paramilitary members (and no loyalists) on August 9. They were held at [[Maze Prison|HMP Maze]]. By 1972 924 people were interned. Internment was ended, but political tensions culminated in the 1981 [[Hunger strike]] and the death of [[Bobby Sands]]. The imprisonment of people under anti-terrorism laws specific to Northern Ireland continued until the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998, but these laws required the right to a fair trial be paramilitary-related trials because of fears of jury intimidation.

Many of those interned were held in a prison called Long Kesh, later known as the [[HM Maze Prison|Maze Prison]] outside Belfast. 

The republican song ''[[The Men Behind the Wire]]'' was composed in response to the internment.

Internment had previously been used as a means of repressing [[Sinn Féin]] and the [[Irish Republican Army]] in both Northern Ireland and the [[Republic of Ireland]].
