Interned persons may be held in [[prison]]s or in facilities known as ''internment camps,'' also known as ''concentration camps''. The term ''concentration camp'' originates from the Spanish–Cuban [[Ten Years' War]] when Spanish forces detained Cuban civilians in camps in order to more easily combat guerrilla forces. Imperialist powers over the following decades continued to use concentration camps (the British during the [[Second Boer War]] and the Americans during the [[Philippine–American War]]).

The term "concentration camp" or "internment camp" is used to refer to a variety of systems that greatly differ in their severity, mortality rate, and architecture; their defining characteristic is that inmates are held outside the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stone |first1=Dan|authorlink=Dan Stone (historian) |title=Concentration Camps: A Very Short Introduction |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0198790709 |language=en|pages=122–123|quote=Concentration camps throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are by no means all the same, with respect either to the degree of violence that characterizes them or the extent to which their inmates are abandoned by the authorities... The crucial characteristic of a concentration camp is not whether it has barbed wire, fences, or watchtowers; it is, rather, the gathering of civilians, defined by a regime as de facto ‘enemies’, in order to hold them against their will without charge in a place where the rule of law has been suspended.}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- He also refers to "internment camps" on page 123. --&gt; [[Extermination camps]] or death camps, whose primary purpose is killing, are also imprecisely referred to as "concentration camps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nazi Camps |url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/nazi-camps?series=10 |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |accessdate=3 October 2020 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] restricts the use of internment, with Article 9 stating, "No one shall be subjected to [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]] or [[exile]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a9 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 9], United Nations&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' defines the term ''concentration camp'' as: "A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions, often as a result of their membership in a group which the government has identified as dangerous or undesirable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Concentration camp |publisher=American Heritage Dictionary |url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=concentration+camp&amp;submit.x=-664&amp;submit.y=-210 |accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first example of civilian internment may date as far back as the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;James L. Dickerson (2010). ''Inside America's Concentration Camps: Two Centuries of Internment and Torture''. p. 29. Chicago Review Press {{ISBN|9781556528064}}&lt;/ref&gt; the English term ''concentration camp'' was first used in order to refer to the ''reconcentrados'' (reconcentration camps) which were set up by the [[Spain under the Restoration|Spanish military]] in [[Cuba]] during the [[Ten Years' War]] (1868–1878).&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |date=2008 |title=Concentration Camp |encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=Sixth |publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |title=Concentration Camps Existed Long Before Auschwitz |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/concentration-camps-existed-long-before-Auschwitz-180967049/ |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The label was applied yet again to camps set up by the United States during the [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Storey|first1=Moorfield|authorlink=Moorfield Storey|last2=Codman|first2=Julian|author2-link=Julian Codman|title=Secretary Root's record.

During the 20th century, the arbitrary internment of civilians by the state reached its most extreme forms in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[List of Gulag camps|Gulag system of concentration camps]] (1918–1991)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/anne-applebaum|title=Gulag: A History, by Anne Applebaum (Doubleday)|last=|first=|date=2004|website=The Pulitzer Prizes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nazi concentration camps]] (1933–1945). The Soviet system was the first applied by a government on its own citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Gulag consisted in over 30,000 camps for most of its existence (1918–1991) and detained some 18 million from 1929 until 1953,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which is only a third of its 73-year lifespan. The Nazi concentration camp system was extensive, with as many as 15,000 camps&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary1"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/cclist.html ''Concentration Camp Listing''] Sourced from Van Eck, Ludo ''Le livre des Camps.''

As a result, the term "concentration camp" is sometimes conflated with the concept of an "[[extermination camp]]" and historians debate whether the term "concentration camp" or the term "internment camp" should be used to describe other examples of civilian internment.&lt;ref name=euph/&gt;
