'''Internment''' is the imprisonment or confinement&lt;ref&gt;per Oxford Universal Dictionary, 1st edition 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; of people, commonly in large groups, without [[trial]]. Collins English dictionary adds that the term is especially used for the confinement "of enemy citizens in [[war]]time or of [[terrorism]] suspects".&lt;ref&gt;internment. (n.d.). Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition. Retrieved November 03, 2014, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/internment&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while it can simply mean [[imprisonment]], it tends to refer to preventive confinement, rather than confinement ''after'' having been convicted of some crime. Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities.&lt;ref name=euph&gt;[http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2012/02/10/146691773/euphemisms-concentration-camps-and-the-japanese-internment Euphemisms, Concentration Camps And The Japanese Internment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interned persons may be held at [[prison]]s or at facilities known as '''internment camps'''. In certain contexts, these may also be known either officially or pejoratively, as '''concentration camps'''.

Internment also refers to the practice of [[neutral country|neutral countries]] in time of war in detaining [[belligerent]] [[armed forces]] and equipment in their territories under the [[Hague Convention of 1907]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= |title=The Second Hague Convention, 1907 |publisher=Yale.edu |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague05.htm |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] restricts the use of internment. Article 9 states that "No one shall be subjected to [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]] or exile."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a9 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 9], United Nations&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of internment and the term "concentration camp" ==
{{Main|List of concentration and internment camps}}

The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' defines the term ''concentration camp'' as: "A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions, often as a result of their membership in a group the government has identified as suspect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Concentration camp |publisher=American Heritage Dictionary |url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=concentration+camp&amp;submit.x=-664&amp;submit.y=-210 |accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish historian [[Władysław Konopczyński]] used the term ''concentration camps'' when describing events in [[Poland]] during the [[Bar Confederation]] rebellion (1768–1772), when the [[Russian Empire]] established three prisoner camps for Polish captives awaiting deportation to [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Konopczyński, Władysław. (1991), ''Konfederacja barska, t. II'', pp. 733–734.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English term originated in the ''reconcentrados'' (reconcentration camps) set up by the [[Spain under the Restoration|Spanish military]] in [[Cuba]] during the [[Ten Years' War]] (1868–1878), [[Cuban War for Independence]] (1895–1898), and by the United States during the [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1902).&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |date=2008 |title=Concentration Camp |work=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=Sixth |publisher=Columbia University Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''concentration camp'' saw wider use during the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), when the [[British concentration camps|British operated such camps]] in South Africa for interning Boers.&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Documents re camps in Boer War |publisher=sul.stanford.edu |url=http://www-sul.stanford.edu/africa/boers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They built 45 tented camps for Boer internees and 64 for black Africans. Of the 28,000 Boer men captured as prisoners of war, the British sent 25,630 overseas. The vast majority of Boers remaining in the local camps were women and children,&lt;ref name=meredith452456/&gt; over 26,000 of whom died there.&lt;ref name=meredith452456&gt;{{cite book

Between 1904 and 1908, the [[Imperial German Army]] operated both concentration camps and the [[Shark Island Concentration Camp]] in [[German South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]) as part of its [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|genocide of the Herero and Namaqua peoples]].

During the 20th century, the arbitrary internment of civilians by the state reached its most notorious levels with [[Nazi concentration camps]] (1933–1945). The Nazi concentration camp system was notable for its extensive size, with as many as 15,000 camps&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary1"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/cclist.html ''Concentration Camp Listing''] Sourced from Van Eck, Ludo ''Le livre des Camps.'' Belgium: Editions Kritak; and Gilbert, Martin ''Atlas of the Holocaust.'' New York: William Morrow 1993 ISBN 0-688-12364-3. In this on-line site are the names of 149 camps and 814 subcamps, organized by country.&lt;/ref&gt; and at least 715,000 simultaneous internees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | title = The Third Reich in Power | year = 2005 | publisher = Penguin Group | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-14-303790-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of combined casualties in these camps is difficult to tabulate, but the conscious policy of [[extermination through labor]] in at least some of the camps ensured inmates would die of starvation, untreated disease and summary executions.&lt;ref name="Marek Przybyszewski"&gt;Marek Przybyszewski, [http://web.archive.org/web/20101022004220/http://www.historia.terramail.pl/opracowania/nowozytna/zamek_centrum_administracji.html IBH Opracowania - Działdowo jako centrum administracyjne ziemi sasińskiej (Działdowo as centre of local administration).] Internet Archive, 22 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Nazi Germany established six [[extermination camps]], specifically designed to kill millions, primarily by [[Extermination_camp#Gassing|gassing]].&lt;ref name="Gellately2001"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert Gellately |author2=Nathan Stoltzfus |title=Social Outsiders in Nazi Germany |year=2001 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-08684-2 |page=216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1toqgWg8ROUC&amp;q=forced+labor#v=snippet&amp;q=forced%20labor&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Applebaum, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2001/oct/18/a-history-of-horror/ A History of Horror], Review of "Le Siècle des camps" by Joël Kotek and Pierre Rigoulot, [[The New York Review of Books]], 18 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As a result, some say that the term "concentration camp" today may be conflated with the concept of "extermination camp" and historians debate whether the term "concentration camp" or "internment camp" should be used to describe other examples of civilian internment, such as the [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during World War II.&lt;ref name=euph/&gt;
