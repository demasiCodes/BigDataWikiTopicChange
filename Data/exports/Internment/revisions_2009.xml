'''Internment''' is the imprisonment or confinement&lt;ref&gt;per Oxford Universal Dictionary, 1st edition 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; of people, commonly in large groups, without trial.  The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (1989) gives the meaning as: ''"The action of ‘interning’; confinement within the limits of a country or place"''. Most modern usage is about individuals, and there is a distinction between '''internment''', which is being confined usually for preventive or political reasons, and [[imprisonment]], which is being closely confined as a punishment for crime. 

"Internment" also refers to the practice of [[neutral country|neutral countries]] in time of [[war]] in detaining belligerent [[armed forces]] and equipment in their territories under the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)#Hague Convention of 1907|Second Hague Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague05.htm The Second Hague Convention, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early civilizations such as the [[Assyria]]ns used [[forced resettlement]] of populations as a means of controlling territory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/hammurabi.htm Laws of Hammurabi]&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until much later in the late 19th and the 20th centuries that records exist of groups of civilian non-combatants being concentrated into large prison camps.

== Internment camps ==
An internment camp  is a large [[Detention (Imprisonment)|detention]] center created for [[political dissent|political opponents]], [[enemy aliens]], people with [[mental illness]], specific [[ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[religion|religious groups]], [[civilian]]s of a critical [[war]]-zone, or other groups of people, usually during a war. The term is used for facilities where inmates are selected according to some specific criteria, rather than individuals who are [[incarcerated]] after [[due process of law]] fairly applied by a [[judiciary]].

As a result of the mistreatment of [[civilians]] interned during recent conflicts, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] was established in 1949 to provide for the protection of civilians during times of war "in the hands" of an enemy and under any occupation by a foreign power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/380?OpenDocument Full text of 4th Geneva Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; It was ratified by 194 nations. [[Prisoner-of-war camp]]s are  internment camps intended specifically for holding members of an enemy's [[armed forces]] as defined in the [[Third Geneva Convention]], and the treatment of whom is specified in that Convention. 

== Concentration camps ==
[[Image:Boercamp1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boer]] women and children in a [[United Kingdom|British]]-run concentration camp in South Africa (1900-1902)]]
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed. defines ''concentration camp'' as: ''a camp where non-combatants of a district are accommodated, such as those instituted by [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] during the [[Second Boer War|South African war]] of 1899-1902; one for the internment of political prisoners, foreign nationals, etc., esp. as organized by the [[Nazi regime]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] before and during the war of 1939-45''. Literally, a Concentration Camp is a place where enemies, perceived undesirables and others are "concentrated", or all placed together, in one controlled environment, usually very unpleasantly.

Similar camps existed earlier, such as in the [[United States]] (concentration camps for [[Cherokee]] and other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s in the 1830s), in [[Cuba]] (1868–78) and in the [[Philippines]] (1898–1901) by [[Spain under the Restoration]] and the [[United States|US]] respectively&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/concentr-cmp.html The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-07.]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The term finds its roots in the "reconcentration camps" set up in Cuba by [[Valeriano Weyler]] in [[1897]] to quell opposition to Spanish rule in Cuba. During the [[Second Boer War]] (1899-1902), the term "concentration camp" was used to describe camps operated by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/africa/boers.html Documents re camps in Boer War]&lt;/ref&gt; Ostensibly conceived as a form of [[humanitarian aid]] to the families whose farms had been destroyed in the fighting, the camps were used to confine and control large numbers of civilians as part of a [[scorched earth]] tactic.

Polish historian Władysław Konopczyński has suggested the first concentration camps were actually created in the 18th century, during [[Bar Confederation]], when [[Russian Empire|Russians]] organized 3 concentration camps in [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] for Polish rebel captives, where internees awaited deportation on to [[Siberia]]. &lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Konopczyński]], Konfederacja barska, t. II, [[Warszawa]] [[1991]], pp. 733-734.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the word ''concentration'' comes from the idea of ''concentrating'' a group of people who are in some way undesirable in one place, where they can be watched by those who incarcerated them. For example, in a time of [[insurgency]], potential supporters of the insurgents are placed where they cannot provide them with supplies or information.

[[Image:Buchenwald Slave Laborers Liberation.jpg|thumb|[[Buchenwald]], a [[Nazi concentration camp]] (1937 to 1945) and a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[NKVD special camp]] (1945 to 1950)]]
In the 20th century the arbitrary internment of civilians by the state became more common and reached a climax with [[Nazi concentration camps]] (1933-1945) and the practice of [[Labor camp|forced labor camp]]s (1918-1991) (nominally, the [[Gulag]] (1929-1960)) of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/gula.html documents relative to ''Gulag'']&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this trend, the term "concentration camp" carries many of the connotations of "extermination camp" and is sometimes used synonymously. A concentration camp, however, is not by definition a death-camp. For example, many of the slave [[labor camp]]s were used as [[Slave labour|free sources of factory labor]] for the manufacture of war materials and other goods.

Because of these negative connotations, the term "concentration camp", originally itself a euphemism, has been replaced by newer euphemisms such as ''internment camp'', ''resettlement camp'', ''detention facility'', etc., regardless of the actual circumstances of the camp, which can vary a great deal.
