'''Internment''' is the imprisonment of people, commonly in large groups, without [[criminal charge|charge]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=27879033|title=Human Rights Vol. 5, No. 3 "INTERNMENT: {{sic|hide=n|nolink=y|reason=error in source|DENTENTION}} WITHOUT TRIAL IN NORTHERN IRELAND"|last=Lowry|first=David|publisher=ABA Publishing|year=1976|isbn=|location=American Bar Association|pages=261|quote=The essence of internment lies in incarceration without charge or trial.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[indictment|intent to file charges]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4c0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=without |title=Dance in Chains: Political Imprisonment in the Modern World |author-link=Padraic Kenney|last=Kenney |first=Padraic |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2017 |isbn= |location= |page=47 |quote=A formal arrest usually comes with a charge, but many regimes employed internment (that is, detention without intent to file charges)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus no [[trial]].

Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities.&lt;ref name=euph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2012/02/10/146691773/euphemisms-concentration-camps-and-the-japanese-internment|title=Euphemisms, Concentration Camps And The Japanese Internment|author=|date=|website=npr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interned persons may be held in [[prison]]s or in facilities known as '''internment camps,''' also known as '''concentration camps'''. This involves internment generally, as distinct from the subset, the Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, popularly referred to as ''death camps.''

Internment also refers to a [[neutral country]]'s practice of detaining [[belligerent]] [[armed forces]] and equipment on its territory  during times of war under the [[Hague Convention of 1907]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Second Hague Convention, 1907 |publisher=Yale.edu |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague05.htm |accessdate=1 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009230811/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague05.htm |archivedate=9 October 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] restricts the use of internment. Article 9 states that "No one shall be subjected to [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]] or [[exile]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a9 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 9], United Nations&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' defines the term ''concentration camp'' as: "A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions, often as a result of their membership in a group which the government has identified as dangerous or undesirable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Concentration camp |publisher=American Heritage Dictionary |url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=concentration+camp&amp;submit.x=-664&amp;submit.y=-210 |accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first example of civilian internment may date as far back as the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;James L. Dickerson (2010). ''Inside America's Concentration Camps: Two Centuries of Internment and Torture''. p. 29. Chicago Review Press {{ISBN|9781556528064}}&lt;/ref&gt; the English term ''concentration camp'' was first used in order to refer to the ''reconcentrados'' (reconcentration camps) which were set up by the [[Spain under the Restoration|Spanish military]] in [[Cuba]] during the [[Ten Years' War]] (1868–78).&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |date=2008 |title=Concentration Camp |work=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=Sixth |publisher=Columbia University Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and similar camps were set up by the United States during the [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1902).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |title=Concentration Camps Existed Long Before Auschwitz |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/concentration-camps-existed-long-before-Auschwitz-180967049/ |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''concentration camp'' saw wider use as the [[British concentration camps|British set up camps]] during the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) in South Africa for interning [[Boer|Boers]]&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Documents re camps in Boer War |publisher=sul.stanford.edu |url=http://www-sul.stanford.edu/africa/boers.html |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609212833/http://www-sul.stanford.edu/africa/boers.html |archivedate=9 June 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Kenya during the [[Mau Mau Uprising]] (1952–1960) for holding and torturing Kenyans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Museum of British Colonialism releases online 3D models of British concentration camps in Kenya |url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/b/museum-british-colonialism-releases-online-3d-models-british |work=Morning Star |date=27 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Mau Mau Rebellion |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1989/12/31/the-mau-mau-rebellion/186d8bdf-1d95-4b63-9147-c67f20d7eb0f/ |work=The Washington Post |date=31 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Concentration camps'' were also set up in [[Chile]] during the [[military dictatorship]] of [[Augusto Pinochet]] (1973–1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chilean coup: 40 years ago I watched Pinochet crush a democratic dream |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/07/chile-coup-pinochet-allende |work=The Guardian |date=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, the arbitrary internment of civilians by the state reached its most extreme forms in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[List of Gulag camps|Gulag system of concentration camps]] (1918-1991)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/anne-applebaum|title=Gulag: A History, by Anne Applebaum (Doubleday)|last=|first=|date=2004|website=The Pulitzer Prizes|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nazi concentration camps]] (1933–45). The Soviet system was the first applied by a government on its own citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Gulag consisted in over 30,000 camps for most of its existence (1918-1991) and housed some 18 million from 1929 until 1953,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; only a third of its 73 year lifespan. The Nazi concentration camp system was extensive, with as many as 15,000 camps&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary1"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/cclist.html ''Concentration Camp Listing''] Sourced from Van Eck, Ludo ''Le livre des Camps.''

In this online site are the names of 149 camps and 814 subcamps, organized by country.&lt;/ref&gt; and at least 715,000 simultaneous internees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J.| title = The Third Reich in Power | year = 2005 | publisher = Penguin Group | location = New York | ISBN = 978-0-14-303790-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of casualties in these camps is difficult to determine, but the deliberate policy  of [[extermination through labor]] in many of the camps was designed to ensure that the inmates would die of starvation, untreated disease and summary executions within set periods of time.&lt;ref name="Marek Przybyszewski"&gt;Marek Przybyszewski, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101022004220/http://www.historia.terramail.pl/opracowania/nowozytna/zamek_centrum_administracji.html IBH Opracowania – Działdowo jako centrum administracyjne ziemi sasińskiej (Działdowo as the centre of local administration)]. Internet Archive, 22 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Nazi Germany established six [[extermination camp]]s, specifically designed to kill millions, primarily by [[Extermination camp#Gassing|gassing]].&lt;ref name="Gellately2001"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Robert Gellately |author2=Nathan Stoltzfus |title=Social Outsiders in Nazi Germany |year=2001 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-08684-2 |page=216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1toqgWg8ROUC&amp;q=forced+labor#v=snippet&amp;q=forced%20labor&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Applebaum, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2001/oct/18/a-history-of-horror/ A History of Horror], Review of "Le Siècle des camps" by Joël Kotek and Pierre Rigoulot, [[The New York Review of Books]], 18 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the term "concentration camp" is sometimes conflated with the concept of an "[[extermination camp]]" and historians debate whether the term "concentration camp" or the term "internment camp" should be used to describe other examples of civilian internment.&lt;ref name=euph/&gt;

Some international media reports have claimed that as many as 3 million [[Uyghurs]] and members of other [[Islam in China|Muslim]] minority groups are being held in [[Xinjiang re-education camps|China's re-education camps]] which are located in the [[Xinjiang]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=As the U.S. Targets China's 'Concentration Camps,' Xinjiang's Human Rights Crisis is Only Getting Worse |url=https://www.newsweek.com/xinjiang-uyghur-crisis-muslim-china-1398782 |work=Newsweek |date=22 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
