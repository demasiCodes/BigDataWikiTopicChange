'''Internment''' is the imprisonment of people, commonly in large groups, without [[criminal charge|charge]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=27879033|title=Human Rights Vol. 5, No. 3 "INTERNMENT: DENTENTION WITHOUT TRIAL IN NORTHERN IRELAND"|last=Lowry|first=David|publisher=ABA Publishing|year=1976|isbn=|location=American Bar Association|pages=261|quote=The essence of internment lies in incarceration without charge or trial.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[indictment|intent to file charges]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4c0DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=without |title=Dance in Chains: Political Imprisonment in the Modern World |author-link=Padraic Kenney

Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities.&lt;ref name=euph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2012/02/10/146691773/euphemisms-concentration-camps-and-the-japanese-internment|title=Euphemisms, Concentration Camps And The Japanese Internment|author=|date=|website=npr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interned persons may be held in [[prison]]s or in facilities known as '''internment camps'''. In certain contexts, these may also be known either officially or pejoratively, as '''concentration camps'''.

Internment also refers to a [[neutral country]]'s practice of detaining [[belligerent]] [[armed forces]] and equipment on its territory  during times of war under the [[Hague Convention of 1907]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= |title=The Second Hague Convention, 1907 |publisher=Yale.edu |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague05.htm |accessdate=1 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009230811/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague05.htm |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] restricts the use of internment. Article 9 states that "No one shall be subjected to [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]] or exile."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a9 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 9], United Nations&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' defines the term ''concentration camp'' as: "A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions, often as a result of their membership in a group the government has identified as dangerous or undesirable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Concentration camp |publisher=American Heritage Dictionary |url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=concentration+camp&amp;submit.x=-664&amp;submit.y=-210 |accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States set up concentration camps for [[Cherokee removal|Cherokee]] and other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Dickerson (2010). ''Inside America's Concentration Camps: Two Centuries of Internment and Torture''. p. 29. Chicago Review Press&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, the U.S. government forced 8,000 [[Navajos]] to walk more than 300 miles at gunpoint from their ancestral homelands in northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico to an internment camp in Bosque Redondo, a desolate tract on the Pecos River in eastern New Mexico.&lt;ref name="Jaimes"/&gt; From 1863 to 1868, the U.S. military persecuted and imprisoned 9,500 [[Navajo]] and 500 [[Mescalero Apache]]. Living under armed guards, more than 3,500 Navajo and Mescalero Apache men, women, and children died from starvation and disease.&lt;ref name="Jaimes"&gt;M. Annette Jaimes (1992).  ''The State of Native America: Genocide, Colonization, and Resistance''. p. 34. South End Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English term ''concentration camp'' was first used in order to refer to the ''reconcentrados'' (reconcentration camps) set up by the [[Spain under the Restoration|Spanish military]] in [[Cuba]] during the [[Ten Years' War]] (1868–78) and the [[Cuban War for Independence]] (1895–98), and similar camps set up by the United States during the [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1902).&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |date=2008 |title=Concentration Camp |work=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=Sixth |publisher=Columbia University Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''concentration camp'' saw wider use around the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), when the [[British concentration camps|British operated such camps]] in South Africa for interning [[Boer]]s.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Documents re camps in Boer War |publisher=sul.stanford.edu |url=http://www-sul.stanford.edu/africa/boers.html |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609212833/http://www-sul.stanford.edu/africa/boers.html |archivedate=9 June 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; They built 45 tented camps for Boer internees and 64 for black Africans. Conditions were terrible for the health of the internees, mainly due to neglect, poor hygiene, and bad sanitation. Of the 28,000 Boer men captured as prisoners of war, the British sent 25,630 overseas. The vast majority of Boers remaining in the local camps were women and children,&lt;ref name=meredith452456/&gt; over 26,000 of whom died there.&lt;ref name=meredith452456&gt;{{cite book |title=Diamonds, Gold, and War: The British, the Boers, and the Making of South Africa Conditions were reputedly even worse in the camps where black Africans were held, but unlike in the Boer camps, death rates were not recorded in the camps where black Africans were held.|last=Meredith|first=Martin|authorlink=Martin Meredith|year=2007|edition=First|location=New York|publisher=[[PublicAffairs]]|isbn=978-1586484736|pages=452–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Boer Wars (2): 1898–1902|series=Men-at-Arms|number=303|last=Knight|first=Ian|year=2000|location=Oxford|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1855326132|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 14,000 Black Africans died in the camps.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pakenham (1991), ''The Scramble for Africa, 1876–1912'', Random House, New York. pp. 580–581.&lt;/ref&gt; Welfare campaigner [[Emily Hobhouse]] brought to the attention of the British public the appalling conditions inside the camps. The British government set up the Fawcett Commission to investigate her claims, under [[Millicent Fawcett]], which corroborated her account, and resulted in improved conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Porch, Douglas (2013). ''Counterinsurgency: Exposing the Myths of the New Way of War''. p. 73. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1904 and 1907, the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] operated concentration camps such as the [[Shark Island Concentration Camp|Shark Island]], [[Swakopmund]] and [[Lüderitz Bay]] camps in [[German South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]) as part of its [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|genocide of the Herero and Namaqua peoples]].  Eventually, the death rate of the camps reached 45%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J.

In the late 1930s, over 100,000 defeated or interned personnel of the Spanish Republican armed forces, along with civilians, were held in concentration camps by the government of France, and they included [[Meknassy|Meheri Zabbens]],&lt;ref name="Almirante Valdés VS o AV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marinarepublicana.blogspot.com/2011/08/almirante-valdes-vs-o-av.html|title=Almirante Valdés (VS o AV)|author=|date=|website=marinarepublicana.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2018 |reason=This is not written in English so it is not clear what it says.

Some of them managed to go into exile or went off to join the [[Allies of World War II|armies of the Allies]] in order to fight against the [[Axis powers]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pourlamemoire.com/reportages-tempoignages.php 24 au 26 août 1944 Libération de Paris par les chars... espagnols de la nueve]{{Dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others ended up in [[Nazi concentration camps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528190203/http://www.xtec.cat/iesrovira-forns/documents/EstimadaSisqueta.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=28 May 2013|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, the arbitrary internment of civilians by the state reached its most extreme form with the establishment of the [[Nazi concentration camps]] (1933–45). The Nazi concentration camp system was extensive, with as many as 15,000 camps&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary1"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/cclist.html ''Concentration Camp Listing''] Sourced from Van Eck, Ludo ''Le livre des Camps.''

As a result, some{{Who|date=April 2018}} say that today the term "concentration camp" may be conflated with the concept of "extermination camp" and historians debate whether the term "concentration camp" or "internment camp" should be used in order to describe other examples of civilian internment, such as the [[United States]] government's [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during World War II,&lt;ref name=euph/&gt; the Australian government's [[Australian immigration detention facilities|immigrant detention facilities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/our-detention-centres-are-intentionally-cruel-and-must-be-closed-20160504-golr04.html|title=Our detention centres are concentration camps and must be closed|first=Stephen|last=Charles|date=4 May 2016 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/australia-houses-migrants-degrading-offshore-detention-camps-n715761|title=No Pacific paradise: Trump's call to PM shines light on detention camps|author=|date=|website=nbcnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South Korea's detention camps for "undesirables" in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2016/04/19/south-korea-covered-up-mass-murder-of-vagrants-before-1988-olympics/|title=South Korea covered up mass murder of vagrants before 1988 Olympics|agency=[[Associated Press]]|author=|date=19 April 2016|website=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
