'''Internment''' is the imprisonment or confinement&lt;ref&gt;per Oxford Universal Dictionary, 1st edition 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; of people, commonly in large groups, without [[trial]]. Collins English dictionary defines internment as "the act of interning or state of being interned, esp of enemy citizens in [[war]]time or of [[terrorism]] suspects".&lt;ref&gt;internment. (n.d.). Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition. Retrieved November 03, 2014, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/internment&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while it can simply mean [[imprisonment]], it tends to refer to preventative confinement rather than confinement ''after'' having been convicted of some crime. Use of these terms is subject to debate and political sensitivities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2012/02/10/146691773/euphemisms-concentration-camps-and-the-japanese-internment Euphemisms, Concentration Camps And The Japanese Internment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interned persons may be held at [[prison]]s, or at facilities known as '''internment camps'''. In certain contexts these may be known, either officially or pejoratively, as '''concentration camps'''.  

Internment also refers to the practice of [[neutral country|neutral countries]] in time of war in detaining [[belligerent]] [[armed forces]] and equipment in their territories under the [[Hague Convention of 1907]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague05.htm |title=The Second Hague Convention, 1907 |publisher=Yale.edu |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] restricts the use of internment. Article 9 states that "No one shall be subjected to [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]] or exile."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a9 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 9], United Nations&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of internment and the term "concentration camp" ==
Early civilizations such as [[Assyria]] used [[forced resettlement]] of populations as a means of controlling territory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/hammurabi.htm |title=Laws of Hammurabi |publisher=Eawc.evansville.edu |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until much later in the late 19th and 20th centuries that records exist of groups of civilian non-combatants being concentrated into large prison camps.

The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' defines the term "Concentration camp" as: "A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions, often as a result of their membership in a group the government has identified as suspect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=concentration+camp&amp;submit.x=-664&amp;submit.y=-210|title=Concentration camp|publisher= American Heritage Dictionary|accessdate= 22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish historian [[Władysław Konopczyński]] has suggested that concentration camps originated in Poland during the [[Bar Confederation]] rebellion (1768–1772), when the [[Russian Empire]] established three camps for Polish rebel captives awaiting deportation to [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Konopczyński, Władysław. (1991), ''Konfederacja barska, t. II'', pp. 733–734.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English term originated in the ''reconcentrados'' (reconcentration camps) set up by the [[Spain under the Restoration|Spanish military]] in [[Cuba]] during the [[Ten Years' War]] (1868–1878), [[Cuban War for Independence]] (1895-1898), and by the United States during the [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1902).&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Concentration Camp |work=The Columbia Encyclopedia |edition= Sixth Edition |year=2008 |publisher=Columbia University Press}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "concentration camp" saw wider use during the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), when the [[British concentration camps|British operated such camps]] in South Africa for interning Boers.&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-sul.stanford.edu/africa/boers.html |title=Documents re camps in Boer War |publisher=sul.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; They built a total of 45 tented camps for Boer internees and 64 for black Africans. Of the 28,000 Boer men captured as prisoners of war, the British sent 25,630 overseas. The vast majority of Boers remaining in the local camps were women and children,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} over 26,000 of whom died there.

During the 20th century, the arbitrary internment of civilians by the state reached a climax with [[Nazi concentration camps]] (1933–1945). As a result, the term "concentration camp" today carries many of the connotations of "[[extermination camp]]" (or "death camp").
