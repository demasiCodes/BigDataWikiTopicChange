'''Internment''' is the imprisonment or confinement&lt;ref&gt;per Oxford Universal Dictionary, 1st edition 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; of people, commonly in large groups, without trial. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1989) gives the meaning as: "The action of 'interning'; confinement within the limits of a country or place." 

Most modern usage is about individuals, and there is a distinction between '''internment''', which is being confined usually for preventive or political reasons, and imprisonment, which is being closely confined as a punishment for crime.

''Internment'' also refers to the practice of [[neutral country|neutral countries]] in time of war in detaining belligerent armed forces and equipment in their territories under the [[Second Hague Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague05.htm The Second Hague Convention, 1907]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early civilizations such as [[Assyria]] used [[forced resettlement]] of populations as a means of controlling territory,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eawc.evansville.edu/anthology/hammurabi.htm Laws of Hammurabi]&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until much later in the late 19th and 20th centuries that records exist of groups of civilian non-combatants being concentrated into large prison camps.

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] restricts the use of internment. Article 9 states that "No one shall be subjected to [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]] or exile."

==Internment camp==
An '''internment camp''' is a large [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]] center created for political opponents, [[enemy alien]]s, people with [[mental illness]], members of specific ethnic or religious groups, civilian inhabitants of a critical war-zone, or other groups of people, usually during a war. The term is used for facilities where the inmates were selected by some generalized criteria, rather than detained as individuals after [[due process of law]] fairly applied by a [[judiciary]]. 

As a result of the mistreatment of civilians interned during World War II, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] was established in 1949 to provide for the protection of civilians during times of war "in the hands" of an enemy and under any occupation by a foreign power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/380?OpenDocument Full text of 4th Geneva Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; It was ratified by 194 nations. [[Prisoner-of-war camp]]s are internment camps intended specifically for holding members of an enemy's armed forces as defined in the [[Third Geneva Convention]], and condition of their treatment is specified in that Convention.

==Concentration camp==

The ''[[Random House Dictionary]]'' defines the term "concentration camp" as: "a guarded compound for the detention or imprisonment of aliens, members of ethnic minorities, political opponents, etc.", and, the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]'' defines it as: "A camp where civilians, enemy aliens, political prisoners, and sometimes prisoners of war are detained and confined, typically under harsh conditions."

=== Earliest usage and origins of the term===
The Polish historian Władysław Konopczyński has suggested the first concentration camps were created in Poland in the 18th century, during the [[Bar Confederation]] rebellion, when the [[Russian Empire]] established three concentration camps for Polish rebel captives awaiting deportation to [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Konopczyński, Władysław. (1991) '' Konfederacja barska, t. II'', pp. 733–734.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest of these camps may have been those set up in the United States for [[Cherokee removal|Cherokee]] and other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s in the 1830s; however, the term originated in the ''reconcentrados'' (reconcentration camps) set up by the [[Spain under the Restoration|Spanish military]] in [[Cuba]] during the [[Ten Years' War]] (1868–1878) and by the United States during the [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1902).&lt;ref name = "columbia"&gt;"Concentration Camp"], ''The Columbia Encyclopedia,'' Sixth Edition, 2008, Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English term "concentration camp" was used more widely during the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), when the British operated such camps in South Africa for interning Boers.&lt;ref name = "columbia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/africa/boers.html Documents re camps in Boer War]&lt;/ref&gt; They built a total of 45 tented camps built for Boer internees and 64 for black Africans. Of the 28,000 Boer men captured as prisoners of war, the British sent 25,630 overseas. The vast majority of Boers remaining in the local camps were women and children.

The Germans used concentration camps in [[German South-West Africa]] during the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]] between 1904 and 1907. The [[Shark Island Extermination Camp|camp at Shark Island, Namibia]] was of the nature of an [[extermination camp]].&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Madley, "From Africa to Auschwitz: How German South West Africa Incubated Ideas and Methods Adopted and Developed by the Nazis in Eastern Europe", ''European History Quarterly'' 2005 35, pp. 430–432.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shift in meaning===

During the 20th century, the arbitrary internment of civilians by the state reached a climax with [[Nazi concentration camps]] (1933–1945). As a result, the term "concentration camp" carries many of the connotations of "[[death camp]]" or "[[extermination camp]]", and is sometimes used synonymously. But Nazi concentration camps were not necessarily death camps. For example, they used some camps primarily to house [[slavery|slave labor]]: the inmates were exploited rather than killed, although many were worked to death or killed for refusing to work.
