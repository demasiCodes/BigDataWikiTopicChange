'''"Internment"''' is the imprisonment or confinement of people, commonly in large groups, without due process of law and a trial.  It also refers to the practice of [[neutral country|neutral countries]] in time of [[war]] detaining belligerent [[armed forces]] and equipment which enter their territory under the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)#Hague Convention of 1907|Second Hague Convention]].

Early civilizations such as the [[Assyria]]ns used forced resettlement of populations as a means of controlling territory, but it was not until much later that records exist of groups of civilians being concentrated into large prison camps. The most notorious of such prison camps were the [[Nazi concentration camps]].

==Internment Camps==
An '''internment camp'''  is a large [[Detention (Imprisonment)|detention]] center created for [[political dissent|political opponents]], [[enemy aliens]], specific [[ethnic group|ethnic]] or [[religion|religious groups]], [[civilian]]s of a critical [[war]]-zone, or other groups of people, usually during a war. The term is used for facilities whose inmates are selected according to some specific criteria, rather than individuals who are incarcerated after [[due process of law]] fairly applied by a [[judiciary]].

As a result of the mistreatment of civilans interned during recent conflicts, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] was established in 1949 to provide for the protection of civilians during times of war "in the hands" of an enemy and under any occupation by a foreign power. It has been ratified by 194 nations. [[Prisoner-of-war camp]]s are a specific type of internment camp intended specifically for holding members of an enemy's [[armed forces]] as defined in the [[Third Geneva Convention]], and the treatment of whom is specifed in that Convention. 

===Concentration camp===
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed. defines ''concentration camp'' as
:''a camp where non-combatants of a district are accommodated, such as those instituted by [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] during the [[South African War|South African war]] of 1899-1902; one for the internment of political prisoners, foreign nationals, etc., esp. as organized by the Nazi regime in Germany before and during the war of 1939-45''

In the English-speaking world, the term "concentration camp" was first used to describe camps operated by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in [[South Africa]] during the 1899-1902 [[Second Boer War]]. Allegedly conceived as a form of humanitarian aid to the families whose farms had been destroyed in the fighting, the camps were used to confine and control large numbers of civilians as part of a [[Scorched Earth]] tactic. A report after the war stated that 27,927 Boers (of whom 22,074 were children under 16) and 14,154 black Africans died as a result of diseases developed due to overcrowding, inadequate diets and poor sanitation in the camps. In all, about 25% of the Boer inmates and 12% of the black African ones died. The term "concentration camp" was coined at this time to signify the "concentration" of a large number of people in one place, and was used to describe both the camps in [[South Africa]] (1899-1902) and those established by the Spanish to support a similar anti-insurgency campaign in [[Cuba]] (circa 1895-1898 [http://www.spanamwar.com/proctorspeech.htm]), although at least some Spanish sources disagree with the comparison [http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/weyler.html].

Use of the word ''concentration'' comes from the idea of ''concentrating'' a group of people who are in some way undesirable in one place, where they can be watched by those who incarcerated them. For example, in a time of [[insurgency]], potential supporters of the insurgents are placed where they cannot provide them with supplies or information. 

The term ''concentration camp'' lost some of its original meaning after Nazi concentration camps were discovered, and has ever since been understood to refer to a place of mistreatment, starvation, forced labour, and murder. The expression since then has only been used in this extremely pejorative sense; no government or organization has used it to describe its own facilities, using instead terms such as ''internment camp'', ''resettlement camp'', ''detention facility'', etc, regardless of the actual circumstances of the camp, which can vary a great deal.

Over the course of the 20th century, the arbitrary internment of civilians by the authority of the state became more common and reached a climax with Nazi concentration camps and the practice of [[genocide]] in [[Nazi extermination camp]]s, and with the [[Gulag]] system of [[Labor camp|forced labor camp]]s of the [[Soviet Union]]. As a result of this trend, the term "concentration camp" carries many of the connotations of "extermination camp" and is sometimes used synonymously. A concentration camp, however, is not by definition a death-camp. For example, many of the slave [[labor camp]]s were used as cheap or free sources of factory labor for the manufacture of war materials and other goods.

Since the nature of Germany's so-called "concentration camps" (Konzentrationslager, abbreviated KL or Lager(i.e. camp), later KZ) became known, the term is sometimes used as [[propaganda]], with greater or lesser justification, to imply that a camp is designed to exterminate, rather than merely to concentrate, its inmates.
