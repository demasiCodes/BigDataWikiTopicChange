'''Same-sex marriage''', also known as '''gay marriage''', is [[marriage]] between [[same-sex relationship|people of the same sex]], either as a secular [[Civil marriage|civil ceremony]] or in a religious setting. The term '''marriage equality''' refers to a political status in which same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage are considered legally equal.

In the late 20th century, rites of marriage for same-sex couples without legal recognition became increasingly common. The first law providing for marriage of people of the same sex in modern times was enacted in 2001 in the [[Netherlands]]. {{As of|2017|11|15|df=y}}, same-sex marriage is legally recognized (nationwide or in some parts) in the following countries: [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]], [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]], [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]], [[Same-sex marriage in Finland|Finland]], [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Germany|Germany]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]], [[Same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Same-sex marriage in Malta|Malta]], [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico|Mexico]],&lt;ref group="nb" name="Mexico"&gt;Same-sex marriage is legal in the states of [[Same-sex marriage in Baja California|Baja California]], [[Same-sex marriage in Campeche|Campeche]], [[Same-sex marriage in Chiapas|Chiapas]], [[Same-sex marriage in Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], [[Same-sex marriage in Coahuila|Coahuila]], [[Same-sex marriage in Colima|Colima]], [[Same-sex marriage in Jalisco|Jalisco]], [[Same-sex marriage in Michoacán|Michoacán]], [[Same-sex marriage in Morelos|Morelos]], [[Same-sex marriage in Nayarit|Nayarit]], [[Same-sex marriage in Puebla|Puebla]], [[Same-sex marriage in Quintana Roo|Quintana Roo]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|Mexico City]] as well as in some municipalities in [[Same-sex marriage in Querétaro|Querétaro]].

Introduction of same-sex marriage laws has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through legislative change to [[marriage laws]], a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or by direct popular vote (via [[ballot initiative]] or [[referendum]]). The recognition of same-sex marriage is a political and social issue, and also a religious issue in many countries, and debates continue to arise over whether people in same-sex relationships should be allowed marriage or some similar status (a [[civil union]]).&lt;ref name=MuslimWaPo&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Pamela K.|title=Marriage: Both Civil and Religious|url=http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2009/07/31/marriage-both-civil-and-religious/3855|accessdate=15 July 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Susan K.|title=Marriage a Civil Right, not Sacred Rite|url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/susan_k_smith/2009/07/marriage_a_civil_right_not_sacred_rite.html|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision in Perry v.

Same-sex marriage can provide those in same-sex relationships who pay their taxes with government services and make financial demands on them comparable to those afforded to and required of those in opposite-sex marriages. Same-sex marriage also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights.&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Administration and Policy&amp;nbsp;— Page 13, Wallace Swan – 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religious views on same-sex marriage|Various faith communities]] around the world support allowing those of the same sex to marry, while many major religions oppose same-sex marriage.

==Terminology==
===Alternative terms===
Some proponents of legal recognition of same-sex marriage, such as [[Freedom to Marry]] and [[Canadians for Equal Marriage]], use the terms ''marriage equality'' and ''equal marriage'' to indicate that they seek equal benefit of marriage laws as opposed to special rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/issues/marriageequality/|title=Marriage Equality|publisher=Garden State Equality|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/marriage-101#faq3|title=Marriage 101|publisher=[[Freedom to Marry]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:AENN&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=13F21B414EDA8168&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46|title=Albany area real estate and the Marriage Equality Act|date=29 May 2012|work=Albany Examiner|accessdate=25 December 2012|author=Pratt, Patricia|quote=On July 24, 2011 the Marriage Equality Act became a law in New York State forever changing the state's legal view of what a married couple is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote on Illinois marriage equality bill coming in January: sponsors|url=http://chicagophoenix.com/2012/12/13/illinois-marriage-equality-vote-january|accessdate=23 December 2012|newspaper=Chicago Phoenix|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission endorses marriage and adoption equality|url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/human-rights-environment/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity/commission-endorses-marriage-and-adoption-equality|publisher=Human Right Commission New Zealand|accessdate=23 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202132031/http://www.hrc.co.nz/human-rights-environment/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity/commission-endorses-marriage-and-adoption-equality|archivedate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulholland|first=Helene|title=Ed Miliband calls for gay marriage equality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/27/ed-miliband-gay-wedding-equality|accessdate=23 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London, UK|date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ring"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2012/12/20/newt-gingrich-accepts-marriage-equality-inevitable|title=Newt Gingrich: Marriage Equality Inevitable, OK|author=Ring, Trudy|work=The Advocate|location=Los Angeles|date=20 December 2012|quote=He [Newt Gingrich] noted to HuffPo that he not only has a lesbian half-sister, LGBT rights activist Candace Gingrich, but has gay friends who've gotten married in Iowa, where their unions are legal.

Opponents of the legalization of same-sex marriage sometimes characterize it as ''redefining marriage'' or ''redefined marriage'', especially in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=State lacks authority to redefine marriage, says bishop|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/state-lacks-authority-to-redefine-marriage-says-bishop/|work=Catholic News Agency|publisher=CNA|accessdate=20 December 2013|date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Redefining marriage, one dictionary at a time|url=http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/redefining-marriage-one-dictionary-time|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=MSNBC|date=18 July 2013|author=Will Rabbe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''homosexual marriage'' is generally used by organisations opposed to same-sex marriage such as the [[Family Research Council]] in the United States;&lt;ref name="ssm concerns"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten Arguments From Social Science Against Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://www.frc.org/issuebrief/ten-arguments-from-social-science-against-same-sex-marriage|website=FRC.org|publisher=[[Family Research Council]]|accessdate=4 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928075625/http://www.frc.org/issuebrief/ten-arguments-from-social-science-against-same-sex-marriage|archivedate=28 September 2015|deadurl=no|quote=...it is unlikely that homosexual marriage would domesticate men in the way that heterosexual marriage does.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that term is rarely used in the mainstream press.&lt;ref name=scarequotes/&gt;

[[AP Stylebook|Associated Press style]] recommends the usages ''marriage for gays and lesbians'' or in space-limited headlines ''gay marriage'' with no hyphen and no scare quotes. The Associated Press warns that the construct ''gay marriage'' can imply that marriages of same-sex couples are somehow legally different from those of mixed-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Robyn|title=When I Get Married, Will It Be a 'Gay Marriage'?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robyn-harper/marriage-equality_b_1572611.html|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper |first=Robyn |title=My Marriage Won't Be a 'Gay Marriage' |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/my-marriage-wont-gay-marriage-11514384.html?cat=41|accessdate=28 September 2012|publisher=Yahoo!|date=30 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928202736/http://voices.yahoo.com/my-marriage-wont-gay-marriage-11514384.html?cat=41|archivedate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of the term ''marriage''===
Anthropologists have struggled to determine a definition of marriage that absorbs commonalities of the [[social construct]] across cultures around the world.&lt;ref name=Fedorak&gt;{{cite book|last=Fedorak|first=Shirley A.|title=Anthropology matters!|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=[Toronto], Ont.|isbn=1442601086|pages=Ch. 11; p. 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gough&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gough|first=Kathleen E.|title=The Nayars and the Definition of Marriage|journal=The Journal of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]]|date=Jan–Jun 1959 |volume=89|issue=1|pages=23–34|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/2844434|accessdate=28 September 2012|doi=10.2307/2844434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many proposed definitions have been criticized for failing to recognize the existence of same-sex marriage in some cultures, including in more than 30 [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African cultures]], such as the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]].&lt;ref name=Gough/&gt;&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stephen O.|title=Boy-wives and female husbands : studies of African homosexualities|year=2001|publisher=St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=0312238290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjbESL6YWU0C&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;ots=WdlOOaKAAq&amp;dq=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;f=false|edition=1st pbk.|author2=Roscoe, Will}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kikuyu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Njambi|first=Wairimu|author2=O'Brien, William|title=Revisiting "Woman-Woman Marriage": Notes on Gikuyu Women|journal=[[NWSA Journal]]|date=Spring 2001|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–23|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/nwsa_journal/v012/12.1njambi.html|accessdate=28 September 2012|doi=10.1353/nwsa.2000.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With several countries revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their definition of the word ''marriage'' to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dictionaries take lead in redefining modern marriage|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/24/20040524-103201-1169r|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=24 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite web|title=Webster Makes It Official: Definition of Marriage Has Changed|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/webster_makes_it_official_definition_of_marriage_has_changed|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Redman|first=Daniel|title=Noah Webster Gives His Blessing: Dictionaries recognize same-sex marriage—who knew?|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2215628|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)]]|date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Dershowitz]] and others have suggested reserving the word ''marriage'' for religious contexts as part of [[privatizing marriage]], and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of [[civil union]]s, in part to strengthen the [[separation between church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rossde.com/editorials/Dershowitz_marriage.html|title=Government Should Quit the Marriage Business|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Dershowitz, Alan M.|authorlink=Alan Dershowitz|date=3 December 2003|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Roback Morse]], the president of the anti-same-sex marriage group [[National Organization for Marriage]]'s Ruth Institute project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruthinstitute.org/pages/boardMembers.html|title=Board of Advisors|publisher=Ruth Institute|accessdate=6 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004193603/http://ruthinstitute.org/pages/boardMembers.html|archivedate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the conflation of marriage with contractual agreements is a threat to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/morse200405200926.asp|title=''Not'' a Social Contract|work=[[National Review]]|author=Morse, Jennifer Roback|authorlink=Jennifer Roback Morse|date=20 May 2004|accessdate=8 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029161345/http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/morse200405200926.asp|archivedate=29 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publications that oppose same-sex marriage, such as ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' and [[Baptist Press]], have an editorial style policy of placing the word ''marriage'' in [[scare quotes]] ("marriage") when it is used in reference to same-sex couples.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In the United States, the mainstream press has generally abandoned this practice.&lt;ref name=scarequotes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/02/25/washington-times-scare-quotes-are-history/|title=Washington Times Scare Quotes Are History|work=Washington City Paper|author=Wemple, Erik|date=25 February 2008|accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cliff Kincaid of the conservative [[Accuracy in Media]] argued for use of quotation marks on the grounds that marriage was a legal status denied same-sex couples by most U.S. state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/honest-versus-slanted-journalism/|title=Honest Versus Slanted Journalism|publisher=[[Accuracy In Media]]|author=Kincaid, Cliff|date=26 February 2004|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage supporters argue that the use of scare quotes is an editorialization that implies illegitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/b/2004/05/21/washington-times-dismisses-gay-marriages.htm|title=Washington Times Dismisses Gay "Marriages"|publisher=About.com|author=Cline, Austin|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
The [[American Anthropological Association]] stated on February 26, 2004:&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. Rather, anthropological research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Research findings from 1998–2015 from the [[University of Virginia]], [[Michigan State University]], [[Florida State University]], the [[University of Amsterdam]], the [[New York State Psychiatric Institute]], [[Stanford University]], the [[University of California-San Francisco]], the [[University of California-Los Angeles]], [[Tufts University]], [[Boston Medical Center]], the Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health and independent researchers also support the findings of this study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Same-sex marriage and children’s well-being: Research roundup|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/gender-society/same-sex-marriage-children-well-being-research-roundup|accessdate=29 December 2015|work=Journalist's Resource|date=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a [[Columbia University]] [[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health|Mailman School of Public Health]] study examining the effects of institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of [[anxiety disorders]], among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author, the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasin|first=Deborah|title=Lesbian, gay, bisexual individuals risk psychiatric disorders from discriminatory policies|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/cums-lgb030210.php|publisher=[[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health]]|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite news|title=New study suggests bans on gay marriage hurt mental health of LGB people|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-sexual-continuum/201003/new-study-suggests-bans-gay-marriage-hurt-mental-health-lgb-people|accessdate=8 November 2010|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=22 March 2010|author= Brian Mustanski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay activist [[Jonathan Rauch]] has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rauch|first=Jonathan|title=For Better or Worse?

''Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America.'' New York, NY: Henry Holt and Company, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Herek, Gregory M. "Legal recognition of same-sex relationships in the United States: A social science perspective." ''American Psychologist,'' Vol 61(6), September 2006, pp. 607–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Psychological Association]] stated in 2004: "...Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status and so on." It has also averred that same-sex couples who may only enter into a civil union, as opposed to a marriage, "are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to those of married couples," which has adverse effects on the well-being of same-sex partners.&lt;ref name="psychological"/&gt;

===Parenting===
Many psychologist organizations have concluded that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents' relationship is recognized and supported by society's institutions, e.g. civil marriage. For example, the [[Canadian Psychological Association]] stated in 2006 that "parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union."&lt;ref name=cpa2006 /&gt; The CPA stated in 2003 the stressors encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent.&lt;ref name=cpa2006 /&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded in 2006, in an analysis published in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'':&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;
{{quote|There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. These data have demonstrated no risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with 1 or more gay parents. Conscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, can be excellent parents. The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.}}

===Opinion polling===
[[File:Rainbow flag breeze.jpg|thumb| LGBT [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow flag]]]]
Numerous polls and studies on the issue have been conducted, including those that were completed throughout the first decade of the 21st century. A consistent trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage has been revealed across the world. Much of the research that was conducted in developed countries in the first decade of the 21st century shows a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage.

Recent polling in the [[United States]] has shown a further increase in public support for same-sex marriage. When adults were asked in 2005 if they thought "marriages between homosexuals should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages", 28 percent replied in the affirmative, while 68 percent replied in the negative (the remaining 4 percent stated that they were unsure). When adults were asked in March 2013 if they supported or opposed same-sex marriage, 50 percent said they supported same-sex marriage, while 41 percent were opposed, and the remaining 9 percent stated that they were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law and Civil Rights|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm|work=PollingReport.com|publisher=POLLING REPORT, INC|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various detailed polls and studies on same-sex marriage that were conducted in several countries show that support for same-sex marriage generally increases with higher levels of education and decreases with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey&amp;nbsp;– Generations at Odds: The Millennial Generation and the Future of Gay and Lesbian Rights|url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/08/generations-at-odds|publisher=[[Public Religion Research Institute]] |accessdate=25 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025004814/http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/08/generations-at-odds|archivedate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pew Forum: Part 2: Gay Marriage|url=http://www.pewforum.org/PublicationPage.aspx?id=647|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=25 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910053311/http://www.pewforum.org/PublicationPage.aspx?id=647|archivedate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poirier|first=Justine|title=Same-Sex Marriage: Let's Make a Change|url=http://www.montrealites.ca/justice/same-sex-marriage-lets-make-a-change.html|publisher=Montréalités Justice|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Data Points: Support for Legal Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Chart-Support-for-Legal/64683/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support for Same‐Sex Marriage in Latin America|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/insights/I0844.enrevised.pdf|publisher=[[Vanderbilt University]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of same-sex unions|Timeline of same-sex marriage|History of homosexuality}}

===Ancient===
A reference to same-sex marriage (by the Egyptians and Canaanites) exists in the Talmud. The Old Testament prohibited homosexual relations (Lev. 18:22, 20:13), and the Jewish sages provide the reason for this as being that the Hebrews were warned not to "follow the acts of the land of Egypt or the acts of the land of Canaan." The sages explicitly state: "what did [the Egyptians and Canaanites] do? A man would marry a man and a woman [marry] a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Joel Roth.

The first Roman emperor to have married a man was [[Nero]], who is reported to have married two other males on different occasions. The first was with one of Nero's own [[Freedman|freedmen]], [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]], with whom Nero took the role of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, CA., ''Roman Homosexuality: Second Edition'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as a groom, Nero married [[Sporus]], a young boy, to replace the adolescent female concubine he had killed&lt;ref name="dio-history-LXII-28"&gt;Nero missed her so greatly that, on learning of a woman who resembled her, he sent for her and kept her; but later he caused a boy of the freedmen, whom he used to call Sporus, ... "he formally "married" Sporus, and assigned the boy a regular dowry according to contract;" q.v., Suetonius ''Nero'' 28; Dio Cassius '' Epitome '' 62.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62.html |title=Bill Thayer's Web Site |website=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married him in a very public ceremony with all the solemnities of matrimony, after which Sporus was forced to pretend to be the female concubine that Nero had killed and act as though they were really married.&lt;ref name="dio-history-LXII-28"/&gt; A friend gave the "bride" away as required by law.

It should be noted, however, that ''conubium'' existed only between a ''civis Romanus'' and a ''civis Romana'' (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citizen), so that a marriage between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases).&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, ''The Roman Law of Marriage'' (Oxford, 1969), pp. 24–28; Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), pp. 43–49.; "Marriages where the partners had ''conubium'' were marriages valid in Roman law (''iusta matrimonia'')" [Treggiari, p. 49]. Compare Ulpian (''Tituli Ulpiani'') 5.3–5: "''Conubium'' is the capacity to marry a wife in Roman law. Roman citizens have ''conubium'' with Roman citizens, but with Latins and foreigners only if the privilege was granted. There is no ''conubium'' with slaves"; compare also Gaius (''Institutionum'' 1:55–56, 67, 76–80).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Susan Treggiari, "''matrimonium'' was then an institution involving a mother, ''mater''. The idea implicit in the word is that a man took a woman in marriage, ''in matrimonium ducere'', so that he might have children by her."&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 342 AD, Christian emperors [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]] issued a law in the [[Theodosian Code]] (''C. Th.'' 9.7.3) prohibiting [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|same-sex marriage in Rome]] and ordering execution for those so married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuefler|first=Mathew|year=2007|title=The Marriage Revolution in Late Antiquity: The Theodosian Code and Later Roman Marriage Law|journal=Journal of Family History|volume=32|pages=343–370|url=http://jfh.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/32/4/343|doi=10.1177/0363199007304424|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
Writing in ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'' in 2013, legal historian [[Michael Klarman]] wrote that while there was a growth of gay rights activism in the 1970s United States, "Marriage equality was not then a priority."

Denmark was the first country to recognize a legal relationship for same-sex couples, establishing "registered partnerships" in 1989.

However, the ECHR stated in ''Schalk and Kopf v Austria'' that this provision was intended to limit marriage to heterosexual relationships, as it used the term "men and women" instead of "everyone".&lt;ref name="CASE OF SCHALK AND KOPF v.

Belgium became the second country in the world to legally recognize same-sex marriages when a bill passed by the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]] took effect on 1 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2003/01/31/Belgium-legalizes-gay-marriage/UPI-46741044012415/|title=Belgium legalizes gay marriage|publisher=UPI|date=31 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Belgium allowed the marriages of foreign same-sex couples only if their country of origin also allowed these unions, however legislation enacted in October 2004 permits any couple to marry if at least one of the spouses has lived in the country for a minimum of three months. A 2006 statute legalized [[LGBT adoption|adoption by same-sex spouses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euronews.net/2005/12/02/belgium-moves-to-allow-gay-adoption/|title=Belgium moves to allow gay adoption|publisher=Euronews|date=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
{{Main article|Same-sex marriage in Brazil}}
{{Same-sex marriage map South America|align=left}}
[[Supreme Federal Court|Brazil's Supreme Court]] ruled in May 2011 that same-sex couples are legally entitled to legal recognition of cohabitation (known as {{lang|pt|''união estável''}}, one of the two possible ''family entities'' in Brazilian legislation, it includes all family and married couple rights in Brazil – besides automatic opt-in for one of four systems of property share and automatic right to inheritance –, and was available for all same-sex couples since the same date), turning same-sex marriage legally possible as a consequence, and just stopping short of equalization of same-sex marriage (potentially confusing, a civil marriage or {{lang|pt|''casamento civil''}} is often rendered as {{lang|pt|''união civil''}} in legal Brazilian Portuguese; a same-sex marriage is a {{lang|pt|''casamento civil homoafetivo''}} or an {{lang|pt|''união civil homoafetiva''}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazil's supreme court recognizes gay partnerships|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/06/us-brazil-gayrights-idUSTRE74503V20110506|accessdate=16 February 2012|agency=Reuters|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between mid-2011 and May 2013, same-sex couples had their cohabitation issues converted into marriages in several Brazil states with the approval of a state judge. All legal Brazilian marriages were always recognized all over Brazil.&lt;ref name="WPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/brazil-judge-approves-what-appears-to-be-countrys-first-gay-marriage-between-2-men/2011/06/27/AGYN2znH_story.html|title=Brazilian judge gives male couple approval for what court says is country's first gay marriage|date=27 June 2011|work=The Washington Post|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zsXujTvb?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/brazil-judge-approves-what-appears-to-be-countrys-first-gay-marriage-between-2-men/2011/06/27/AGYN2znH_story.html|archivedate=2 July 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, the Court of Bahia equalized marriage in the state of [[Bahia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5.tjba.jus.br/corregedoria/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=420:uniaohomoafetiva&amp;catid=31:noticias&amp;Itemid=142 |title=Provimento Conjunto trata de união homoafetiva |work=Tribunal de Justiça do Estado da Bahia (official web site of the state supreme court) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927065759/http://www5.tjba.jus.br/corregedoria/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=420%3Auniaohomoafetiva&amp;catid=31%3Anoticias&amp;Itemid=142|archivedate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brasil247.com/pt/247/bahia247/86361/Bahia-já-pode-oficializar-casamento-homoafetivo.htm|language=Portuguese|date=27 November 2012|title=Bahia já pode oficializar casamento homoafetivo|work=brasil247.com|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] likewise had same-sex marriage allowed in demand by court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norma do TJ obriga cartórios de SP a registrar casamento gay|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/1203680-norma-do-tj-obriga-cartorios-de-sp-a-registrar-casamento-gay.shtml|newspaper=Folha de S. Paulo|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriages also became equalized in relation to opposite-sex ones between January 2012 and April 2013 by court order in Alagoas, Ceará, Espírito Santo, the Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraíba, Paraná, Piauí, Rondônia, Santa Catarina and Sergipe, and in Santa Rita do Sapucaí, a municipality in Minas Gerais; in Rio de Janeiro, the State Court facilitated its realization by district judges in agreement with the equalization (instead of ordering notaries to accept same-sex marriages in demand as all others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virgula.uol.com.br/ver/noticia/lifestyle/2013/04/20/324152-rio-de-janeiro-retira-impedimentos-a-casamento-entre-gays|title=Rio de Janeiro state legalizes gay marriage|date=17 April 2013|accessdate= 22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 2013, the Justice's [[National Justice Council|National Council of Brazil]] issued a ruling requiring all civil registers of the country to perform same-sex marriages by a 14–1 vote, thus legalizing same-sex marriage in the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/cidades,cnj-obriga-cartorios-a-celebrar-casamento-entre-homossexuais,1031678,0.htm |title=CNJ obriga cartórios a celebrar casamento entre homossexuais |publisher=Estadao.com.br |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2013/05/apos-uniao-estavel-gay-podera-casar-em-cartorio-decide-cnj.html|title=G1 - Decisão do CNJ obriga cartórios a fazer casamento homossexual - notícias em Política|work=Política|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jb.com.br/pais/noticias/2013/05/14/cnj-obriga-cartorios-a-converterem-uniao-estavel-gay-em-casamento/|title=Jornal do Brasil|work=Jornal do Brasil|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution came into effect on 16 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.cnj.jus.br/dje/jsp/dje/DownloadDeDiario.jsp?dj=DJ89_2013-ASSINADO.PDF&amp;statusDoDiario=ASSINADO DIÁRIO DA JUSTIÇA CONSELHO NACIONAL DE JUSTIÇA Edição nº 89/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2013/05/regra-que-obriga-cartorios-fazer-casamento-gay-vale-partir-do-dia-16.html Regra que obriga cartórios a fazer casamento gay vale a partir do dia 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, polls suggested that 47% of Brazilians supported marriage equalization and 57% supported adoption equalization for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portugues.christianpost.com/news/quase-metade-dos-internautas-brasileiros-aprova-o-casamento-gay-15398/ Almost half of Brazilian internet users support gay marriage], christianpost.com; accessed 5 July 2017. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polls in June 2013 also supported the conclusion that the division of opinion between acceptance and rejection of same-sex marriage is in about equal halves. When the distinction between same-sex unions that are not termed marriages in relation to same-sex marriage is made, the difference in the numbers of approval and disapproval is still insignificant, below 1%; the most frequent reason for disapproval is a supposed 'unnaturalness' of same-sex relationships, followed by religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telelistas.net/blog/62-das-pessoas-nao-aprovam-o-casamento-gay-segundo-enquete/ 62% of people aren't approving of gay marriage, according to poll – Telelistas] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.gospelmais.com.br/pesquisa-maioria-brasileiros-contra-casamento-gay-55261.html A majority of Brazilians is against same-sex marriage and regards church as the most trustworthy institution, reveals research – Gospel+] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{Main article|Same-sex marriage in Canada}}
Legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Canada followed a series of constitutional challenges based on the [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|equality provisions]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. In the first such case, ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'', same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in [[Same-sex marriage in Ontario|Ontario]] on 14 January 2001 were subsequently validated when the [[common law]], mixed-sex definition of marriage was held to be unconstitutional. Similar rulings had legalized same-sex marriage in eight provinces and one territory when the ''2005 [[Civil Marriage Act]]'' defined marriage throughout Canada as "the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others."

====Colombia====
{{Main article|Same-sex marriage in Colombia}}
Same-sex marriage has been legal in Colombia since April 2016. The country's [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]] ruled, on 28 April 2016 that same-sex couples are allowed to enter into civil marriages in the country and that judges and notaries are barred from refusing to perform same-sex weddings.&lt;ref name="April 28, 2016 ruling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/justicia/matrimonio-gay-corte-constitucional-le-daria-el-si-definitivo/16575865|title=Corte Constitucional da el sí definitivo y avala el matrimonio gay - Justicia - El Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|last=Tiempo|work=eltiempo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/colombia-legalizes-same-sex-marriage/a-19223822|title=Colombia legalizes same-sex marriage|work=Deutsche Welle|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wradio.com.co/noticias/actualidad/corte-legaliza-el-matrimonio-entre-parejas-del-mismo-sexo/20160428/nota/3119179.aspx|title=Corte legaliza el matrimonio entre parejas del mismo sexo|date=28 April 2016|work=W Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 2016, the Court ruled that marriage doesn't only apply to opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/justicia/corte-aprueba-matrimonio-homosexual/16557410|title=Histórico: Colombia tiene matrimonio homosexual|work=El Tiempo|date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecitypaperbogota.com/news/colombia-says-yes-to-gay-marriage/10653|title=Colombia says 'I do' to gay marriage|date=7 April 2016|work=The City Paper Bogota}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/04/07/colombia-high-court-rules-in-favor-of-same-sex-marriage/|title=Colombia high court rules in favor of same-sex marriage|work=Washington Blade|date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Colombia-Legalizes-Gay-Marriage-Huge-Victory-for-LGBTI-Rights-20160407-0041.html|title=Colombia Legalizes Gay Marriage, Huge Victory for LGBTI Rights|date=7 April 2016|work=TeleSur (English)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all advances in relationship recognition rights for same-sex couples has come from sweeping rulings of the Court. A series of rulings by the court that started in February 2007 meant that same-sex couples could apply for all the rights that heterosexual couples have in de facto unions (''uniones de hecho'').&lt;ref name="2009 ruling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-029-2009.pdf|title=Decision C-029 of 2009|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-10938.html Colombian court confirms equal rights for same-sex couples], Pink News, 30 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2011, the Constitutional Court of Colombia ordered the Congress to pass the legislation giving same-sex couples similar rights to marriage by 20 June 2013. If such a law were not passed by then, same-sex couples would be granted these rights automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-577-2011.pdf|title=DECISION C-577/11 The homosexuals have the right to form a family|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/07/27/colombia.gay.marriage/|work=CNN| title=Colombian court says Congress must decide on gay marriage|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
{{main article|Same-sex marriage in France}}
Since November 1999, France has a [[Civil solidarity pact|civil union]] law that is open to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples. Following the election of [[François Hollande]] as President of France in May 2012 and the subsequent legislative election in which the Socialist Party took a majority of seats in the French National Assembly, the new Prime Minister [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] stated that a same-sex marriage bill had been drafted and would be passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Marriage Will Soon Become Legal in France, Big Win for LGBT Rights in Europe|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iCHjEwL13Lmoqv92kvpq7ADOWPlw|publisher=AFP|accessdate=3 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228011837/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iCHjEwL13Lmoqv92kvpq7ADOWPlw|archivedate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Government introduced a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, ''[[Bill 344 (2012)|Bill 344]]'', in the National Assembly on 17 November 2012. Article 1 of the bill defining marriage as an agreement between two people was passed on 2 February 2013 in its first reading by a 249–97 vote. On 12 February 2013, the National Assembly approved the entire bill in a 329–229 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France's parliament passes gay marriage bill|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/02/12/france-gay-marriage-adoption.html|accessdate=24 April 2013|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2013, the upper house of the French Parliament voted to legalise same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French senate votes to legalise gay marriage|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22126437|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April 2013, the law was approved by the National Assembly in a 331–225 vote.&lt;ref name="Same-sex marriage: France"&gt;{{cite news|title=Same-sex marriage: French parliament approves new law|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22261494|publisher=BBC News Europe|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Law No.2013-404'' grants same-sex couples living in France, including foreigners provided at least one of the partners has their domicile or residence in France, the legal right to get married. The law also allows the recognition in France of same-sex couples' marriages that occurred abroad before the bill's enactment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lesur|first=Lionel|title=France Allows Same-Sex Marriages|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/france-allows-same-sex-marriages|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=13 June 2013|author2=Lisa A. Linsky|author3=McDermott Will &amp; Emery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement of the French Parliament's vote results, those in opposition to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in France participated in public protests. In both [[Paris]] and [[Lyon]], violence erupted as protesters clashed with police; the issue has mobilised right-wing forces in the country, including neo-Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hollande calls for calm as gay marriage opponents vow to fight on in France |url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/04/24/hollande-calls-for-calm-as-gay-marriage-opponents-vow-to-fight-on-in-france/ |accessdate=25 April 2013 |newspaper=Euronews|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main right-wing opposition party UMP challenged the law in the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], which had one month to rule on whether the law conformed to the Constitution. The Constitutional Council had previously ruled that the issue of same-sex marriage was one for the Parliament to decide and there was only little hope for UMP to overturn the Parliament's vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Décision n° 2010–92 QPC du 28 janvier 2011|url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2011/2010-92-qpc/decision-n-2010-92-qpc-du-28-janvier-2011.52612.html|work=Les décisions|publisher=Conseil Constitutionel|accessdate=24 April 2013|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 2013, the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] declared the bill legal in its entire redaction. President Hollande signed it into law on 18 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/2013/2013-669-dc/communique-de-presse.137047.html Communiqué de presse – 2013-669 DC – Loi ouvrant le mariage aux couples de personnes de même sexe], [[Constitutional Council of France]]; retrieved 17 May 2013.{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
{{main article|Same-sex marriage in Germany}}
Same-sex marriage has been legal in Germany since 1 October 2017. A bill recognising marriages and adoption rights for same-sex couples passed the [[Bundestag]] on 30 June 2017 after the ruling [[CDU/CSU]] Coalition Government, led by [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]], allowed parliamentarians a [[conscience vote]] on the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/europe/germany-gay-marriage.html|title=Parliament in Germany Approves Same-Sex Marriage|last=Smale|first=Alison|date=30 June 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=30 June 2017|last2=Shimer|first2=David|language=en-US|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703142747/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/europe/germany-gay-marriage.html|archivedate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous attempts by smaller parties to introduce same-sex marriage were blocked by the CDU/CSU over several years. The bill was signed into law by [[President of Germany|German President]] [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] on 20 July and came into effect on 1 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-equalmarriage/germanys-first-same-sex-i-dos-as-marriage-equality-dawns-idUKKCN1C50TA|title=Germany's first same-sex "I do"'s as marriage equality dawns|work=[[Reuters]]|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the legalisation of same-sex marriage, Germany was one of the first countries to legislate [[Civil union|registered partnerships]] (''Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft'') for same-sex couples, which provided most though not all the rights of marriage. The law came into effect on 1 August 2001, and the act was progressively amended on subsequent occasions to reflect [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|court]] rulings expanding the rights of registered partners.

====Iceland====
{{Main article|Same-sex marriage in Iceland}}
Same-sex marriage was introduced in Iceland through legislation establishing a gender-neutral definition of marriage introduced by the Coalition Government of the [[Social Democratic Alliance]] and [[Left-Green Movement]]. The legislation was passed unanimously by the Icelandic [[Althing]] on 11 June 2010, and took effect on 27 June 2010, replacing an earlier system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65A3V020100611|title=Iceland passes gay marriage law in unanimous vote|agency=Reuters|date= 11 June 2010|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/06/28/new-gay-marriage-law-in-iceland-comes-into-force/|title=New gay marriage law in Iceland comes into force|work=Icenews|date= 28 June 2010|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] and her partner were among the first married same-sex couples in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/iceland/7858150/Iceland-PM-weds-as-gay-marriage-legalised.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Iceland PM weds as gay marriage legalised|date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====

Ireland held a [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015|referendum]] on 22 May 2015. The referendum proposed to add to the [[Irish Constitution]]: "marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex". The proposal approved; with 62% of voters supporting same-sex marriage. On 29 August 2015, the Irish President, [[Michael D. Higgins]], signed the result of the May referendum into law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/president-signs-same-sex-marriage-into-constitution-1.2333882|title=President signs same-sex marriage into Constitution|date=29 August 2015|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made Ireland the first country in the world to approve same-sex marriage at a nationwide referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/vote2015/2015/0523/703205-referendum-byelection/|title=Ireland says Yes to same-sex marriage|publisher=RTE|date=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage became formally legally recognised in Ireland on 16 November 2015.&lt;ref name="legal123"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34810598|title=Same-sex marriage is now legal in Republic of Ireland|work=BBC News|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the ''Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010'' allowed same sex couples to enter civil partnerships. The Act came into force on 1 January 2011 and gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar to, but not equal to, those of civil marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/partnership-laws-come-into-force-1.869456 |title=Partnership laws come into force |publisher=The Irish Times |date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta has recognized same-sex unions since April 2014, following the enactment of the ''Civil Unions Act'', first introduced in September 2013. It established civil unions with same rights, responsibilities, and obligations as marriage, including the right of joint adoption and recognition of foreign same sex marriage.&lt;ref name="tvm.com.mt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvm.com.mt/news/aggornat-ryan-u-jamie-jirregistraw-l-ewwel-zwieg-gay-fmalta|title=Aġġornat: Ryan u Jaime jirreġistraw l-ewwel żwieġ gay f'Malta - TVM|work=TVM|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of Malta|Maltese Parliament]] gave final approval to the legislation on 14 April 2014 by a vote of 37 in favour and 30 abstentions.

Same-sex couples can marry in [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|Mexico City]] and in the states of [[Same-sex marriage in Baja California|Baja California]], [[Same-sex marriage in Campeche|Campeche]], [[Same-sex marriage in Chiapas|Chiapas]], [[Same-sex marriage in Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], [[Same-sex marriage in Coahuila|Coahuila]], [[Same-sex marriage in Colima|Colima]], [[Same-sex marriage in Jalisco|Jalisco]], [[Same-sex marriage in Michoacán|Michoacán]], [[Same-sex marriage in Morelos|Morelos]], [[Same-sex marriage in Nayarit|Nayarit]], [[Same-sex marriage in Puebla|Puebla]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Quintana Roo|Quintana Roo]] as well as in some municipalities in [[Same-sex marriage in Querétaro|Querétaro]]. In individual cases, same-sex couples have been given judicial approval to marry in all other states. Since August 2010, same-sex marriages performed within Mexico are recognized by the 31 states without exception.

On 21 December 2009, [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|the Federal District]]'s [[Legislative Assembly of the Federal District|Legislative Assembly]] legalized same-sex marriages and [[gay adoption|adoption by same-sex couples]]. The law was enacted eight days later and became effective in early March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|publisher=MSNBC|title=Mexico City's gay marriage law takes effect|date=4 March 2010|url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35714490/ns/world_news-americas/|accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August 2010, the [[Mexican Supreme Court]] ruled that while not every state must grant same-sex marriages, they must all recognize those performed where they are legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-10932748|publisher=BBC News|title=Supreme court rules gay weddings valid in all Mexico|date=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2014, the Congress of Coahuila approved adoptions by same-sex couples and a bill legalizing same-sex marriages passed on 1 September 2014 making Coahuila the second state to reform its Civil Code to allow for legal same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aprueban matrimonios gay en Coahuila|date=1 September 2014|url=http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/apruebanmatrimoniosgayencoahuila-2155742.html|publisher=Vangardia.com.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took effect on 17 September, and the first couple married on 20 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=19500&amp;MediaType=1&amp;Category=24|title=First Gay Couple Marries In Coahuila, Mexico|date=21 September 2014|publisher=On Top Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2015, the Governor of Chihuahua announced that his administration would no longer oppose same-sex marriages within the state. The order was effective immediately, thus making Chihuahua the third state to legalize such unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexico state of Chihuahua officially approves same-sex marriage|date=2015-06-12|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/mexico-state-chihuahua-officially-approves-same-sex-marriage120615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexican state to allow same-sex marriage| date=2015-06-12|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/06/12/mexican-state-to-allow-same-sex-marriage/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 2015, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation]] released a "jurisprudential thesis" which deems the state-laws defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman unconstitutional. The ruling standardized court procedures across Mexico to authorize same-sex marriages.

====Netherlands====
{{Main article|Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands}}
The Netherlands was the first country to extend marriage laws to include same-sex couples, following the recommendation of a special commission appointed to investigate the issue in 1995. A same-sex marriage bill passed the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] and the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] in 2000, taking effect on 1 April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/20/world/same-sex-dutch-couples-gain-marriage-and-adoption-rights.html|title=Same-Sex Dutch Couples Gain Marriage and Adoption Rights|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 2000|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Caribbean Netherlands|Dutch Caribbean special municipalities]] of [[Bonaire]], [[Sint Eustatius]] and [[Saba]], marriage is open to same-sex couples.

{{See also|De facto union in Portugal}}
Portugal created de facto unions ({{lang|pt|''união de facto''}} in legal European Portuguese) similar to common-law marriage for cohabiting opposite-sex partners in 1999, and extended these unions to same-sex couples in 2001. However, the 2001 extension did not allow for same-sex adoption, either jointly or of stepchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistoriaconmapas.com/war-maps/Same-sex-marriage-Legal-recognition-War-Maps.htm|title=Historia con Mapas|accessdate=26 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082229/http://www.lahistoriaconmapas.com/war-maps/Same-sex-marriage-Legal-recognition-War-Maps.htm|archivedate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2010, Parliament approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.

====South Africa====
{{Main article|Same-sex marriage in South Africa}}
Legal recognition of same-sex marriages in South Africa came about as a result of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]]'s decision in the case of ''[[Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie]]''. The court ruled on 1 December 2005 that the existing marriage laws violated the [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa|equality clause]] of the ''[[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]]'' because they discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. The court gave [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] one year to rectify the inequality.

The ''[[Civil Union Act (South Africa)|Civil Union Act]]'' was passed by the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] on 14 November 2006, by a vote of 230 to 41. It became law on 30 November 2006. South Africa is the fifth country, the first in Africa, and the second outside Europe, to legalize same-sex marriage.

{{main article|Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom}}

Since 2005, same-sex couples have been allowed to enter into [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]], a separate union providing the [[Legal consequences of marriage and civil partnership in the United Kingdom|legal consequences of marriage]]. In 2006, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] rejected a legal bid by a British [[Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson|lesbian couple]] who had [[Same-sex marriage in British Columbia|married]] in Canada to have their union recognised as a marriage in the UK rather than a civil partnership. In September 2011, the Coalition Government announced its intention to introduce same-sex civil marriage in England and Wales by the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|May 2015 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Jessica|title=Government proposes introducing gay marriage after Cameron intervention|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/09/16/government-proposes-introduction-of-full-gay-marriage-after-cameron-intervention/|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the Scottish Government's consultation, the UK Government's consultation for England and Wales did not include provision for religious ceremonies. In May 2012, three religious groups (Quakers, Liberal Judaism and Unitarians) sent a letter to David Cameron, asking that they be allowed to solemnise same-sex weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/05/29/religious-groups-urge-david-cameron-to-maintain-equal-marriage-support/|title=Religious groups urge David Cameron to maintain equal marriage support|work=PinkNews|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the UK Government completed the consultation to allow civil marriage for same-sex couples in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref name="grauni1127"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships may soon be welcomed|first=Alan|last=Travis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/17/civil-partnerships-marriage|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its response to the consultation, the Government said that it also intended "...to enable those religious organisations that wish to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies to do so, on a permissive basis only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/equal-marriage-consultation|title=Equal marriage consultation|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2012, the Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]], announced that, whilst he favoured allowing same-sex marriage within a religious context, provision would be made guaranteeing no religious institution would be required to perform such ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20642428|title=Gay marriage: David Cameron backs church role|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 2013, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debated the ''[[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill]]'', approving it in a 400–175 vote at the second [[Reading (legislature)|reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Sparrow|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/feb/05/gay-marriage-debate-politics-live-blog|title=MPs vote overwhelmingly in favour of gay marriage|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=5 February 2013|location=London, UK|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third reading took place on 21 May 2013, and was approved by 366 votes to 161.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriage: Commons passes Cameron's plan|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22605011|accessdate=21 May 2013|date=21 May 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 June 2013, the bill received its second reading in the [[House of Lords]], after a blocking amendment was defeated by 390 votes to 148.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm |title=Lords Hansard text for 4 Jun 201304 Jun 2013 (pt 0002)|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk|date=4 June 2013|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 2013, the bill was given a third reading by the House of Lords, meaning that it had been passed, and so it was then returned to Commons for the consideration of the Lords' amendments.

The [[Scottish Government]] conducted a three-month-long consultation which ended on 9 December 2011 and the analysis was published in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Consultation sees 50,000 responses|work=The Scotsman|location=Edinburgh|url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/politics/consultation_sees_50_000_responses_1_2001639|accessdate=9 February 2012|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the consultation held in England and Wales, Scotland considered both civil and religious same-sex marriage. Whilst the Scottish Government is in favour of same-sex marriage, it stated that no religious body would be forced to hold such ceremonies once legislation is enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Parliament Website|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/09/05153328/1|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish consultation received more than 77,000 responses, and on 27 June 2013 the Government published the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2013/06/same-sex-marriage-27062013|title=Same sex marriage|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preserve the freedom of both religious groups and individual clergy, the Scottish Government believed it necessary for changes to be made to the ''Equality Act 2010'' and communicated with the UK Government on this matter; thus, the first same-sex marriages in Scotland did not occur until this had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-23067324|title=Scotland's gay marriage bill published at Holyrood|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Scottish bill concerning same-sex marriage had been published, the 'Australian' reported that LGBT rights campaigners, celebrating outside the UK Parliament on 15 July 2013 for the clearance of the ''Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill'' in the House of Lords, declared that they would continue the campaign to extend same-sex marriage rights to both Scotland and Northern Ireland,&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriage moves a step closer in UK|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/gay-marriage-moves-a-step-closer-in-uk/story-fn3dxix6-1226679898796?net_sub_uid=44933799|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=16 July 2013|author=Andrew Woodcock}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than solely Northern Ireland, where there are no plans to introduce such legislation.

The Northern Ireland Executive has stated that it does not intend to introduce legislation allowing for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland.

Before the legalization of same-sex marriage in any U.S. jurisdiction, the [[104th United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the ''[[Defense of Marriage Act]]'' (DOMA) in 1996, attempting to define marriage for the first time solely as a union between a man and a woman for all federal purposes, and allowing states to refuse to recognize such marriages created in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/1/7.html|title=US CODE: Title 1,7.

===National debates===
====Armenia====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Armenia}}
Armenia has historically had few protections or recognition in law of same-sex couples. This changed in July 2017, when the Ministry of Justice revealed that all marriages performed abroad are valid in Armenia, including marriages between people of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/m/eng/news/243348 |title=Mobile |website=Panarmenian.Net |date=2017-07-03|accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; That makes Armenia the second country of the former [[Soviet Union]], after
[[Recognition of same-sex unions in Estonia|Estonia]], to recognise same-sex marriages performed abroad.

====Australia====
{{Main article|Recognition of same-sex unions in Australia}}
Australian federal law currently bans recognition of same-sex marriages. Civil unions/partnerships are available in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Queensland]], while domestic registered partnerships are available in [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Tasmania]] and [[South Australia]]. [[Western Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]] both only offer [[de facto]] unions for same-sex couples, and committed same-sex couples in all states and territories are recognised as de facto unions (which provide most of the benefits and recognition of marriage) under federal law. On 22 October 2013, a bill was passed by the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) legalising same-sex marriage in the ACT. However, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] found that the change was never valid and an official reversal of the bill was announced on 12 December 2013. The High Court established that such a change to ACT legislation could not operate concurrently with the federal Marriage Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia: Gay marriage law reversed by high court less than a week after first weddings|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/australia-gay-marriage-law-reversed-less-than-a-week-after-first-weddings-8999422.html|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 December 2013|author=Adam Withnall|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to September 2016, 21 same-sex marriage related bills had been introduced in the [[Parliament of Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKeown|first1=Deirdre|title=Chronology of same-sex marriage bills introduced into the federal parliament: a quick guide|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/Quick_Guides/SSMarriageBills|website=www.aph.gov.au|publisher=Parliamentary Library (Australia)|accessdate=27 December 2016|location=Canberra|language=en-AU|date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; none of which passed. The [[Turnbull Government|Coalition Government]], narrowly re-elected at the [[Australian federal election, 2016|July 2016 federal election]], pledged to hold a [[Referendums in Australia|plebiscite]] on the issue in early 2017, with the question being put to the Australian people before Parliament voted to change the law. The opposition [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] supported same-sex marriage but lobbied for a parliamentary [[conscience vote]] on same-sex marriage legislation without a public vote. This created a [[political stalemate]], with Labor and other minor parties refusing to back a plebiscite and the Coalition refusing to allow a parliamentary conscience vote.&lt;ref name=SenateRejects&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-07/same-sex-marriage-plebiscite-bill-blocked-by-senate/8003430|title=Same-sex marriage plebiscite bill blocked by Senate|work=ABC News|date=7 November 2016|author=Francis Keany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stalemate was broken when the Government announced the [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey]], which [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] was unable to block. The survey, which was held between 12 September and 7 November 2017, was non-binding and voluntary. The results of the survey was a majority 'yes' vote with 61.6% of the vote&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2017/nov/15/australias-same-sex-marriage-postal-survey-results-live|title=Australia's same-sex marriage postal survey: 61.6% yes, 38.4% no – live|last=Davidson|first=Helen|date=2017-11-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-14|last2=Davey|first2=Melissa|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Knaus|first3=Christopher|last4=Davey|first4=Melissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Government has pledged to facilitate the passage of a [[private member's bill]] legalising same-sex marriage in the [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] before the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/email-me-your-questions-please|title=We Tried To Answer Literally Every Question About The Same-Sex Marriage Postal Survey|work=BuzzFeed|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2013, the Greens introduced a bill in [[National Council (Austria)|Parliament]] that would legalise same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thinkoutsideyourbox.net/?p=33177|title=Nationalrat: Grüne bringen Antrag zur Ehe-Öffnung für Lesben und Schwule ein|publisher=Thinkoutsideyourbox.net|date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sent to the Judiciary Committee on 17 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXV/A/A_00049/index.shtml Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, Änderung]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was supposed to be debated in Autumn 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.ggg.at/index.php?id=62&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=6230&amp;cHash=3d81365a9088534c41b5d7ef6d9b02d5 Abstimmung über Ehe-Öffnung ohne Klubzwang?]&lt;/ref&gt; but was delayed by the ruling coalition.

In December 2015, the Vienna Administrative Court dismissed a case challenging the same-sex marriage ban. The plaintiffs appealed to the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20160323/families-fight-austrias-gay-marriage-ban|title=Families fight Austria's gay marriage ban|date=23 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chile====

[[Michelle Bachelet]], the President of Chile, who was elected to a second term in March 2014, has promised to work for the implementation of same-sex marriage and has a majority in both houses of [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]]. Previously, she said, "Marriage equality, I believe we have to make it happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/chile-expected-legalize-gay-marriage120314|title=Chile expected to legalize gay marriage|work=Gay Star News|first=Joe|last=Morgan|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polling shows majority support for same-sex marriage among Chileans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepchile.cl/dms/lang_1/doc_4844.html|title=Estudio Nacional de Opinión Pública, Junio–Julio 2011.

On 10 December 2014, a group of [[Senate of Chile|senators]], from various parties, joined LGBT rights group [[MOVILH]] (Homosexual Movement of Integration and Liberation) in presenting a bill to allow same-sex marriage and adoption to Congress. MOVILH has been in talks with the Chilean Government to seek an amiable solution to the pending marriage lawsuit brought against the state before the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]]. MOVILH has suggested that they would drop the case if Bachelet's Congress keeps their promise to legislate same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cascaraamarga.es/politica-lgtb/lgtb-internacional/10299-el-proyecto-de-ley-de-matrimonio-igualitario-llega-al-parlamento-de-chile.html|title=El proyecto de ley de matrimonio igualitario llega al Parlamento de Chile|publisher=Cáscara Amarga|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
{{Main article|Recognition of same-sex unions in China}}
The ''Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China'' explicitly defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman. No other form of civil union is recognized. The attitude of the Chinese Government towards homosexuality is believed to be "three nos": "No approval; no disapproval; no promotion." The Ministry of Health officially removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in 2001.

[[Li Yinhe]], a sociologist and sexologist well known in the Chinese gay community, has tried to legalize same-sex marriage several times, including during the National People's Congress in 2000 and 2004 (''Legalization for Same-Sex Marriage'' 《中国同性婚姻合法化》 in 2000 and the ''Same-Sex Marriage Bill'' 《中国同性婚姻提案》 in 2004). According to Chinese law, 35 delegates' signatures are needed to make an issue a bill to be discussed in the Congress. Her efforts failed due to lack of support from the delegates. CPPCC National Committee spokesman [[Wu Jianmin]]
when asked about Li Yinhe's proposal, said that same-sex marriage was still too "ahead of its time" for China. He argued that same-sex marriage was not recognized even in many Western countries, which are considered much more liberal in social issues than China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2006-03-05/10278364854s.shtml|title=政协发言人称同性婚姻太超前 李银河提案再受挫_新闻中心_新浪网|publisher=News.sina.com.cn|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement is understood as an implication that the Government may consider recognition of same-sex marriage in the long run, but not in the near future.

On 5 January 2016, a court in [[Changsha]], southern [[Hunan|Hunan Province]], agreed to hear the lawsuit of 26-year-old Sun Wenlin filed in December 2015 against the Bureau of Civil Affairs of Furong District for its June 2015 refusal to let him marry his 36-year-old male partner, Hu Mingliang. On 13 April 2016, with hundreds of same-sex marriage supporters outside, the Changsha court ruled against Sun, who vowed to appeal, citing the importance of his case for LGBT progress in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/13/474065742/chinese-court-rules-against-gay-couple-seeking-to-get-married|title=Chinese Court Rules Against Gay Couple Seeking To Get Married|publisher=The Two-Way|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, a lawyer in El Salvador filed a lawsuit before the country's Supreme Court asking for the nullification of Article 11 of the Family Code which defines marriage as a heterosexual union.

====Israel====
{{Main article|Same-sex marriage in Israel}}
Israel's High Court of Justice ruled to recognize foreign same-sex marriages for the limited purpose of registration with the Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration, however this is merely for statistical purposes and grants no state-level rights; Israel does not recognize civil marriages performed under its own jurisdiction. A bill was raised in the [[Knesset]] (parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but the Knesset has not advanced the bill since December 2006. A bill to legalize same-sex and interfaith civil marriages was defeated in the Knesset, 39–11, on 16 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Jerusalem Post|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=270221|title=Knesset rejects marriage equality bill|date=16 May 2012|author=Harkov, Lahav|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522013505/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=270221|archivedate=22 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the National LGBT Taskforce of Israel petitioned the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] to allow same-sex marriage in the country, arguing that the refusal of the rabbinical court to recognise same-sex marriage should not prevent civil courts from performing same-sex marriages. The court did not immediately rule against the validity of the petition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/NGO-The-Aguda-petitions-Supreme-Court-to-allow-same-sex-marriage-Israel-431733#article=6017RkIwRTRGQ0UyQzlCNUYxOUM3OUI5QTc1RTJGQkVGMkU=|title=NGO petitions High Court to allow same-sex marriage in Israel|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 2016, the Italian Senate passed a bill allowing civil unions with 173 senators in favour and 73 against. That same bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 11 May 2016 with 372 deputies in favour and 51 against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2016/05/11/news/unioni_civili_voto_fiducia_camera-139563931/?ref=HREA-1|title=Unioni civili, Camera approva: è legge.

On 31 January 2017, the Italian [[Supreme Court of Cassation]] ruled that same-sex marriages performed abroad can be fully recognized by court order, when at least one of the two spouses is a citizen of a [[European Union]] country where same-sex marriage is legal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blitzquotidiano.it/cronaca-italia/nozze-gay-in-italia-cassazione-convalida-il-primo-matrimonio-tra-due-donne-2630868/|title=Nozze gay riconosciute dalla Cassazione: prima volta in Italia|website=www.blitzquotidiano.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus making same-sex marriage [[de-facto]] legal under certain circumstances.

====Japan====
{{Main article|Same-sex marriage in Japan}}
Same-sex marriage is not legal in Japan. Article 24 of the Japanese Constitution states that "Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitution of Japan|date=3 November 1946|location=Tokyo|url=http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 24 was created to establish the equality of both sexes in marriage, in opposition to the pre-war legal situation whereby the husband/father was legally defined as the head of household and marriage require permission from the male head of the family.

51% of the Japanese population supports same-sex marriage, according to the latest poll carried out in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-29/majority-of-japanese-support-same-sex-marriage-poll-shows|title=Majority of Japanese Support Same-Sex Marriage, Poll Shows|publisher=Bloomberg|date=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latvia====
{{Main article|Recognition of same-sex unions in Latvia}}
On 27 May 2016, the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia]] overturned an administrative court decision which refused an application to register a same-sex marriage in the country. A Supreme Court press spokeswoman said that the court agrees with the administrative court that current regulations do not allow for same-sex marriages to be legally performed in Latvia. However, the matter should have been considered in a context not of marriage, but of registering familial partnership. Furthermore, it would have been impossible to conclude whether the applicants' rights were violated or not unless their claim is accepted and reviewed in a proper manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsm.lv/en/article/societ/society/supreme-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-request-will-be-considered.a184891/ |title=Supreme Court rules same-sex marriage request will be considered |publisher=Public broadcasting of Latvia |date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court will now decide whether the refusal was in breach of the Latvian Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.

====Nepal====

====Slovenia====
{{Main article|Recognition of same-sex unions in Slovenia}}
Slovenia recognises registered partnerships for same-sex couples.

In December 2014, the eco-socialist [[United Left (Slovenia)|United Left]] party introduced a bill amending expansion of the definition of marriage in the 1976 ''Marriage and Family Relations Act'' to include same-sex couples. In January 2015, the Government expressed no opposition to the bill. In February 2015, the bill was passed with 11 votes to 2. In March, the Assembly passed the bill in a 51–28 vote. On 10 March 2015, the National Council rejected a motion to require the Assembly to vote on the bill again, in a 14–23 vote. Opponents of the bill launched a petition for a referendum and managed to collect 40,000 signatures. Then Parliament voted to block the referendum with a clarification that it would be against the Slovenian Constitution to vote about matters concerning human rights. Finally the Constitutional Court ruled against the banning of the referendum (5–4) and [[Slovenian same-sex marriage referendum, 2015|the referendum]] was to be held on 20 December 2015.

In the referendum, 63.4% of the voters voted against the law, rendering Parliament's same-sex marriage act invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/referendum/pobudniki-referenduma-uspeli-novela-zakona-o-zakonski-zvezi-zavrnjena/381559 |title=Pobudniki referenduma uspeli, sprememba zakona o zakonski zvezi zavrnjena |language=Slovenian|date=20 December 2015 |access-date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taiwan====
{{main article|Same-sex marriage in Taiwan}}
On 22 December 2014, a proposed amendment to the Civil Code which would legalize same-sex marriage was due to go under review by the Judiciary Committee. If the amendment passes the committee stage it will then be voted on at the plenary session of the [[Legislative Yuan]] in 2015. The amendment, called the marriage equality amendment, would insert neutral terms into the Civil Code replacing ones that imply heterosexual marriage, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage. It would also allow same-sex couples to adopt children.

[[Yu Mei-nu]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), who is the convener of the current legislative session, has expressed support for the amendment as have more than 20 other DPP lawmakers as well as two from the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] and one each from the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lii Wen|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/12/21/2003607251|title=Gay marriage proposal set for review|work=Taipei Times|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan would become the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage if the Civil Code is amended.

A poll carried out between August and October 2015 found that 71% of the Taiwanese population supports same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/11/30/nearly-two-thirds-of-taiwan-supports-marriage-equality-survey-finds/ |title=Nearly two thirds of Taiwan supports marriage equality, survey finds |publisher=PinkNews |date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tsai Ing-wen]], the President of Taiwan since May 2016, announced her support of same-sex marriage in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/watch-taiwan-presidential-frontrunner-officially-endorses-marriage-equality/|title=Watch: Taiwan presidential frontrunner officially endorses marriage equality|date=2 November 2015|work=gaystarnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, two same-sex marriage bills were introduced before the [[Legislative Yuan]]. Subsequently, protests have been staged by groups opposing and by groups supporting legalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/12/04/2003660533 |title=Thousands protest gay marriage in Taipei |author=Gerber, Abraham|date=4 December 2016|work=[[Taipei Times]]|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/12/11/2003660976|title=Thousands rally to support equal marriage rights - Taipei Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry, and gave the Government two years to amend the law to that effect. If the law is not amended after two years, same-sex couples will be able to register a valid marriage application in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;

====Venezuela====

In April 2016, the Supreme Court announced it would hear a lawsuit which seeks to declare Article 44 of the Civil Code unconstitutional for outlawing same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/11963|title=The Struggle isn't Over": Venezuela Moves Towards Marriage Equality|publisher=Venezuelanalysis.com|date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam====
{{main article|Same-sex marriage in Vietnam}}
In Vietnam, currently only a marriage between a man and a woman is recognized. Vietnam's Ministry of Justice began seeking advice on legalizing same-sex marriage from other governmental and non-governmental organizations in April and May 2012, and planned to further discuss the issue at the National Assembly in Spring 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnam government consults on same-sex marriage|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vietnam-government-consults-same-sex-marriage200612|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2013, the Ministry of Justice requested that the National Assembly avoid action until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote on same-sex marriage in Vietnam likely to be delayed until 2014|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vote-same-sex-marriage-vietnam-likely-be-delayed-until-2014200213}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a hearing to discuss marriage law reforms in April 2013, deputy minister of health Nguyen Viet Tien proposed that same-sex marriage be made legal immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/04/vietnam-flawed-on-human-rights-but-a-leader-in-gay-rights/275413|title=Vietnam: Flawed on Human Rights, but a Leader in Gay Rights|author=Thomas Maresca|date=30 April 2013|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese Government abolished an administrative fine imposed on same-sex weddings in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/345169/vietnam-ends-same-sex-marriage-fines|title=Vietnam ends same-sex marriage fines|publisher=Bangkok Post|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was enacted on 11 November 2013. The 100,000–500,000 [[VND]]  ($24[[USD]]) fine will be abolished. Although same-sex marriages are not permitted in Vietnam, the policy will decriminalize the relationship, habitual privileges such as household registry, property, child raising, and co-habitual partnerships are recognized.&lt;ref&gt;S.

On 27 May 2014, the National Assembly's Committee for Social Affairs removed the provision giving legal status and some rights to cohabiting same-sex couples from the Government's bill to amend the ''Law on Marriage and Family''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vietnamese-lawmakers-back-down-giving-rights-same-sex-couples300514|title=Vietnamese lawmakers back down on giving rights to same-sex couples|date=|work=Gay Star News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/vietnams-proposed-marriage-law-disappoints-lgbt-activists-/1925916.html|title=Vietnam’s Proposed Marriage Law Disappoints LGBT Activists|work=VOA|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was approved by the National Assembly on 19 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thanhniennews.com/politics/vietnam-allows-surrogacy-within-families-denies-samesex-marriage-27502.html|title=Vietnam allows surrogacy within families, denies same-sex marriage|work=Thanh Nien Daily|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/20478/vietnam-removes-ban-on-same-sex-marriage|title=Vietnam removes ban on same sex marriage|author=Tuoi Tre Newspaper|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2015, the ''2014 Law on Marriage and Family'' officially went into effect. It states that while Vietnam allows same-sex weddings, it will not offer legal recognition or protection to unions between people of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marilynstowe.co.uk/2014/12/29/vietnam-set-to-lift-gay-marriage-ban/|title=Vietnam set to lift gay marriage ban|work=Marilyn Stowe Blog|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International organizations===
The terms of employment of the staff of [[international organizations]] (not [[Business|commercial]]) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.

Despite their relative independence, few organizations recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the United Nations recognize same-sex marriages if and only if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Secretary-General Bulletin|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/522/40/PDF/N0452240.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to mixed-sex married couples to de facto partners or [[domestic partner]]s of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into a mixed-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the [[World Bank]] does recognize domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTHRJOBS/0,,contentMDK:20522360~menuPK:1353209~pagePK:64262408~piPK:64262191~theSitePK:1058433,00.html|title=Jobs&amp;nbsp;— Compensation &amp; Benefits|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New York City Proposition 8 Protest outside LDS temple 20.jpg|thumb|upright|Many advocates, such as this November 2008 protester at a demonstration in [[New York City]] against [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]], reject the notion of [[civil unions]], describing them as inferior to the legal recognition of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=Towleroad&gt;{{cite web|last=Towle|first=Andy|title=NYC Protest and Civil Rights March Opposing Proposition 8|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2008/11/we-did-it.html|publisher=[[Towleroad]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Civil union, [[civil partnership]], [[domestic partnership]], [[registered partnership]], unregistered partnership, and unregistered cohabitation statuses offer varying legal benefits of marriage. As of March 2017, countries that have an alternative form of legal recognition other than marriage on a national level are: [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Andorra|Andorra]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Australia|Australia]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Chile|Chile]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Croatia|Croatia]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Registered partnership in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Estonia|Estonia]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Greece|Greece]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Hungary|Hungary]], [[Same-sex marriage in Israel|Israel]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Italy|Italy]], [[Same-sex marriage in Japan|Japan (various cities)]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]], [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico#Tlaxcala|Mexico (Tlaxcala)]], the [[Same-sex marriage in Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten|Netherlands (Aruba)]], [[LGBT rights in San Marino|San Marino]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Slovenia|Slovenia]], [[Registered partnership in Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|Taiwan (all special municipalities and some counties and provincial cities)]] and the [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (Northern Ireland and [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Jersey|Jersey]]).&lt;ref name="countries and states legal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearson|first=Mary|title=Where is Gay Marriage Legal?|url=http://christiangays.com/marriage/legal.shtml|publisher=christiangays.com|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Steve|title=Which Countries Have Legalized Gay Marriage?|url=http://www.care2.com/causes/which-countries-have-legalized-gay-marriage.html|publisher=Care2.com (news.bbc.co.uk as source)|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-sexual same-sex marriage===
====Kenya====
{{main article|LGBT rights in Kenya}}
Female same-sex marriage is practiced among the [[Gikuyu people|Gikuyu]], [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Kamba people|Kamba]], [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], and to a lesser extent neighboring peoples.  Approximately 5–10% of women are in such marriages.  However, this is not seen as homosexual, but is instead a way for families without sons to keep their inheritance within the family.&lt;ref&gt;''Gender and Language in Sub-Saharan Africa,'' 2013:35&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws criminalizing homosexuality are generally specific to men, though in 2010 the prime minister called for women to be arrested as well.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

====Nigeria====
{{main article|Same-sex marriage in Nigeria}}
In Nigeria, homosexual activity between men, but not between women, is illegal.  In 2006, Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] introduced legislation that prohibits same-sex marriages and criminalizes anyone who "performs, witnesses, aids or abets" such ceremonies.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleshman|first=Michael|title=African gays and lesbians combat bias: An 'invisible' minority seeks legal safeguards, acceptance|url=https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=28 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183121/http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html|archivedate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Igbo people]] and probably other peoples in the south of the country, there are circumstances where a marriage between women is considered appropriate, such as when a woman has no child and her husband dies, and she takes a wife to perpetuate her inheritance and family lineage.&lt;ref name=NigeriaTribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111010506/http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archivedate=11 January 2010|title=Tradition of same gender marriage in Igboland|first=Leo|last=Igwe|work=Nigerian Tribune|date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
{{See also|LGBT rights opposition}}
While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the [[history of same-sex unions|historical and anthropological record]] reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, through full acceptance and integration, sympathetic toleration, indifference, prohibition and discrimination, to persecution and physical annihilation. Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising,&lt;ref name="Laurie"/&gt; undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-blankenhorn19-2008sep19,0,6057126.story|title=Protecting marriage to protect children|last=Blankenhorn|first=David|date=19 September 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships,&lt;ref name="findlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements|title=See discussion of prenuptial and postmarital agreements at Findlaw|publisher=Family.findlaw.com|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="indegayforum1"&gt;Dale Carpenter is a prominent spokesman for this view.

===Parenting===
{{Main article|LGBT parenting|Same-sex marriage and the family}}
Scientific literature indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union (either a mixed-sex or same-sex union). As a result, professional scientific associations have argued for same-sex marriage to be legally recognized as it will be beneficial to the children of same-sex parents or carers.&lt;ref name="amici"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cpa2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=pediatrics/&gt;&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb, Ph.D.|first=Michael|title=Expert Affidavit for U.S. District Court (D.

====Adoption====
{{main article|LGBT adoption}}
All states that allow same-sex marriage also allow the joint [[adoption]] of children by people of the same sex, with the exceptions of Guerrero, Jalisco, Nayarit, Puebla and Quintana Roo in Mexico. In addition, [[Andorra]], [[Austria]] and [[Israel]] as well as several subnational jurisdictions which do not recognize same-sex marriage nonetheless permit joint adoption by unmarried same-sex couples: the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia in Australia, Querétaro and Veracruz in Mexico as well as Northern Ireland and Jersey in the United Kingdom. Some additional states allow stepchild adoption by those who are in a same-sex relationship but are unmarried: [[Croatia]], [[Estonia]], [[Italy]] (on a case-by-case basis), [[Slovenia]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://euroclashblog.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/austrian-court-rules-to-allow-same-sex-adoptions/|title=Austrian court rules to allow same-sex adoptions|work=The Privateer|date=16 January 2016|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Surrogacy and IVF treatment====
{{main article|Assisted reproductive technology}}
A gay or bisexual man has the option of [[surrogacy]], the process in which a woman bears a child for another person through [[artificial insemination]] or carries another woman's surgically implanted [[fertilized egg]] to birth. A lesbian or bisexual woman has the option of artificial insemination.&lt;ref&gt;The Fertility Sourcebook, Third Edition&amp;nbsp;– Page 245, M.

===Transgender and intersex people===
{{synthesis|date=May 2017}}
{{See also|Transgender|Legal aspects of transsexualism|Intersex|Intersex human rights}}
When sex is defined legally, it may be defined by any one of several criteria: the [[XY sex-determination system]], the type of [[gonad]]s, the type of external sexual features, or the person's social identification.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Consequently, both [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] individuals may be legally categorized into confusing gray areas, and could be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} This could result in long-term marriages, as well as recent same-sex marriages, being overturned.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The problems of defining gender by the existence/non-existence of gonads or certain sexual features is complicated by the existence of [[Gender Reassignment Surgery|surgical methods]] to alter these features.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Estimates run as high as one percent of live [[childbirth|births]] exhibiting some degree of sexual ambiguity,&lt;ref name="Laurie"&gt;{{citation |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality|publisher=The Drum|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Fausto-Sterling ''et al.'', 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births being ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including sometimes involuntary surgery to address their sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency|title=How common is intersex?|publisher=Intersex Society of North America|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. "Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality." ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' 38.5 (October 2009): 688–701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the ''[[Gender Recognition Act 2004]]'' allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage|publisher=365gay.com|date=5 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|archivedate=17 October 2007|accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. A similar provision including sterilization also existed in Sweden, but was phased out in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/sweden-ends-forced-sterilization-trans110113 Sweden ends forced sterilization of trans]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, transgender and intersex marriages typically run into similar complications.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19brfs-USDEFENDSMAR_BRF.html|title=U.S. Defends Marriage Law|work=The New York Times|date=18 September 2009|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some of them prohibit legal changes of gender.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Divorce===
{{Main article|Divorce of same-sex couples}}
In the United States of America before the case of ''Obergefell v. Hodges'', couples in same-sex marriages could only obtain a divorce in jurisdictions that recognized same-sex marriages, with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthew S. Coleman, Esq.|title=Obergefell v. Hodges|url=http://www.einhornharris.com/familylawblog/obergefell-v-hodges|publisher=Einhorn Harris|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial and legislative===
{{Main article|Conflict of marriage laws#Same-sex marriage}}
There are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A "[[direct democracy|majority rules]]" position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|title=Poll: Calif. gay marriage ban driven by religion|author=Leff, Lisa|agency=Associated Press|date=4 December 2008|work=USA Today|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208080418/http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|archivedate=8 December 2008}} archived here.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a [[civil rights]] view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7723645.stm|title= Divisions persist over gay marriage ban|author=Mirchandani, Rajesh|publisher=BBC News|date=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious views===
{{Further information|Religious views on same-sex marriage}}

Religion plays a prominent role in discourse about same-sex marriage,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} and several religious organizations and churches have expressed a range of official positions. Religious views on same-sex marriage are closely related to religious views on homosexuality.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} While the majority of world religions stand in opposition, the number of denominations accepting and conducting same-sex marriages has increased in the 2000s and 2010s.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Some religious arguments for supporting same-sex marriage are beginning to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3049650|title=Transformational Marriage: How to End the Culture Wars Over Same-Sex Marriage|first=Robin|last=Kar|date=8 October 2017|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[Christianity|Christians]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-05-13-pope-abortion-gays_N.htm|website=USA Today|title=Pope: Abortion, Gay Marriage among World's Greatest Threats|date=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref name="assembly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assemblyofbishops.org/about/documents/2013-assembly-statement-on-marriage-and-sexuality|title=2013 Assembly Statement on Marriage and Sexuality|work=assemblyofbishops.org|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations, such as [[Homosexuality and Seventh-day Adventism|Seventh-day Adventists]], take official positions opposing same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Annual Council of the General Conference Executive Committee|title=Position Statement on Homosexuality|series=Seventh-day Adventist Church Statements|date=3 October 1999|url=http://adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main-stat46.html|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] are also officially opposed to same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Does God Approve of Same-Sex Marriage?|journal=''Awake!''|date=April 8, 2005|page=27|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102005250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Protestant groups, like the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], and the [[United Church of Christ]], and some Catholic ones, such as the [[Old Catholic Church]] (US Province), support allowing those of the same sex to marry or conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;

The vast majority of traditional [[Muslim]] scholars believe Shariah law opposes same-sex marriage and condemns same-sex sex. This is also the dominant view in modern Muslim societies. Some Muslims in the West now argue that homosexuality is allowed by Shariah law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Homosexuality-and-Same-Sex-Marriage-in-Islam.html|title=Homosexuality and Same-Sex Marriage in Islam|website=Patheos|first=Jonathan|last=Brown|date=7 July 2009|accessdate=26 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707002336/http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Homosexuality-and-Same-Sex-Marriage-in-Islam.html|archivedate=7 July 2015|df=dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Jewish leaders oppose same-sex marriage, while Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist Jewish rabbinical groups affirm its validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/06/04/life-religion/conservative-rabbinic-group-issues-guidelines-for-same-sex-wedding-rituals|last=Sales|first=Ben|title=Conservative Rabbinic Group Issues Guidelines for Same-Sex Wedding Rituals|website=JTA: Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Buddhism]] is considered to be ambivalent on the subject as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mettanando|last=Bhikkhu|date=July 13, 2005|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,1429,0,0,1,0|title=Religion and Same-Sex Marriage|website=The Buddhist Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2016}} particular Buddhists have supported same-sex marriage,&lt;ref name=ausbuddhists&gt;{{cite web|last1=Potts|first1=Andrew M.|title=Buddhists Come Out for Equality|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/buddhists-come-out-for-equality/75906|accessdate=28 February 2015|website=Star Observer|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jeff.
