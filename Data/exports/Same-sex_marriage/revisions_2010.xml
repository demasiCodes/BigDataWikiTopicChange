'''Same-sex marriage''' (also called '''gay marriage''')&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|gay marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a legally or socially recognized [[marriage]] between two persons of the same [[biological sex]] or [[gender identity|social gender]]. Same-sex marriage is a civil rights, political, social, moral, and religious issue in many nations. The conflicts arise over whether same-sex couples should be allowed to enter into marriage, be required to use a different status (such as a [[civil union]], which either grant equal rights as marriage or limited rights in comparison to marriage), or not have any such rights. A related issue is whether the term "marriage" should be applied.&lt;ref name=MuslimWaPo&gt;[http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/pamela_k_taylor/2009/07/marriage_both_civil_and_religious.html Marriage: Both Civil and Religious], Pamela Taylor, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', July 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/susan_k_smith/2009/07/marriage_a_civil_right_not_sacred_rite.html Marriage a Civil Right, not Sacred Rite], Susan Smith, ''The Washington Post'', July 30, 2009; accessed 9/12/2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Decision in Perry v.

Support for same-sex marriage is often based upon what is regarded as a [[universal human rights]] issue, mental and physical health concerns, [[equality before the law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalrightsfoundation.org/pressDownloads/AFER_Case_Announce.pdf Prop. 8 Challenged in Federal Court], [[American Foundation for Equal Rights]], May 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the goal of [[normalization (sociology)|normalizing]] [[LGBT]] relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Julie|title=Public Relations: Why the Rush to Same-Sex Marriage?

==Etymology and terminological usage==
The word "marriage" comes from [[Old French]] ''mariage'', from ''marier'' ("to marry"), from Latin ''maritare'' ("to marry", literally "give in marriage"), from ''maritus'' ("lover", "nuptial"), from ''mas'' ("male", "masculine", "of the male sex").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myetymology.com/english/marriage.html |title=English etymology of marriage |publisher=myEtymology.com |date= |accessdate=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists have struggled to come up with a definition of marriage that absorbs commonalities of the social construct across cultures.&lt;ref name=Fedorak&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=gJJ9Eu06JmEC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=anthropologists%20struggle%20define%20marriage&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q=anthropologists%20struggle%20define%20marriage&amp;f=false Anthropology Matters!], Shirley Fedorak, Broadview Press, 2007, Chapter 11, Page 174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gough&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2844434 The Nayars and the Definition of Marriage], Kathleen Gough, The Journals of [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]], 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edvard Westermarck]] defined marriage in the 1922 edition of ''The History of Human Marriage'' as "a relation of one or more men to one or more women which is recognized as custom or law and involves certain rights and duties" to the individuals who enter into it, and any children born from it.&lt;ref name=Westermarck&gt;''This History of Human Marriage'', Volume 1, Edvard Westermarck, Oxford University Press, Chapter 1, Page 26; 1922 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such definitions failed to recognize same-sex marriages that have been documented around the world, including in more than 30 [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African cultures]], such as the [[Kikuyu]] and [[Nuer]].&lt;ref name=Gough/&gt;&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjbESL6YWU0C&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;ots=WdlOOaKAAq&amp;dq=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;f=false Boy-wives and female husbands: studies of African homosexualities], Stephen O.

In [[lexicography]], words have changed and expanded in accordance to the status quo. In the last 10 years, in the English-speaking world, all major dictionaries have either dropped gender specifications, or supplemented them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/24/20040524-103201-1169r/ Dictionaries take lead in redefining modern marriage], ''[[Washington Times]]'', May 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;[http://www.abajournal.com/news/webster_makes_it_official_definition_of_marriage_has_changed/ Webster Makes It Official: Definition of Marriage Has Changed], Martha Neil, ''[[American Bar Association]]'', March 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2215628/ Dictionaries recognize same-sex marriage—who knew?], Daniel Redman, ''[[Slate.com|Slate]]'', April 7, 2009; accessed 9/19/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Many proponents of same-sex marriages use the term ''marriage equality''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/issues/marriage.html|title=MARRIAGE EQUALITY|publisher=Garden State Equality|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/marriage-101#faq3|title=Marriage 101|publisher=Freedom to Marry|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to stress that they seek equality as opposed to special rights.

Human Events 64.36 (October 20, 2008): 17–17. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO.

[[Alan Dershowitz]] and others have suggested reserving the word "marriage" for religious contexts as part of [[privatizing marriage]], and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of [[civil union]]s, in part to strengthen the [[separation between church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Use in print and online media===
Some publications that oppose same-sex marriages adopt an editorial style policy of placing the word ''marriage'' in quotation marks ("marriage") when it is used in reference to same-sex couples. In the United States, the mainstream press has generally abandoned this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/02/25/washington-times-scare-quotes-are-history/|title=Washington Times Scare Quotes Are History|publisher=Washington City Paper|author=Erik Wemple|date=February 25, 2008|accessdate=July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some socially conservative online publications, such as [[WorldNetDaily]] and [[Baptist Press]], still follow the practice. Cliff Kincaid of [[Accuracy in Media]] argues for use of quotation marks on the grounds that marriage is a legal status denied same-sex couples by most state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

{{Main|History of same-sex unions|Timeline of same-sex marriage}}

===Ancient===
Various types of same-sex marriages have existed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Neill | first=James | year=2008 | title=The origins and role of same-sex relations in human societies | publisher=McFarland | isbn=9780786435135 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from informal, unsanctioned relationships to highly ritualized unions.&lt;ref name=Herdt1993 &gt;{{Cite book| last=Herdt | first=Gilbert H. | year=1993 | title=Ritualized Homosexuality in Melanesia | publisher=University of California Press | isbn=9780520080966 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=mlFp0nFhvbwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southern Chinese province of [[Fujian]], through the [[Ming dynasty]] period, females would bind themselves in contracts to younger females in elaborate ceremonies.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Males also entered similar arrangements. This type of arrangement was also similar in ancient European history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

An example of egalitarian male [[domestic partnership]] from the early [[Zhou Dynasty]] period of China is recorded in the story of [[Pan Zhang &amp; Wang Zhongxian]].  While the relationship was clearly approved by the wider community, and was compared to heterosexual marriage, it did not involve a religious ceremony binding the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsch, Bret.  (1990).  ''Passions of the Cut Sleeve''.  University of California Press.  pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

The first historical mention of the performance of same-sex "marriages" occurred during the early [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, "Same Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe." (New York: Random House, 1995). Pages 80–85.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Nero|Emperor Nero]] is reported to have engaged in a "marriage" ceremony with one of his male slaves. [[Elagabalus|Emperor Elagabalus]] "married" a [[Carian]] slave named Hierocles.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Scarre "Chronicles of the Roman Emperors" (London: Thames and Hudson Ltd, 1995). Page 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted, however, that ''conubium'' existed only between a ''civis Romanus'' and a ''civis Romana'' (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citzen), so that a so-called "marriage" between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases).&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, ''The Roman Law of Marriage'' (Oxford, 1969), pp. 24-28; Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), pp. 43-49.; "Marriages where the partners had ''conubium'' were marriages valid in Roman law (''iusta matrimonia'')" [Treggiari, p. 49].  Compare Ulpian (''Tituli Ulpiani'' 5.3-5: "''Conubium'' is the capacity to marry a wife in Roman law.  Roman citizens have ''conubium'' with Roman citizens, but with Latins and foreigners only if the privilege was granted.  There is no ''conubium'' with slaves"; compare also Gaius (''Institutionum'' 1:55-56, 67, 76-80).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "''matrimonium'' is an institution involving a mother, ''mater''.  The idea implicit in the word is that a man takes a woman in marriage, ''in matrimonium ducere'', so that he may have children by her."&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the lack of legal validity notwithstanding, there is a consensus among modern historians that same-sex relationships existed in ancient Rome, but the exact frequency and nature of "same-sex unions" during that period is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Eskridge|first= William N.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1993|month= Oct|title= A History of Same-Sex Marriage |journal= Virginia Law Review |volume= 79|issue= 7|pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= The Romans may have accorded some same-sex unions the legal or cultural status of marriage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 342 AD Christian emperors [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]] issued a law in the [[Theodosian Code]] (''C.

====Europe====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Europe}}

The granting and honoring of same-sex marriages is also currently being considered by several countries in Europe.

In early July 2009, the [[Slovenia]]n minister of interior announced that it is likely that [[Registered partnership in Slovenia#Same sex marriage|Slovenia will legalize same-sex marriage]] in the near future, following government agreement that same-sex couples deserve to be entitled to all of the same benefits of opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP) &amp;ndash; Jul 2, 2009 |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hjrgMMgg5JR4WuLYjqWx5dRrRGOQ |title=Slovenia to legalize same-sex marriage soon: minister |publisher=Google.com |date=2009-07-02 |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, the government approved a bill allowing same-sex marriage and adoption and sent it to parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=a&amp;id=1460860 |title=Family Law Bill Ready for Parliament |publisher=Sta.si |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new government of [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] has also announced its intention to legalize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.station.lu/index.php?p=edito&amp;id=12240 |title=The Station Network |publisher=Station.lu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In France in 2006, a 30-member non-[[quorum]] parliamentary commission of the [[French National Assembly]] published a 453-page ''Report on the Family and the Rights of Children'', which [[Same-sex marriage in France|rejected same-sex marriages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2006_docs/Francesummary.pdf|format=PDF|title=Executive summary of "Report on the Family and the Rights of Children" prepared by the French National Assembly, Paris, January&amp;nbsp;25, 2006|date=January 25, 2006|accessdate=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finland may legalize same-sex marriage after the 2011 [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary elections]].

Some [[Latin American]] nations have taken up such proposals, [[Aníbal Fernández|Justice Minister]] of [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Argentina|Argentina]] worked to submit a gender neutral law draft before the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/BreakingNews/View/4013 |title=Aníbal Fernández supports parliamentary debate on same-sex marriages |publisher=Buenosairesherald.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14, 2010 the Argentine Senate prepared to vote on a bill granting the broadest marital protections to gay people in Latin America. It was supported by the Government of [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] and opposed by the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Polls showed that nearly 70 percent of Argentines support giving gay people the same marital rights as heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/world/americas/14argentina.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss | work=The New York Times | title=Argentina Senate to Vote on Gay Marriage | first=Alexei | last=Barrionuevo | date=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oceania====
[[Same-sex marriage in Australia|Australia]] bans recognition of same-sex marriages at the federal level, but the current [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] government favors synchronized state and territory [[registered partnership]] legislation (as in [[Tasmania]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The [[Australian Capital Territory]] offers civil partnerships. New Zealand's Parliament rejected a bill that would have prohibited the recognition of [[same-sex marriage in New Zealand]] in December 2005. However, New Zealand's Marriage Act 1955 still only recognizes marriage rights for opposite-sex couples. The marriage laws consider [[transsexuals]] who have undergone [[reassignment surgery]] as having changed sex for legal purposes, following Family Court and [[High Court of New Zealand]] decisions in 1995.

Currently there is a law before the Tasmanian legislative Council which would recognise gay marriages in Tasmania, which were performed overseas or in another state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/01/2999027.htm?section=justin |title=Tasmania moves to recognise same-sex unions - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2010-09-01 |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Israel}}
[[Israel]]'s High Court of Justice ruled to honor same-sex marriages granted in other countries even though Israel does not recognize such marriages performed under its own jurisdiction. A bill was raised in the [[Knesset]] (parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but the Knesset has not advanced the bill since December 2006.

====Africa====
Same-sex marriage [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|became legal]] in South Africa on November 30, 2006 when the Civil Unions Bill was enacted after having been passed by the South African Parliament earlier that month. A ruling by the Constitutional Court on December 1, 2005 had imposed a deadline of December 1, 2006 to make same-sex marriage legal. South Africa became the fifth country, the first in Africa, and the second outside Europe, to legalize same-sex marriage. In 2006, [[Same-sex marriage in Nigeria|Nigerian]] President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] introduced legislation that prohibits same-sex marriages and criminalizes anyone who "performs, witnesses, aids or abets" such ceremonies.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;[http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html African gays and lesbians combat bias], Michael Fleshman, Africa Renewal, Vol.21 #1 (April 2007), page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Igbo people]] of [[Nigeria]], there are circumstances where a marriage between two women is allowed, such as when a woman has no child and the husband dies.&lt;ref name=NigeriaTribune&gt;[http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html Tradition of same gender marriage in Igboland], Leo Igwe, Nigerian Tribune, June 19, 2009.

====United States====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in the United States}}
In the United States, although [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriages are not recognized federally]], same-sex couples can marry in five states and one district ([[Same-sex marriage in Connecticut|Connecticut]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iowa|Iowa]], [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]], and the [[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]]) and receive state-level benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iGQ6LMSOvL9rjDHrAmyO9mHoVieAD9BOJN7G1 ]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Rhode Island do not facilitate same-sex marriages, but do recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions.  Additionally, several states offer civil unions or domestic partnerships, granting all or part of the state-level rights and responsibilities of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/issues/1548.htm |title=LGBT Laws of NJ |publisher=HRC |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/issues/904.htm |title=LGBT Laws of Maryland |publisher=HRC |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-one states have constitutional restrictions limiting marriage to one woman and one man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 1996, the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]] passed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) defining marriage solely as a union between a couple of the opposite sex for all federal purposes and allowing for the non-recognition amongst the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/1/7.html |title=US CODE: Title 1,7.

A 2005 federal district court decision, ''[[Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning]]'', holding that prohibiting recognition of same-sex relationships violated the Constitution was overturned on appeal by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] in 2006, which ruled that "laws limiting the state-recognized institution of marriage to heterosexual couples ... do not violate the Constitution of the United States."

In 2006, the Supreme Court of Washington concluded that encouraging procreation within the framework of marriage can be seen as a legitimate government interest furthered by limiting marriage between opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

In 2010, [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] stated the evidence did not show any historical purpose for excluding same-sex couples from marriage, as states have never required spouses to have an ability or willingness to procreate in order to marry. Proponents of excluding same-sex couples from marriage were unable to reply how permitting same-sex marriage impairs or adversely affects the assumption that the state’s interest in marriage is procreative. When asked to identify the evidence at trial that supported the contention responsible procreation is really at the heart of society’s interest in regulating marriage, proponents’ counsel replied he did not have evidence of this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

===International organizations===
The terms of employment of the staff of [[international organizations]] (not [[Business|commercial]]) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.

Despite their relative independence, few organizations currently recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the United Nations recognize same-sex marriages if and only if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/522/40/PDF/N0452240.pdf UN Secretary-General Bulletin ST/SGB/2004/13], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to opposite-sex married couples to ''de facto'' partners or [[domestic partner]]s of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into an opposite-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the [[World Bank]] does recognize domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Australia===
In Australia, Commonwealth law prohibits the recognition of same-sex marriage under the ''[[Marriage Act 1961]]''. However, every Australian government jurisdiction provides to ''de facto'' same-sex couples a wide range of rights  equal to those afforded to ''de facto'' opposite-sex couples. These rights are gained without registration, under a status called ''"unregistered cohabitation"''. Furthermore, formal domestic partnership registries exist in [[LGBT rights in New South Wales|New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Since July 1, 2009, same-sex couples are recognised as ''de facto'' partners in a wide range of legislation in every Australian government jurisdiction, including superannuation, social security, health care and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/sweeping-gay-law-reform-finally-passes-20081127-6jgd.html |title=Sweeping gay law reform finally passes |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=2008-11-27 |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Grace Abrams and Fiona Power became Australia's first legally recognized same-sex married couple after Grace Abrams had gender-modification surgery and was later officially granted a passport with female status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Petersen |first=Terje |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/16/2060485.htm |title=Limited govt equals freedom for same-sex couples |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2007-10-16 |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
{{Same-sex marriage map Europe|align=left|size=200px}}
In Denmark, Finland and Hungary, a [[registered partnership]] provides nearly all of the rights of marriage, including joint adoption rights in Denmark. Finland and [[Greenland]] have biological adoption only (no joint adoption). These partnership laws are short laws that state that wherever the word "marriage" appears in the country's law, it will now also be construed to mean "registered partnership", and wherever the word "spouse" appears, it will now also be construed to mean "registered partner"&amp;nbsp;— thereby transferring the body of marriage laws onto same-sex couples in registered partnerships.

In the United Kingdom, [[civil partnerships]] were introduced in 2005. The law gives civil partners the same benefits and associated legal rights of marriage; ranging from tax exemptions and joint property rights, to [[next-of-kin]] status and shared parenting responsibilities. The one notable exception is the use of [[courtesy titles]] by the partner of a male peer or knight. In the first year, 16,100 ceremonies took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Denis Campbell |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/feb/03/gayrights.world |title=Honeymoon is over for gay weddings |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil unions in New Zealand]] are identical to British civil partnerships in their association with equivalent spousal rights and responsibilities to marriage.

==Transgender and intersex persons==
{{Ref improve section|date=December 2008}}
{{See also|Transsexualism|Legal aspects of transsexualism|Gender identity}}
When sex is defined legally, it may be defined by any one of several criteria: the [[XY sex-determination system]], the type of [[gonad]]s, the type of external sexual features, or the person's social identification. Consequently, both [[transsexual]]s and [[intersex]]ed individuals may be legally categorized into confusing gray areas, and could be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions. This could result in long-term marriages, as well as recent same-sex marriages, being overturned.

The problems of defining gender by the existence/non-existence of gonads or certain sexual features is complicated by the existence of [[Gender Reassignment Surgery|surgical methods]] to alter these features. Estimates&lt;ref&gt;(Fausto-Sterling et al., 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; run as high as 1 percent of live [[childbirth|birth]]s exhibiting some degree of sexual ambiguity, and between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births being ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including sometimes involuntary [[surgery]] to address their sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transsexual to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. "Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality." Archives of Sexual Behavior 38.5 (Oct. 2009): 688–701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. September 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the UK marriages are for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her marriage or civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate. Such persons are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity.

In the United States, transsexual and intersexual marriages typically run into the complications detailed above. As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;SCHWARTZ, JOHN. "U.S. Defends Marriage Law."

==Controversy==
{{Off-topic|date=April 2010}}
{{See also|LGBT rights opposition}}
While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the [[history of same-sex unions|historical and anthropological record]] reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, to sympathetic toleration, to indifference, to prohibition. Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that recognition of same-sex marriages would erode religious freedoms,&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/191kgwgh.asp |title=Banned in Boston |publisher=Weeklystandard.com |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising, undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-blankenhorn19-2008sep19,0,6057126.story|title=Protecting marriage to protect children|last=Blankenhorn|first=David|date=September 19, 2008|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships,&lt;ref name="findlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements/ |title=See discussion of prenuptial and postmarital agreements at Findlaw |publisher=Family.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="indegayforum1"&gt;Dale Carpenter is a prominent spokesman for this view. For a better understanding of this view, see Carpenter's writings at http://www.indegayforum.org/staff/show/91.html.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The debate regarding same-sex marriages includes debate based upon social viewpoints as well as debate based on majority rules, religious convictions, economic arguments, health-related concerns, and a variety of other issues.

===Judicial and legislative===
{{Main|Marriage (conflict)#Same-sex marriage}}
A "[[direct democracy|majority rules]]" position determines whether same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;

Thursday, December 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a "[[civil rights]]" view answers the same question by carefully examining both sides of the controversy and seeking a ruling from an impartial judiciary, whether the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is constitutionally guaranteed (or in other countries, required for overriding equality reasons or other civil rights of citizens).&lt;ref&gt;

===Religion===

Many Christian groups have been vocal and politically active in opposing same-sex marriage laws in the United States. &lt;!--Cited list is in the [[Religious views on same-sex marriage]] subarticle  --&gt; Christians opposed to same-sex marriage have claimed that extending marriage rights to same-sex couples could undercut the conventional purpose of marriage, or would be contrary to God's will.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Southern Baptist Convention, ''On Same-Sex Marriage'' (adopted 2003) http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=1128 (visited January 20, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hatecrime.org/subpages/hatespeech/robertson.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021219203548/http://hatecrime.org/subpages/hatespeech/robertson.html|archivedate=December 19, 2002|title=The Religious Right and Anti-Gay Speech: Messengers of Love or Purveyors of Hate?|publisher=Matthew Shepard Online Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apacny.net/The%20Christian%20Case%20Against%20Same-Sex%20Marriage.pdf|title=The Christian Case Against Same-Sex Marriage|date=January 2008|publisher=Association of Politically Active Christians|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nogaymarriage.com/gaymarriagequestions.html Gay Marriage Questions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apacny.net/APACBiblicalPerspectiveSSMCU.pdf|title=A Biblical Perspective on Same-Sex "Marriage" and Civil Unions|date=January 2009|publisher=Association of Politically Active Christians|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caucusforamerica.com/print.php?pID=41 |title=America's Rabbi &amp;#124; Once Again Democrats Bow to “Unions” |publisher=Caucusforamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian opposition to same-sex marriage also comes from the belief that same-sex marriage normalizes homosexual behavior and would encourage it, instead of encouraging resistance to [[same-sex attraction]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Christian supporters of same-sex marriage have claimed that marriage rights for same-sex couples strengthens the institution of marriage and provides legal protection for children of gay and lesbian parents. Bible-based arguments for same-sex marriage rights include that the word "homosexual", as found in modern versions of the Bible, is an inaccurate translation of the original texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soulforce.org/article/homosexuality-bible-gay-christian|title=What the Bible Says&amp;nbsp;— And Doesn't Say&amp;nbsp;— About Homosexuality|last=White|first=Mel|publisher=Soulforce|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaychurch.org/gay_and_christian_yes/calling_the_rainbow_nation_home/7_gac_the_clobber_passages.htm|title=The "Clobber" Passages|publisher=gaychurch.org|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither [[Vine's Expository Dictionary]] nor [[Strong's Concordance]] (two significant bible reference works) contains the word "homosexual". There also is no direct biblical prohibition of marriage rights for same-sex couples. Certain biblical texts used by non-affirming Christian organizations to condemn homosexuality, and by extension same-sex marriage, may refer only to specific sex acts and idolatrous worship lacking any relevance to contemporary same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccchurch.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Resources|title=Resources|publisher=Metropolitan Community Church|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting marriage rights for gays and lesbians is viewed by affirming Christians as a Christ-like commitment to the equality and dignity of all persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedominchrist-sf.org/article_rd.htm|title=Before you Begin Studying the "Clobber" Passages|last=Davis|first=Richard|publisher=Freedom In Christ|accessdate=October 6, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051219165008/http://freedominchrist-sf.org/article_rd.htm |archivedate = December 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc2009.org/ViewLegislation/view_leg_detail.aspx?id=986&amp;type=Final|title=D025 – Anglican Communion: Commitment and Witness to Anglican Communion|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wouldjesusdiscriminate.com/|title=Would Jesus Discriminate?|publisher=Metropolitan Community Church|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Church of Canada]] asserts that "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, are a gift from God",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology|title=Equality Rights|publisher=United Church of Canada|year=2007

On July 4, 2005 the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC), at their 25th General Synod, voted to support full legal and religious marriage equality for gay and lesbian couples making it the first mainline Christian denomination in the United States to support and promote same sex marriage equality.  The UCC is a liberal Christian denomination with a long history of supporting gay rights, women's rights, African-American civil rights and other issues of social justice.

[[Unitarian Universalism]], a liberal faith tradition, supports marriage equality for same-sex couples. It has taken an active role advocating for LGBT rights and same-sex marriages are often performed in [[Unitarian Universalism|UU]] congregations.

Judaism, like Christianity, contains varying views on the issue of marriage rights, both politically and religiously, for same-sex couples. Many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] maintain the traditional Jewish bans on both sexual acts and marriages amongst members of the same sex,&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, Orthodox Response to Same-Sex Marriage, NY Jewish Week (Mar. 26, 2004) http://www.ou.org/public_affairs/article/ou_resp_same_sex_marriage/ (visited January 20, 2008); Rabbinical Council of America, Joining with Three Other Orthodox Organizations, RCA Opposes Redefinition of Marriage in New York State (June 21, 2007) http://www.rabbis.org/news/index.cfm?type=policies (visited January 20, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; but other orthodox rabbis, such as [[Steven Greenberg (rabbi)|Steven Greenberg]], disagree.

From the [[Islam]]ic perspective, a majority of [[Muslim]] legal scholars cite the rulings of Muhammad and the story of Lot in Sodom as condemnation of homosexuality. Given that Islam views marriage as an exchange between two parties of protection and security for exclusive sexual and reproductive rights, same-sex marriages cannot be considered legal within the constrains of a Muslim marriage.

[[Buddhist]] scripture and teachings do not take a consistent stance against homosexuality, and do not specifically proscribe nor endorse same-sex marriage; thus, there is no unified stance for or against the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,1429,0,0,1,0|title=Will gay marriage be allowed by Buddhists in Thailand?|last=Bhikkhu|first=Mettanando|date=July 13, 2005|publisher=Buddhist Channel|agency=Bangkok Post|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is sometimes asserted in policy debates that heterosexual couples are inherently better parents than same-sex couples, or that the children of lesbian or gay parents fare worse than children raised by heterosexual parents, those assertions find no support in the scientific research literature.&lt;ref name="amici"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Psychological Association: [http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/advocacy/brief.pdf Brief presented to the Legislative House of Commons Committee on Bill C38 By the Canadian Psychological Association June 2, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apsp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/LGBT-Families-Lit-Review.pdf |title=Elizabeth Short, Damien W.

The gender of a child’s parent is not a factor in a child’s adjustment. The sexual orientation of an individual does not determine whether that individual can be a good parent. Children raised by gay or lesbian parents are as likely as children raised by heterosexual parents to be healthy, successful and well-adjusted. The research supporting this conclusion is accepted beyond serious debate in the field of developmental psychology.&lt;ref name=perry&gt;[https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/files/09cv2292-ORDER.pdf Kristin M. Perry v. Arnold Schwarzenegger – Order]&lt;/ref&gt;  Statements by the leading associations of experts in this area reflect professional consensus that children raised by lesbian or gay parents do not differ in any important respects from those raised by heterosexual parents. No credible empirical research suggests otherwise.&lt;ref name="amici"/&gt;

If gay, lesbian, or bisexual parents were inherently less capable than otherwise comparable heterosexual parents, their children would evidence problems regardless of the type of sample. This pattern clearly has not been observed. Given the consistent failures in this research literature to disprove the null hypothesis, the burden of empirical proof is on those who argue that the children of sexual minority parents fare worse than the children of heterosexual parents.&lt;ref name="herek2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Herek GM |title=Legal recognition of same-sex relationships in the United States: a social science perspective |journal=The American Psychologist |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=607–21 |year=2006 |month=September |pmid=16953748 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.61.6.607 |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/AP_06_pre.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of same-sex marriage==

The American Psychological Association stated in 2004:&lt;ref name="psychological"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The institution of civil marriage confers a social status and important legal benefits, rights, and privileges. ... Same-sex couples are denied equal access to civil marriage. ... Same-sex couples who enter into a civil union are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to married couples ... The benefits, rights, and privileges associated with domestic partnerships are not universally available, are not equal to those associated with marriage, and are rarely portable ... Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, and socioeconomic status ... the APA believes that it is unfair and discriminatory to deny same-sex couples legal access to civil marriage and to all its attendant benefits, rights, and privileges.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The American Sociological Association stated in 2004:&lt;ref name="sociological"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman intentionally discriminates against lesbians and gay men as well as their children and other dependents by denying access to the protections, benefits, and responsibilities extended automatically to married couples ... we believe that the official justification for the proposed constitutional amendment is based on prejudice rather than empirical research ... the American Sociological Association strongly opposes the proposed constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Canadian Psychological Association stated in 2006:&lt;ref name="cpa2006"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The literature (including the literature on which opponents to marriage of same-sex couples appear to rely) indicates that parents’ financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union. As the CPA stated in 2003, the stressors encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent. The CPA recognizes and appreciates that persons and institutions are entitled to their opinions and positions on this issue. However, CPA is concerned that some are mis-interpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions, when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values. CPA asserts that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents’ relationship is recognized and supported by society’s institutions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The American Anthropological Association stated in 2005:&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt; 

    &lt;blockquote&gt;The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. Rather, anthropological research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The United Kingdom's Royal College of Psychiatrists has stated the following. The statement uses the term "civil partnership" and not gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/rollofhonour/specialinterestgroups/gaylesbian.aspx#recent |author=Royal College of Psychiatrists |title=Royal College of Psychiatrists’ Position Statement on Sexual Orientation |accessdate=November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... lesbian, gay and bisexual people are and should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens. This includes ... the rights and responsibilities involved in a civil partnership ... &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for the LGBT population that may affect their health and well-being.

In 2010, a Mailman School of Public Health study examining the effects of institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of [[anxiety disorders]], among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health: [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/cums-lgb030210.php Lesbian, gay, bisexual individuals risk psychiatric disorders from discriminatory policies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite news|title=New study suggests bans on gay marriage hurt mental health of LGB people|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-sexual-continuum/201003/new-study-suggests-bans-gay-marriage-hurt-mental-health-lgb-people|accessdate=8 November 2010|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=22 March 2010|author=Dr. Brian Mustanski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay activist [[Jonathan Rauch]] has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;Rauch, Jonathan. "[http://www.jonathanrauch.com/jrauch_articles/gay_marriage_1_the_case_for_marriage/ For Better or Worse?]" The case for gay (and straight) marriage. ''The New Republic'', May 6, 1996. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rauch, Jonathan (2004). ''Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America.'' New York, NY: Henry Holt and Company, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to opposite-sex marriage  indicate that same-sex and opposite-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex couples and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Herek, Gregory M. "Legal recognition of same-sex relationships in the United States: A social science perspective." ''American Psychologist,'' Vol 61(6), September 2006, 607–621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

In 2009, a pair of economists at [[Emory University]] tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of [[HIV]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sovo.com/2009/6-12/news/localnews/10213.cfm Emory researchers: Gay marriage bans increase HIV infections]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact:&amp;#160; Elaine Justice: 404.727.0643 |url=http://www.emory.edu/home/news/releases/2009/06/study-links-gay-marriage-bans-to-rise-in-hiv-rate.html |title=Study Links Gay Marriage Bans to Rise in HIV infections |publisher=Emory.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study linked the passage of same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
