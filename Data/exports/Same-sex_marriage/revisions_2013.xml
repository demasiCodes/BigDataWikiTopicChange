'''Same-sex marriage''' (also known as '''gay marriage''') is marriage between two persons of the same [[biological sex]] and/or [[gender identity]]. Legal recognition of same-sex marriage or the possibility to perform a same-sex marriage is sometimes referred to as '''marriage equality''' or '''equal marriage''', particularly by supporters.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:AENN&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=13F21B414EDA8168&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46 |title=Albany area real estate and the Marriage Equality Act |date=29 May 2012 |work=Albany Examiner |accessdate=25 December 2012 |author=Pratt, Patricia |quote=On July 24, 2011 the Marriage Equality Act became a law in New York State forever changing the state's legal view of what a married couple is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Vote on Illinois marriage equality bill coming in January: sponsors |url= http://chicagophoenix.com/2012/12/13/illinois-marriage-equality-vote-january/ |accessdate=23 December 2012 |newspaper=Chicago Phoenix |date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Commission endorses marriage and adoption equality |url= http://www.hrc.co.nz/human-rights-environment/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity/commission-endorses-marriage-and-adoption-equality |publisher=Human Right Commission New Zealand |date=No date |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mulholland |first=Helene |title=Ed Miliband calls for gay marriage equality |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/27/ed-miliband-gay-wedding-equality |accessdate=23 December 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |location =London |date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ring"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2012/12/20/newt-gingrich-accepts-marriage-equality-inevitable |title=Newt Gingrich: Marriage Equality Inevitable, OK |author=Ring, Trudy |work =The Advocate |location=Los Angeles |date=20 December 2012 |quote=He [Newt Gingrich] noted to HuffPo that he not only has a lesbian half-sister, LGBT rights activist Candace Gingrich, but has gay friends who've gotten married in Iowa, where their unions are legal.

Introduction of same-sex marriage laws has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through a legislative change to marriage laws, a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or by direct popular vote (via a [[ballot initiative]] or a [[referendum]]). The recognition of same-sex marriage is a political, social, [[human rights]] and [[civil rights]] issue, as well as a religious issue in many nations and around the world, and debates continue to arise over whether same-sex couples should be allowed marriage, be required to hold a different status (a [[civil union]]), or be denied recognition of such rights.&lt;ref name=MuslimWaPo&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Pamela K. |title= Marriage: Both Civil and Religious |url= http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/pamela_k_taylor/2009/07/marriage_both_civil_and_religious.html |accessdate=20 September 2012 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Susan K. |title= Marriage a Civil Right, not Sacred Rite |url= http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/susan_k_smith/2009/07/marriage_a_civil_right_not_sacred_rite.html |accessdate=20 September 2012 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision in Perry v.

Same-sex marriages can be performed in a secular [[Civil marriage|civil ceremony]] or in a religious setting. Various faith communities around the world support allowing same-sex couples to marry or conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies; for example: &lt;!-- PLEASE DO ''not'' ADD ANY RELIGIOUS GROUPS WHICH ARE ''not'' MAJOR/NOTABLE DENOMINATIONS OR DISTINCT RELIGIONS WITHOUT PRIOR DISCUSSION.

===Organizations===
The [[American Psychological Association]] stated in 2004:&lt;ref name="psychological" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The institution of civil marriage confers a social status and important legal benefits, rights, and privileges. ... Same-sex couples are denied equal access to civil marriage. ... Same-sex couples who enter into a civil union are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to married couples ... The benefits, rights, and privileges associated with domestic partnerships are not universally available, are not equal to those associated with marriage, and are rarely portable ... Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, and socioeconomic status ... the APA believes that it is unfair and discriminatory to deny same-sex couples legal access to civil marriage and to all its attendant benefits, rights, and privileges.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Sociological Association]] stated in 2004:&lt;ref name="asa" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman intentionally discriminates against lesbians and gay men as well as their children and other dependents by denying access to the protections, benefits, and responsibilities extended automatically to married couples ... we believe that the official justification for the proposed constitutional amendment is based on prejudice rather than empirical research ... the American Sociological Association strongly opposes the proposed constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Canadian Psychological Association]] stated in 2006:&lt;ref name=cpa2006 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The literature (including the literature on which opponents to marriage of same-sex couples appear to rely) indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union. As the CPA stated in 2003, the stressors encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent. The CPA recognizes and appreciates that persons and institutions are entitled to their opinions and positions on this issue. However, CPA is concerned that some are mis-interpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions, when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values. CPA asserts that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents' relationship is recognized and supported by society's institutions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Anthropological Association]] stated in 2005:&lt;ref name="aaa" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. Rather, anthropological research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded in 2006, in an analysis published in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'':&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;
{{quote|There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. These data have demonstrated no risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with 1 or more gay parents. Conscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, can be excellent parents. The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.}}

The United Kingdom's [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] has stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/PS01_2010x.pdf|author=Royal College of Psychiatrists|title=Royal College of Psychiatrists' Position Statement on Sexual Orientation|accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| ... lesbian, gay and bisexual people are and should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar {{sic}} rights and responsibilities as all other citizens. This includes ... the rights and responsibilities involved in a civil partnership ...}}

In 2010, a [[Columbia University]] [[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health|Mailman School of Public Health]] study examining the effects of institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of [[anxiety disorders]], among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author, the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasin|first=Deborah|title=Lesbian, gay, bisexual individuals risk psychiatric disorders from discriminatory policies|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/cums-lgb030210.php|publisher=[[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health]]|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite news|title=New study suggests bans on gay marriage hurt mental health of LGB people|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-sexual-continuum/201003/new-study-suggests-bans-gay-marriage-hurt-mental-health-lgb-people|accessdate=8 November 2010|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=22 March 2010|author=Dr. Brian Mustanski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America.'' New York, NY: Henry Holt and Company, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex couples and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Herek, Gregory M.

===Opinion polling===
Numerous polls and studies on the issue have been conducted, including those that were completed throughout the first decade of the 21st century. A consistent trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage has been revealed across the world. Much of the research that was conducted in developed countries in the first decade of the 21st century shows a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage. Support for legal same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.&lt;ref name=Gallup2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Newport|first=Frank|title=For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/First-Time-Majority-Americans-Favor-Legal-Gay-Marriage.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Opinion: Nationally|url=http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality/|publisher=australianmarriageequality.com|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Life in Estonia|url=http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia/|publisher=globalgayz.com|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jowit|first=Juliette|title=Gay marriage gets ministerial approval|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/jun/12/gay-marriage-receive-ministerial-approval|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Irish people support gay marriage, poll says|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/24/most-irish-people-support-gay-marriage-poll-says/ |accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=PinkNews|date=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent polling in the United States has shown a further increase in the American public's support for same-sex marriage. When adults were asked in 2005 if they thought "marriages between homosexuals should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages", 28 percent replied in the affirmative, while 68 percent replied in the negative (the remaining 4 percent stated that they were unsure). When adults were asked in March 2013 if they supported or opposed same-sex marriage, 50 percent said they supported same-sex marriage, while 41 percent were opposed, and the remaining 9 percent stated that they were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law and Civil Rights|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm|work=PollingReport.com|publisher=POLLING REPORT, INC|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various detailed polls and studies on same-sex marriage that were conducted in several countries show that support for same-sex marriage generally increases with higher levels of education, and that younger people are more likely to support legalization than older generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey&amp;nbsp;– Generations at Odds: The Millennial Generation and the Future of Gay and Lesbian Rights|url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/08/generations-at-odds/|publisher=[[Public Religion Research Institute]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pew Forum: Part 2: Gay Marriage|url=http://www.pewforum.org/PublicationPage.aspx?id=647|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poirier|first=Justine|title=Same-Sex Marriage: Let's Make a Change|url=http://www.montrealites.ca/justice/same-sex-marriage-lets-make-a-change.html|publisher=Montréalités Justice|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Data Points: Support for Legal Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Chart-Support-for-Legal/64683/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support for Same‐Sex Marriage in Latin America|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/insights/I0844.enrevised.pdf|publisher=[[Vanderbilt University]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of same-sex unions|Timeline of same-sex marriage|History of homosexuality}}

===Ancient===
An example of egalitarian male [[domestic partnership]] from the early [[Zhou Dynasty]] period of China is recorded in the story of [[Pan Zhang &amp; Wang Zhongxian]]. While the relationship was clearly approved by the wider community, and was compared to heterosexual marriage, it did not involve a religious ceremony binding the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsch, Bret. (1990). ''Passions of the Cut Sleeve''. University of California Press. pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

The first historical mention of the performance of same-sex marriages occurred during the early [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=boswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=John|title=Same-sex unions in premodern Europe|year=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-75164-5|pages=80–85|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Same_sex_unions_in_premodern_Europe.html?id=iRL9cXA1m1IC}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were usually reported in a critical or satirical manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frier|first=Bruce|title=Roman Same-Sex Weddings from the Legal Perspective|url=http://www.umich.edu/~classics/news/newsletter/winter2004/weddings.html|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Elagabalus]] referred to his [[quadriga|chariot]] driver, a blond slave from [[Caria]] named [[Hierocles (charioteer)|Hierocles]], as his husband.&lt;ref name="dio-history-lxxix-30"&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/79*.html#78-30 LXXIX.30]&lt;/ref&gt; He also married an athlete named Zoticus in a lavish public ceremony in Rome amidst the rejoicings of the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius '' Epitome '' 80.5, 80.14, 80.15, 80.16; Herodian ''Roman History '' 5.6.1–5.6.2.

The first Roman emperor to have married a man was [[Nero]], who is reported to have married two other men on different occasions. His first marriage was with one of his [[Freedman|freedmen]], [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]], to whom Nero took the role of the bride. Later, as a groom, Nero married [[Sporus]], a young boy who resembled one of Nero's concubines,&lt;ref&gt;Nero missed her so greatly after her death that on learning of a woman who resembled her he at first sent for her and kept her; but later he caused a boy of the freedmen, whom he used to call Sporus, ... "he formally "married" Sporus, and assigned the boy a regular dowry according to contract;" q.v., Suetonius ''Nero'' 28; Dio Cassius '' Epitome '' 62.28
Old Translation of passage at:http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html&lt;/ref&gt; in a very public ceremony with all the solemnities of matrimony, after which Sporus lived with Nero as his spouse. A friend gave the "bride" away as required by law. The marriage was celebrated separately in both Greece and Rome in extravagant public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius '' Epitome '' 62.28, 62.13. Old Translation of passage at: http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted, however, that ''conubium'' existed only between a ''civis Romanus'' and a ''civis Romana'' (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citizen), so that a marriage between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases).&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, ''The Roman Law of Marriage'' (Oxford, 1969), pp. 24–28; Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), pp. 43–49.; "Marriages where the partners had ''conubium'' were marriages valid in Roman law (''iusta matrimonia'')" [Treggiari, p. 49]. Compare Ulpian (''Tituli Ulpiani'') 5.3–5: "''Conubium'' is the capacity to marry a wife in Roman law. Roman citizens have ''conubium'' with Roman citizens, but with Latins and foreigners only if the privilege was granted. There is no ''conubium'' with slaves"; compare also Gaius (''Institutionum'' 1:55–56, 67, 76–80).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Susan Treggiari, "''matrimonium'' is an institution involving a mother, ''mater''. The idea implicit in the word is that a man takes a woman in marriage, ''in matrimonium ducere'', so that he may have children by her."&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the lack of legal validity notwithstanding, there is a consensus among modern historians that same-sex relationships existed in ancient Rome, but the exact frequency and nature of "same-sex unions" during that period is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eskridge|first=William N.|year=1993|month=Oct|title=A History of Same-Sex Marriage |journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=79|issue=7|quote=The Romans may have accorded some same-sex unions the legal or cultural status of marriage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 342 AD Christian emperors [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]] issued a law in the [[Theodosian Code]] (''C. Th.'' 9.7.3) prohibiting [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|same-sex marriage in Rome]] and ordering execution for those so married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuefler|first=Mathew|year=2007|title=The Marriage Revolution in Late Antiquity: The Theodosian Code and Later Roman Marriage Law|journal=Journal of Family History|volume=32|pages=343–370|url=http://jfh.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/32/4/343|doi=10.1177/0363199007304424|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
A same-sex marriage between the two men Pedro Díaz and Muño Vandilaz in the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] municipality of [[Rairiz de Veiga]] in Spain occurred on 16 April 1061. They were married by a priest at a small chapel. The historic documents about the church wedding were found at [[Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova]].&lt;ref name="firstmarriage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galiciae.com/nova/78210.html|language=gl|author=Carlos Callón|title=Callón gaña o Vicente Risco de Ciencias Sociais cun ensaio sobre a homosexualidade na Idade Media|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Victorian Era, two women cohabiting was termed a [[Boston marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wouldjesusdiscriminate.org/biblical_evidence/ruth_naomi.html | title = Ruth loved Naomi as Adam loved Eve | publisher = wouldjesusdiscriminate.org | accessdate = 10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denmark was the first state to recognize a legal relationship for same-sex couples, establishing "registered partnerships" very much like marriage in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rule|first=Sheila|title=Rights for Gay Couples in Denmark|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/02/world/rights-for-gay-couples-in-denmark.html|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Netherlands]] became the first nation in the world to grant [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|same-sex marriages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/05/26/f-same-sex-timeline.html|title=Same-sex marriage around the world|work=CBC News|location=Toronto|date=26 May 2009|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriages are also granted and mutually recognized by [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative record of the same-sex marriage bill (in Dutch)|url=http://www.senaat.be/www/?MIval=/dossier&amp;LEG=2&amp;NR=1173&amp;LANG=nl|publisher=senaat.be (Belgian Senate)|accessdate=25 September 2012}} and {{cite web|title=Legislative record of the same-sex marriage bill (in French)|url=http://www.senaat.be/www/?MIval=/dossier&amp;LEG=2&amp;NR=1173&amp;LANG=fr|publisher=senaat.be (Belgian Senate)|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]] (2010),&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/05/17/portugal-gay017.html|title=Portugal's president signs gay marriage bill|work=CBC News|location =Toronto|date=17 May 2010|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] (2012), [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]] (2013) and [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]] (2013).

==Same sex marriage around the world==
{{Main|Status of same-sex marriage|Same-sex union legislation}}

Same-sex marriage is legally recognized nationwide in [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]], [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]],&lt;ref group="nb" name="Denmark" /&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]], the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]],&lt;ref group="nb" name="Netherlands" /&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]],&lt;ref group="nb" name="New Zealand"/&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]], [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]], [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]]. In the [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|United States]], same-sex marriages are recognized on the federal level, though same-sex couples can only marry in fourteen of the fifty states and Washington D.C. In [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Mexico|Mexico]], same-sex marriages are only performed regularly in [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|Mexico City]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Quintana Roo|Quintana Roo]], but these marriages are recognized by all Mexican states and by the Mexican federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wall|first=Allan|title=Mexican Supreme Court Advances Gay Marriage Agenda|url=http://www.newswithviews.com/Wall/allan132.htm|work=News With Views|quote="The ruling [on] 5 August 2010, upheld the Mexico City same-sex marriage law as being constitutional.

===Legal recognition===

====Argentina====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Argentina}}
On 15 July 2010, the Argentine Senate approved a bill extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. It was supported by the Government of [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] and opposed by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrionuevo|first=Alexei|title=Argentina Approves Gay Marriage, in a First for Region|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/world/americas/16argentina.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 February 2012|date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls showed that nearly 70% of Argentines supported giving gay people the same marital rights as heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/world/americas/14argentina.html|work=The New York Times|title=Argentina Senate to Vote on Gay Marriage|first=Alexei|last=Barrionuevo|date=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law came into effect on 22 July 2010.

====Australia====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Australia}}
On 22 October 2013, a bill was passed by the Parliament of the [[Australian Capital Territory]] legalising same-sex marriage. However, the Commonwealth ''[[Marriage Act 1961 (Australia)|Marriage Act 1961]]'' defines marriage as between "a man and a woman", so its Constitutional legality is unclear. A [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] challenge is expected later in 2013 by the Federal Government.

====Belgium====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Belgium}}
Belgium became the second country in the world to legally recognize same-sex marriages when a bill passed by the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]] took effect on 1 June 2003. Originally, Belgium allowed the marriages of foreign same-sex couples only if their country of origin also allowed these unions, however legislation enacted in October 2004 permits any couple to marry if at least one of the spouses has lived in the country for a minimum of three months. A 2006 statute legalized [[LGBT adoption|adoption by same-sex spouses]].

====Brazil====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Brazil}}
[[Supreme Federal Court|Brazil's Supreme Court]] ruled in May 2011 that same-sex couples are legally entitled to legal recognition of cohabitation (known as {{lang|pt|''união estável''}}, what includes all family and married couple rights in Brazil since the same date), turning same-sex marriage legally possible as a consequence, and just stopping short of equalization of same-sex marriage (potentially confusing, marriage is termed {{lang|pt|''união civil''}} in legal Brazilian Portuguese; a same-sex marriage is a {{lang|pt|''união civil homoafetiva''}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazil's supreme court recognizes gay partnerships|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/06/us-brazil-gayrights-idUSTRE74503V20110506|accessdate=16 February 2012|agency=Reuters|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex couples had their cohabitation issues converted into marriage in several Brazil states with the approval of a state judge. All legal Brazilian marriages were always recognized all over Brazil.&lt;ref name="WPost"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/brazil-judge-approves-what-appears-to-be-countrys-first-gay-marriage-between-2-men/2011/06/27/AGYN2znH_story.html |title=Brazilian judge gives male couple approval for what court says is country's first gay marriage |date=27 June 2011 |work=The Washington Post |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5zsXujTvb |archivedate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 2013, The Justice's [[National Justice Council|National Council of Brazil]] issues a ruling requiring all civil registers of the country to perform same-sex marriages by a 14-1 vote, thus legalizing same-sex marriage in the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/cidades,cnj-obriga-cartorios-a-celebrar-casamento-entre-homossexuais,1031678,0.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2013/05/apos-uniao-estavel-gay-podera-casar-em-cartorio-decide-cnj.html Decisão do CNJ obriga cartórios a fazer casamento homossexual]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jb.com.br/pais/noticias/2013/05/14/cnj-obriga-cartorios-a-converterem-uniao-estavel-gay-em-casamento/ CNJ obriga cartórios a converterem união estável gay em casamento]&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution came into effect on 16 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.cnj.jus.br/dje/jsp/dje/DownloadDeDiario.jsp?dj=DJ89_2013-ASSINADO.PDF&amp;statusDoDiario=ASSINADO DIÁRIO DA JUSTIÇA CONSELHO NACIONAL DE JUSTIÇA Edição nº 89/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2013/05/regra-que-obriga-cartorios-fazer-casamento-gay-vale-partir-do-dia-16.html Regra que obriga cartórios a fazer casamento gay vale a partir do dia 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, polls suggested that 47% of Brazilians supported marriage equalization and 57% supported adoption equalization for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portugues.christianpost.com/news/quase-metade-dos-internautas-brasileiros-aprova-o-casamento-gay-15398/ Almost half of Brazilian internet users support gay marriage – The Christian Post in Portuguese] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls in June 2013 also supported the conclusion that the division of opinion between acceptance and rejection of same-sex marriage is in about equal halves. When the distinction between same-sex unions that are not termed marriages in relation to same-sex marriage is made, the difference in the numbers of approval and disapproval is still insignificant, below 1%; the most frequently reason for disapproval is the supposed 'unnaturalness' of same-sex relationships, followed by religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telelistas.net/blog/62-das-pessoas-nao-aprovam-o-casamento-gay-segundo-enquete/ 62% of people aren't approving of gay marriage, according to poll – Telelistas] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.gospelmais.com.br/pesquisa-maioria-brasileiros-contra-casamento-gay-55261.html A majority of Brazilians is against same-sex marriage and regards church as the most trustworthy institution, reveals research – Gospel+] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Canada}}
Legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Canada followed a series of constitutional challenges based on the [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|equality provisions]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. In the first such case, ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'', same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in [[Same-sex marriage in Ontario|Ontario]] on 14 January 2001 were subsequently validated when the [[common law]], mixed-sex definition of marriage was held to be unconstitutional. Similar rulings had legalized same-sex marriage in eight provinces and one territory when the 2005 ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]'' defined marriage throughout Canada as "the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others."

====Denmark====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Denmark}}
On 7 June 2012, the [[Folketing]] (Danish parliament) approved new laws regarding same-sex civil and religious marriage. These laws permit same-sex couples to get married in the [[Church of Denmark]]. The bills received [[Royal Assent]] on 12 June and took effect on 15 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanners|first=Peter|title=Gay marriage legalised|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/national/updated-gay-marriage-legalised|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=The Copenhagen Post|date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark was previously the first country in the world to legally recognize same-sex couples through registered partnerships in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.cybercity.dk/~dko12530/s2.htm The Registered Partnership Act]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rule, Sheila (2 October 1989).

{{main|Same-sex marriage in France}}
Following the election of [[François Hollande]] as President of France in May 2012 and the subsequent legislative election in which the Socialist party took a majority of seats in the French National Assembly, the new Prime Minister [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] stated that a same-sex marriage bill has been drafted and would be passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Gay Marriage Will Soon Become Legal in France, Big Win for LGBT Rights in Europe|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iCHjEwL13Lmoqv92kvpq7ADOWPlw|publisher=AFP|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government introduced a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, [[Bill 344 (2012)|Bill 344]], in the National Assembly on 17 November 2012. Article 1 of the bill defining marriage as an agreement between two people was passed on 2 February 2013 in its first reading by a 249–97 vote. On 12 February 2013, the National Assembly approved the entire bill in a 329–229 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France's parliament passes gay marriage bill|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/02/12/france-gay-marriage-adoption.html|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2013, the upper house of the French parliament voted to legalise gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French senate votes to legalise gay marriage|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22126437|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April 2013 the law was approved by the National Assembly in a 331-225 vote.&lt;ref name="Same-sex marriage: France"&gt;{{cite web|title=Same-sex marriage: French parliament approves new law|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22261494|publisher=BBC News Europe|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law No.2013-404 grants same-sex couples living in France, including foreigners provided at least one of the partners has their domicile or residence in France, the legal right to get married.  The law also allows the recognition in France of same-sex couples’ marriages that occurred abroad before the bill's enactment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lesur|first=Lionel|title=France Allows Same-Sex Marriages|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/france-allows-same-sex-marriages|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=13 June 2013|author2=Lisa A. Linsky|author3=McDermott Will &amp; Emery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement of the French parliament's vote results, those in opposition to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in France participated in public protests. In both Paris and Lyon, violence erupted as protesters clashed with police; the issue has mobilised right-wing forces in the country, including neo-Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollande calls for calm as gay marriage opponents vow to fight on in France|url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/04/24/hollande-calls-for-calm-as-gay-marriage-opponents-vow-to-fight-on-in-france/|accessdate=25 April 2013|newspaper=Euronews|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main right-wing opposition party UMP challenged the law in the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], which had one month to rule on whether the law conformed to the Constitution. The Constitutional Council had previously ruled that the issue of same-sex marriage was one for the legislature to decide &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Décision n° 2010-92 QPC du 28 janvier 2011|url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2011/2010-92-qpc/decision-n-2010-92-qpc-du-28-janvier-2011.52612.html|work=Les décisions|publisher=Conseil Constitutionel|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was only little hope for UMP to overturn the parliament's vote.

On 17 May 2013, the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] declared the Bill legal in its entire redaction. President Hollande signed it into law on 18 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/2013/2013-669-dc/communique-de-presse.137047.html Communiqué de presse - 2013-669 DC - Loi ouvrant le mariage aux couples de personnes de même sexe], [[Constitutional Council of France]], retrieved on 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Israel}}
Israel's High Court of Justice ruled to honor same-sex marriages granted in other countries, in line with its recognition of other civil marriages; Israel does not recognize civil marriages performed under its own jurisdiction. A bill was raised in the [[Knesset]] (parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but the Knesset has not advanced the bill since December 2006. A bill to legalize same-sex and interfaith civil marriages was defeated in the Knesset, 39–11, on 16 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Jerusalem Post|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=270221|title=Knesset rejects marriage equality bill|date=16 May 2012|author=Harkov, Lahav|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands was the first country to extend marriage laws to include same-sex couples, following the recommendation of a special commission appointed to investigate the issue in 1995. A same-sex marriage bill passed the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] and the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] in 2000, taking effect on 1 April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/20/world/same-sex-dutch-couples-gain-marriage-and-adoption-rights.html|title=Same-Sex Dutch Couples Gain Marriage and Adoption Rights|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 2000|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Norway====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Norway}}

Same-sex marriage became legal in Norway on 1 January 2009 when a gender neutral marriage bill was enacted after being passed by the Norwegian legislature in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway adopts gay marriage law|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jko_BIHizUFFqUtmEaUrAEoPXFWw|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse]] via [[Google]]|date=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-06-17-gaymarriage_N.htm|title=New law in Norway grants gay couples marriage rights|work=USA Today|location =Washington DC|date=17 June 2008|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway became the first [[Scandinavia]]n country and the sixth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.

Gender neutral marriage replaced Norway's previous system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Couples in registered partnerships are able to retain that status or convert their registered partnership to a marriage. No new registered partnerships may be created.

====Portugal====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Portugal}}
{{See also|De facto union in Portugal}}
Portugal created de facto unions ({{lang|pt|''união de facto''}} in legal European Portuguese) similar to common-law marriage for cohabiting opposite-sex partners in 1999, and extended these unions to same-sex couples in 2001. However, the 2001 extension did not allow for same-sex adoption, either jointly or of stepchildren.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

On 8 January 2010, the parliament approved—126 votes in favor, 97 against and 7 abstentions—same-sex marriage. The Portuguese president promulgated the law on 8 April 2010 and the law was effective on 5 June 2010, making Portugal the eighth country to legalize nationwide same-sex marriage; however, adoption was still denied for same-sex couples.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

On 24 February 2012, the parliament rejected two bills allowing same-sex couples to adopt children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GAY RIGHTS: LAWMAKERS DEFEAT ADOPTION BILL FOR COUPLES|url=http://www.portugaldailyview.com/whats-new/gay-rights-lawmakers-defeat-adoption-bill-for-couples|work=Portugal Daily View|publisher=Portugal Daily View|accessdate=24 October 2013|author=Lusa News|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 17 May 2013, the Portuguese parliament passed a law allowing same-sex married couples to adopt their partner's children (i.e. stepchild adoption).

====South Africa====

[[File:Gay troue.jpg|thumb|210px|Same-sex wedding in South Africa, 2007]]
Legal recognition of same-sex marriages in South Africa came about as a result of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]]'s decision in the case of ''[[Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie]]''. The court ruled on 1 December 2005 that the existing marriage laws violated the [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa|equality clause]] of the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]] because they discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. The court gave [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] one year to rectify the inequality. The [[Civil Union Act (South Africa)|Civil Union Act]] was passed by the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] on 14 November 2006, by a vote of 230 to 41. It became law on 30 November 2006. South Africa is the fifth country, the first in Africa, and the second outside Europe, to legalize same-sex marriage.

Same-sex marriage in Sweden has been legal since 1 May 2009, following the adoption of a new, gender-neutral law on marriage by the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish parliament]] on 1 April 2009, making Sweden the seventh country in the world to open marriage to same sex couples nationwide. Marriage replaced Sweden's registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Existing registered partnerships between same-sex couples remained in force with an option to convert them into marriages.&lt;ref name="swedishmarriagerights"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7978495.stm|title=Sweden allows same-sex marriage|publisher=BBC News|date=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church of Sweden says yes to gay marriage|url=http://www.thelocal.se/22810/20091022/|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=The Local|date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005 same-sex couples have been allowed to enter into [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]], a separate union which provides the [[Legal consequences of marriage and civil partnership in the United Kingdom|legal consequences of marriage]]. In 2006 the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] rejected a legal bid by a British lesbian couple who had [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|married]] in Canada to have their union recognised as a marriage in the UK rather than a civil partnership. In September 2011, the Coalition government announced its intention to introduce same-sex civil marriage in England and Wales by the [[Next United Kingdom general election|next general election]] in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Jessica|title=Government proposes introducing gay marriage after Cameron intervention|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/09/16/government-proposes-introduction-of-full-gay-marriage-after-cameron-intervention/|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the UK government's Consultation for England and Wales did not include provision for religious ceremonies. In May 2012, three religious groups (Quakers, Liberal Judaism and Unitarians) sent a letter to David Cameron, asking that they be allowed to solemnise same-sex weddings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/05/29/religious-groups-urge-david-cameron-to-maintain-equal-marriage-support/ Pink News: Religious groups urge Cameron]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012 the UK government completed the Consultation to allow civil marriage for same-sex couples in [[England and Wales]]&lt;ref name="grauni1127"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships may soon be welcomed|first=Alan|last=Travis|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/17/civil-partnerships-marriage|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its response to the Consultation, the Government said that it now also intended "...to enable those religious organisations that wish to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies to do so, on a permissive basis only."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/equal-marriage-consultation UK Government website: response to Consultation]&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2012, the Prime Minister announced that, whilst he favoured allowing same-sex marriage within a religious context, provision would be made guaranteeing no religious institution would be required to perform such ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20642428 BBC Gay Marriage:Cameron backs Church role]&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 2013, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debated the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill]], approving it in a 400–175 vote at the second [[Reading (legislature)|reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Sparrow |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2013/feb/05/gay-marriage-debate-politics-live-blog|title=MPs vote overwhelmingly in favour of gay marriage |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third reading took place on 21 May 2013, and was approved by 366 votes to 161.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay marriage: Commons passes Cameron's plan |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22605011 |accessdate=21 May 2013 |date=21 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 2013 the Bill received its second reading in the [[House of Lords]], after a blocking amendment was defeated by 390 votes to 148.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 2013, the Bill was given a third reading by the House of Lords, meaning that it had been passed, and so it was then returned to Commons for the consideration of Lords' amendments.

The [[104th United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) in 1996, attempting to define marriage for the first time solely as a union between a man and a woman for all federal purposes, and allowing states to refuse to recognize such marriages created in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/1/7.html|title=US CODE: Title 1,7. Definition of "marriage" and "spouse"|publisher=Cornell University|date=7 April 2010|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning]]'' (2005), holding that prohibiting recognition of same-sex relationships violated the Constitution, was overturned on appeal by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 2006, which ruled that "laws limiting the state-recognized institution of marriage to heterosexual couples ... do not violate the Constitution of the United States."  However this decision no longer has precedential effect after [[Windsor v. United States]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; where the Supreme Court, stated that "DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of the equal liberty of persons that is protected by the Fifth Amendment".  The [[Washington Supreme Court]], also in 2006, concluded that encouraging procreation within the framework of marriage can be seen as a legitimate government interest furthered by limiting marriage to between mixed-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|opinion=No. 75934-1|pinpoint=p. 41|litigants=Andersen v.

In 2010, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for Northern California]] ruled in ''[[Perry v.

{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Australia}}
Australian federal law currently bans recognition of same-sex marriages, although as of 2013, the nation's smallest sub-jurisdiction (the [[Australian Capital Territory]]) has legalised same-sex marriage. However, the [[Commonwealth Government]] is currently challenging the constitutional and legal validity of the ACT's law. The federal [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] government officially changed its position to allow a [[conscience vote]] on same-sex marriage in 2011, despite then-Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]]'s opposition to such a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-06/turnbull-calls-for-conscience-vote-on-gay-marriage/3714796|title= Turnbull backs conscience vote on gay marriage|publisher=ABC News|location=Sydney|date=6 December 2011|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] is opposed to same-sex marriage, and its leader [[Tony Abbott]] said he will block a conscience vote on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kerr, Christian|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/tony-abbotts-swing-on-same-sex-marriage/story-fn59niix-1226250767160|title=Tony Abbott's swing on same-sex marriage|work=The Australian|location=Sydney|date=23 January 2012|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Registered partnerships]] are available in [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]], Queensland and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. From 1 July 2009 [[Social Security (Australia)|Centrelink]] recognised same-sex couples equally regarding social security&amp;nbsp;– under the common-law marriage, de facto status or unregistered cohabitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of a partner|url=http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/individuals/member_couple_ssr.htm|publisher=Australian Department of Human Services|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010 Tasmania became the first Australian state to recognise same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions, though only as de facto status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-09-29/tasmania-to-recognise-same-sex-marriage/2279158|title=Tasmania to recognise same-sex marriage|publisher=ABC News|location=Sydney|date=30 September 2010|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 2012, a bill before the The [[Australian House of Representatives]] to legalize same-sex marriage was defeated 42 to 98 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lower House votes down same-sex marriage bill|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-19/same-sex-marriage-bill-voted-down/4270016|work=ABC News|first=Simon|last=Cullen|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, as one of his first speeches as new Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd made it clear that he was proud to be the first ever Australian PM to support gay marriage, declaring he would consider a plebiscite or referendum on the issue, although he was defeated before he could take this action.

====China====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in the People's Republic of China}}
The ''Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China'' explicitly defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman. No other form of civil union is recognized. The attitude of the Chinese government towards homosexuality is believed to be "three nos": "No approval; no disapproval; no promotion." The Ministry of Health officially removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in 2001.

[[Li Yinhe]], a sociologist and sexologist well known in the Chinese gay community, has tried to legalize same-sex marriage several times, including during the National People's Congress in 2000 and 2004 (''Legalization for Same-Sex Marriage'' 《中国同性婚姻合法化》 in 2000 and the ''Same-Sex Marriage Bill'' 《中国同性婚姻提案》 in 2004). According to Chinese law, 35 delegates' signatures are needed to make an issue a bill to be discussed in the Congress. Her efforts failed due to lack of support from the delegates. A government spokesperson, when asked about Li Yinhe's proposal, said that same-sex marriage was still too "ahead of its time" for China. He argued that same-sex marriage was not recognized even in many Western countries, which are considered much more liberal in social issues than China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2006-03-05/10278364854s.shtml|title=政协发言人称同性婚姻太超前 李银河提案再受挫_新闻中心_新浪网|publisher=News.sina.com.cn|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement is understood as an implication that the government may consider recognition of same-sex marriage in the long run, but not in the near future.

====Colombia====
{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Colombia}}
On 26 July 2011, the Constitutional Court of Colombia ordered the Congress to pass the legislation giving same-sex couples similar rights to marriage by 20 June 2013. If such a law is not passed by then, same-sex couples will be granted these rights automatically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-577-2011.pdf DECISION C-577/11 The homosexuals have the right to form a family]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/07/27/colombia.gay.marriage/|work=CNN| title=Colombian court says Congress must decide on gay marriage|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 Senator [[Armando Benedetti]] introduced a bill legalizing same-sex marriage. It initially only allowed for civil unions, but he amended the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/articulo-382915-matrimonio-gay-empieza-ser-tramitado-senado "Matrimonio gay" empieza a ser tramitado en Senado]&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate's First Committee approved the bill on 4 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colombia-politics.com/gay-marriage-bill-passes-first-hurdle/ Gay marriage bill passes first hurdle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.semana.com/nacion/primera-vez-comision-del-congreso-aprueba-matrimonio-gay/189204-3.aspx Por primera vez una comisión del Congreso aprueba el matrimonio gay]&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2013, the bill was defeated in the full Senate on a 51–17 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/24/uk-colombia-gaymarriage-idUKBRE93N1EJ20130424|publisher=[[Reuters]] |title=Colombia lawmakers reject controversial gay marriage bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2013, a judge sanctioned a legal domestic partnership between two gay men. The union has been variously described as a "civil union" and a "marriage", although a former top judge suggested it is "an unnamed contract that is not matrimony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://southfloridagaynews.com/articles/first-same-sex-civil-union-legalized-in-colombia/126641|title=First Same-Sex Civil Union Legalized in Colombia|agency=South Florida Gay News|date=25 July 2013|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Finland}}
In 2010, [[Minister of Justice (Finland)|Minister of Justice]] [[Tuija Brax]] said her Ministry was preparing to amend the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriage by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/07/gender-neutral_marriage_law_possible_by_2012_1804013.html|title=Gender-Neutral Marriage Law Possible by 2012|work=[[YLE|Finnish Broadcasting Company]]|accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2013, the bill was rejected by the Legal Affairs Committee of the Finnish Parliament by 9 to 8. A [[Initiative#Finland|citizens' initiative]] was launched on 19 March 2013 to put the issue before Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk web |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/01/finland-parliamentary-committee-narrowly-rejects-equal-marriage-bill/ |title=Finland: Parliamentary committee narrowly rejects equal marriage bill |first= Joseph Patrick |last=McCormick |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative gathered the required number of 50,000 signatures of Finnish citizens in just one day, and had exceeded 107,000 signatures on the citizens' initiative website of the Ministry of Justice by the time of its reporting by the media. The citizens' initiative overrides the committee's decision, and thus the bill must now be considered by the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/petitioners_take_gay_marriage_bill_to_parliament/6544701 |title=Petitioners take gay marriage bill to Parliament|publisher=Yle|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Germany}}

Since 1 August 2001, Germany has registered partnerships (Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) for same-sex couples, providing most but not all rights of marriage. The differences extend to taxes and adoption.
In June 2011, [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Germany|Germany]] faced a vote on same-sex marriage. The issue was opened by the [[Senate of Hamburg|senate of the city-state]] of [[Hamburg]], and would be voted on in the Federal Bundesrat.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

On 28 June 2012, a [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]] motion to allow parity for same-sex couples for tax purposes and adoption was defeated in the [[Bundestag|Federal Diet of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/bundestag-lehnt-entwurf-fuer-homo-ehen-ab-1.2889834|title=Bundestag lehnt Entwurf für Homo-Ehen ab|language=German|trans_title=Federal Diet declines motion for gay marriages|date=28 June 2012|newspaper=[[Rheinische Post]]|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2013 the Bundesrat passed a bill to establish legal recognition for same-sex marriage, which is now presently pending before the Bundestag for approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=18841|title=Bundesrat stimmt für Ehe-Öffnung|publisher=queer.de|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present [[Government of Ireland]] established a [[Constitutional Convention (Ireland)|Constitutional Convention]] in December 2012 tasked with considering wide-ranging changes to the Irish constitution, and one of the issues the Convention will address and make recommendations to the Government on is same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution|title=Constitutional Convention|publisher=Government of Ireland|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2013 the Convention voted in favour of same-sex marriage by a margin of 79 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/referendum-strongly-backed-for-samesex-marriage-29195120.html|title=Referendum strongly backed for same-sex marriage|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government has pledged to respond publicly to recommendations arising from the Convention and will indicate a date for referendum where it is considered necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1203/1224327391745.html|title=Taoiseach makes commitment to constitution group|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Same-sex marriage in Nepal}}
In November 2008, Nepal's highest court issued final judgment on matters related to LGBT rights, which included permitting same-sex couples to marry. Same-sex marriage and protection for sexual minorities were to be included in the new Nepalese constitution required to be completed by 31 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nepal/Nepal-charter-to-grant-gay-rights/Article1-499154.aspx|title=Nepal charter to grant gay rights|work=Hindustan Times|date=19 January 2010|accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Dean|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/7027736/Nepal-to-stage-gay-weddings-on-Everest.html|title=Nepal 'to stage gay weddings on Everest'|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 January 2010|accessdate=1 February 2010| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legislature was unable to agree on the constitution before the deadline and was dissolved after the Supreme Court ruled that the term could not be extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/world/asia/nepal-disbands-legislature-as-talks-on-constitution-fail.html|title=Legislature in Nepal Disbands in Failure|work=The New York Times|date=31 May 2012|accessdate=1 June 2012|first1=Kiran|last1=Chapagain|first2=Jim|last2=Yardley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====
In the process of rewriting the Turkish constitution, the opposition party [[Peace and Democracy Party|BDP]] called for the liberalization of marriage policies to include same-sex marriage. The largest opposition party in the Turkish parliament, [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]], supported the idea. The largest party in the parliament, the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]], opposes same-sex marriage, although Premier [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], the leader of the AKP, supported full equal rights for LGBT citizens in 2002, the year he launched his party. In response to a request from BDP, a parliamentary discussion of same-sex marriage is anticipated when all political parties gather in committees to establish a new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BDP'nin eşcinsel evlilik isteği tartışılıyor|url=http://www.haber10.com/haber/279069/|publisher=Haber10|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GL|first=Kaos|title=LGBT Initiative from Prime Minister Erdoğan!|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/guide/country_by_country/turkey/lgbt_initiative_from_prime_minister_erdogan|publisher=ILGA Europe|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a poll of Turkish attitudes towards sexuality, 3.6% of Turks supported same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bekâret ve eşcinsellik...|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalYazar&amp;ArticleID=1120726&amp;Yazar=DR.-ALPER-HASANOGLU&amp;CategoryID=41|publisher=[[Radikal]]|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Vietnam}}
In Vietnam, currently only a marriage between a man and a woman is recognized. Vietnam's Ministry of Justice began seeking advice on legalizing same-sex marriage from other governmental and non-governmental organizations in April and May 2012, and planned to further discuss the issue at the National Assembly in Spring 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnam government consults on same-sex marriage|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vietnam-government-consults-same-sex-marriage200612|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2013, the Ministry of Justice requested that the National Assembly avoid action until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote on same-sex marriage in Vietnam likely to be delayed until 2014|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vote-same-sex-marriage-vietnam-likely-be-delayed-until-2014200213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a hearing to discuss marriage law reforms in April 2013, deputy minister of health Nguyen Viet Tien proposed that same-sex marriage be made legal immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/04/vietnam-flawed-on-human-rights-but-a-leader-in-gay-rights/275413/|title=Vietnam: Flawed on Human Rights, but a Leader in Gay Rights|author=Thomas Maresca|date=30 April 2013|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese government abolished an administrative fine imposed on same-sex weddings in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/345169/vietnam-ends-same-sex-marriage-fines&lt;/ref&gt; The policy will be enacted on Nov 11, 2013. The 100,000-500,000 [[VND]]  ($24[[USD]]) fine will be abolished. Although same-sex marriages are not permitted in Vietnam, the policy will decriminalize the relationship, habitual privileges such as household registry, property, child raising, and co-habitual partnerships are recognized.&lt;ref&gt;S.Sarkar, Gaystar News.

===International organizations===
The terms of employment of the staff of [[international organizations]] (not [[Business|commercial]]) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.

Despite their relative independence, few organizations recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the United Nations recognize same-sex marriages if and only if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Secretary-General Bulletin|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/522/40/PDF/N0452240.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to mixed-sex married couples to ''de facto'' partners or [[domestic partner]]s of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into an mixed-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the [[World Bank]] does recognize domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTHRJOBS/0,,contentMDK:20522360~menuPK:1353209~pagePK:64262408~piPK:64262191~theSitePK:1058433,00.html|title=Jobs&amp;nbsp;— Compensation &amp; Benefits|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-sexual same-sex marriage ===
Several traditional societies in Africa have traditionally allowed non-sexual marriage between two women.  These arrangements usually involve one woman taking the role of a man and marrying another woman to secure her inheritance, and are not seen as homosexual.

====Kenya====
{{main|LGBT rights in Kenya}}
Female same-sex marriage is practiced among the [[Gikuyu people|Gikuyu]], [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Kamba people|Kamba]], [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], and to a lesser extent neighboring peoples.  Approximately 5–10% of women are in such marriages.  However, this is not seen as homosexual, but is instead a way for families without sons to keep their inheritance within the family.&lt;ref&gt;''Gender and Language in Sub-Saharan Africa,'' 2013:35&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws criminalizing homosexuality are generally specific to men, though in 2010 the prime minister called for women to be arrested as well.

====Nigeria====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Nigeria}}
In Nigeria, homosexual activity between men, but not between women, is illegal.  In 2006, Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] introduced legislation that prohibits same-sex marriages and criminalizes anyone who "performs, witnesses, aids or abets" such ceremonies.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleshman|first=Michael|title=African gays and lesbians combat bias: An 'invisible' minority seeks legal safeguards, acceptance|url=http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Igbo people]] and probably other peoples in the south of the country, there are circumstances where a marriage between women is considered appropriate, such as when a woman has no child and her husband dies, and she takes a wife to perpetuate her inheritance and family lineage.&lt;ref name=NigeriaTribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100111010506/http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archivedate=11 January 2010|title=Tradition of same gender marriage in Igboland|first=Leo|last=Igwe|work=Nigerian Tribune|date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil union, [[civil partnership]], [[domestic partnership]], [[registered partnership]], unregistered partnership, and unregistered cohabitation statuses offer varying legal benefits of marriage and are available to same-sex couples in: Andorra, Australia, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="countries and states legal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearson|first=Mary|title=Where is Gay Marriage Legal?|url=http://christiangays.com/marriage/legal.shtml|publisher=christiangays.com|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Steve|title=Which Countries Have Legalized Gay Marriage?|url=http://www.care2.com/causes/which-countries-have-legalized-gay-marriage.html|publisher=Care2.com (news.bbc.co.uk as source)|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Parenting===
{{Main|LGBT parenting|Same-sex marriage and the family}}
Scientific literature indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union (either a mixed-sex or same-sex union). As a result, professional scientific associations have argued for same-sex marriage to be legally recognized as it will be beneficial to the children of same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="amici" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpa2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pediatrics /&gt;&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb, Ph.D.|first=Michael|title=Expert Affidavit for U.S. District Court (D.

{{main|LGBT adoption}}
Most same-sex-marriage states allow the joint [[adoption]] of children by same-sex couples.  (Portugal is a long-standing exception.)  In addition, several states which do not have marriage equality nonetheless permit joint adoption by unmarried same-sex couples: The United Kingdom, Western Australia, New South Wales, and Tasmania within Australia, Coahuilla and Chihuahua in Mexico, a number of US states (Colorado, Indiana, Nevada, Oregon), and in at least a few cases, Israel.  Several additional states allow second-parent ('step-child' or 'step-parent') adoption by unmarried same-sex couples.

====Surrogacy and IVF treatment====
{{main|Assisted reproductive technology}}
A gay or bisexual man has the option of [[surrogacy]], the process in which a woman bears a child for another person through [[artificial insemination]] or carries another woman's surgically implanted [[fertilized egg]] to birth. A lesbian or bisexual woman has the option of artificial insemination.&lt;ref&gt;The Fertility Sourcebook, Third Edition&amp;nbsp;– Page 245, M.

===Transgender and intersex persons===
{{See also|Transsexualism|Legal aspects of transsexualism|Gender identity}}
When sex is defined legally, it may be defined by any one of several criteria: the [[XY sex-determination system]], the type of [[gonad]]s, the type of external sexual features, or the person's social identification. Consequently, both [[transsexual]]s and [[intersex]]ed individuals may be legally categorized into confusing gray areas, and could be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions. This could result in long-term marriages, as well as recent same-sex marriages, being overturned.

The problems of defining gender by the existence/non-existence of gonads or certain sexual features is complicated by the existence of [[Gender Reassignment Surgery|surgical methods]] to alter these features. Estimates&lt;ref&gt;(Fausto-Sterling ''et al.'', 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; run as high as 1 percent of live [[childbirth|births]] exhibiting some degree of sexual ambiguity, and between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births being ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including sometimes involuntary surgery to address their sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency|title=How common is intersex?|publisher=Intersex Society of North America|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transsexual to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. "Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality." ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' 38.5 (October 2009): 688–701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the UK marriages are for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her marriage or civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate. Such persons are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual persons to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage|publisher=365gay.com|date=5 July 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|archivedate=17 October 2007|accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quebec prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried persons could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. A similar provision including sterilization also existed in Sweden, but was phased out in 2013.

In the United States, transsexual and intersexual marriages typically run into similar complications. As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19brfs-USDEFENDSMAR_BRF.html|title=U.S. Defends Marriage Law|work=The New York Times|date=18 September 2009|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
{{See also|LGBT rights opposition}}
While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the [[history of same-sex unions|historical and anthropological record]] reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, through full acceptance and integration, sympathetic toleration, indifference, prohibition and discrimination, to persecution and physical annihilation. Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that recognition of same-sex marriages would erode religious freedoms,&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston&gt;{{cite news|url= http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/191kgwgh.asp|title=Banned in Boston|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]|date=5 May 2006|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising, undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-blankenhorn19-2008sep19,0,6057126.story|title=Protecting marriage to protect children|last=Blankenhorn|first=David|date=19 September 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships,&lt;ref name="findlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements/|title=See discussion of prenuptial and postmarital agreements at Findlaw|publisher=Family.findlaw.com|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="indegayforum1"&gt;Dale Carpenter is a prominent spokesman for this view. For a better understanding of this view, see Carpenter's writings at http://www.indegayforum.org/staff/show/91.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate regarding same-sex marriages includes debate based upon social viewpoints as well as debate based on majority rules, religious convictions, economic arguments, health-related concerns, and a variety of other issues.

Anthropologists have struggled to determine a definition of marriage that absorbs commonalities of the social construct across cultures around the world.&lt;ref name=Fedorak&gt;{{cite book|last=Fedorak|first=Shirley A.|title=Anthropology matters!|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=[Toronto], Ont.|isbn=1442601086|pages=Ch. 11; p. 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gough&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gough|first=Kathleen E.|title=The Nayars and the Definition of Marriage|journal=The Journal of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]]|year=1959|month=Jan.&amp;nbsp;– Jun.|volume=89|issue=1|pages=23–34|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2844434|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many proposed definitions have been criticized for failing to recognize the existence of same-sex marriage in some cultures, including in more than 30 [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African cultures]], such as the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]].&lt;ref name=Gough /&gt;&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stephen O.|title=Boy-wives and female husbands : studies of African homosexualities|year=2001|publisher=St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=0312238290|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjbESL6YWU0C&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;ots=WdlOOaKAAq&amp;dq=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;f=false|edition=1st pbk. ed.|coauthors=Roscoe, Will}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kikuyu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Njambi|first=Wairimu|coauthors=O'Brien, William|title=Revisiting "Woman-Woman Marriage": Notes on Gikuyu Women|journal=[[NWSA Journal]]|year=2001|month=Spring|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–23|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/nwsa_journal/v012/12.1njambi.html|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With several countries revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their definition of the word ''marriage'' to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dictionairies take lead in redefining modern marriage|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/24/20040524-103201-1169r/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=24 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite web|title=Webster Makes It Official: Definition of Marriage Has Changed|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/webster_makes_it_official_definition_of_marriage_has_changed/|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Redman|first=Daniel|title=Noah Webster Gives His Blessing: Dictionaries recognize same-sex marriage—who knew?|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2215628/|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)]]|date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Dershowitz]] and others have suggested reserving the word ''marriage'' for religious contexts as part of [[privatizing marriage]], and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of [[civil union]]s, in part to strengthen the [[separation between church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rossde.com/editorials/Dershowitz_marriage.html|title=Government Should Quit the Marriage Business|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Dershowitz, Alan M.|authorlink=Alan Dershowitz|date=3 December 2003|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Roback Morse]], the president of the anti-same-sex marriage group [[National Organization for Marriage]]'s Ruth Institute project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruthinstitute.org/pages/boardMembers.html|title=Board of Advisors|publisher=Ruth Institute|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the conflation of marriage with contractual agreements is a threat to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/morse200405200926.asp|title=''Not'' a Social Contract|work=[[National Review]]|author=Morse, Jennifer Roback|authorlink=Jennifer Roback Morse|date=20 May 2004|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of legal recognition of same-sex marriage, such as [[Freedom to Marry]] and [[Canadians for Equal Marriage]], use the terms ''marriage equality'' and ''equal marriage'' to indicate that they seek equal benefit of marriage laws as opposed to special rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/issues/marriageequality/|title=Marriage Equality|publisher=Garden State Equality|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/marriage-101#faq3|title=Marriage 101|publisher=[[Freedom to Marry]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of same-sex marriage such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] use the term ''traditional marriage'' to mean marriages between one man and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Divine Institution of Marriage|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/the-divine-institution-of-marriage|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bishops discuss religious liberty, marriage, finances at annual meeting|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1104473.htm|work=Catholic New Service|location=Baltimore|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=23282 |work=Baptist Press|title=Marriage Protection Sunday: Churches encouraged to address 'gay marriage'|date=19 May 2006|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-same-sex-marriage activist [[Maggie Gallagher]] argues that equating same-sex and mixed-sex marriages changes the meaning of marriage and its traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Maggie.

Some publications that oppose same-sex marriage, such as ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' and [[Baptist Press]], have an editorial style policy of placing the word ''marriage'' in [[scare quotes]] ("marriage") when it is used in reference to same-sex couples.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In the United States, the mainstream press has generally abandoned this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/02/25/washington-times-scare-quotes-are-history/|title=Washington Times Scare Quotes Are History|work=Washington City Paper|author= Wemple, Erik|date=25 February 2008|accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cliff Kincaid of the conservative [[Accuracy in Media]] argues for use of quotation marks on the grounds that marriage is a legal status denied same-sex couples by most state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/honest-versus-slanted-journalism/|title=Honest Versus Slanted Journalism|work=[[Accuracy In Media]]|author=Kincaid, Cliff|date=26 February 2004|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage supporters argue that the use of scare quotes is an editorialization that implies illegitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/b/2004/05/21/washington-times-dismisses-gay-marriages.htm|title=Washington Times Dismisses Gay "Marriages"|publisher=About.com|author=Cline, Austin|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AP Stylebook|Associated Press style]] recommends the usages ''marriage for gays and lesbians'' or in space-limited headlines ''gay marriage'' with no hyphen and no scare quotes. The Associated Press warns that the construct ''gay marriage'' can imply that marriages of same-sex couples are somehow legally different from those of mixed-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Robyn|title=When I Get Married, Will It Be a 'Gay Marriage'?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robyn-harper/marriage-equality_b_1572611.html|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Robyn|title=My Marriage Won't Be a 'Gay Marriage'|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/my-marriage-wont-gay-marriage-11514384.html?cat=41|accessdate=28 September 2012|publisher=Yahoo!|date=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judicial and legislative====
{{Main|Conflict of marriage laws#Same-sex marriage}}
There are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A "[[direct democracy|majority rules]]" position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|title=Poll: Calif. gay marriage ban driven by religion|author=Leff, Lisa|agency=Associated Press|date=4 December 2008|work=USA Today}} archived here [http://www.webcitation.org/68OwEop7Y].&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a [[civil rights]] view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7723645.stm|title= Divisions persist over gay marriage ban|author=Mirchandani, Rajesh|publisher=BBC News|date=12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
