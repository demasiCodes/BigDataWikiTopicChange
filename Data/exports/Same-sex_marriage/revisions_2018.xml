'''Same-sex marriage''' (also known as '''gay marriage''') is the [[marriage]] of a same-sex couple, entered into in a civil or religious ceremony. The term '''marriage equality''' refers to a political status in which the marriages of same-sex couples and the marriages of opposite-sex couples are recognized as equal by the law.

Some proponents of legal recognition of same-sex marriage, such as [[Freedom to Marry]] and [[Canadians for Equal Marriage]], use the terms ''marriage equality'' and ''equal marriage'' to indicate that they seek the recognition of same-sex marriage on equal ground with opposite-sex marriage as opposed to special rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/issues/marriageequality/|title=Marriage Equality|publisher=Garden State Equality|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/marriage-101#faq3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216021129/http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/marriage-101#faq3|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 February 2010|title=Marriage 101|publisher=[[Freedom to Marry]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:AENN&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=13F21B414EDA8168&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46|title=Albany area real estate and the Marriage Equality Act|date=29 May 2012|work=Albany Examiner|accessdate=25 December 2012|author=Pratt, Patricia|quote=On July 24, 2011 the Marriage Equality Act became a law in New York State forever changing the state's legal view of what a married couple is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote on Illinois marriage equality bill coming in January: sponsors|url=http://chicagophoenix.com/2012/12/13/illinois-marriage-equality-vote-january|accessdate=23 December 2012|newspaper=Chicago Phoenix|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission endorses marriage and adoption equality|url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/human-rights-environment/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity/commission-endorses-marriage-and-adoption-equality|publisher=Human Right Commission New Zealand|accessdate=23 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202132031/http://www.hrc.co.nz/human-rights-environment/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity/commission-endorses-marriage-and-adoption-equality|archivedate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulholland|first=Helene|title=Ed Miliband calls for gay marriage equality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/27/ed-miliband-gay-wedding-equality|accessdate=23 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London, UK|date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ring"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2012/12/20/newt-gingrich-accepts-marriage-equality-inevitable|title=Newt Gingrich: Marriage Equality Inevitable, OK|author=Ring, Trudy|work=The Advocate|location=Los Angeles|date=20 December 2012|quote=He [Newt Gingrich] noted to HuffPo that he not only has a lesbian half-sister, LGBT rights activist Candace Gingrich, but has gay friends who've gotten married in Iowa, where their unions are legal.

The [[AP Stylebook]] recommends the usage of the phrase ''marriage for gays and lesbians'' or the term ''gay marriage'' in space-limited headlines. The [[Associated Press]] warns that the construct ''gay marriage'' can imply that the marriages of same-sex couples are somehow different from the marriages of opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Robyn|title=When I Get Married, Will It Be a 'Gay Marriage'?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robyn-harper/marriage-equality_b_1572611.html|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper |first=Robyn |title=My Marriage Won't Be a 'Gay Marriage' |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/my-marriage-wont-gay-marriage-11514384.html?cat=41|accessdate=28 September 2012|publisher=Yahoo!|date=30 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928202736/http://voices.yahoo.com/my-marriage-wont-gay-marriage-11514384.html?cat=41|archivedate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of the term ''marriage''===
Anthropologists have struggled to determine a definition of marriage that absorbs commonalities of the [[social construct]] across cultures around the world.&lt;ref name=Fedorak&gt;{{cite book|last=Fedorak|first=Shirley A.|title=Anthropology matters!|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=[Toronto], Ont.|isbn=978-1442601086|pages=Ch. 11; p. 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gough&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gough|first=Kathleen E.|title=The Nayars and the Definition of Marriage|journal=The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|date=Jan–Jun 1959 |volume=89|issue=1|pages=23–34|doi=10.2307/2844434|jstor=2844434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many proposed definitions have been criticized for failing to recognize the existence of same-sex marriage in some cultures, including in more than 30 [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African cultures]], such as the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]].&lt;ref name=Gough/&gt;&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stephen O.|title=Boy-wives and female husbands : studies of African homosexualities|year=2001|publisher=St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=978-0312238292|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZjbESL6YWU0C&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;dq=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;f=false|edition=1st pbk.|author2=Roscoe, Will}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kikuyu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Njambi|first=Wairimu|author2=O'Brien, William|title=Revisiting "Woman-Woman Marriage": Notes on Gikuyu Women|journal=[[NWSA Journal]]|date=Spring 2001|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–23|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/nwsa_journal/v012/12.1njambi.html|accessdate=28 September 2012|doi=10.1353/nwsa.2000.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With several countries revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their definition of the word marriage to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dictionaries take lead in redefining modern marriage|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/24/20040524-103201-1169r|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=24 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite web|title=Webster Makes It Official: Definition of Marriage Has Changed|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/webster_makes_it_official_definition_of_marriage_has_changed|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Redman|first=Daniel|title=Noah Webster Gives His Blessing: Dictionaries recognize same-sex marriage—who knew?|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2215628|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to same-sex marriage is based, in part, on the beliefs that homosexuality is unnatural and abnormal, that the recognition of same-sex unions will promote homosexuality in society, and that children are better off when raised by opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref name="thoughtco"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thoughtco.com/moral-and-religious-arguments-250095 | title=Common Arguments Against Gay Marriage | date=16 July 2017 | accessdate=26 September 2017 | author=Cline, Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims are refuted by science, which shows that homosexuality is a natural and normal human sexuality, that sexual orientation cannot be chosen, and that the children of same-sex couples fare just as well or even better than the children of opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref name="Pediatrics.aappublications.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/118/1/349.full|title=The Effects of Marriage, Civil Union, and Domestic Partnership Laws on the Health and Well-being of Children|publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]]|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2005_SameSexMarriage.pdf|title=Position Statement on Support of Legal Recognition of Same-Sex Civil Marriage|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|date=|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/Statement-on-Marriage-and-the-family.cfm?renderforprint=1|title=Statement on Marriage and the Family|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|date=|accessdate=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Advocacy%20and%20Newsroom/Position%20Statements/ps2002_Adoption.pdf|title=Position Statement on Adoption and Co-parenting of Children by Same-sex Couples |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|year=2002|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite news|first=Annie|last=Davis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/23/children-raised-by-same-sex-parents-do-as-well-as-their-peers-study-shows|title=Children raised by same-sex parents do as well as their peers, study shows|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=October 22, 2017|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Lindsey|last=Bever|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/07/children-of-same-sex-couples-are-happier-and-healthier-than-peers-research-shows|title=Children of same-sex couples are happier and healthier than peers, research shows|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=July 7, 2014|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the opponents of same-sex marriage are religious groups including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], all of which desire for marriage to remain restricted to opposite-sex marriages.&lt;ref name="lds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sbc"/&gt;

===Child suicide===
The establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation. A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9–12 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9–12 declined by 14% in states which established same-sex marriage, resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among children in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage. The lead researcher of the study observed that "laws that have the greatest impact on gay adults may make gay kids feel more hopeful for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Difference-in-Differences Analysis of the Association Between State Same-Sex Marriage Policies and Adolescent Suicide Attempts|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2604258|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|volume=171|issue=4|pages=350–356|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.4529|pmid=28241285|pmc=5848493|year=2017|last1=Raifman|first1=Julia|last2=Moscoe|first2=Ellen|last3=Austin|first3=S.

===Parenting===
Professional organizations of psychologists have concluded that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents' relationship is recognized and supported by society's institutions, e.g. civil marriage. For example, the [[Canadian Psychological Association]] stated in 2006 that "parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union."&lt;ref name=cpa2006&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20(1).pdf|title=Marriage of Same-Sex Couples – 2006 Position Statement Canadian Psychological Association|year=2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419195945/http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20%281%29.pdf|archivedate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPA has stated that the stress encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent.&lt;ref name=cpa2006&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20(1).pdf|title=Marriage of Same-Sex Couples – 2006 Position Statement Canadian Psychological Association|year=2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419195945/http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20%281%29.pdf|archivedate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded in 2006, in an analysis published in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'':
{{quote|author=The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]|text=''There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. Conscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, can be excellent parents. The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.''&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;}}

In 2010, a [[Columbia University]] [[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health|Mailman School of Public Health]] study examining the effects of institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of [[anxiety disorders]], among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author, the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasin|first=Deborah|title=Lesbian, gay, bisexual individuals risk psychiatric disorders from discriminatory policies|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/cums-lgb030210.php|publisher=[[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health]]|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite news|title=New study suggests bans on gay marriage hurt mental health of LGB people|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-sexual-continuum/201003/new-study-suggests-bans-gay-marriage-hurt-mental-health-lgb-people|accessdate=8 November 2010|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=22 March 2010|author= Brian Mustanski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and journalist [[Jonathan Rauch]] has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rauch|first=Jonathan|title=For Better or Worse?

New York, NY: Henry Holt and Company, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Herek, Gregory M.

The [[American Psychological Association]] stated in 2004: "Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status and so on." It has also averred that same-sex couples who may only enter into a civil union, as opposed to a marriage, "are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to those of married couples," which has adverse effects on the well-being of same-sex partners.&lt;ref name="psychological"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf|title=Resolution on Sexual Orientation and Marriage|year=2004|author=[[American Psychological Association]]|accessdate=10 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511190536/http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous polls and studies on the issue have been conducted, including those that were completed throughout the first decade of the 21st century. A consistent trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage has been revealed across the world, often driven in large part by a significant generational gap in support. Polling that that been conducted in developed democracies in the first decade of the 21st century shows a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage. Support for legal same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.&lt;ref name=Gallup2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Newport|first=Frank|title=For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/First-Time-Majority-Americans-Favor-Legal-Gay-Marriage.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Opinion: Nationally|url=http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303043929/http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 March 2011|publisher=australianmarriageequality.com|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Life in Estonia|url=http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia|publisher=globalgayz.com |accessdate=25 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716100828/http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia|archivedate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jowit|first=Juliette|title=Gay marriage gets ministerial approval|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/12/gay-marriage-receive-ministerial-approval|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 June 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Irish people support gay marriage, poll says|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/24/most-irish-people-support-gay-marriage-poll-says|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=PinkNews|date=24 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926032112/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/24/most-irish-people-support-gay-marriage-poll-says|archivedate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], continual polling by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] over the course of more than two decades has shown that support for same-sex marriage has grown rapidly, while opposition has simultaneously collapsed.

===Ancient===
A reference to same-sex marriage (by the Egyptians and Canaanites) exists in the [[Talmud]]. The [[Book of Leviticus]] prohibited homosexual relations (Lev. 18:22, 20:13), and the Jewish sages provide the reason for this as being that the Hebrews were warned not to "follow the acts of the land of Egypt or the acts of the land of Canaan." The sages explicitly state: "what did [the Egyptians and Canaanites] do? A man would marry a man and a woman [marry] a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Joel Roth.

It should be noted, however, that ''conubium'' existed only between a ''civis Romanus'' and a ''civis Romana'' (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citizen), so that a marriage between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases).&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, ''The Roman Law of Marriage'' (Oxford, 1969), pp. 24–28; Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), pp. 43–49.; "Marriages where the partners had ''conubium'' were marriages valid in Roman law (''iusta matrimonia'')" [Treggiari, p. 49]. Compare Ulpian (''Tituli Ulpiani'') 5.3–5: "''Conubium'' is the capacity to marry a wife in Roman law. Roman citizens have ''conubium'' with Roman citizens, but with Latins and foreigners only if the privilege was granted. There is no ''conubium'' with slaves"; compare also Gaius (''Institutionum'' 1:55–56, 67, 76–80).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Susan Treggiari, "''matrimonium'' was then an institution involving a mother, ''mater''. The idea implicit in the word is that a man took a woman in marriage, ''in matrimonium ducere'', so that he might have children by her."&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 342 AD, Christian emperors [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]] issued a law in the [[Theodosian Code]] (''C. Th.'' 9.7.3) prohibiting [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|same-sex marriage in Rome]] and ordering execution for those so married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuefler|first=Mathew|year=2007|title=The Marriage Revolution in Late Antiquity: The Theodosian Code and Later Roman Marriage Law|journal=Journal of Family History|volume=32|pages=343–370|url=http://jfh.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/32/4/343|doi=10.1177/0363199007304424|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
Historians variously trace the beginning of the modern movement in support of same-sex marriage to anywhere from around the 1970s to the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Same-Sex Marriage Came to Be|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/03/how-same-sex-marriage-came-to-be|website=[[Harvard Magazine]]|date=March–April 2013|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The secret history of same-sex marriage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/23/-sp-secret-history-same-sex-marriage|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Denmark became the first country to recognize a legal relationship for same-sex couples, establishing [[registered partnership]]s, which gave those in same-sex relationships "most rights of married heterosexuals, but not the right to adopt or obtain joint custody of a child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rule|first=Sheila|title=Rights for Gay Couples in Denmark|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/02/world/rights-for-gay-couples-in-denmark.html|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]]{{efn|name=netherlands}} became the first country to establish same-sex marriage by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/05/26/f-same-sex-timeline.html|title=Same-sex marriage around the world|work=CBC News|location=Toronto|date=26 May 2009|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then same-sex marriage has been established by law in [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003), [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] (2012), [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|New Zealand]]{{efn|name=nz}} (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] (2015), the [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|United States]]{{efn|name=usa}} (2015), [[Same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (2015), [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]] (2016), [[Same-sex marriage in Finland|Finland]] (2017), [[Same-sex marriage in Malta|Malta]] (2017), [[Same-sex marriage in Germany|Germany]] (2017) and [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|Australia]] (2017).

In December 2017, the [[Constitutional Court of Austria]] ruled that the right of same-sex couples to marry is guaranteed by the [[Constitution of Austria]] and that the [[Parliament of Austria]] has a grace period of one year to amend the marriage law to align with the Constitution after which same-sex marriage will automatically become established by law in [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/austria-same-sex-gay-marriage-legal-constitutional-court-lgbt-rights-start-date-couples-a8092516.html Austria court legalises same-sex marriage from start of 2019, ruling all existing laws discriminatory],; ''The Independent'', 5 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica]] ruled that the right of same-sex couples to marry is guaranteed by the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], in line with a January 2018 ruling by the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], and that the [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica]] has a grace period of eighteen months to amend the marriage law to align with the Convention after which same-sex marriage will automatically become established by law in [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref name="chinch"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chinchilla |first1=Sofía |title=Sala IV da 18 meses para que entre en vigencia el matrimonio homosexual |url=https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/politica/sala-iv-da-18-meses-para-que-entre-en-vigencia-el/CZK6BUA5GRFSRJMN7H6H25BLNY/story/ |accessdate=9 August 2018 |agency=La Nación |date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Judge Sir [[Nicolas Bratza]], then head of the European Court of Human Rights, delivered a speech in 2012 that signaled the court was ready to declare same-sex marriage a "human right", as soon as enough countries fell into line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriage: the French connection|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/9859036/Gay-marriage-the-French-connection.html|accessdate=8 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=9 February 2013|author=Christopher Booker|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay marriage politically, rather than ethically motivated|url=http://www.sosogay.co.uk/2013/gay-marriage-politically-rather-than-ethically-motivated|website=So So Gay|publisher=So So Gay Ltd|accessdate=8 November 2013|author=Jamie Clarke|date=6 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006084549/http://sosogay.co.uk/2013/gay-marriage-politically-rather-than-ethically-motivated|archivedate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Nicholas Bratza|url=http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=ODYzMQ==|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131108001904/http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=ODYzMQ==|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 November 2013|website=Press Complaints Commission|publisher=Press Complaints Commission|accessdate=8 November 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] states that: "Men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Convention on Human Rights|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf|website=ECHR.coe.int|publisher=European Court of Human Rights|accessdate=25 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703060501/http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf|archivedate=3 July 2014|format=PDF|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; not limiting marriage to those in a heterosexual relationship. However, the ECHR stated in ''Schalk and Kopf v Austria'' that this provision was intended to limit marriage to heterosexual relationships, as it used the term "men and women" instead of "everyone".&lt;ref name="CASE OF SCHALK AND KOPF v.

=====European Union=====
On 12 March 2015, the [[European Parliament]] passed a non-binding resolution encouraging EU institutions and member states to "[reflect] on the recognition of same-sex marriage or same-sex civil union as a political, social and human and civil rights issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/03/13/ukip-and-tories-abstain-on-eu-motion-to-recognise-same-sex-marriage/|title=UKIP and Tories abstain on EU motion to recognise same-sex marriage|website=PinkNews|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P8-TA-2015-0076+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN|title=Texts adopted - Thursday, 12 March 2015 - Annual report on human rights and democracy in the world 2013 and the EU policy on the matter  - P8_TA-PROV(2015)0076|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-annual-report-on-human-rights-and-democracy-in-the-world-2013-and-the-eu-policy-on-the-matter-motion-8.html|title=Annual report on human rights and democracy in the world 2013 and the EU policy on the matter|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2018, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled, in a case from [[Same-sex marriage in Romania|Romania]], that, under the specific conditions of the couple in question, married same-sex couples have the same residency rights as other married couples in an EU country, even if that country does not permit or recognize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apnews.com/561b1bb4ecff48b598eb1c2c20db2735 EU court backs residency rights for gay couple in Romania – AP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44366898 Same-sex spouses have EU residence rights, top court rules – BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Inter-American Court of Human Rights=====
After a motion lodged by Costa Rica, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] issued a landmark advisory ruling in favour of same-sex marriage on 9 January 2018, which is expected to facilitate legalisation in several countries in the Americas.{{efn|name=IACHR}}

The Court said that governments "must recognise and guarantee all the rights that are derived from a family bond between people of the same sex". They also said that it was inadmissible and discriminatory for a separate legal provision to be established (such as [[civil union]]s) instead of same-sex marriage. The Court demanded that governments "guarantee access to all existing forms of domestic legal systems, including the right to marriage, in order to ensure the protection of all the rights of families formed by same-sex couples without discrimination". Recognising the difficulty in passing such laws in countries where there is strong opposition to same-sex marriage, it recommended that governments pass temporary decrees until new legislation is brought in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfbaytimes.com/major-advance-marriage-equality-gender-identity-rights-latin-america/ |title="Major Advance for Marriage Equality and Gender Identity Rights in Latin America". ''San Francisco Bay Times'', 2018 January 29 |publisher=Sfbaytimes.com |date= 2018-01-25|accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court issued its ruling in response to a motion brought by Costa Rica in 2016. The Costa Rican Government asked the Court to give its opinion on whether it had an obligation to extend property rights to same-sex couples, and the Court ruled that it did. The Costa Rican Government also wanted to know whether it should allow transgender people to change their name and gender on their identity documents. Again, the Court ruled that it must.

The governments of Costa Rica and Panama have announced that they will fully implement the IACHR ruling.&lt;ref name="panama"/&gt;&lt;ref name="panama1"/&gt; Additionally, on 11 January, the president of the [[Supreme Court of Peru]] and chairman of the country's [[Judiciary of Peru|judiciary]], Duberlí Rodríguez, stated that Peru should abide by the decision.&lt;ref name="peru"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180112/434230085521/judicatura-peru-debe-respetar-decision-corteidh-sobre-matrimonio-homosexual.html Perú debe respetar decisión CorteIDH sobre matrimonio homosexual] lavanguardia&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 January 2018, Housing Minister Carlos Bruce estimated that same-sex marriage will be allowed in Peru within two years, and several former Supreme Court judges and lawmakers, notably Indira Huilca, stated that same-sex marriage will soon be legal in Peru, regardless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ojo.pe/actualidad/carlos-bruce-matrimonio-gay-pronto-peru-251881/|title=Carlos Bruce hace anuncio: "Matrimonio gay se dará pronto en Perú"|website=ojo.pe|date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://rpp.pe/politica/actualidad/huilca-matrimonio-entre-personas-del-mismo-sexo-debe-implementarse-en-el-peru-noticia-1104560 Huilca: "Matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo debe implementarse en el Perú"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Peruvian Government, however, has yet to issue a formal decision on the matter.

On 29 June 2018, two family judges in [[Cuenca, Ecuador]] ruled that the Civil Registry must issue same-sex marriage licenses on request, stating that the decision of the IACHR trumped the [[Constitution of Ecuador|Ecuadorian Constitution]]'s definition of marriage. The Registry has appealed, but the Constitutional Court has indicated that it is likely to rule in favor of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="ecuador"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.advocate.com/marriage-equality/2018/7/05/ecuadorian-court-rules-marriage-equality|title=Ecuadorian Court Rules for Marriage Equality|date=2018-07-05|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [https://www.ecuavisa.com/articulo/noticias/actualidad/403051-union-gay-seria-reconocida-corte-constitucional Unión gay sería reconocida por Corte Constitucional]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 2018, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica|Costa Rican Supreme Court]] delcared Costa Rica's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional, and gave the [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica|Legislative Assembly]] 18 months to reform the law accordingly, otherwise the ban would be abolished automatically. This was in line with the IACHR ruling.&lt;ref name="chinch"/&gt;

Besides Ecuador and Costa Rica, lawsuits regarding same-sex marriage have been filed in El Salvador (halting a proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage),&lt;ref name="el salvador"/&gt; Honduras,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wockner.blogspot.com/2018/06/worldwide-marriage-equality-watch-list.html?m=1 Worldwide Marriage Equality Watch List]&lt;/ref&gt; Panama,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/02/16/panama-supreme-court-judge-withdraws-draft-ruling-marriage/ Panama Supreme Court judge withdraws draft ruling against marriage]&lt;/ref&gt; Paraguay (to recognize marriages performed abroad),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hoy.com.py/nacionales/lgtbi-anuncia-presin-a-corte-para-aceptar-unin-igualitaria-y-habr-guerra|title=LGTBI anuncia presión a Corte para aceptar unión igualitaria y habrá ‘guerra’|publisher=Hoy (Paraguay)|date=12 January 2018|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peru,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpp.pe/lima/actualidad/tribunal-constitucional-debate-reconocimiento-de-matrimonio-gay-noticia-1130829 Tribunal Constitucional debate reconocimiento de matrimonio gay realizado en México]&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are under the jurisdiction of the IACHR.

====Argentina====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Argentina}}
[[File:Crowd in support of Gay Marriage 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Crowd in support of same-sex marriage in [[Buenos Aires]]]]
On 15 July 2010, the [[Argentine Senate]] approved a bill extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. It was supported by the government of [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] and opposed by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrionuevo|first=Alexei|title=Argentina Approves Gay Marriage, in a First for Region|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/16/world/americas/16argentina.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=9 February 2012|date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls showed that nearly 70% of Argentines supported giving gay people the same marital rights as heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/world/americas/14argentina.html|work=The New York Times|title=Argentina Senate to Vote on Gay Marriage|first=Alexei|last=Barrionuevo|date=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law came into effect on 22 July 2010 upon promulgation by the Argentine President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/07/22/cristina-kirchner-signs-bill-legalizing-same-sex-couples-marriage|title=Cristina Kirchner signs bill legalizing same-sex couples' marriage|website=mercopress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina thus became the first country in [[Latin America]], the second in the [[Americas]], and the tenth in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.

====Australia====

Australia became the second nation in [[Oceania]] to legalise same-sex marriage when the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] passed a bill on 7 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-07/same-sex-marriage-bill-passes-house-of-representatives/9235560|title=Same-sex marriage bill passes House of Representatives, paving way for first gay weddings|website=ABC News|date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill received [[royal assent]] on 8 December, and took effect on 9 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-08/same-sex-marriage-legal-after-gg-approval/9239334|title=Same-sex marriage signed into law by Governor-General, first weddings to happen from January 9|website=ABC News|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ausleg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017A00129|title=Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017|date=9 December 2017|website=Federal Register of Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law removed the ban on same-sex marriage which previously existed and followed a [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey|voluntary postal survey]] held from 12 September to 7 November 2017, which returned a 61.6% ''Yes'' vote for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/15/australia-says-yes-to-same-sex-marriage-in-historic-postal-survey|title=Australia says yes to same-sex marriage in historic postal survey|date=15 November 2017|journal=The Guardian|last1=Karp|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same legislation also legalised same-sex marriage in all of Australia's [[States and territories of Australia|external territories]].&lt;ref name=Ausleg/&gt;

====Austria====

Since 1 January 2010, same-sex couples have been allowed to enter registered partnerships (''Eingetragene Partnerschaft'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/austrian-embassy-london/service-for-citizens/civil-status-family/registered-civil-partnerships/|title=Registered (civil) partnerships – Österreichische Botschaft London|first=Außenministerium der Republik|last=Österreich|website=www.bmeia.gv.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2013, the [[The Greens – The Green Alternative|Greens]] introduced a bill in the [[National Council (Austria)|Austrian Parliament]] that would legalise same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thinkoutsideyourbox.net/?p=33177|title=Nationalrat: Grüne bringen Antrag zur Ehe-Öffnung für Lesben und Schwule ein|publisher=Thinkoutsideyourbox.net|date=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sent to the Judiciary Committee on 17 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXV/A/A_00049/index.shtml Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, Änderung]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was supposed to be debated in Autumn 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.ggg.at/index.php?id=62&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=6230&amp;cHash=3d81365a9088534c41b5d7ef6d9b02d5 Abstimmung über Ehe-Öffnung ohne Klubzwang?]&lt;/ref&gt; but was delayed by the ruling coalition.

In December 2015, the Vienna Administrative Court dismissed a case challenging the same-sex marriage ban. The plaintiffs appealed to the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20160323/families-fight-austrias-gay-marriage-ban|title=Families fight Austria's gay marriage ban|date=23 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 2017, the [[Constitutional Court (Austria)|Constitutional Court]] agreed to consider one of the cases challenging the law barring same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ggg.at/2017/10/17/verfassungsgerichtshof-koennte-noch-heuer-die-ehe-in-oesterreich-oeffnen/ |title=Verfassungsgerichtshof könnte die Ehe in Österreich noch dieses Jahr öffnen |publisher=Ggg.at |date=2017-10-17 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/2000066167782/Verfassungsgericht-prueft-Eheoeffnung-fuer-Homosexuelle |title=Verfassungsgericht prüft Öffnung der Ehe für Homosexuelle |publisher=Derstandard.at |date= |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kurier.at/politik/inland/vfgh-prueft-eheoeffnung-fuer-gleichgeschlechtliche-paare-in-oesterreich/292.567.898 |title=VfGH prüft Eheöffnung für gleichgeschlechtliche Paare in Österreich |publisher=Kurier.at |date=2017-10-17 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2017, the Court struck down the ban on same-sex marriage as [[unconstitutional]].

====Brazil====

{{Same-sex marriage map South America|align=left}}
[[Supreme Federal Court|Brazil's Supreme Court]] ruled in May 2011 that same-sex couples are legally entitled to legal recognition of cohabitation (known as {{lang|pt|união estável}}, one of the two possible family entities in Brazilian legislation. It included almost all of the rights available to married couples in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazil's supreme court recognizes gay partnerships|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/06/us-brazil-gayrights-idUSTRE74503V20110506|accessdate=16 February 2012|agency=Reuters|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between mid-2011 and May 2013, same-sex couples had their cohabitation issues converted into marriages in several Brazil states with the approval of a state judge. All legal Brazilian marriages were always recognized all over Brazil.&lt;ref name="WPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/brazil-judge-approves-what-appears-to-be-countrys-first-gay-marriage-between-2-men/2011/06/27/AGYN2znH_story.html|title=Brazilian judge gives male couple approval for what court says is country's first gay marriage|date=27 June 2011|work=The Washington Post|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zsXujTvb?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/brazil-judge-approves-what-appears-to-be-countrys-first-gay-marriage-between-2-men/2011/06/27/AGYN2znH_story.html|archivedate=2 July 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, the Court of Bahia equalized marriage in the state of [[Bahia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5.tjba.jus.br/corregedoria/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=420:uniaohomoafetiva&amp;catid=31:noticias&amp;Itemid=142 |title=Provimento Conjunto trata de união homoafetiva |website=Tribunal de Justiça do Estado da Bahia (official web site of the state supreme court) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927065759/http://www5.tjba.jus.br/corregedoria/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=420%3Auniaohomoafetiva&amp;catid=31%3Anoticias&amp;Itemid=142|archivedate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brasil247.com/pt/247/bahia247/86361/Bahia-já-pode-oficializar-casamento-homoafetivo.htm|language=Portuguese|date=27 November 2012|title=Bahia já pode oficializar casamento homoafetivo|work=brasil247.com|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] likewise had same-sex marriage legalized by court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norma do TJ obriga cartórios de SP a registrar casamento gay|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/1203680-norma-do-tj-obriga-cartorios-de-sp-a-registrar-casamento-gay.shtml|newspaper=Folha de S.

In Rio de Janeiro, the State Court facilitated its realization by district judges in agreement with the equalization (instead of ordering notaries to accept same-sex marriages in demand as all others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virgula.uol.com.br/ver/noticia/lifestyle/2013/04/20/324152-rio-de-janeiro-retira-impedimentos-a-casamento-entre-gays|title=Rio de Janeiro state legalizes gay marriage|date=17 April 2013|accessdate= 22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 2013, the Justice's [[National Justice Council|National Council of Brazil]] issued a ruling requiring all civil registers of the country to perform same-sex marriages by a 14–1 vote, thus legalizing same-sex marriage in the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/cidades,cnj-obriga-cartorios-a-celebrar-casamento-entre-homossexuais,1031678,0.htm |title=CNJ obriga cartórios a celebrar casamento entre homossexuais |publisher=Estadao.com.br |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2013/05/apos-uniao-estavel-gay-podera-casar-em-cartorio-decide-cnj.html|title=G1 - Decisão do CNJ obriga cartórios a fazer casamento homossexual - notícias em Política|website=Política|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jb.com.br/pais/noticias/2013/05/14/cnj-obriga-cartorios-a-converterem-uniao-estavel-gay-em-casamento/|title=Jornal do Brasil|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution came into effect on 16 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.cnj.jus.br/dje/jsp/dje/DownloadDeDiario.jsp?dj=DJ89_2013-ASSINADO.PDF&amp;statusDoDiario=ASSINADO DIÁRIO DA JUSTIÇA CONSELHO NACIONAL DE JUSTIÇA Edição nº 89/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2013/05/regra-que-obriga-cartorios-fazer-casamento-gay-vale-partir-do-dia-16.html Regra que obriga cartórios a fazer casamento gay vale a partir do dia 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, polls suggested that 47% of Brazilians supported marriage equalization and 57% supported adoption equalization for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portugues.christianpost.com/news/quase-metade-dos-internautas-brasileiros-aprova-o-casamento-gay-15398/ Almost half of Brazilian internet users support gay marriage], christianpost.com; accessed 5 July 2017. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the distinction between same-sex unions that are not termed marriages in relation to same-sex marriage is made, the difference in the numbers of approval and disapproval is still insignificant, below 1%; the most frequent reason for disapproval is a supposed 'unnaturalness' of same-sex relationships, followed by religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telelistas.net/blog/62-das-pessoas-nao-aprovam-o-casamento-gay-segundo-enquete/ 62% of people aren't approving of gay marriage, according to poll – Telelistas] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.gospelmais.com.br/pesquisa-maioria-brasileiros-contra-casamento-gay-55261.html A majority of Brazilians is against same-sex marriage and regards church as the most trustworthy institution, reveals research – Gospel+] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Canada}}
Legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Canada followed a series of constitutional challenges based on the [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|equality provisions]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. In the first such case, ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'', same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in [[Same-sex marriage in Ontario|Ontario]] on 14 January 2001 were subsequently validated when the [[common law]], mixed-sex definition of marriage was held to be unconstitutional. Similar rulings had legalized same-sex marriage in eight provinces and one territory when the ''2005 [[Civil Marriage Act]]'' defined marriage throughout Canada as "the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others."

====Colombia====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Colombia}}

In February 2007, a series of rulings by the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]] meant that same-sex couples could apply for all the rights that heterosexual couples have in ''de facto'' unions (''uniones de hecho'').&lt;ref name="2009 ruling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-029-2009.pdf|title=Decision C-029 of 2009|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-10938.html Colombian court confirms equal rights for same-sex couples], Pink News, 30 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2011, the Constitutional Court of Colombia ordered the Congress to pass the legislation giving same-sex couples similar rights to marriage by 20 June 2013. If such a law were not passed by then, same-sex couples would be granted these rights automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-577-2011.pdf|title=DECISION C-577/11 The homosexuals have the right to form a family|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/07/27/colombia.gay.marriage/|work=CNN| title=Colombian court says Congress must decide on gay marriage|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Senator [[Armando Benedetti]] introduced a bill legalizing same-sex marriage. It initially only allowed for civil unions, but he amended the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/articulo-382915-matrimonio-gay-empieza-ser-tramitado-senado "Matrimonio gay" empieza a ser tramitado en Senado]&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate's First Committee approved the bill on 4 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia-politics.com/gay-marriage-bill-passes-first-hurdle/|title=Gay marriage bill passes first hurdle - Colombia Politics|website=Colombia Politics|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.semana.com/nacion/primera-vez-comision-del-congreso-aprueba-matrimonio-gay/189204-3.aspx Por primera vez una comisión del Congreso aprueba el matrimonio gay]&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2013, the bill was defeated in the full Senate on a 51–17 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/24/uk-colombia-gaymarriage-idUKBRE93N1EJ20130424|publisher=Reuters |title=Colombia lawmakers reject controversial gay marriage bill | date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2013, a civil court judge in [[Bogotá]] declared a same-sex couple legally married, after a ruling on 11 July 2013 accepting the petition. This was the first same-sex couple married in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.caracol.com.co/judiciales/juez-aplica-norma-del-matrimonio-civil-a-pareja-gay-y-cita-a-contrayentes-con-dos-testigos/20131107/nota/1931472.aspx Juez aplica norma del matrimonio civil a pareja gay y cita a contrayentes con dos testigos].

In September 2013, two civil court judges married two same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Potts |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/judges-allow-first-same-sex-marriages-colombia011013 |title=Judges allow first same-sex marriages in Colombia |publisher=Gay Star News |date=2013-10-01 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first marriage was challenged by a conservative group, and it was initially annulled. Nevertheless, in October, a High Court (Tribunal Supremo de Bogotá) maintained the validity of that marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/tribunal-superior-de-bogota-rechaza-tutela-contra-matrimonio-gay_13142227-4 |title=Rechazan tutela que tumbaba primer matrimonio gay en el país |publisher=Eltiempo.Com |date=2013-10-24 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmi.com.co/?n=118476 |title=CM&amp; la noticia |publisher= |accessdate=26 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016144837/http://www.cmi.com.co/?n=118476 |archivedate=16 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2016, the Court ruled that marriage doesn't exclusively apply to opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/justicia/corte-aprueba-matrimonio-homosexual/16557410|title=Histórico: Colombia tiene matrimonio homosexual|website=El Tiempo|date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecitypaperbogota.com/news/colombia-says-yes-to-gay-marriage/10653|title=Colombia says 'I do' to gay marriage|date=7 April 2016|website=The City Paper Bogota}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/04/07/colombia-high-court-rules-in-favor-of-same-sex-marriage/|title=Colombia high court rules in favor of same-sex marriage|website=Washington Blade|date=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Colombia-Legalizes-Gay-Marriage-Huge-Victory-for-LGBTI-Rights-20160407-0041.html|title=Colombia Legalizes Gay Marriage, Huge Victory for LGBTI Rights|date=7 April 2016|website=TeleSur (English)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costa Rica====

On 19 March 2015, a bill to legalize same-sex marriage was introduced in the [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica]] by Deputy Ligia Elena Fallas Rodríguez of the [[Broad Front (Costa Rica)|Broad Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asamblea.go.cr/Centro_de_Informacion/Consultas_SIL/Pginas/Detalle%20Proyectos%20de%20Ley.aspx?Numero_Proyecto=19508 |title=Páginas - Detalle Proyectos de Ley |website=Asamblea.go.cr |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 2015, the organization Front for Equal Rights (''Frente Por los Derechos Igualitarios'') and a group of deputies presented another bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.cr/2015/12/10/proyecto-de-organizaciones-sociales-para-matrimonio-igualitario-ya-esta-en-la-asamblea-legislativa/ |title=Proyecto de organizaciones sociales para Matrimonio Igualitario ya está en la Asamblea Legislativa – Diario Digital Nuestro País |website=Elpais.cr |date=2015-12-10 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=www.diarioextra.com |url=http://www.diarioextra.com/Noticia/detalle/278377/12-diputados-respaldan-proyecto-de-ley-para-permitir-matrimonio-gay |title=12 Diputados respaldan proyecto de ley para permitir matrimonio gay |publisher=Diario Extra |date= |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/fdicr/docs/proyectoleymatrimonioigualitario_20 |title=Proyecto de Ley Matrimonio Igualitario by Frente por los Derechos Igualitarios |website=Issuu.com |date=2013-06-27 |accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 February 2016, the [[Supreme Court of Costa Rica|Constitutional Court of Costa Rica]] announced it would hear a case seeking to legalize same-sex marriage in Costa Rica and declare the country's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameliarueda.com/nota/sala-estudio-recursos-de-inconsticuionalidad-prohibicion-matrimonio-gay|title=Sala IV admite para estudio 2 recursos de inconstitucionalidad contra prohibición de matrimonio gay - AmeliaRueda.com|website=ameliarueda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] (IACHR) ruled that the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] mandates and requires the recognition of same-sex marriage. The ruling is fully binding on [[Same-sex marriage in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], who within hours agreed to adhere to it and fully implement it. Costa Rican Vice President [[Ana Helena Chacón Echeverría]] announced that the Government would implement the ruling "in its totality". Costa Rica's [[Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones de Costa Rica|Supreme Electoral Court]] (the institution in charge of [[civil registration]], including the issuance of [[marriage certificate]]s) announced that it will obey the ruling of the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights|IACHR]] and will adapt the necessary by-laws once the [[Executive Branch]] notifies the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cerdas|first1=Daniela|title=Registro Civil solo espera notificación del Ejecutivo para adecuar reglas al matrimonio gay|url=http://www.nacion.com/el-pais/gobierno/registro-civil-solo-espera-notificacion-del/2FTLNLISQRCBTEBAMQ6MXYBLQM/story/?rel=none|accessdate=13 January 2018|agency=La Nación}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official notification was done on 12 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://qcostarica.com/costa-ricas-foreign-ministry-initiates-notification-process-to-execute-court-order-on-gay-marriage/|title=Costa Rica’s Foreign Ministry Initiates Notification Process To Execute Court Order On Gay Marriage|publisher=[[Q Costa Rica]]|date=12 January 2018|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 January, a same-sex couple applied for a marriage certificate.

In the [[Costa Rican general election, 2018|2018 Costa Rican general election]], the IACHR ruling on same-sex marriage became a prominent issue. [[Carlos Alvarado Quesada]], who supports LGBT rights and favors the implementation of the ruling, won the election with 60.7% of the vote, defeating by wide margin [[Fabricio Alvarado]], a vocal opponent of LGBT rights who was against the implementation of the ruling. On 8 August 2018, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica|Supreme Court of Costa Rica]] ruled that the prohibition of same-sex marriage in the Family Code is unconstitutional, giving Congress 18 months to reform the law or the prohibition will be automatically lifted without legislation.&lt;ref name="chinch"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chinchilla |first1=Sofía |title=Sala IV da 18 meses para que entre en vigencia el matrimonio homosexual |url=https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/politica/sala-iv-da-18-meses-para-que-entre-en-vigencia-el/CZK6BUA5GRFSRJMN7H6H25BLNY/story/ |accessdate=9 August 2018 |agency=La Nación |date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Denmark}}
On 25 May 1989, Denmark wrote history as the first country to make it legal to be in a registered partnership with one of the same sex. A registered partnership was the same as a civil marriage, but was not seen as marriage in the eyes of the church. Axel and Eigil Axgil were the first ones to get married this way.&lt;ref name="Sabinsky_5/24/2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=SABINSKY | first=SONJA | title=Da Danmark skrev verdenshistorie | website=Jydske Vestkysten | date=May 24, 2014 | url=https://www.jv.dk/livsstil/Da-Danmark-skrev-verdenshistorie/artikel/1750195 | language=no | access-date=November 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2012, the [[Folketing]] (Danish Parliament) approved new laws regarding same-sex civil and religious marriage. These laws permit same-sex couples to get married in the [[Church of Denmark]]. The bills received [[royal assent]] on 12 June and took effect on 15 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanners |first=Peter |title=Gay marriage legalised |url=http://cphpost.dk/news/national/updated-gay-marriage-legalised |accessdate=25 September 2012 |newspaper=The Copenhagen Post |date=7 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818162542/http://cphpost.dk/news/national/updated-gay-marriage-legalised |archivedate=18 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark was previously the first country in the world to legally recognize same-sex couples through registered partnerships in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.cybercity.dk/~dko12530/s2.htm The Registered Partnership Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930123537/http://users.cybercity.dk/~dko12530/s2.htm|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rule, Sheila (2 October 1989).

====France====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in France}}
Since November 1999, France has had a [[civil union]] scheme known as a [[civil solidarity pact]] that is open to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N144 Pacte civil de solidarité (Pacs)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Government introduced a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, ''[[Bill 344 (2012)|Bill 344]]'', in the National Assembly on 17 November 2012. Article 1 of the bill defining marriage as an agreement between two people was passed on 2 February 2013 in its first reading by a 249–97 vote. On 12 February 2013, the National Assembly approved the entire bill in a 329–229 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=France's parliament passes gay marriage bill|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/02/12/france-gay-marriage-adoption.html|accessdate=24 April 2013|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2013, the upper house of the French Parliament voted to legalise same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French senate votes to legalise gay marriage|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22126437|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April 2013, the law was approved by the National Assembly in a 331–225 vote.&lt;ref name="Same-sex marriage: France"&gt;{{cite news|title=Same-sex marriage: French parliament approves new law|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22261494|publisher=BBC News Europe|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Law No.2013-404'' grants same-sex couples living in France, including foreigners provided at least one of the partners has their domicile or residence in France, the legal right to get married. The law also allows the recognition in France of same-sex couples' marriages that occurred abroad before the bill's enactment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lesur|first=Lionel|title=France Allows Same-Sex Marriages|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/france-allows-same-sex-marriages|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=13 June 2013|author2=Lisa A.

The main right-wing opposition party UMP challenged the law in the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], which had one month to rule on whether the law conformed to the Constitution. The Constitutional Council had previously ruled that the issue of same-sex marriage was one for the Parliament to decide and there was only little hope for UMP to overturn the Parliament's vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Décision n° 2010–92 QPC du 28 janvier 2011|url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2011/2010-92-qpc/decision-n-2010-92-qpc-du-28-janvier-2011.52612.html|website=Les décisions|publisher=Conseil Constitutionel|accessdate=24 April 2013|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 May 2013, the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] declared the bill legal in its entire redaction.

====Germany====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Germany}}

Prior to the legalisation of same-sex marriage, Germany was one of the first countries to legislate [[Civil union|registered partnerships]] (''Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft'') for same-sex couples, which provided most of the rights of marriage. The law came into effect on 1 August 2001, and the act was progressively amended on subsequent occasions to reflect [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|court]] rulings expanding the rights of registered partners.

Same-sex marriage has been legal in Germany since 1 October 2017. A bill recognising marriages and adoption rights for same-sex couples passed the [[Bundestag]] on 30 June 2017 after [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] stated that she would allow her [[CDU/CSU]] parliamentarians a [[conscience vote]] on such legislation, shortly after it was made a requirement for any future coalition by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik/bundesparteitag-der-spd-schulz-macht-ehe-fuer-alle-zur-koalitionsbedingung-27856194|title=Bundesparteitag der SPD Schulz macht Ehe für alle zur Koalitionsbedingung|work=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]]|publisher=[[Berliner Zeitung]]|language=de|date=25 June 2017|accessdate=26 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625220038/http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik/bundesparteitag-der-spd-schulz-macht-ehe-fuer-alle-zur-koalitionsbedingung-27856194|archivedate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-governing [[SPD]] consequently forced a vote on the issue together with the opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/europe/germany-gay-marriage.html|title=Parliament in Germany Approves Same-Sex Marriage|last=Smale|first=Alison|date=30 June 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=30 June 2017|last2=Shimer|first2=David|language=en-US|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703142747/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/europe/germany-gay-marriage.html|archivedate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous attempts by smaller parties to introduce same-sex marriage were blocked by the CDU/CSU-led government over several years.

====Iceland====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Iceland}}
Same-sex marriage was introduced in Iceland through legislation establishing a gender-neutral definition of marriage introduced by the Coalition Government of the [[Social Democratic Alliance]] and [[Left-Green Movement]]. The legislation was passed unanimously by the Icelandic [[Althing]] on 11 June 2010, and took effect on 27 June 2010, replacing an earlier system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65A3V020100611|title=Iceland passes gay marriage law in unanimous vote|agency=Reuters|date= 11 June 2010|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/06/28/new-gay-marriage-law-in-iceland-comes-into-force/|title=New gay marriage law in Iceland comes into force|work=Icenews|date= 28 June 2010|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] and her partner were among the first married same-sex couples in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/iceland/7858150/Iceland-PM-weds-as-gay-marriage-legalised.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Iceland PM weds as gay marriage legalised|date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland}}
Prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, the ''Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010'' allowed same sex couples to enter civil partnerships. The Act came into force on 1 January 2011 and gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar to, but not equal to, those of civil marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/partnership-laws-come-into-force-1.869456 |title=Partnership laws come into force |publisher=The Irish Times |date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2015, Ireland held a [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015|referendum]]. The referendum proposed to add to the [[Irish Constitution]]: "marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex". The proposal was approved with 62% of voters supporting same-sex marriage. On 29 August 2015, Irish President [[Michael D. Higgins]] signed the result of the May referendum into law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/president-signs-same-sex-marriage-into-constitution-1.2333882|title=President signs same-sex marriage into Constitution|date=29 August 2015|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made Ireland the first country in the world to approve same-sex marriage at a nationwide referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/vote2015/2015/0523/703205-referendum-byelection/|title=Ireland says Yes to same-sex marriage|journal=Rte.ie|date=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage became formally legally recognised in Ireland on 16 November 2015.&lt;ref name="legal123"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34810598|title=Same-sex marriage is now legal in Republic of Ireland|journal=BBC News|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malta has recognized same-sex unions since April 2014, following the enactment of the ''Civil Unions Act'', first introduced in September 2013.

On 28 November 2011, the first two same-sex marriages occurred in [[Quintana Roo]] after it was discovered that Quintana Roo's Civil Code did not explicitly prohibit same-sex marriage,&lt;ref name="QR marriages legal"&gt;{{cite news|author=Brisa Muñoz|publisher=CNN México|title=Dos matrimonios homosexuales se casaron en un municipio conservador|date=2 December 2011|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/12/02/los-matrimonios-del-mismo-sexo-despiertan-polemica-en-quintana-roo|language=Spanish|accessdate=2 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106064114/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/12/02/los-matrimonios-del-mismo-sexo-despiertan-polemica-en-quintana-roo|archivedate=6 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these marriages were later annulled by the [[Governor of Quintana Roo]] in April 2012.&lt;ref name="QR marriages annulled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=304595|website=[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]]|publisher=Comunicación e Información, S.A. de C.V|title=Anula gobernador de Quintana Roo dos bodas gay; lo acusan de homofóbico|language=Spanish|date=17 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012|first=Rosa|last=Santana}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, the Secretary of State of Quintana Roo reversed the annulments and allowed for future same-sex marriages to be performed in the state.&lt;ref name="QR marriages reinstated"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/845171.html|language=Spanish|title=Revocan anulación de bodas gay en QRoo|first=Adriana|last=Varillas|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2014, the Congress of [[Coahuila]] approved adoptions by same-sex couples. A bill legalizing same-sex marriages passed on 1 September 2014, making Coahuila the first state (and second jurisdiction after Mexico City) to reform its Civil Code to allow for legal same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aprueban matrimonios gay en Coahuila|date=1 September 2014|url=http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/apruebanmatrimoniosgayencoahuila-2155742.html|publisher=Vangardia.com.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took effect on 17 September, and the first couple married on 20 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=19500&amp;MediaType=1&amp;Category=24|title=First Gay Couple Marries In Coahuila, Mexico|date=21 September 2014|publisher=On Top Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2015, the Governor of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] announced that his administration would no longer oppose same-sex marriages in the state. The order was effective immediately, thus making Chihuahua the third state to legalize such unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexico state of Chihuahua officially approves same-sex marriage|date=2015-06-12|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/mexico-state-chihuahua-officially-approves-same-sex-marriage120615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexican state to allow same-sex marriage| date=2015-06-12|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/06/12/mexican-state-to-allow-same-sex-marriage/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 2015, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation]] released a "jurisprudential thesis" which found state-laws defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman unconstitutional. The ruling standardized court procedures across Mexico to authorize same-sex marriages. However, the process is still lengthy and more expensive than that for an opposite-sex marriage, as the ruling did not invalidate any state laws, meaning same-sex couples will be denied the right to wed and will have to turn to the courts for individual injunctions ({{lang-es|amparo}}). However, given the nature of the ruling, judges and courts throughout Mexico must approve any application for a same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/mexico-supreme-court-opens-door-to-gay-marriage-nationwide/307197801|title=Mexico supreme court says state laws limiting marriage to man and woman unconstitutional|publisher=Minneapolis Star Tribune|date=12 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614004959/http://www.startribune.com/mexico-supreme-court-opens-door-to-gay-marriage-nationwide/307197801|archivedate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official release of the thesis was on 19 June 2015, which took effect on 22 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexico avalara matrimonio gay partir lunes|date=2015-06-19|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2015/06/19/nota/4972027/mexico-avalara-matrimonio-gay-partir-lunes|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2015, following the Supreme Court's ruling striking down district same-sex marriage bans, the Civil Registry of [[Guerrero]] announced that they had planned a collective same-sex marriage ceremony for 10 July 2015 and indicated that there would have to be a change to the law to allow gender-neutral marriage, passed through the state Legislature before the official commencement.&lt;ref name="La Jornada"&gt;{{cite web|author=La Jornada|url=http://www.lajornadaguerrero.com.mx/2015/06/26/index.php?section=sociedad&amp;article=008n1soc|title=A partir de julio, en Guerrero se permitirá casarse a parejas del mismo sexo|publisher=Lajornadaguerrero.com.mx|accessdate=3 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701075751/http://www.lajornadaguerrero.com.mx/2015/06/26/index.php?section=sociedad&amp;article=008n1soc|archivedate=1 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The registry announced more details of their plan, advising that only select registration offices in the state would be able to participate in the collective marriage event.&lt;ref name="collective marriage"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trujillo|first1=Javier|title=Invitan a boda colectiva del mismo sexo en Acapulco|url=http://www.milenio.com/estados/Invitan_a_boda_colectiva_del_mismo_sexo_en_Acapulco_0_545345734.html|accessdate=30 June 2015|publisher=Milenio|date=29 June 2015|location=Acapulco, Mexico|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state Governor instructed civil agencies to approve same-sex [[marriage license]]s.

====Netherlands====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands}}
The Netherlands was the first country to extend marriage laws to include same-sex couples, following the recommendation of a special commission appointed to investigate the issue in 1995. A same-sex marriage bill passed the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] and the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] in 2000, taking effect on 1 April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/20/world/same-sex-dutch-couples-gain-marriage-and-adoption-rights.html|title=Same-Sex Dutch Couples Gain Marriage and Adoption Rights|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 2000|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Caribbean Netherlands|Dutch Caribbean special municipalities]] of [[Bonaire]], [[Sint Eustatius]] and [[Saba]], marriage is open to same-sex couples. A law enabling same-sex couples to marry in these municipalities passed and came into effect on 10 October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=18 December 2010|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0028129/geldigheidsdatum_18-12-2010|publisher=[[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Government of the Netherlands]]| title=Aanpassingswet openbare lichamen Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba|date=1 September 2010|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caribbean countries [[Same-sex marriage in Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten|Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten]], forming the remainder of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, do not perform same-sex marriages, but must recognize those performed in the Netherlands proper.

Portugal created de facto unions similar to common-law marriage for cohabiting opposite-sex partners in 1999, and extended these unions to same-sex couples in 2001. However, the 2001 extension did not allow for same-sex adoption, either jointly or of stepchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistoriaconmapas.com/war-maps/Same-sex-marriage-Legal-recognition-War-Maps.htm|title=Historia con Mapas|accessdate=26 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082229/http://www.lahistoriaconmapas.com/war-maps/Same-sex-marriage-Legal-recognition-War-Maps.htm|archivedate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2010, Parliament approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage. The Portuguese President promulgated the law on 8 April 2010 and the law was effective on 5 June 2010, making Portugal the eighth country to legalize nationwide same-sex marriage; however, adoption was still denied for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.57883.com/en/wiki/wiki/people/201502/Same-sex_marriage0_en.57883.com.html|title=Same-sex marriage in Portugal|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gay troue.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Same-sex wedding in South Africa, 2007]]
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in South Africa}}

Legal recognition of same-sex marriages in South Africa came about as a result of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]]'s decision in the case of ''[[Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie]]''. The court ruled on 1 December 2005 that the existing marriage laws violated the [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa|equality clause]] of the ''[[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]]'' because they discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. The court gave [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] one year to rectify the inequality.

The ''[[Civil Union Act (South Africa)|Civil Union Act]]'' was passed by the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] on 14 November 2006, by a vote of 230 to 41. It became law on 30 November 2006. South Africa became the fifth country, the first in Africa, and the second outside Europe, to legalize same-sex marriage.

====Sweden====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Sweden}}
Same-sex marriage in Sweden has been legal since 1 May 2009, following the adoption of a new gender-neutral law on marriage by the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish Parliament]] on 1 April 2009, making Sweden the seventh country in the world to open marriage to same-sex couples nationwide. Marriage replaced Sweden's registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Existing registered partnerships between same-sex couples remained in force with an option to convert them into marriages.&lt;ref name="swedishmarriagerights"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7978495.stm|title=Sweden allows same-sex marriage|publisher=BBC News|date=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church of Sweden says yes to gay marriage|url=http://www.thelocal.se/22810/20091022|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=The Local|date=22 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111080159/http://www.thelocal.se/22810/20091022|archivedate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriages have been performed by the [[Church of Sweden]] since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.svenskakyrkan.se/samkonade-aktenskap |title=Samkönade äktenskap |publisher=Svenskakyrkan.se |date=2017-12-14 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom}}

Since 2005, same-sex couples have been allowed to enter into [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]], a separate union providing the [[Legal consequences of marriage and civil partnership in the United Kingdom|legal consequences of marriage]]. In 2006, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] rejected a legal bid by a British [[Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson|lesbian couple]] who had [[Same-sex marriage in British Columbia|married]] in Canada to have their union recognised as a marriage in the UK rather than a civil partnership.

In September 2011, the Coalition Government announced its intention to introduce same-sex civil marriage in England and Wales by the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|May 2015 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Jessica|title=Government proposes introducing gay marriage after Cameron intervention|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/09/16/government-proposes-introduction-of-full-gay-marriage-after-cameron-intervention/|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the Scottish Government's consultation, the UK Government's consultation for England and Wales did not include provision for religious ceremonies. In May 2012, three religious groups (Quakers, Liberal Judaism and Unitarians) sent a letter to David Cameron, asking that they be allowed to solemnise same-sex weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/05/29/religious-groups-urge-david-cameron-to-maintain-equal-marriage-support/|title=Religious groups urge David Cameron to maintain equal marriage support|website=PinkNews|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the UK Government completed the consultation to allow civil marriage for same-sex couples in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref name="grauni1127"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships may soon be welcomed|first=Alan|last=Travis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/17/civil-partnerships-marriage|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its response to the consultation, the Government said that it also intended "...to enable those religious organisations that wish to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies to do so, on a permissive basis only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/equal-marriage-consultation|title=Equal marriage consultation|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, the Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]], announced that, whilst he favoured allowing same-sex marriage within a religious context, provision would be made guaranteeing no religious institution would be required to perform such ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20642428|title=Gay marriage: David Cameron backs church role|journal=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third [[Reading (legislature)|reading]] took place on 21 May 2013, and was approved by 366 votes to 161.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriage: Commons passes Cameron's plan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22605011|accessdate=21 May 2013|date=21 May 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 2013, the Commons accepted all of the Lords' amendments.&lt;ref name=BBC23338279&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23338279|title=Same-sex marriage becomes law in England and Wales|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=5  July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July 2013, the bill received [[royal assent]] becoming the ''[[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]]'', which came into force on 13 March 2014.&lt;ref name="BBC23338279"/&gt; The first same-sex marriages took place on 29 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26793127|title=Same-sex marriage now legal as first couples wed|journal=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2014-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Government]] conducted a three-month-long consultation which ended on 9 December 2011. The analysis was published in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Consultation sees 50,000 responses|work=The Scotsman|location=Edinburgh|url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/politics/consultation_sees_50_000_responses_1_2001639|accessdate=9 February 2012|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the consultation held in England and Wales, Scotland considered both civil and religious same-sex marriage. Whilst the Scottish Government was in favour of same-sex marriage, it stated that no religious body would be forced to hold such ceremonies once legislation is enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Parliament Website|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/09/05153328/1|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=9 February 2012|date=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 June 2013, the Government published the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2013/06/same-sex-marriage-27062013|title=Same sex marriage|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preserve the freedom of both religious groups and individual clergy, the Scottish Government believed it necessary for changes to be made to the ''Equality Act 2010'' and communicated with the UK Government on this matter; thus, the first same-sex marriages in Scotland did not occur until this had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-23067324|title=Scotland's gay marriage bill published at Holyrood|journal=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February 2014, the Scottish Parliament overwhelmingly passed legislation legalising same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25960225|title=Scotland's same-sex marriage bill is passed|journal=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill received royal assent as the ''[[Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014]]'' on 12 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/BusinessBulletin/74320.aspx|title=Thursday 13 March 2014 – Announcements – Scottish Parliament|publisher=scottish.parliament.uk|date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scotland's same-sex marriage bill is passed |accessdate=14 March 2014|date=4 February 2014|url=http://m.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25960225|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law took effect on 16 December 2014, with the first same-sex weddings occurring for those converting their civil partnerships into marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/same-sex-marriage-becomes-legal-in-scotland-1-3635305|title=Same-sex marriage becomes legal in Scotland|publisher=Scotsman|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/first-same-sex-marriages-to-take-place-in-scotland-on-hogman|title=Scotland's First Same-Sex Marriages To Take Place On Hogmanay|website=BuzzFeed|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Ireland Executive has stated that it does not intend to introduce legislation allowing for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions are treated as civil partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-37791366|title=Same-sex marriage: Arlene Foster criticised for 'childish' online abuse comments|journal=BBC News|date=28 October 2016|quote=[[First Minister of Northern Ireland|First Minister]] [[Arlene Foster]] said the DUP would use a petition of concern to block any change to the law over the next five years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Celebrating a new America -lovewins 58242 (18588276403).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[White House]], illuminated in rainbow colors, on the evening of the ''Obergefell'' ruling, June 26, 2015.]]
[[Same-sex marriage in the United States]] expanded from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015 through various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes, and federal court rulings.

Civil rights campaigning in support of marriage without distinction as to sex or sexual orientation began in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=The Same-Sex Couple Who Got a Marriage License in 1971|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/us/the-same-sex-couple-who-got-a-marriage-license-in-1971.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 16, 2015|accessdate=April 6, 2018|last1=Eckholm|first1=Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the now overturned ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'' saw the U.S. Supreme Court decline to become involved.&lt;ref name="Gumbel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gumbel|first=Andrew|title=The Great Undoing?|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/2009/06/20/great-undoing|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue became prominent from around 1993, when the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]] ruled in ''[[Baehr v. Miike|Baehr v. Lewin]]'' that it was unconstitutional under the [[Constitution of Hawaii|state constitution]] for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. That ruling led to federal and state actions to explicitly abridge marriage on the basis of sex in order to prevent the marriages of same-sex couples from being recognized by law, the most prominent of which was [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]]. In 2003, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled in ''[[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health]]'' that it was unconstitutional under the [[Constitution of Massachusetts|state constitution]] for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. From 2004 through to 2015, as [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|the tide of public opinion]] continued to move towards support of same-sex marriage, various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes ([[referenda]] and [[initiative]]s), and federal court rulings established same-sex marriage in 36 states.

In 2004, [[Coretta Scott King]], a leader of the [[African-American civil rights movement]] and the widow of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], expressed her support for same-sex marriage and publicly denounced attempts to define marriage as the "union of a man and a woman" as a form of "gay bashing".&lt;ref name="Michael Long"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeanne Theoharis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; In 2007, [[Mildred Loving]], the joint plaintiff alongside her husband [[Richard Loving]] in the 1967 landmark civil rights case of ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' in which the Supreme Court of the United States struck down all state bans on [[Interracial marriage in the United States|inter-racial marriage]], expressed her support for same-sex marriage and compared it to inter-racial marriage.&lt;ref name="American Constitution Society"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Douglas Martin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; In 2011, [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|national public support for same-sex marriage]] rose above 50% for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/147662/first-time-majority-americans-favor-legal-gay-marriage.aspx|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|date=May 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[NAACP]], the leading African-American civil rights organization, declared its support for same-sex marriage and stated that it is a [[civil right]].&lt;ref name="NAACP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="naacp.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; In 2013, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]] for violating the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in the landmark civil rights case of ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', leading to federal recognition of same-sex marriage, with federal benefits for married couples connected to either the state of residence or the state in which the marriage was solemnized. In 2015, [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|national public support for same-sex marriage]] rose to 60% for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Record-High 60% of Americans Support Same-Sex Marriage|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/183272/record-high-americans-support-sex-marriage.aspx|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] [[civil rights]] case of ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that the [[Fundamental rights in the United States|fundamental right]] of same-sex couples to marry on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples, with all the accompanying rights and responsibilities, is guaranteed by both the [[Due Process Clause]] and the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

The ruling of the Supreme Court in ''Obergefell'' occurred following decades of consistently rising [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|national public support for same-sex marriage in the United States]], with support continuing to rise thereafter.

The [[United States of America]] is the most populous country in the world to have established same-sex marriage nationwide.

====Uruguay====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Uruguay}}
Uruguay's [[Chamber of Deputies (Uruguay)|Chamber of Deputies]] passed a bill on 12 December 2012, to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diputados aprobó el matrimonio igualitario Pasada la mediano|url=http://www.unoticias.com.uy/2012/12/12/informacion_nacional/diputados_aprobo_el_matrimonio_igualitario/|website=Noticias|publisher=Diario UNoticias|accessdate=31 July 2013|language=Spanish|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Senate (Uruguay)|Senate]] passed the bill on 2 April 2013, but with minor amendments.

===National debates===
====Armenia====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Armenia}}
Armenia has historically had few protections or recognition in law of same-sex couples. This changed in July 2017, when the Ministry of Justice revealed that all marriages performed abroad are valid in Armenia, including marriages between people of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/m/eng/news/243348 |title=Mobile |website=Panarmenian.Net |date=2017-07-03|accessdate=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; That made Armenia the second country of the former [[Soviet Union]], after
[[Recognition of same-sex unions in Estonia|Estonia]], to recognise same-sex marriages performed abroad, though it's not clear if such recognition has any practical effect.

====Bulgaria====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Bulgaria}}
The Bulgarian Constitution forbids the legalisation of same-sex marriage, stipulating that marriage can only be between a man and a woman.

In late 2017, a Bulgarian same-sex couple, who [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|married in the United Kingdom]], filed a lawsuit in order to have their marriage recognised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofiaglobe.com/2017/12/05/woman-sues-bulgarian-authorities-for-recognition-of-same-sex-marriage/ Woman sues Bulgarian authorities for recognition of same-sex marriage] ''The Sofia Globe'', 5 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Sofia Administrative Court ruled against them in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/186950/The+Court+did+not+Recognize+a+Marriage+Between+Bulgarian+Women+in+the+UK |title=The Court did not Recognize a Marriage Between Bulgarian Women in the UK |publisher=Novinite.com |date=2018-01-12 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sofia]] court granted a same-sex couple the right to live in Bulgaria on 29 June 2018.

A formal agreement between the two parties and the [[Inter-American Commission of Human Rights]] was signed in April 2015.&lt;ref name="blade"&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/01/15/latin-america-countries-urged-to-abide-by-landmark-lgbt-rights-ruling/ Latin America countries urged to abide by landmark LGBT rights ruling] ''The Washington Blade'', 15 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean Government pledged to legalise same-sex marriage.

On 28 January 2015, the National Congress approved a bill recognizing civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples offering some of the rights of marriage. Bachelet signed the bill on 14 April, and it came into effect on 22 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Chile recognises same-sex civil unions|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-32296246|journal=BBC News|date=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters-bill-pass&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esposito|first1=Anthony|title=Socially-conservative Chile approves civil unions|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/28/chile-civilunions-idUSL1N0V71X020150128|accessdate=28 January 2015|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in China}}
The ''Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China'' explicitly defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman. No other form of civil union is recognized. The attitude of the Chinese Government towards homosexuality is believed to be "three nos": "No approval; no disapproval; no promotion." The Ministry of Health officially removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in 2001.

[[Li Yinhe]], a sociologist and sexologist well known in the Chinese gay community, has tried to legalize same-sex marriage several times, including during the National People's Congress in 2000 and 2004 (''Legalization for Same-Sex Marriage'' 《中国同性婚姻合法化》 in 2000 and the ''Same-Sex Marriage Bill'' 《中国同性婚姻提案》 in 2004). According to Chinese law, 35 delegates' signatures are needed to make an issue a bill to be discussed in the Congress. Her efforts failed due to lack of support from the delegates. CPPCC National Committee spokesman [[Wu Jianmin]]
when asked about Li Yinhe's proposal, said that same-sex marriage was still too "ahead of its time" for China. He argued that same-sex marriage was not recognized even in many Western countries, which are considered much more liberal in social issues than China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2006-03-05/10278364854s.shtml|title=政协发言人称同性婚姻太超前 李银河提案再受挫_新闻中心_新浪网|publisher=News.sina.com.cn|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement is understood as an implication that the Government may consider recognition of same-sex marriage in the long run, but not in the near future.

On 5 January 2016, a court in [[Changsha]], southern [[Hunan|Hunan Province]], agreed to hear the lawsuit of 26-year-old Sun Wenlin filed in December 2015 against the Bureau of Civil Affairs of Furong District for its June 2015 refusal to let him marry his 36-year-old male partner, Hu Mingliang. On 13 April 2016, with hundreds of same-sex marriage supporters outside, the Changsha court ruled against Sun, who vowed to appeal, citing the importance of his case for LGBT progress in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/13/474065742/chinese-court-rules-against-gay-couple-seeking-to-get-married|title=Chinese Court Rules Against Gay Couple Seeking To Get Married|publisher=The Two-Way|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgia====
{{Main|LGBT rights in Georgia (country)}}

====Israel====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Israel}}
In 2006, Israel's High Court of Justice ruled to recognize foreign same-sex marriages for the limited purpose of registration with the Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration; however, this is merely for statistical purposes and grants no state-level rights. Israel does not recognize civil marriages performed under its own jurisdiction. A bill was raised in the [[Knesset]] (Israeli Parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but the Knesset did not advance the bill. A bill to legalize same-sex and interfaith civil marriages was defeated in the Knesset, 39–11, on 16 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Jerusalem Post|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=270221|title=Knesset rejects marriage equality bill|date=16 May 2012|author=Harkov, Lahav|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522013505/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=270221|archivedate=22 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the National LGBT Taskforce of Israel petitioned the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] to allow same-sex marriage in the country, arguing that the refusal of the rabbinical court to recognise same-sex marriage should not prevent civil courts from performing same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/NGO-The-Aguda-petitions-Supreme-Court-to-allow-same-sex-marriage-Israel-431733#article=6017RkIwRTRGQ0UyQzlCNUYxOUM3OUI5QTc1RTJGQkVGMkU=|title=NGO petitions High Court to allow same-sex marriage in Israel|website=The Jerusalem Post|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court handed down a ruling on 31 August 2017, determining the issue was the responsibility of the Knesset, and not the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpost.com/Israel-News/Supreme-Court-rejects-petition-to-recognize-same-sex-marriage-503894|date=31 August 2017|website=Jerusalem Post|title=Supreme Court rejects petition to recognize same-sex marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2016, the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia]] overturned an administrative court decision which refused an application to register a same-sex marriage in the country. A Supreme Court press spokeswoman said that the court agrees with the administrative court that current regulations do not allow for same-sex marriages to be legally performed in Latvia. However, the matter should have been considered in a context not of marriage, but of registering familial partnership. Furthermore, it would have been impossible to conclude whether the applicants' rights were violated or not unless their claim is accepted and reviewed in a proper manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsm.lv/en/article/societ/society/supreme-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-request-will-be-considered.a184891/ |title=Supreme Court rules same-sex marriage request will be considered |publisher=Public broadcasting of Latvia |date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court will now decide whether the refusal was in breach of the Latvian Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.

In November 2008, the [[Supreme Court of Nepal]] issued final judgment on matters related to LGBT rights, which included permitting same-sex couples to marry. Same-sex marriage and protection for sexual minorities were to be included in the new Nepalese Constitution required to be completed by 31 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nepal/Nepal-charter-to-grant-gay-rights/Article1-499154.aspx|title=Nepal charter to grant gay rights|website=Hindustan Times|date=19 January 2010|accessdate=1 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123144431/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nepal/Nepal-charter-to-grant-gay-rights/Article1-499154.aspx|archivedate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Dean|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/7027736/Nepal-to-stage-gay-weddings-on-Everest.html|title=Nepal 'to stage gay weddings on Everest'|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 January 2010|accessdate=1 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Legislature was unable to agree on the Constitution before the deadline and was dissolved after the Supreme Court ruled that the term could not be extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/world/asia/nepal-disbands-legislature-as-talks-on-constitution-fail.html|title=Legislature in Nepal Disbands in Failure|work=The New York Times|date=31 May 2012|accessdate=1 June 2012|first1=Kiran|last1=Chapagain|first2=Jim|last2=Yardley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nepali Constitution was enacted in September 2015, but does not address same-sex marriage.

President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] supports the legalization of same-sex marriage, but feels that such a law may not pass in Congress yet as many are still influenced heavily by colonial-era Christian ideals. He also supports same-sex civil unions, which has a higher possibility for passage and is supported by the majority of congresspersons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-18/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-says-he-supports-same-sex-marriage/9266962 |title=Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte says he supports same-sex marriage |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2017-12-18 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romania====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Romania}}

On 5 June 2018, the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) ruled, in a case originating from Romania, that same-sex couples have the same residency rights as different-sex couples, when a national of an EU country gets married while resident in an EU country where same-sex marriage is legal, and the spouse is from a non-EU country.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44366898|title=Same-sex spouses have equal residency rights|journal=BBC News|date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conversation"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/rights-for-same-sex-married-couples-to-move-around-the-eu-confirmed-in-landmark-ruling-96387 |title=Rights for same-sex married couples to move around the EU confirmed in landmark ruling |author=Alina Tryfonidou |publisher=The Conversation |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slovenia====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Slovenia}}
Slovenia recognises registered partnerships for same-sex couples.

In December 2014, the eco-socialist [[United Left (Slovenia)|United Left]] party introduced a bill amending the definition of marriage in the 1976 ''Marriage and Family Relations Act'' to include same-sex couples. In January 2015, the Government expressed no opposition to the bill. In February 2015, the bill was passed with 11 votes to 2. In March, the Assembly passed the final bill in a 51–28 vote. On 10 March 2015, the National Council rejected a motion to require the Assembly to vote on the bill again, in a 14–23 vote. Opponents of the bill launched a petition for a referendum and managed to collect 40,000 signatures. The Parliament then voted to block the referendum with a clarification that it would be against the [[Constitution of Slovenia|Slovenian Constitution]] to vote on matters concerning human rights. Finally, the Constitutional Court ruled against the banning of the referendum (5–4) and [[Slovenian same-sex marriage referendum, 2015|the referendum]] was held on 20 December 2015.

In the referendum, 63.4% of the voters voted against the law, rendering Parliament's same-sex marriage act invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/referendum/pobudniki-referenduma-uspeli-novela-zakona-o-zakonski-zvezi-zavrnjena/381559 |title=Pobudniki referenduma uspeli, sprememba zakona o zakonski zvezi zavrnjena |language=Slovenian|date=20 December 2015 |access-date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, [[Kim Jho Kwang-soo]] and his partner, Kim Seung-Hwan, filed a lawsuit seeking legal status for their marriage after their marriage registration form was rejected by the local authorities in [[Seoul]]. On 25 May 2016, a South Korean district court ruled against the couple and argued that without clear legislation a same-sex union can not be recognized as a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/25/south-korea-rejects-film-director-kim-jho-gwang-so-same-sex-marriage-case|title=South Korean court rejects film director's same-sex marriage case|journal=The Guardian|date=25 May 2016|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple quickly filed an appeal against the district court ruling.

====Taiwan====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Taiwan}}
On 22 December 2014, a proposed amendment to the Civil Code which would legalize same-sex marriage was due to go under review by the Judiciary Committee. If the amendment passes the committee stage, it will then be voted on at the plenary session of the [[Legislative Yuan]] in 2015. The amendment, called the marriage equality amendment, would insert neutral terms into the Civil Code replacing ones that imply heterosexual marriage, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage. It would also allow same-sex couples to adopt children.

[[Yu Mei-nu]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), who is the convener of the current legislative session, has expressed support for the amendment as have more than 20 other DPP lawmakers as well as two from the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] and one each from the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lii Wen|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/12/21/2003607251|title=Gay marriage proposal set for review|website=Taipei Times|date=21 December 2014|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan would become the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage if the Civil Code is amended.

A poll carried out between August and October 2015 found that 71% of the Taiwanese population supported same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/11/30/nearly-two-thirds-of-taiwan-supports-marriage-equality-survey-finds/ |title=Nearly two thirds of Taiwan supports marriage equality, survey finds |publisher=PinkNews |date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tsai Ing-wen]], the President of Taiwan since May 2016, announced her support of same-sex marriage in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/watch-taiwan-presidential-frontrunner-officially-endorses-marriage-equality/|title=Watch: Taiwan presidential frontrunner officially endorses marriage equality|date=2 November 2015|website=gaystarnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, two new same-sex marriage bills were introduced to the [[Legislative Yuan]]. Subsequently, protests have been staged by groups opposing and by groups supporting legalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/12/04/2003660533 |title=Thousands protest gay marriage in Taipei |author=Gerber, Abraham|date=4 December 2016|work=[[Taipei Times]]|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/12/11/2003660976|title=Thousands rally to support equal marriage rights - Taipei Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry, and gave the Taiwanese Government two years to amend the law to that effect.

President [[Nicolás Maduro]] supports same-sex marriage, and has suggested that the [[2017 Constituent National Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] would agree to legalising it.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://shangay.com/maduro-creo-que-todo-el-mundo-se-puede-casar-aunque-sea-homosexual Maduro: "Creo que todo el mundo se puede casar, aunque sea homosexual"] ''shangay.com'', 20 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam====
{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Vietnam}}
In Vietnam, currently only a marriage between a man and a woman is recognized. Vietnam's Ministry of Justice began seeking advice on legalizing same-sex marriage from other governmental and non-governmental organizations in April and May 2012, and planned to further discuss the issue at the National Assembly in Spring 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnam government consults on same-sex marriage|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vietnam-government-consults-same-sex-marriage200612|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2013, the Ministry of Justice requested that the National Assembly avoid action until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote on same-sex marriage in Vietnam likely to be delayed until 2014|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vote-same-sex-marriage-vietnam-likely-be-delayed-until-2014200213}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a hearing to discuss marriage law reforms in April 2013, deputy minister of health Nguyen Viet Tien proposed that same-sex marriage be made legal immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/04/vietnam-flawed-on-human-rights-but-a-leader-in-gay-rights/275413|title=Vietnam: Flawed on Human Rights, but a Leader in Gay Rights|author=Thomas Maresca|date=30 April 2013|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese Government abolished an administrative fine imposed on same-sex weddings in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/345169/vietnam-ends-same-sex-marriage-fines|title=Vietnam ends same-sex marriage fines|publisher=Bangkok Post|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was enacted on 11 November 2013. The 100,000–500,000 [[VND]]  ($24[[USD]]) fine will be abolished. Although same-sex marriages are not permitted in Vietnam, the policy will decriminalize the relationship, habitual privileges such as household registry, property, child raising, and co-habitual partnerships are recognized.&lt;ref&gt;S.

In June 2013, the National Assembly began formal debate on a proposal to establish legal recognition for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/world/11253-vietnam-national-assembly-begins-debate-on-marriage-equality.html|title=The latest entertainment news for Australia's LGBTIQ community|publisher=Gay News Network|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 2013, the Government issued the decree abolishing the fines on same-sex marriages.

On 27 May 2014, the National Assembly's Committee for Social Affairs removed the provision giving legal status and some rights to cohabiting same-sex couples from the Government's bill to amend the ''Law on Marriage and Family''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vietnamese-lawmakers-back-down-giving-rights-same-sex-couples300514|title=Vietnamese lawmakers back down on giving rights to same-sex couples|date=2014-05-30|website=Gay Star News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/vietnams-proposed-marriage-law-disappoints-lgbt-activists-/1925916.html|title=Vietnam's Proposed Marriage Law Disappoints LGBT Activists|website=VOA|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was approved by the National Assembly on 19 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thanhniennews.com/politics/vietnam-allows-surrogacy-within-families-denies-samesex-marriage-27502.html|title=Vietnam allows surrogacy within families, denies same-sex marriage|website=Thanh Nien Daily|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/20478/vietnam-removes-ban-on-same-sex-marriage|title=Vietnam removes ban on same sex marriage|author=Tuoi Tre Newspaper|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2015, the ''2014 Law on Marriage and Family'' officially went into effect. It states that while Vietnam allows same-sex weddings, it will not offer legal recognition or protection to unions between people of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marilynstowe.co.uk/2014/12/29/vietnam-set-to-lift-gay-marriage-ban/|title=Vietnam set to lift gay marriage ban|website=Marilyn Stowe Blog|accessdate=26 July 2015|date=2014-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International organizations===
The terms of employment of the staff of [[international organizations]] (not [[Business|commercial]]) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.

Despite their relative independence, few organizations recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the [[United Nations]] recognize same-sex marriages if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Secretary-General Bulletin|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/522/40/PDF/N0452240.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to mixed-sex married couples to de facto partners or [[domestic partner]]s of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into a mixed-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the [[World Bank]] does recognize domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTHRJOBS/0,,contentMDK:20522360~menuPK:1353209~pagePK:64262408~piPK:64262191~theSitePK:1058433,00.html|title=Jobs&amp;nbsp;— Compensation &amp; Benefits|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New York City Proposition 8 Protest outside LDS temple 20.jpg|thumb|upright|Many advocates, such as this November 2008 protester at a demonstration in [[New York City]] against [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]], reject the notion of [[civil unions]], describing them as inferior to the legal recognition of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=Towleroad&gt;{{cite web|last=Towle|first=Andy|title=NYC Protest and Civil Rights March Opposing Proposition 8|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2008/11/we-did-it.html|publisher=[[Towleroad]]|accessdate=28 September 2012|date=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Civil union, [[civil partnership]], [[domestic partnership]], [[registered partnership]], unregistered partnership, and unregistered cohabitation statuses offer varying legal benefits of marriage. As of December 2017, countries that have an alternative form of legal recognition other than marriage on a national level are: [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Andorra|Andorra]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Chile|Chile]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Croatia|Croatia]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Cyprus|Cyprus]], the [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Estonia|Estonia]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Greece|Greece]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Hungary|Hungary]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Israel|Israel]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Italy|Italy]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Poland|Poland]], [[LGBT rights in San Marino|San Marino]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Switzerland|Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="countries and states legal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearson|first=Mary|title=Where is Gay Marriage Legal?|url=http://christiangays.com/marriage/legal.shtml|publisher=christiangays.com|accessdate=20 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301004148/http://christiangays.com/marriage/legal.shtml|archive-date=1 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Steve|title=Which Countries Have Legalized Gay Marriage?|url=http://www.care2.com/causes/which-countries-have-legalized-gay-marriage.html|publisher=Care2.com (news.bbc.co.uk as source)|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a subnational level, the [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico#Tlaxcala|Mexican state of Tlaxcala]], [[Same-sex marriage in Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten|the Dutch constituent country of Aruba]] and [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] in the United Kingdom allow same-sex couples to access civil unions or partnerships, but restrict marriage to couples of the opposite sex. Additionally, various cities and counties in [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Cambodia|Cambodia]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Japan|Japan]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|Taiwan]] offer same-sex couples varying levels of benefits, which include hospital visitation rights and others.

===Non-sexual same-sex marriage===
====Kenya====
{{main|LGBT rights in Kenya}}
Female same-sex marriage is practiced among the [[Gikuyu people|Gikuyu]], [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Kamba people|Kamba]], [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], and to a lesser extent neighboring peoples.  Approximately 5–10% of women are in such marriages.  However, this is not seen as homosexual, but is instead a way for families without sons to keep their inheritance within the family.&lt;ref&gt;''Gender and Language in Sub-Saharan Africa,'' 2013:35&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws criminalizing homosexuality are generally specific to men, though in 2010 the prime minister called for women to be arrested as well.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

====Nigeria====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Nigeria}}
In Nigeria, homosexual activity between men, but not between women, is illegal.  In 2006, Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] introduced legislation that prohibits same-sex marriages and criminalizes anyone who "performs, witnesses, aids or abets" such ceremonies.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleshman|first=Michael|title=African gays and lesbians combat bias: An 'invisible' minority seeks legal safeguards, acceptance|url=https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=28 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183121/http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html|archivedate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Igbo people]] and probably other peoples in the south of the country, there are circumstances where a marriage between women is considered appropriate, such as when a woman has no child and her husband dies, and she takes a wife to perpetuate her inheritance and family lineage.&lt;ref name=NigeriaTribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111010506/http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archivedate=11 January 2010|title=Tradition of same gender marriage in Igboland|first=Leo|last=Igwe|website=Nigerian Tribune|date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
{{See also|LGBT rights opposition}}
While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the [[history of same-sex unions|historical and anthropological record]] reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, through full acceptance and integration, sympathetic toleration, indifference, prohibition and discrimination, to persecution and physical annihilation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising,&lt;ref name="Laurie"/&gt; undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-blankenhorn19-2008sep19,0,6057126.story|title=Protecting marriage to protect children|last=Blankenhorn|first=David|date=19 September 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships,&lt;ref name="findlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements|title=See discussion of prenuptial and postmarital agreements at Findlaw|publisher=Family.findlaw.com|accessdate=5 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025170627/http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements/|archivedate=25 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="indegayforum1"&gt;Dale Carpenter is a prominent spokesman for this view.

===Parenting===
{{Main|LGBT parenting|Same-sex marriage and the family}}
Scientific literature indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union (either a mixed-sex or same-sex union). As a result, professional scientific associations have argued for same-sex marriage to be legally recognized as it will be beneficial to the children of same-sex parents or carers.&lt;ref name="amici"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/10/27/amicus29.pdf|title=Brief of the American Psychological Association, The California Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy as amici curiae in support of plaintiff-appellees&amp;nbsp;– Appeal from United States District Court for the Northern District of California Civil Case No. 09-CV-2292 VRW (Honorable Vaughn R.

====Adoption====
{{main|LGBT adoption}}
All states that allow same-sex marriage also allow the joint [[adoption]] of children by people of the same sex, with the exceptions of Jalisco, Nayarit and Quintana Roo in Mexico. In addition, [[Andorra]], [[Austria]] and [[Israel]] as well as several subnational jurisdictions which do not recognize same-sex marriage nonetheless permit joint adoption by unmarried same-sex couples: Querétaro and Veracruz in Mexico as well as Northern Ireland and Jersey in the United Kingdom. Some additional states allow stepchild adoption by those who are in a same-sex relationship but are unmarried: [[Croatia]], [[Estonia]], [[Italy]] (on a case-by-case basis), [[Slovenia]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://euroclashblog.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/austrian-court-rules-to-allow-same-sex-adoptions/|title=Austrian court rules to allow same-sex adoptions|website=The Privateer|date=16 January 2016|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, more than 16,000 same-sex couples were raising an estimated 22,000 adopted children in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LGBT Adoption Statistics|url=http://www.lifelongadoptions.com/lgbt-adoption/lgbt-adoption-statistics|website=lifelongadoptions.com|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4% of all adopted children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Families are created with love|url=http://gayadoption.org/facts-supporting-gay-adoption|website=gayadoption.org|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Surrogacy and IVF treatment====
{{main|Assisted reproductive technology}}
A gay or bisexual man has the option of [[surrogacy]], the process in which a woman bears a child for another person through [[artificial insemination]] or carries another woman's surgically implanted [[fertilized egg]] to birth. A lesbian or bisexual woman has the option of artificial insemination.&lt;ref&gt;The Fertility Sourcebook, Third Edition&amp;nbsp;– Page 245, M. Sara Rosenthal&amp;nbsp;– 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Family Social Work&amp;nbsp;– Page 348, Donald Collins, Catheleen Jordan, Heather Coleman&amp;nbsp;– 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender and intersex people===
{{synthesis|date=May 2017}}
{{See also|Transgender|Legal aspects of transsexualism|Intersex|Intersex human rights}}
When sex is defined legally, it may be defined by any one of several criteria: the [[XY sex-determination system]], the type of [[gonad]]s, the type of external sexual features, or the person's social identification.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Consequently, both [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] individuals may be legally categorized into confusing gray areas, and could be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} This could result in long-term marriages, as well as recent same-sex marriages, being overturned.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The problems of defining gender by the existence/non-existence of gonads or certain sexual features is complicated by the existence of [[Gender Reassignment Surgery|surgical methods]] to alter these features.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Estimates run as high as one percent of live [[childbirth|births]] exhibiting some degree of sexual ambiguity,&lt;ref name="Laurie"&gt;{{citation |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality|publisher=The Drum|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Fausto-Sterling ''et al.'', 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births being ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including sometimes involuntary surgery to address their sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency|title=How common is intersex?|publisher=Intersex Society of North America|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. "Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality." ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' 38.5 (October 2009): 688–701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the ''[[Gender Recognition Act 2004]]'' allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage|publisher=365gay.com|date=5 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|archivedate=17 October 2007|accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. A similar provision including sterilization also existed in Sweden, but was phased out in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/sweden-ends-forced-sterilization-trans110113|title=Sweden ends forced sterilization of trans|date=11 January 2013|website=gaystarnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, transgender and intersex marriages typically run into similar complications.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19brfs-USDEFENDSMAR_BRF.html|title=U.S. Defends Marriage Law|work=The New York Times|date=18 September 2009|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some of them prohibit legal changes of gender.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Divorce===
{{Main|Divorce of same-sex couples}}
In the United States of America before the case of ''Obergefell v. Hodges'', couples in same-sex marriages could only obtain a divorce in jurisdictions that recognized same-sex marriages, with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthew S. Coleman, Esq.|title=Obergefell v. Hodges|url=http://www.einhornharris.com/familylawblog/obergefell-v-hodges|publisher=Einhorn Harris|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial and legislative===
{{Main|Conflict of marriage laws#Same-sex marriage}}
There are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A "[[direct democracy|majority rules]]" position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|title=Poll: Calif. gay marriage ban driven by religion|author=Leff, Lisa|agency=Associated Press|date=4 December 2008|work=USA Today|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208080418/http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|archivedate=8 December 2008}} archived here.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a [[civil rights]] view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7723645.stm|title= Divisions persist over gay marriage ban|author=Mirchandani, Rajesh|publisher=BBC News|date=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
