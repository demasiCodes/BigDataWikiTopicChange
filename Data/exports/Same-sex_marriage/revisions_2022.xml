'''Same-sex marriage''', also known as '''gay marriage''', is the [[marriage]] of two people of the same [[Legal sex and gender|sex or gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/same-sex-marriage-states | title=Same Sex Marriage States 2022 | publisher=World Population Review |access-date=2022-05-22 |quote=Same-sex marriage is the marriage of people of the same sex or gender}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2022|post=,}} marriage between same-sex couples is legally performed and recognized in 33 countries, with the most recent being [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico|Mexico]], constituting some 1.35&lt;!--1351.101 million, using mostly 2022 estimates from the WP country or demographics articles--&gt; billion people (17% of the world's population). In [[Same-sex marriage in Andorra|Andorra]], a law allowing same-sex marriage will come into force on 17 February 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bopa.ad/bopa/034098/Pagines/CGL20220810_11_06_09.aspx |title=Llei 30/2022, del 21 de juliol, qualificada de la persona i de la família |publisher=Bopa.ad |date= |accessdate=2022-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Same-sex adoption|Adoption rights]] are not necessarily covered, though most states with same-sex marriage allow those couples to jointly adopt as other married couples can. In contrast, 34 countries (as of 2021) have definitions of marriage in their constitutions that prevent marriage between couples of the same sex, most enacted in recent decades as a preventative measure. Some other countries have constitutionally mandated [[Islamic law]], which is generally interpreted as prohibiting marriage between same-sex couples. In six of the former and most of the latter, homosexuality itself [[Sodomy law|is criminalized]]. There are records of marriage between men dating back to the [[1st century|first century]].&lt;ref name="WilliamsRoman2"&gt;Williams, CA., ''Roman Homosexuality: Second Edition'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 280, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era, the first civil government to knowingly issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple was [[Blue Earth County, Minnesota|Blue Earth County, Minnesota, United States]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;William N. Eskridg Jr. and Christopher R. Riano, "Marriage Equality: From Outlaws to In-Laws", ''Yale University Press'' (2020), Chapter 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first law providing for '''marriage equality''' between same-sex and opposite-sex couples was [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|passed in the continental Netherlands]] in 2000 and took effect on 1 April 2001, after being signed by [[Queen Beatrix]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg-2014-12-04"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-04/gay-marriage-same-sex-partners-can-wed-in-many-countries |title=In 14 years, same-sex marriage has spread round the world |first=Caroline |last=Winter |publisher=Bloomberg |date=December 4, 2014 |access-date=2022-02-20 |archive-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220113164339/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-04/gay-marriage-same-sex-partners-can-wed-in-many-countries |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of [[marriage law]] equally to same-sex and opposite-sex couples has varied by jurisdiction, and has come about through legislative change to marriage law, court rulings based on constitutional guarantees of equality, recognition that marriage of same-sex couples is allowed by existing marriage law, and by direct popular vote, such as through [[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koco.com/news/oklahomanews/around-oklahoma/samesex-oklahoma-couple-marries-legally-under-tribal-law/-/12530084/22553184/-/101ihp0z/-/index.html |title=Same-sex Oklahoma couple marries legally under tribal law |publisher=KOCO |date=26 September 2013 |access-date=22 October 2013 |archive-date=22 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022022830/http://www.koco.com/news/oklahomanews/around-oklahoma/samesex-oklahoma-couple-marries-legally-under-tribal-law/-/12530084/22553184/-/101ihp0z/-/index.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.coloradodaily.com/2022/06/19/former-boulder-county-clerk-who-issued-first-same-sex-marriage-license-in-1975-dies-at-78/ | title =  Clela Rorex, former Boulder County Clerk who issued first same-sex marriage license in 1975 dies at 78 | date = 19 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent supporters of same-sex marriage are the world's major medical and [[Scientific community|scientific communities]], and [[human rights]] and [[civil rights]] organizations, while most prominent opponents are [[fundamentalism|religious fundamentalist]] groups.

With several countries revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their definition of the word marriage to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dictionaries take lead in redefining modern marriage|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/24/20040524-103201-1169r|access-date=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=24 May 2004|archive-date=18 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918034452/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/24/20040524-103201-1169r/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite web|title=Webster Makes It Official: Definition of Marriage Has Changed|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/webster_makes_it_official_definition_of_marriage_has_changed|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|access-date=28 September 2012|archive-date=27 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427004101/http://www.abajournal.com/news/webster_makes_it_official_definition_of_marriage_has_changed|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Redman|first=Daniel|title=Noah Webster Gives His Blessing: Dictionaries recognize same-sex marriage—who knew?|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2215628|access-date=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=7 April 2009|archive-date=17 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917032021/http://www.slate.com/id/2215628/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient===
A reference to marriage between same-sex couples appears in the [[Sifra]], which was written in the 3rd century CE. The [[Book of Leviticus]] prohibited homosexual relations, and the Hebrews were warned not to "follow the acts of the land of Egypt or the acts of the land of Canaan" (Lev. 18:22, 20:13). The Sifra clarifies what these ambiguous "acts" were, and that they included marriage between same-sex couples: "A man would marry a man and a woman a woman, a man would marry a woman and her daughter, and a woman would be married to two men."&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Joel Roth.

What is arguably the first historical mention of the performance of marriages between same-sex couples occurred during the early [[Roman Empire]] according to controversial&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;Shaw criticizes Boswell's methodology and conclusions as disingenuous {{cite magazine|last=Shaw|first=Brent|author-link=Brent Shaw|date=July 1994|title=A Groom of One's Own?|magazine=[[The New Republic]]|pages=43–48|url=http://www.learnedhand.com/shaw_boswell.htm|access-date=25 June 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20060507014622/http://www.learnedhand.com/shaw_boswell.htm|archive-date=7 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; historian [[John Boswell]].&lt;ref name=boswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=John|title=Same-sex unions in premodern Europe|year=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-75164-9|pages=80–85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRL9cXA1m1IC|access-date=28 October 2020|archive-date=21 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200721182232/https://books.google.com/books?id=iRL9cXA1m1IC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were usually reported in a critical or satirical manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frier|first=Bruce|title=Roman Same-Sex Weddings from the Legal Perspective|url=http://www.umich.edu/~classics/news/newsletter/winter2004/weddings.html|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|access-date=25 September 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230041201/http://www.umich.edu/~classics/news/newsletter/winter2004/weddings.html|archive-date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Craig A. Williams, some Romans as early as the first century clearly did participate in formal ceremonies in which two males were married. These marriages were seen as atypical: Williams writes that "a marriage between two fully gendered 'men' was inconceivable; if two males were joined together, one of them had to be 'the woman.'"&lt;ref name="WilliamsRoman3"&gt;Williams, CA., ''Roman Homosexuality: Second Edition'', Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 279–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Roman emperor to have married a man was [[Nero]], who is reported to have married two other males on different occasions. The first was with one of Nero's own [[Freedman|freedmen]], [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]], with whom Nero took the role of the bride.&lt;ref name="WilliamsRoman"&gt;Williams, CA., ''Roman Homosexuality: Second Edition'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as a groom, Nero married [[Sporus]], a young boy, to replace his wife [[Poppaea Sabina]] following her death,&lt;ref name="dio-history-LXII-28"&gt;Nero missed her so greatly that, on learning of a woman who resembled her, he sent for her and kept her; but later he caused a boy of the freedmen, whom he used to call Sporus, ... "he formally "married" Sporus, and assigned the boy a regular dowry according to contract;" q.v., Suetonius ''Nero'' 28; Dio Cassius '' Epitome '' 62.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62.html |title=Bill Thayer's Web Site |website=Penelope.uchicago.edu |access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married him in a very public ceremony with all the solemnities of matrimony, after which Sporus was forced to pretend to be the female concubine that Nero had killed and act as though they were really married.&lt;ref name="dio-history-LXII-28"/&gt; A friend gave the "bride" away as required by law. The marriage was celebrated in both Greece and Rome in extravagant public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html |title=Cassius Dio — Epitome of Book 62 |website=Penelope.uchicago.edu |access-date=7 July 2017 |archive-date=11 October 2013 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131011215112/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Conubium'' existed only between a ''civis Romanus'' and a ''civis Romana'' (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citizen), so that a marriage between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases).&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, ''The Roman Law of Marriage'' (Oxford, 1969), pp. 24–28; Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), pp. 43–49.; "Marriages where the partners had ''conubium'' were marriages valid in Roman law (''iusta matrimonia'')" [Treggiari, p. 49]. Compare Ulpian (''Tituli Ulpiani'') 5.3–5: "''Conubium'' is the capacity to marry a wife in Roman law. Roman citizens have ''conubium'' with Roman citizens, but with Latins and foreigners only if the privilege was granted. There is no ''conubium'' with slaves"; compare also Gaius (''Institutionum'' 1:55–56, 67, 76–80).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Susan Treggiari, "''matrimonium'' was then an institution involving a mother, ''mater''. The idea implicit in the word is that a man took a woman in marriage, ''in matrimonium ducere'', so that he might have children by her."&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 342 AD, Christian emperors [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]] issued a law in the [[Theodosian Code]] (''C. Th.'' 9.7.3) prohibiting [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|marriage between same-sex couples in Rome]] and ordering execution for those so married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuefler|first=Mathew|year=2007|title=The Marriage Revolution in Late Antiquity: The Theodosian Code and Later Roman Marriage Law|journal=Journal of Family History|volume=32|pages=343–370|doi=10.1177/0363199007304424|issue=4|s2cid=143807895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Fontaine of Cornell University Classics Department has pointed out that there is no provision for marriage between same-sex couples in Roman Law, and the text from 342&amp;nbsp;CE is corrupt, "marries a woman" might be "goes to bed in a dishonorable manner with a man" as a condemnation of homosexual behavior between men.&lt;ref&gt;Eidolon, 2015, Michael Fontaine, Associate Professor of Classics and Assistant Dean, Cornell University "nubit…feminam" for "cubit...infamen," and the Law does not provide for it."&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians variously trace the beginning of the modern movement in support of same-sex marriage to anywhere from around the 1980s to the 1990s. In [[United States of America]] same-sex marriage became an official request of gay rights movement after the [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] in [[1987]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Same-Sex Marriage Came to Be|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/03/how-same-sex-marriage-came-to-be|website=[[Harvard Magazine]]|date=March–April 2013|access-date=28 March 2015|archive-date=2 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502173822/https://harvardmagazine.com/2013/03/how-same-sex-marriage-came-to-be|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The secret history of same-sex marriage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/23/-sp-secret-history-same-sex-marriage|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=26 July 2015|date=23 January 2015|archive-date=2 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502182628/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/23/-sp-secret-history-same-sex-marriage|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Denmark became the first country to legally recognize a relationship for same-sex couples, establishing [[registered partnership]]s, which gave those in same-sex relationships "most rights of married heterosexuals, but not the right to adopt or obtain joint custody of a child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rule|first=Sheila|title=Rights for Gay Couples in Denmark|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/02/world/rights-for-gay-couples-in-denmark.html|access-date=19 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 October 1989|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080523/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/02/world/rights-for-gay-couples-in-denmark.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|continental Netherlands]] became the first country to broaden marriage laws to include same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-2014-12-04" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/same-sex-marriage-around-the-world-1.799137|title=Same-sex marriage around the world|work=CBC News|location=Toronto|date=26 May 2009|access-date=6 October 2009|archive-date=25 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125125134/http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/05/26/f-same-sex-timeline.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, same-sex marriage has been established by law in 31 other countries, including most of the [[Americas]] and [[Western Europe]].

In other countries, constitutions have been adopted which have wording specifying that marriage is between a man and a woman, although, especially with the older constitutions, they were not necessarily worded with the intent to ban same-sex marriage.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

In 2010, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled in ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'', a case involving an Austrian same-sex couple who were denied the right to marry.&lt;ref name="CASE OF SCHALK AND KOPF v.

Furthermore, under European Convention of Human Rights, states are not obliged to allow same-sex marriage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avram |first=Marieta |date=2016 |title=Drept civil Familia |trans-title=Civil law Family |url= |language=Romanian |location=Bucharest |publisher=Editura Hamangiu |isbn=978-606-27-0609-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|text=The Court acknowledged that a number of Contracting States had extended marriage to same-sex partners, but went on to say that this reflected their own vision of the role of marriage in their societies and did not flow from an interpretation of the fundamental right as laid down by the Contracting States in the Convention in 1950.

On 5 June 2018, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled, in a case from [[Same-sex marriage in Romania|Romania]], that, under the specific conditions of the couple in question, married same-sex couples have the same residency rights as other married couples in an EU country, even if that country does not permit or recognize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apnews.com/561b1bb4ecff48b598eb1c2c20db2735 |title=EU court backs residency rights for gay couple in Romania – AP |website=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=6 June 2018 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142617/https://apnews.com/561b1bb4ecff48b598eb1c2c20db2735 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44366898 |title=Same-sex spouses have EU residence rights, top court rules – BBC |work=BBC News |date=5 June 2018 |access-date=6 June 2018 |archive-date=8 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508223531/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44366898 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ruling was not implemented in Romania and on 14 September 2021 the [[European Parliament]] passed a resolution calling on the [[European Commission]] to ensure that the ruling is respected across the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Texts adopted – LGBTIQ rights in the EU – Tuesday, 14 September 2021 |url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0366_EN.html |website=www.europarl.europa.eu |access-date=16 September 2021 |language=en |archive-date=16 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210916211040/https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0366_EN.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MEPs condemn failure to respect rights of same-sex partners in EU |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/14/meps-condemn-failure-respect-rights-same-sex-partners-eu |access-date=16 September 2021 |work=The Guardian |date=14 September 2021 |language=en |archive-date=14 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210914132153/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/14/meps-condemn-failure-respect-rights-same-sex-partners-eu |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inter-American Court of Human Rights ====
[[File:María Alexandra Chávez y Michelle Pamela Avilés - Primer matrimonio entre dos mujeres en Ecuador.jpg|thumb|right|Alexandra Chávez and Michelle Avilés, the first same-sex couple to marry in Ecuador]]
On 8 January 2018, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] (IACHR) ruled that the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] mandates and requires the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. The landmark ruling was fully binding on [[Same-sex marriage in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]] and set binding precedent in the other signatory countries. The Court recommended that governments issue temporary decrees recognizing same-sex marriage until new legislation is brought in. Among states without same-sex marriage, the ruling applies to [[LGBT rights in Barbados|Barbados]], [[LGBT rights in Bolivia|Bolivia]], the [[LGBT rights in the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], [[LGBT rights in El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[LGBT rights in Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[LGBT rights in Haiti|Haiti]], [[LGBT rights in Honduras|Honduras]], [[LGBT rights in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], [[LGBT rights in Panama|Panama]], [[LGBT rights in Paraguay|Paraguay]], [[LGBT rights in Peru|Peru]] and [[LGBT rights in Suriname|Suriname]].

The Court said that governments "must recognize and guarantee all the rights that are derived from a family bond between people of the same sex". They also said that it was inadmissible and discriminatory for a separate legal provision to be established (such as [[civil union]]s) instead of same-sex marriage. The Court demanded that governments "guarantee access to all existing forms of domestic legal systems, including the right to marriage, in order to ensure the protection of all the rights of families formed by same-sex couples without discrimination". Recognizing the difficulty in passing such laws in countries where there is strong opposition to same-sex marriage, it recommended that governments pass temporary decrees until new legislation is brought in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=25 January 2018|title="Major Advance for Marriage Equality and Gender Identity Rights in Latin America".

===International organizations===
The terms of employment of the staff of [[international organizations]] (not [[Business|commercial]]) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.

Despite their relative independence, few organizations recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the [[United Nations]] recognize same-sex marriages if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Secretary-General Bulletin|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/522/40/PDF/N0452240.pdf|publisher=United Nations|access-date=25 September 2012|archive-date=12 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112161154/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/522/40/PDF/N0452240.pdf|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to mixed-sex married couples to de facto partners or [[domestic partner]]s of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into a mixed-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the [[World Bank]] does recognize domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTHRJOBS/0,,contentMDK:20522360~menuPK:1353209~pagePK:64262408~piPK:64262191~theSitePK:1058433,00.html|title=Jobs&amp;nbsp;— Compensation &amp; Benefits|publisher=The World Bank Group|access-date=8 March 2007|archive-date=7 March 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307114604/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTHRJOBS/0,,contentMDK:20522360~menuPK:1353209~pagePK:64262408~piPK:64262191~theSitePK:1058433,00.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female same-sex marriage is practiced among the [[Gikuyu people|Gikuyu]], [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Kamba people|Kamba]], [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], and to a lesser extent neighboring peoples. About 5–10% of women are in such marriages.

=== Adolescence ===
A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among school students in grades 9–12 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among high schoolers of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9–12 declined by 14% in states that established same-sex marriage, resulting in about 134,000 fewer attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among youth in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among youth in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among teenage youth occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="JAMA"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Raifman|first1=Julia|last2=Moscoe|first2=Ellen|last3=Austin|first3=S.

Professional organizations of psychologists have concluded that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents' relationship is recognized and supported by society's institutions, e.g. civil marriage. For example, the [[Canadian Psychological Association]] (CPA) stated in 2006 that "parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union."&lt;ref name="cpa2006" /&gt; The CPA has stated that the stress encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent.&lt;ref name="cpa2006" /&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded in 2006, in an analysis published in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'':{{blockquote|There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment... The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;}}

===Health===

The [[American Psychological Association]] stated in 2004: "Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status and so on." It has also averred that same-sex couples who may only enter into a civil union, as opposed to a marriage, "are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to those of married couples", which has adverse effects on the well-being of same-sex partners.&lt;ref name="psychological"&gt;{{cite web|author=American Psychological Association|author-link=American Psychological Association|year=2004|title=Resolution on Sexual Orientation and Marriage|url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511190536/http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf|archive-date=11 May 2011|access-date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2006}}, the data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.&lt;ref name="aap2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Herek, Gregory M.

Scientific literature indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union (either a mixed-sex or same-sex union).

All states that allow same-sex marriage also allow the joint [[adoption]] of children by those couples with the exceptions of Ecuador, Taiwan, and a third of states in Mexico; in Taiwan, only step-child adoption of biological children is allowed; in the others, no adoption is allowed, though such restrictions have been ruled unconstitutional in Mexico. In addition, [[Andorra]] and [[Israel]], which do not recognize same-sex marriage nonetheless permit joint adoption by unmarried same-sex couples. Some additional states that do not recognize same-sex marriage allow stepchild adoption by couples in civil unions: [[Croatia]], [[Estonia]], [[Italy]] (on a case-by-case basis) and [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://euroclashblog.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/austrian-court-rules-to-allow-same-sex-adoptions/|title=Austrian court rules to allow same-sex adoptions|website=The Privateer|date=16 January 2016|access-date=8 October 2017|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222315/https://euroclashblog.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/austrian-court-rules-to-allow-same-sex-adoptions/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, more than 16,000 same-sex couples were raising an estimated 22,000 adopted children in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LGBT Adoption Statistics|url=http://www.lifelongadoptions.com/lgbt-adoption/lgbt-adoption-statistics|website=lifelongadoptions.com|access-date=13 February 2016|archive-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429011127/https://www.lifelongadoptions.com/lgbt-adoption/lgbt-adoption-statistics|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4% of all adopted children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Families are created with love|url=http://gayadoption.org/facts-supporting-gay-adoption|website=gayadoption.org|access-date=13 February 2016|archive-date=6 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306081250/http://gayadoption.org/facts-supporting-gay-adoption/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Surrogacy and IVF treatment====

A gay or bisexual man has the option of [[surrogacy]], the process in which a woman bears a child for another person through [[artificial insemination]] or carries another woman's surgically implanted [[fertilized egg]] to birth.

===Transgender and intersex people===
{{synthesis|date=May 2017}}
{{See also|Transgender rights|Intersex human rights}}
The legal status of same-sex marriage may have implications for the marriages of couples in which one or both parties are [[transgender]], depending on how sex is defined within a jurisdiction. Transgender and [[intersex]] individuals may be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. "Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality." ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' 38.5 (October 2009): 688–701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the ''[[Gender Recognition Act 2004]]'' allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person had to dissolve their civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their [[legal sex]] marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage|publisher=365gay.com|date=5 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|archive-date=17 October 2007|access-date=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. A similar provision including sterilization also existed in Sweden, but was phased out in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/sweden-ends-forced-sterilization-trans110113|title=Sweden ends forced sterilization of trans|date=11 January 2013|website=gaystarnews.com|access-date=10 October 2017|archive-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612234631/https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/sweden-ends-forced-sterilization-trans110113/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, transgender and intersex marriages was subject to legal complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deborah |first1=Anthony |title=CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE: TRANSSEXUAL MARRIAGE AND THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN SEX AND LEGAL SEX. |journal=Texas Journal of Women &amp; the Law |date=Spring 2012 |volume=21 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19brfs-USDEFENDSMAR_BRF.html|title=U.S. Defends Marriage Law|work=The New York Times|date=18 September 2009|access-date=29 September 2009|archive-date=14 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714172436/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19brfs-USDEFENDSMAR_BRF.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some of them prohibit legal changes of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps|title=Movement Advancement Project {{!}} Equality Maps|website=www.lgbtmap.org|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19|archive-date=22 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190422164047/http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce===
{{Main|Divorce of same-sex couples}}
In the United States before the case of ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'', couples in same-sex marriages could only obtain a divorce in jurisdictions that recognized same-sex marriages, with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthew S. Coleman, Esq.|title=Obergefell v. Hodges|url=http://www.einhornharris.com/familylawblog/obergefell-v-hodges|publisher=Einhorn Harris|access-date=8 November 2015|date=16 September 2015|archive-date=24 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224103921/http://www.einhornharris.com/familylawblog/obergefell-v-hodges/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial and legislative===
{{Main|Conflict of marriage laws#Same-sex marriage}}
There are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A "[[direct democracy|majority rules]]" position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|title=Poll: Calif. gay marriage ban driven by religion|author=Leff, Lisa|agency=Associated Press|date=4 December 2008|work=USA Today|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208080418/http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|archive-date=8 December 2008}} archived here.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a [[civil rights]] view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7723645.stm|title=Divisions persist over gay marriage ban|author=Mirchandani, Rajesh|work=BBC News|date=12 November 2008|access-date=18 December 2008|archive-date=28 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428173747/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7723645.stm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous polls and studies on the issue have been conducted. A trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage has been revealed across many countries of the world, often driven in large part by a generational difference in support. Polling that was conducted in developed democracies in this century shows a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage. Support for same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.&lt;ref name="Gallup2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Newport|first=Frank|title=For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage|date=20 May 2011|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/First-Time-Majority-Americans-Favor-Legal-Gay-Marriage.aspx|access-date=25 September 2012|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|archive-date=29 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729043935/http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/First-Time-Majority-Americans-Favor-Legal-Gay-Marriage.aspx|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Opinion: Nationally|url=http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303043929/http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality/|archive-date=3 March 2011|access-date=25 September 2012|publisher=australianmarriageequality.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Life in Estonia|url=http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716100828/http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia|archive-date=16 July 2012|access-date=25 September 2012|publisher=globalgayz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jowit|first=Juliette|date=12 June 2012|title=Gay marriage gets ministerial approval|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/12/gay-marriage-receive-ministerial-approval|access-date=25 September 2012|archive-date=6 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506173542/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/12/gay-marriage-receive-ministerial-approval|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 February 2011|title=Most Irish people support gay marriage, poll says|newspaper=PinkNews|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/24/most-irish-people-support-gay-marriage-poll-says|url-status=dead|access-date=25 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926032112/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/24/most-irish-people-support-gay-marriage-poll-says|archive-date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update inline|date=December 2021}}
