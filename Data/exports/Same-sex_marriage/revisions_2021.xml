'''Same-sex marriage''', also known as '''gay marriage''' or '''homosexual marriage''', is the [[marriage]] of two people of the same [[sex]] or [[gender]]. There are records of same-sex marriage dating back to the [[1st century|first century]]. In the modern era, marriage equality for same-sex couples was first legally acknowledged in the [[Netherlands]] on [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|1 April 2001]].

{{As of|2021 |post=,}} same-sex marriage is legally performed and recognized in 29 countries (nationwide or in some jurisdictions) with the most recent being [[Same-sex marriage in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]] (2020). [[Same-sex marriage in Switzerland|Switzerland]] held a referendum on 26 September 2021 that returned a 64% yes-vote, which will allow same-sex couples to marry starting 1 July 2022.

In contrast, 33 countries (as of 2021) have gendered definitions of marriage in their constitutions that prevent same-sex marriage, most enacted in recent decades as a preventative measure. Some other countries have constitutionally mandated [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which is generally interpreted as prohibiting same-sex marriage. In half a dozen of the former and most of the latter, homosexuality itself [[Sodomy law|is criminalized]].

The application of [[marriage law]] equally to same-sex and opposite-sex couples (called '''marriage equality''') has varied by jurisdiction, and has come about through legislative change to marriage law, court rulings based on constitutional guarantees of equality, recognition that same-sex marriage is allowed by existing marriage law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koco.com/news/oklahomanews/around-oklahoma/samesex-oklahoma-couple-marries-legally-under-tribal-law/-/12530084/22553184/-/101ihp0z/-/index.html |title=Same-sex Oklahoma couple marries legally under tribal law |publisher=KOCO |date=26 September 2013 |access-date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by direct popular vote (via [[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s). The recognition of same-sex marriage is considered to be a [[human rights|human right]] and a [[civil rights|civil right]] as well as a political, social, and religious issue.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

[[#Public opinion|Polls consistently show]] continually rising support for the recognition of same-sex marriage in all developed democracies and in some developing democracies.

Scientific studies show that the financial, psychological, and physical well-being of gay people are enhanced by marriage, and that the children of same-sex parents benefit from being raised by married same-sex couples within a marital union that is recognized by law and supported by societal institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources:

==Terminology==
===Alternative terms===
Some proponents of the legal recognition of same-sex marriage—such as [[Marriage Equality USA]] (founded in 1998), [[Freedom to Marry]] (founded in 2003), and [[Canadians for Equal Marriage]]—have long used the terms ''marriage equality'' and ''equal marriage'' to signal that their goal was for same-sex marriage to be recognized on equal ground with opposite-sex marriage. Opponents of same-sex marriage, by contrast, characterized gay couples as seeking "[[special rights]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/issues/marriageequality/|title=Marriage Equality|publisher=Garden State Equality|access-date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/marriage-101#faq3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216021129/http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/marriage-101#faq3|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 February 2010|title=Marriage 101|publisher=[[Freedom to Marry]]|access-date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:AENN&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=13F21B414EDA8168&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46|title=Albany area real estate and the Marriage Equality Act|date=29 May 2012|work=Albany Examiner|access-date=25 December 2012|author=Pratt, Patricia|quote=On July 24, 2011 the Marriage Equality Act became a law in New York State forever changing the state's legal view of what a married couple is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote on Illinois marriage equality bill coming in January: sponsors|url=http://chicagophoenix.com/2012/12/13/illinois-marriage-equality-vote-january|access-date=23 December 2012|newspaper=Chicago Phoenix|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission endorses marriage and adoption equality|url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/human-rights-environment/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity/commission-endorses-marriage-and-adoption-equality|publisher=Human Right Commission New Zealand|access-date=23 December 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202132031/http://www.hrc.co.nz/human-rights-environment/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity/commission-endorses-marriage-and-adoption-equality|archive-date=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulholland|first=Helene|title=Ed Miliband calls for gay marriage equality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/27/ed-miliband-gay-wedding-equality|access-date=23 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London, UK|date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ring"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2012/12/20/newt-gingrich-accepts-marriage-equality-inevitable|title=Newt Gingrich: Marriage Equality Inevitable, OK|author=Ring, Trudy|work=The Advocate|location=Los Angeles|date=20 December 2012|quote=He [Newt Gingrich] noted to HuffPo that he not only has a lesbian half-sister, LGBT rights activist Candace Gingrich, but has gay friends who've gotten married in Iowa, where their unions are legal.

The [[AP Stylebook]] recommends the usage of the phrase ''marriage for gays and lesbians'' or the term ''gay marriage'' in space-limited headlines. The [[Associated Press]] warns that the construct ''gay marriage'' can imply that the marriages of same-sex couples are somehow different from the marriages of opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Robyn|title=When I Get Married, Will It Be a 'Gay Marriage'?|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/robyn-harper/marriage-equality_b_1572611.html|access-date=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper |first=Robyn |title=My Marriage Won't Be a 'Gay Marriage' |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/my-marriage-wont-gay-marriage-11514384.html?cat=41|access-date=28 September 2012|publisher=Yahoo!|date=30 June 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928202736/http://voices.yahoo.com/my-marriage-wont-gay-marriage-11514384.html?cat=41|archive-date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With several countries revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their definition of the word marriage to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dictionaries take lead in redefining modern marriage|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/24/20040524-103201-1169r|access-date=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=24 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite web|title=Webster Makes It Official: Definition of Marriage Has Changed|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/webster_makes_it_official_definition_of_marriage_has_changed|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|access-date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Redman|first=Daniel|title=Noah Webster Gives His Blessing: Dictionaries recognize same-sex marriage—who knew?|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2215628|access-date=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of same-sex marriage who want marriage to be restricted to pairings of a man and a woman, such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], use the term ''traditional marriage'' to mean opposite-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="religion"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Divine Institution of Marriage|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/the-divine-institution-of-marriage|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]|access-date=28 September 2012|date=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=23282|work=Baptist Press|title=Marriage Protection Sunday: Churches encouraged to address 'gay marriage'|date=19 May 2006|access-date=30 September 2011|archive-date=26 July 2014|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6RMM7eFRS?url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=23282|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of same-sex unions|Timeline of same-sex marriage|History of homosexuality}}

===Ancient===
A reference to same-sex marriage appears in the [[Sifra]], which was written in the 3rd century CE. The [[Book of Leviticus]] prohibited homosexual relations, and the Hebrews were warned not to "follow the acts of the land of Egypt or the acts of the land of Canaan" (Lev. 18:22, 20:13). The Sifra clarifies what these ambiguous "acts" were, and that they included same-sex marriage: "A man would marry a man and a woman a woman, a man would marry a woman and her daughter, and a woman would be married to two men."&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Joel Roth.

The first Roman emperor to have married a man was [[Nero]], who is reported to have married two other males on different occasions. The first was with one of Nero's own [[Freedman|freedmen]], [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]], with whom Nero took the role of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, CA., ''Roman Homosexuality: Second Edition'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, as a groom, Nero married [[Sporus]], a young boy, to replace the adolescent female concubine he had killed&lt;ref name="dio-history-LXII-28"&gt;Nero missed her so greatly that, on learning of a woman who resembled her, he sent for her and kept her; but later he caused a boy of the freedmen, whom he used to call Sporus, ... "he formally "married" Sporus, and assigned the boy a regular dowry according to contract;" q.v., Suetonius ''Nero'' 28; Dio Cassius '' Epitome '' 62.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62.html |title=Bill Thayer's Web Site |website=Penelope.uchicago.edu |access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married him in a very public ceremony with all the solemnities of matrimony, after which Sporus was forced to pretend to be the female concubine that Nero had killed and act as though they were really married.&lt;ref name="dio-history-LXII-28"/&gt; A friend gave the "bride" away as required by law. The marriage was celebrated in both Greece and Rome in extravagant public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html |title=Cassius Dio — Epitome of Book 62 |website=Penelope.uchicago.edu |access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Conubium'' existed only between a ''civis Romanus'' and a ''civis Romana'' (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citizen), so that a marriage between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases).&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, ''The Roman Law of Marriage'' (Oxford, 1969), pp. 24–28; Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), pp. 43–49.; "Marriages where the partners had ''conubium'' were marriages valid in Roman law (''iusta matrimonia'')" [Treggiari, p. 49]. Compare Ulpian (''Tituli Ulpiani'') 5.3–5: "''Conubium'' is the capacity to marry a wife in Roman law. Roman citizens have ''conubium'' with Roman citizens, but with Latins and foreigners only if the privilege was granted. There is no ''conubium'' with slaves"; compare also Gaius (''Institutionum'' 1:55–56, 67, 76–80).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Susan Treggiari, "''matrimonium'' was then an institution involving a mother, ''mater''. The idea implicit in the word is that a man took a woman in marriage, ''in matrimonium ducere'', so that he might have children by her."&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 342 AD, Christian emperors [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]] issued a law in the [[Theodosian Code]] (''C. Th.'' 9.7.3) prohibiting [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|same-sex marriage in Rome]] and ordering execution for those so married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuefler|first=Mathew|year=2007|title=The Marriage Revolution in Late Antiquity: The Theodosian Code and Later Roman Marriage Law|journal=Journal of Family History|volume=32|pages=343–370|doi=10.1177/0363199007304424|issue=4|s2cid=143807895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Fontaine of Cornell University Classics Department has pointed out that there is no provision for same-sex marriage in Roman Law, and the text from 342&amp;nbsp;CE is corrupt, "marries a woman" might be "goes to bed in a dishonorable manner with a man" as a condemnation of homosexual behavior between men.&lt;ref&gt;Eidolon, 2015, Michael Fontaine, Associate Professor of Classics and Assistant Dean, Cornell University "nubit…feminam" for "cubit...infamen," and the Law does not provide for it."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boxer Codex]], dated 1590, records the normality and acceptance of same-sex marriage in the native cultures of the [[Philippines]] prior to colonization.&lt;ref&gt;George Bryan Souza.

===Contemporary===
Historians variously trace the beginning of the modern movement in support of same-sex marriage to anywhere from around the 1980s to the 1990s. In [[United States of America]] same sex marriage became an official request of gay rights movement after the [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] in [[1987]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Same-Sex Marriage Came to Be|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/03/how-same-sex-marriage-came-to-be|website=[[Harvard Magazine]]|date=March–April 2013|access-date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The secret history of same-sex marriage|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/23/-sp-secret-history-same-sex-marriage|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=26 July 2015|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Denmark became the first country to legally recognize a relationship for same-sex couples, establishing [[registered partnership]]s, which gave those in same-sex relationships "most rights of married heterosexuals, but not the right to adopt or obtain joint custody of a child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rule|first=Sheila|title=Rights for Gay Couples in Denmark|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/02/world/rights-for-gay-couples-in-denmark.html|access-date=19 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|metropolitan Netherlands]] became the first country to establish same-sex marriage by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/same-sex-marriage-around-the-world-1.799137|title=Same-sex marriage around the world|work=CBC News|location=Toronto|date=26 May 2009|access-date=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, same-sex marriage has also been established by law in 28 other countries, including most of the [[Americas]] and [[Western Europe]]. Yet its spread has been uneven — [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] is the only country in [[LGBT rights in Africa|Africa]] to take the step; [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|Taiwan]] is the only one in [[LGBT rights in Asia|Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/europe-africa-netherlands-job-cohen-western-europe-e08b053af367028737c9c41c492cc568|title = The Dutch went first in 2001; who has same-sex marriage now?|website = [[Associated Press]]|date = 28 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International court rulings===

==== European Court of Human Rights ====
In 2010, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled in ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'', a case involving an Austrian same-sex couple who were denied the right to marry.&lt;ref name="CASE OF SCHALK AND KOPF v. AUSTRIA"&gt;{{cite web|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-99605|access-date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court found, by a vote of 4 to 3, that their human rights had not been violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buyse|first=Antoine|date=24 June 2010|title=Strasbourg court rules that states are not obliged to allow gay marriage|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/jun/24/european-court-of-human-rights-civil-partnerships|access-date=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court further stated that same-sex unions are not protected under art. 12 of ECHR ("Right to marry"), which exclusively protects the right to marry of opposite-sex couples (without regard if the sex of the partners is the result of birth or of sex change), but they are protected under art. 8 of ECHR ("Right to respect for private and family life") and art. 14 ("Prohibition of discrimination"). Furthermore, under European Convention of Human Rights, states are not obliged to allow same-sex marriage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avram |first=Marieta |date=2016 |title=Drept civil Familia |trans-title=Civil law Family |url= |language=Romanian |location=Bucharest |publisher=Editura Hamangiu |isbn=978-606-27-0609-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|text=The Court acknowledged that a number of Contracting States had extended marriage to same-sex partners, but went on to say that this reflected their own vision of the role of marriage in their societies and did not flow from an interpretation of the fundamental right as laid down by the Contracting States in the Convention in 1950. The Court concluded that it fell within the State’s margin of appreciation as to how to regulate the effects of the change of gender on pre-existing marriages.|author=European Court of Human Rights, Schalk and Kopf v Austria&lt;ref name="CASE OF SCHALK AND KOPF v.

However, the ECHR stated in ''Schalk and Kopf v Austria'' that this provision was intended to limit marriage to heterosexual relationships, as it used the term "men and women" instead of "everyone".&lt;ref name="CASE OF SCHALK AND KOPF v.

{{further|Coman and Others v General Inspectorate for Immigration and Ministry of the Interior}}
On 5 June 2018, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled, in a case from [[Same-sex marriage in Romania|Romania]], that, under the specific conditions of the couple in question, married same-sex couples have the same residency rights as other married couples in an EU country, even if that country does not permit or recognize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apnews.com/561b1bb4ecff48b598eb1c2c20db2735 EU court backs residency rights for gay couple in Romania – AP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44366898 Same-sex spouses have EU residence rights, top court rules – BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ruling was not implemented in Romania and on 14 September 2021 the [[European Parliament]] passed a resolution calling on the [[European Commission]] to ensure that the ruling is respected across the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Texts adopted - LGBTIQ rights in the EU - Tuesday, 14 September 2021 |url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0366_EN.html |website=www.europarl.europa.eu |access-date=16 September 2021 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MEPs condemn failure to respect rights of same-sex partners in EU |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/14/meps-condemn-failure-respect-rights-same-sex-partners-eu |access-date=16 September 2021 |work=the Guardian |date=14 September 2021 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inter-American Court of Human Rights ====
On 8 January 2018, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] (IACHR) ruled that the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] mandates and requires the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. The landmark ruling was fully binding on [[Same-sex marriage in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]] and set binding precedent in the other signatory countries. The Court recommended that governments issue temporary decrees recognizing same-sex marriage until new legislation is brought in. The ruling applies to [[LGBT rights in Barbados|Barbados]], [[LGBT rights in Bolivia|Bolivia]], Chile, Costa Rica, the [[LGBT rights in the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[LGBT rights in El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[LGBT rights in Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[LGBT rights in Haiti|Haiti]], [[LGBT rights in Honduras|Honduras]], [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico|Mexico]], [[LGBT rights in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], [[LGBT rights in Panama|Panama]], [[LGBT rights in Paraguay|Paraguay]], [[LGBT rights in Peru|Peru]] and [[LGBT rights in Suriname|Suriname]].

The Court said that governments "must recognize and guarantee all the rights that are derived from a family bond between people of the same sex". They also said that it was inadmissible and discriminatory for a separate legal provision to be established (such as [[civil union]]s) instead of same-sex marriage. The Court demanded that governments "guarantee access to all existing forms of domestic legal systems, including the right to marriage, in order to ensure the protection of all the rights of families formed by same-sex couples without discrimination". Recognizing the difficulty in passing such laws in countries where there is strong opposition to same-sex marriage, it recommended that governments pass temporary decrees until new legislation is brought in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=25 January 2018|title="Major Advance for Marriage Equality and Gender Identity Rights in Latin America".

The ruling has directly led to the legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Costa Rica and Ecuador. In the wake of the ruling, lawsuits regarding same-sex marriage have also been filed in Bolivia, Honduras,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wockner.blogspot.com/2018/06/worldwide-marriage-equality-watch-list.html?m=1 Worldwide Marriage Equality Watch List]&lt;/ref&gt; Panama,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/02/16/panama-supreme-court-judge-withdraws-draft-ruling-marriage/ Panama Supreme Court judge withdraws draft ruling against marriage]&lt;/ref&gt; Paraguay (to recognize marriages performed abroad),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=12 January 2018|title=LGTBI anuncia presión a Corte para aceptar unión igualitaria y habrá 'guerra'|publisher=Hoy (Paraguay)|url=http://www.hoy.com.py/nacionales/lgtbi-anuncia-presin-a-corte-para-aceptar-unin-igualitaria-y-habr-guerra|access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peru,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpp.pe/lima/actualidad/tribunal-constitucional-debate-reconocimiento-de-matrimonio-gay-noticia-1130829 Tribunal Constitucional debate reconocimiento de matrimonio gay realizado en México]&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are under the jurisdiction of the IACHR.

On 15 July 2010, the [[Argentine Senate]] approved a bill extending marriage rights to same-sex couples.

Australia became the second nation in [[Oceania]] to legally recognize same-sex marriage when the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] passed a bill on 7 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-07/same-sex-marriage-bill-passes-house-of-representatives/9235560|title=Same-sex marriage bill passes House of Representatives, paving way for first gay weddings|website=ABC News|date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill received [[royal assent]] on 8 December, and took effect on 9 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-08/same-sex-marriage-legal-after-gg-approval/9239334|title=Same-sex marriage signed into law by Governor-General, first weddings to happen from January 9|website=ABC News|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ausleg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017A00129|title=Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017|date=9 December 2017|website=Federal Register of Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law removed the ban on same-sex marriage that previously existed and followed a [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey|voluntary postal survey]] held from 12 September to 7 November 2017, which returned a 61.6% ''Yes'' vote for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/15/australia-says-yes-to-same-sex-marriage-in-historic-postal-survey|title=Australia says yes to same-sex marriage in historic postal survey|date=15 November 2017|journal=The Guardian|last1=Karp|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same legislation provided for same-sex marriage in all of Australia's [[States and territories of Australia|external territories]].&lt;ref name=Ausleg/&gt;

====Austria====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Austria}}
Since 1 January 2010, same-sex couples have been allowed to enter registered partnerships (''Eingetragene Partnerschaft'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/austrian-embassy-london/service-for-citizens/civil-status-family/registered-civil-partnerships/|title=Registered (civil) partnerships – Österreichische Botschaft London|first=Außenministerium der Republik|last=Österreich|website=www.bmeia.gv.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, the Vienna Administrative Court dismissed a case challenging the same-sex marriage ban. The plaintiffs appealed to the Constitutional Court, which struck down the ban on same-sex marriage as [[unconstitutional]] on 5 December 2017, with effect from 1 January 2019. The Court also decided that [[civil union]]s will be open for both same-sex and different-sex couples from that date onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vfgh.gv.at/downloads/VfGH_G_258-2017_Press_release_same-sex_marriage.pdf|title=Press release from the Austrian constitution court|date=5 December 2017|work=Distinction between marriage and registered partnership violates ban on discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsche Welle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/gay-marriage-in-austria-approved-by-constitutional-court/a-41654156|title=Gay marriage in Austria approved by Constitutional Court|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=5 December 2017|access-date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgium became the second country in the world to legally recognize same-sex marriages when a bill passed by the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]] took effect on 1 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2003/01/31/Belgium-legalizes-gay-marriage/UPI-46741044012415/|title=Belgium legalizes gay marriage|publisher=UPI|date=31 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, Belgium allowed the marriages of foreign same-sex couples only if their country of origin also allowed these unions, however legislation enacted in October 2004 permits any couple to marry if at least one of the spouses has lived in the country for a minimum of three months. A 2006 statute legalized [[LGBT adoption|adoption by same-sex spouses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euronews.net/2005/12/02/belgium-moves-to-allow-gay-adoption/|title=Belgium moves to allow gay adoption|publisher=Euronews|date=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Brazil}}
{{Same-sex marriage map South America|align=left}}
On 14 May 2013, the Justice's [[National Justice Council|National Council of Brazil]] legally recognized same-sex marriage in the entire country in a 14–1 vote by issuing a ruling that orders all civil registers of the country to perform same-sex marriages and convert any existing civil union into a marriage, if the couple wish so. The ruling was published on 15 May and took effect on 16 May 2013.

[[Supreme Federal Court|Brazil's Supreme Court]] ruled in May 2011 that same-sex couples are legally entitled to legal recognition of stable unions (known as {{lang|pt|união estável}}), one of the two possible family entities in Brazilian legislation. It includes almost all of the rights available to married couples in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazil's supreme court recognizes gay partnerships|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-gayrights-idUSTRE74503V20110506|access-date=16 February 2012|work=Reuters|date=5 May 2011|archive-date=24 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024123240/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/06/us-brazil-gayrights-idUSTRE74503V20110506|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between mid-2011 and May 2013, same-sex couples had their cohabitation issues converted into marriages in several Brazil states with the approval of a state judge. All legal Brazilian marriages were always recognized all over Brazil.&lt;ref name="WPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/brazil-judge-approves-what-appears-to-be-countrys-first-gay-marriage-between-2-men/2011/06/27/AGYN2znH_story.html|title=Brazilian judge gives male couple approval for what court says is country's first gay marriage|date=27 June 2011|work=The Washington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911044643/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/brazil-judge-approves-what-appears-to-be-countrys-first-gay-marriage-between-2-men/2011/06/27/AGYN2znH_story.html|archive-date=11 September 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision paved the way for future legislation on same-sex matrimonial rights. Before the nationwide legislation, the states of [[Same-sex marriage in Alagoas|Alagoas]], [[Bahia]], [[Ceará]], [[Espírito Santo]], the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Paraíba]], [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], [[Piauí]], [[Rondônia]], [[Same-sex marriage in Santa Catarina|Santa Catarina]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], and [[Sergipe]], as well as the city of [[Santa Rita do Sapucaí]] (MG), had already allowed same-sex marriages and several unions were converted into full [[marriage]]s by state judges. In [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], same-sex couples could also marry but only if local judges agreed with their request.

In March 2013, polls suggested that 47% of Brazilians supported marriage equalization and 57% supported adoption equalization for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portugues.christianpost.com/news/quase-metade-dos-internautas-brasileiros-aprova-o-casamento-gay-15398/ Almost half of Brazilian internet users support gay marriage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926082310/http://portugues.christianpost.com/news/quase-metade-dos-internautas-brasileiros-aprova-o-casamento-gay-15398/ |date=26 September 2013 }}, christianpost.com; accessed 5 July 2017. {{in lang|pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Canada}}
Legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Canada followed a series of constitutional challenges based on the [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|equality provisions]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. In the first such case, ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'', same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in [[Same-sex marriage in Ontario|Ontario]] on 14 January 2001 were subsequently validated when the [[common law]], mixed-sex definition of marriage was held to be unconstitutional. Similar rulings had already legally recognized same-sex marriage in eight provinces and one territory when the ''2005 [[Civil Marriage Act]]'' defined marriage throughout Canada as "the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others".

====Colombia====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Colombia}}

In February 2007, a series of rulings by the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia|Constitutional Court]] meant that same-sex couples could apply for all the rights that heterosexual couples have in ''de facto marital unions'' (''uniones maritales de hecho'').&lt;ref name="2009 ruling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-029-2009.pdf|title=Decision C-029 of 2009|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-10938.html Colombian court confirms equal rights for same-sex couples], Pink News, 30 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2011, the Constitutional Court of Colombia ordered the Congress to pass legislation giving same-sex couples similar rights to marriage by 20 June 2013. If such a law were not passed by then, same-sex couples would be granted these rights automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-577-2011.pdf|title=DECISION C-577/11 The homosexuals have the right to form a family|access-date=7 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429010946/http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-577-2011.pdf|archive-date=29 April 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/07/27/colombia.gay.marriage/|work=CNN| title=Colombian court says Congress must decide on gay marriage|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress failed to pass same-sex marriage legislation, but the civil registries did not begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-colombia-gaymarriage-idUKBRE93N1EJ20130424|work=Reuters |title=Colombia lawmakers reject controversial gay marriage bill | date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2013, a civil court judge in [[Bogotá]] declared a same-sex couple legally married, after a ruling on 11 July 2013 accepting the petition. This was the first same-sex couple married in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|es}} [http://www.caracol.com.co/judiciales/juez-aplica-norma-del-matrimonio-civil-a-pareja-gay-y-cita-a-contrayentes-con-dos-testigos/20131107/nota/1931472.aspx Juez aplica norma del matrimonio civil a pareja gay y cita a contrayentes con dos testigos] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130713025006/http://www.caracol.com.co/judiciales/juez-aplica-norma-del-matrimonio-civil-a-pareja-gay-y-cita-a-contrayentes-con-dos-testigos/20131107/nota/1931472.aspx |date=13 July 2013 }}.

In September 2013, two civil court judges married two same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew |last=Potts |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/judges-allow-first-same-sex-marriages-colombia011013 |title=Judges allow first same-sex marriages in Colombia |publisher=Gay Star News |date=1 October 2013 |access-date=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first marriage was challenged by a conservative group, and it was initially annulled. Nevertheless, in October, a High Court (Tribunal Supremo de Bogotá) maintained the validity of that marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/tribunal-superior-de-bogota-rechaza-tutela-contra-matrimonio-gay_13142227-4 |title=Rechazan tutela que tumbaba primer matrimonio gay en el país |publisher=Eltiempo.Com |date=24 October 2013 |access-date=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmi.com.co/?n=118476 |title=CM&amp; la noticia |access-date=26 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016144837/http://www.cmi.com.co/?n=118476 |archive-date=16 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 2016, the legal uncertainty around same-sex unions was resolved when the Constitutional Court ruled that same-sex couples are allowed to enter into civil marriages in the country and that judges and notaries are barred from refusing to perform same-sex weddings.&lt;ref name="April 28, 2016 ruling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/politica/justicia/matrimonio-gay-corte-constitucional-le-daria-el-si-definitivo/16575865|title=Corte Constitucional da el sí definitivo y avala el matrimonio gay - Justicia - El Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|last=Tiempo|website=eltiempo.com|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/colombia-legalizes-same-sex-marriage/a-19223822|title=Colombia legalizes same-sex marriage|website=Deutsche Welle|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wradio.com.co/noticias/actualidad/corte-legaliza-el-matrimonio-entre-parejas-del-mismo-sexo/20160428/nota/3119179.aspx|title=Corte legaliza el matrimonio entre parejas del mismo sexo|date=28 April 2016|website=W Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costa Rica====

{{main|Same-sex marriage in Costa Rica}}

On 10 February 2016, the [[Supreme Court of Costa Rica|Constitutional Court of Costa Rica]] announced it would hear a case seeking to legally recognize same-sex marriage in Costa Rica and declare the country's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameliarueda.com/nota/sala-estudio-recursos-de-inconsticuionalidad-prohibicion-matrimonio-gay|title=Sala IV admite para estudio 2 recursos de inconstitucionalidad contra prohibición de matrimonio gay - AmeliaRueda.com|website=ameliarueda.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] (IACHR) issued an Advisory Opinion (AO 24/17) regarding issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity, stating that the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] includes the recognition of same-sex marriage, in a case brought by the government of Costa Rica.

In the [[2018 Costa Rican general election]], the IACHR ruling on same-sex marriage became a prominent issue. [[Carlos Alvarado Quesada]], who supports LGBT rights and favors the implementation of the ruling, won the election with 60.7% of the vote, defeating by wide margin [[Fabricio Alvarado]], a vocal opponent of LGBT rights who was against the implementation of the ruling. On 8 August 2018, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica|Supreme Court of Costa Rica]] ruled that the prohibition of same-sex marriage in the Family Code is unconstitutional, giving Congress 18 months to reform the law or the prohibition will be automatically lifted. As the Congress did not act, same-sex marriage in Costa Rica became legal on 26 May 2020 in line with the court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-25/costa-rica-latest-country-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage|title=Costa Rica is the latest country to legalize same-sex marriage|publisher=Los Angeles Time|date=26 May 2020|access-date=27 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Denmark}}
On 25 May 1989, Denmark became the first country to legally recognize registered partnerships between same-sex couples. A registered partnership was the same as a civil marriage, but was not seen as marriage in the eyes of the church.&lt;ref name="Sabinsky_5/24/2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=SABINSKY | first=SONJA | title=Da Danmark skrev verdenshistorie | website=Jydske Vestkysten | date=24 May 2014 | url=https://www.jv.dk/livsstil/Da-Danmark-skrev-verdenshistorie/artikel/1750195 | language=no | access-date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2012, the [[Folketing]] (Danish Parliament) approved new laws regarding same-sex civil and religious marriage. These laws permit same-sex couples to get married in the [[Church of Denmark]]. The bills received [[royal assent]] on 12 June and took effect on 15 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanners |first=Peter |title=Gay marriage legalised |url=http://cphpost.dk/news/national/updated-gay-marriage-legalised |access-date=25 September 2012 |newspaper=The Copenhagen Post |date=7 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818162542/http://cphpost.dk/news/national/updated-gay-marriage-legalised |archive-date=18 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in France}}
Since November 1999, France has had a [[civil union]] scheme known as a [[civil solidarity pact]] that is open to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} [https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N144 Pacte civil de solidarité (Pacs)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Government introduced a bill to legally recognize same-sex marriage, ''[[Bill 344 (2012)|Bill 344]]'', in the National Assembly on 17 November 2012. It received final approval in the National Assembly in a 331–225 vote on 23 April 2013.&lt;ref name="Same-sex marriage: France"&gt;{{cite news|title=Same-sex marriage: French parliament approves new law|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22261494|publisher=BBC News Europe|access-date=23 April 2013|date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Law No.2013-404'' grants same-sex couples living in France, including foreigners provided at least one of the partners has their domicile or residence in France, the legal right to get married. The law also allows the recognition in France of same-sex couples' marriages that occurred abroad before the bill's enactment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lesur|first1=Lionel|title=France Allows Same-Sex Marriages|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/france-allows-same-sex-marriages|access-date=20 June 2013|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=13 June 2013|first2=Lisa A.|last2=Linsky|author3=McDermott Will &amp; Emery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main right-wing opposition party UMP challenged the law in the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], which had one month to rule on whether the law conformed to the Constitution. On 17 May 2013, the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] declared the bill legal in its entirety. President [[François Hollande]] signed it into law on 18 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/2013/2013-669-dc/communique-de-presse.137047.html Communiqué de presse – 2013-669 DC – Loi ouvrant le mariage aux couples de personnes de même sexe], [[Constitutional Council of France]]; retrieved 17 May 2013.{{in lang|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Germany}}

Prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, Germany was one of the first countries to legislate [[Civil union|registered life partnerships]] (''Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft'') for same-sex couples, which provided most of the rights of marriage. The law came into effect on 1 August 2001, and the act was progressively amended on subsequent occasions to reflect [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|court]] rulings expanding the rights of registered partners.

Same-sex marriage has been legal in Germany since 1 October 2017. A bill recognizing marriages and adoption rights for same-sex couples passed the [[Bundestag]] on 30 June 2017 after [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] stated that she would allow her [[CDU/CSU]] parliamentarians a [[conscience vote]] on such legislation, shortly after it was made a requirement for any future coalition by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik/bundesparteitag-der-spd-schulz-macht-ehe-fuer-alle-zur-koalitionsbedingung-27856194|title=Bundesparteitag der SPD Schulz macht Ehe für alle zur Koalitionsbedingung|work=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]]|publisher=[[Berliner Zeitung]]|language=de|date=25 June 2017|access-date=26 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625220038/http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/politik/bundesparteitag-der-spd-schulz-macht-ehe-fuer-alle-zur-koalitionsbedingung-27856194|archive-date=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-governing [[SPD]] consequently forced a vote on the issue together with the opposition parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/europe/germany-gay-marriage.html|title=Parliament in Germany Approves Same-Sex Marriage|last1=Smale|first1=Alison|date=30 June 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=30 June 2017|last2=Shimer|first2=David|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703142747/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/europe/germany-gay-marriage.html|archive-date=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed into law by [[President of Germany|German President]] [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] on 20 July and came into effect on 1 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-germany-equalmarriage/germanys-first-same-sex-i-dos-as-marriage-equality-dawns-idUKKCN1C50TA|title=Germany's first same-sex "I do"'s as marriage equality dawns|journal=Reuters|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iceland====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Iceland}}
Same-sex marriage was introduced in Iceland through legislation establishing a gender-neutral definition of marriage introduced by the Coalition Government of the [[Social Democratic Alliance]] and [[Left-Green Movement]]. The legislation was passed unanimously by the Icelandic [[Althing]] on 11 June 2010, and took effect on 27 June 2010, replacing an earlier system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65A3V020100611|title=Iceland passes gay marriage law in unanimous vote|work=Reuters|date= 11 June 2010|access-date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/06/28/new-gay-marriage-law-in-iceland-comes-into-force/|title=New gay marriage law in Iceland comes into force|work=Icenews|date= 28 June 2010|access-date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] and her partner were among the first married same-sex couples in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/iceland/7858150/Iceland-PM-weds-as-gay-marriage-legalised.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Iceland PM weds as gay marriage legalised|date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Niall O'Loughlin - vote yes on marriage equality street art - Dublin, Ireland.png|thumb|Street art by Niall O'Loughlin in Dublin encouraging people to vote yes in 2015's Irish referendum]]
Prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, the ''Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010'' allowed same sex couples to enter civil partnerships. The Act came into force on 1 January 2011 and gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar to, but not equal to, those of civil marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/partnership-laws-come-into-force-1.869456 |title=Partnership laws come into force |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2015, Ireland held a [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015|referendum]] that proposed to add to the [[Irish Constitution]]: "marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex." The proposal was approved with 62% of voters supporting same-sex marriage. On 29 August 2015, Irish President [[Michael D. Higgins]] signed the result of the May referendum into law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/president-signs-same-sex-marriage-into-constitution-1.2333882|title=President signs same-sex marriage into Constitution|date=29 August 2015|website=The Irish Times|access-date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made Ireland the first country in the world to approve same-sex marriage at a nationwide referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/vote2015/2015/0523/703205-referendum-byelection/|title=Ireland says Yes to same-sex marriage|journal=RTÉ.ie|date=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage became formally legally recognized in Ireland on 16 November 2015.&lt;ref name="legal123"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34810598|title=Same-sex marriage is now legal in Republic of Ireland|journal=BBC News|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malta====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Malta}}
Malta has recognized same-sex unions since April 2014, following the enactment of the ''Civil Unions Act'', first introduced in September 2013. It established civil unions with same rights, responsibilities, and obligations as marriage, including the right of joint adoption and recognition of foreign same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="tvm.com.mt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvm.com.mt/news/aggornat-ryan-u-jamie-jirregistraw-l-ewwel-zwieg-gay-fmalta|title=Aġġornat: Ryan u Jaime jirreġistraw l-ewwel żwieġ gay f'Malta - TVM|website=TVM|access-date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parliament of Malta|Maltese Parliament]] gave final approval to the legislation on 14 April 2014 by a vote of 37 in favor and 30 abstentions.

The first foreign same-sex marriage was registered on 29 April 2014 and the first civil union was performed on 14 June 2014.&lt;ref name="tvm.com.mt"/&gt;

On 21 February 2017, Minister for Social Dialogue, Consumer Affairs, and Civil Liberties [[Helena Dalli]] said that she was preparing a bill to legally recognize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170221/local/gay-marriage-to-be-introduced-in-malta-soon.640309 Gay marriage to be introduced in Malta soon], timesofmalta.com; accessed 5 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was presented to Parliament on 5 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170705/local/small-silent-protest-against-gay-marriage-law-outside-parliament.652526 Gay marriages bill sails through first vote - government to reject opposition amendments], timesofmalta.com; accessed 5 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill's last reading took place in Parliament on 12 July 2017, where it was approved 66–1.

In individual cases, same-sex couples have been given judicial approval to marry in all other states. Since August 2010, same-sex marriages performed within Mexico are recognized by the 31 states without exception. On 18 December 2019, the ruling party, Morena, introduced a constitutional amendment that would legally recognize marriage at the federal level and require all states to adjust their laws correspondingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/1653990.propone-morena-reforma-para-garantizar-matrimonio-igualitario-en-mexico.html|title = Propone Morena reforma para garantizar matrimonio igualitario en México}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2009, the [[Legislative Assembly of the Federal District|Legislative Assembly]] of [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico City|Mexico City]] (formerly the Federal District of Mexico City) legally recognized same-sex marriages and [[gay adoption|adoption by same-sex couples]]. The law was enacted eight days later and became effective in early March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NBC News|title=Mexico City's gay marriage law takes effect|date=4 March 2010|url= https://www.nbcnews.com/id/35714490|access-date=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August 2010, the [[Mexican Supreme Court]] ruled that while not every state must grant same-sex marriages, they must all recognize those performed where they are legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-10932748|work=BBC News|title=Supreme court rules gay weddings valid in all Mexico|date=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2011, the first two same-sex marriages occurred in [[Quintana Roo]] after it was discovered that Quintana Roo's Civil Code did not explicitly prohibit same-sex marriage,&lt;ref name="QR marriages legal"&gt;{{cite news|first=Brisa|last=Muñoz|publisher=CNN México|title=Dos matrimonios homosexuales se casaron en un municipio conservador|date=2 December 2011|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/12/02/los-matrimonios-del-mismo-sexo-despiertan-polemica-en-quintana-roo|language=es|access-date=2 January 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106064114/http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/12/02/los-matrimonios-del-mismo-sexo-despiertan-polemica-en-quintana-roo|archive-date=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these marriages were later annulled by the [[Governor of Quintana Roo]] in April 2012.&lt;ref name="QR marriages annulled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=304595|website=[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]]|publisher=Comunicación e Información, S.A. de C.V|title=Anula gobernador de Quintana Roo dos bodas gay; lo acusan de homofóbico|language=es|date=17 April 2012|access-date=20 April 2012|first=Rosa|last=Santana}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, the Secretary of State of Quintana Roo reversed the annulments and allowed for future same-sex marriages to be performed in the state.&lt;ref name="QR marriages reinstated"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/845171.html|language=es|title=Revocan anulación de bodas gay en QRoo|first=Adriana|last=Varillas|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|date=3 May 2012|access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2014, the Congress of [[Coahuila]] approved adoptions by same-sex couples. A bill recognizing same-sex marriages passed on 1 September 2014, making Coahuila the first state (and second jurisdiction after Mexico City) to reform its Civil Code to allow for legal same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aprueban matrimonios gay en Coahuila|date=1 September 2014|url=http://www.vanguardia.com.mx/apruebanmatrimoniosgayencoahuila-2155742.html|publisher=Vangardia.com.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took effect on 17 September, and the first couple married on 20 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=19500&amp;MediaType=1&amp;Category=24|title=First Gay Couple Marries In Coahuila, Mexico|date=21 September 2014|magazine=On Top Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2015, the Governor of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] announced that his administration would no longer oppose same-sex marriages in the state. The order was effective immediately, thus making Chihuahua the third state to legally recognize such unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexico state of Chihuahua officially approves same-sex marriage|date=12 June 2015|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/mexico-state-chihuahua-officially-approves-same-sex-marriage120615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexican state to allow same-sex marriage| date=12 June 2015|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/06/12/mexican-state-to-allow-same-sex-marriage/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 2015, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation]] released a "jurisprudential thesis" that found state-laws defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman unconstitutional. The ruling standardized court procedures across Mexico to authorize same-sex marriages. However, the process is still lengthy and more expensive than that for an opposite-sex marriage, as the ruling did not invalidate any state laws, meaning same-sex couples will be denied the right to wed and will have to turn to the courts for individual injunctions ({{lang-es|amparo}}). However, given the nature of the ruling, judges and courts throughout Mexico must approve any application for a same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/mexico-supreme-court-opens-door-to-gay-marriage-nationwide/307197801|title=Mexico supreme court says state laws limiting marriage to man and woman unconstitutional|newspaper=Minneapolis Star Tribune|date=12 June 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614004959/http://www.startribune.com/mexico-supreme-court-opens-door-to-gay-marriage-nationwide/307197801|archive-date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official release of the thesis was on 19 June 2015, which took effect on 22 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexico avalara matrimonio gay partir lunes|date=19 June 2015|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2015/06/19/nota/4972027/mexico-avalara-matrimonio-gay-partir-lunes|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this ruling, a majority of states have begun allowing same-sex marriage, either through legislative change, administrative decisions, or under court orders.

The Netherlands was the first country to extend marriage laws to include same-sex couples, following the recommendation of a special commission appointed to investigate the issue in 1995. A same-sex marriage bill passed the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] and the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] in 2000, taking effect on 1 April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/20/world/same-sex-dutch-couples-gain-marriage-and-adoption-rights.html|title=Same-Sex Dutch Couples Gain Marriage and Adoption Rights|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 2000|access-date=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|De facto union in Portugal}}

Portugal created de facto unions similar to common-law marriage for cohabiting opposite-sex partners in 1999, and extended these unions to same-sex couples in 2001. However, the 2001 extension did not allow for same-sex adoption, either jointly or of stepchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistoriaconmapas.com/war-maps/Same-sex-marriage-Legal-recognition-War-Maps.htm|title=Historia con Mapas|access-date=26 July 2015}} {{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Same-sex marriage in South Africa}}

Legal recognition of same-sex marriages in South Africa came about as a result of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]]'s decision in the case of ''[[Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie]]''. The court ruled on 1 December 2005 that the existing marriage laws violated the [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa|equality clause]] of the ''[[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]]'' because they discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. The court gave [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] one year to rectify the inequality.

The ''[[Civil Union Act (South Africa)|Civil Union Act]]'' was passed by the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] on 14 November 2006, by a vote of 230 to 41. It became law on 30 November 2006. South Africa became the fifth country, the first in Africa, and the second outside Europe, to legally recognize same-sex marriage.

{{main|Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom}}

Same-sex marriage is legal in all parts of the [[United Kingdom]]. As [[marriage]] is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved legislative matter]], different parts of the UK enacted same-sex marriage at different times; it has been recognized and performed in [[England and Wales]] since March 2014, in [[Scotland]] since December 2014, and in [[Northern Ireland]] since January 2020.

* [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013|Legislation to allow same-sex marriage]] in [[England and Wales]] was passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] in July 2013 and took effect on 13 March 2014. The first same-sex marriages took place on 29 March 2014.
* [[Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014|Legislation to allow same-sex marriage]] in [[Same-sex marriage in Scotland|Scotland]] was passed by the [[Scottish Parliament]] in February 2014 and took effect on 16 December 2014.

The first same-sex marriage ceremony took place on 11 February 2020.

Same-sex marriage is legal in nine of the fourteen [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territories]]. It has been recognized in [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the British Overseas Territories|South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] since 2014, [[Same-sex marriage in Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] and the [[Same-sex marriage in the British Indian Ocean Territory|British Indian Ocean Territory]] (for UK military personnel only) since 3 June 2014, the [[Same-sex marriage in the Pitcairn Islands|Pitcairn Islands]] since 14 May 2015, the [[Same-sex marriage in the British Antarctic Territory|British Antarctic Territory]] since 13 October 2016, [[Same-sex marriage in Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] since 15 December 2016, the [[Same-sex marriage in the Falkland Islands|Falkland Islands]] since 29 April 2017, [[Same-sex marriage in Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha|Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]] since 20 December 2017, and [[Same-sex marriage in Bermuda|Bermuda]] since 23 November 2018.

An appeal by the government of Bermuda of a lower court's ruling for same-sex marriage is scheduled to be heard in February 2021.

Same-sex marriage is legal in the [[Crown dependencies]]. It has been recognized and performed in the [[Same-sex marriage in the Isle of Man|Isle of Man]] since 22 July 2016, in [[Same-sex marriage in Jersey|Jersey]] since 1 July 2018, and in the [[Same-sex marriage in Guernsey|Bailiwick of Guernsey]] at different times: in the jurisdiction of [[Guernsey]] since 2 May 2017, in [[Alderney]] since 14 June 2018, and in [[Sark]] since 23 April 2020.

Since 2005, same-sex couples have been allowed to enter into [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]], a separate union providing the [[Legal consequences of marriage and civil partnership in the United Kingdom|legal consequences of marriage]]. In 2006, the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] rejected a legal bid by a British [[Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson|lesbian couple]] who had [[Same-sex marriage in British Columbia|married]] in Canada to have their union recognized as a marriage in the UK rather than a civil partnership.

[[Same-sex marriage in the United States]] expanded from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015 through various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes, and federal court rulings. The [[U.S. state|fifty states]] each have separate [[marriage law]]s, which must adhere to rulings by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that recognize [[marriage]] as a [[Fundamental rights in the United States|fundamental right]] that is guaranteed by both the [[Due Process Clause]] and the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], as first established in the 1967 [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] [[civil rights]] case of ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''.

Civil rights campaigning in support of marriage without distinction as to sex or sexual orientation began in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Same-Sex Couple Who Got a Marriage License in 1971|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/us/the-same-sex-couple-who-got-a-marriage-license-in-1971.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=16 May 2015|access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the now overturned ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'' saw the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decline to become involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Great Undoing?|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/2009/06/20/great-undoing|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|first=Andrew|last=Gumbel|access-date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue became prominent from around 1993, when the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]] ruled in ''[[Baehr v. Miike|Baehr v. Lewin]]'' that it was unconstitutional under the [[Constitution of Hawaii|state constitution]] for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. That ruling led to federal and state actions to explicitly abridge marriage on the basis of sex in order to prevent the marriages of same-sex couples from being recognized by law, the most prominent of which was the 1996 federal [[DOMA]]. In 2003, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled in ''[[Goodridge v. Department of Public Health]]'' that it was unconstitutional under the [[Constitution of Massachusetts|state constitution]] for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. From 2004 through to 2015, as [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|the tide of public opinion]] continued to move towards support of same-sex marriage, various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes ([[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s), and federal court rulings established same-sex marriage in thirty-six of the fifty states.

In May 2011, [[Public opinion of same-sex marriage in the United States|national public support for same-sex marriage]] rose above 50% for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/147662/first-time-majority-americans-favor-legal-gay-marriage.aspx|website=[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]|date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] struck down [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]] for violating the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in the landmark civil rights case of ''[[United States v. Windsor]]'', leading to federal recognition of same-sex marriage, with federal benefits for married couples connected to either the state of residence or the state in which the marriage was solemnized. In June 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in the landmark civil rights case of ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that the [[Fundamental rights in the United States|fundamental right]] of same-sex couples to marry on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples, with all the accompanying rights and responsibilities, is guaranteed by both the [[Due Process Clause]] and the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

Same-sex marriage is also legal in four of the United States territories: [[Same-sex marriage in Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], [[Same-sex marriage in the United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]], [[Same-sex marriage in Guam|Guam]], and the [[Same-sex marriage in the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Mariana Islands]]. It is not legal in [[LGBT rights in American Samoa|American Samoa]], amid legal uncertainty over whether the US Constitution applies there in full.

[[Same-sex marriage in tribal nations in the United States|Native American Tribal Nations]] also have their own same-sex marriage legislation.

The [[United States of America]] is the most populous country in the world to have established same-sex marriage nationwide.

====Uruguay====

Uruguay's [[Chamber of Deputies (Uruguay)|Chamber of Deputies]] passed a bill on 12 December 2012, to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diputados aprobó el matrimonio igualitario Pasada la mediano|url=http://www.unoticias.com.uy/2012/12/12/informacion_nacional/diputados_aprobo_el_matrimonio_igualitario/|website=Noticias|publisher=Diario UNoticias|access-date=31 July 2013|language=es|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Senate (Uruguay)|Senate]] passed the bill on 2 April 2013, but with minor amendments. On 10 April 2013, the Chamber of Deputies passed the amended bill by a two-thirds majority (71–22).

The Bulgarian Constitution forbids the legalization of same-sex marriage, stipulating that marriage can only be between a man and a woman.

In late 2017, a Bulgarian same-sex couple, who [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|married in the United Kingdom]], filed a lawsuit in order to have their marriage recognized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofiaglobe.com/2017/12/05/woman-sues-bulgarian-authorities-for-recognition-of-same-sex-marriage/ Woman sues Bulgarian authorities for recognition of same-sex marriage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913124655/https://sofiaglobe.com/2017/12/05/woman-sues-bulgarian-authorities-for-recognition-of-same-sex-marriage/ |date=13 September 2018 }} ''The Sofia Globe'', 5 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Sofia Administrative Court ruled against them in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/186950/The+Court+did+not+Recognize+a+Marriage+Between+Bulgarian+Women+in+the+UK |title=The Court did not Recognize a Marriage Between Bulgarian Women in the UK |publisher=Novinite.com |date=12 January 2018 |access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sofia]] court granted a same-sex couple the right to live in Bulgaria on 29 June 2018. The couple, an [[Australia]]n woman and her French spouse, had married in [[France]] in 2016, but were denied residency in Bulgaria a year later when they attempted to move there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.voanews.com/a/bulgarian-court-backs-same-sex-couple-s-eu-residence-rights/4467521.html Bulgarian Court Backs Same-sex Couple's EU Residence Rights], ''VOA News'', 4 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2014, a group of [[Senate of Chile|senators]] from various parties, joined LGBT rights group [[MOVILH]] (Homosexual Movement of Integration and Liberation) in presenting a bill to allow same-sex marriage and adoption to Congress. MOVILH had been in talks with the Chilean Government to seek an amiable solution to the pending marriage lawsuit brought against the state before the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cascaraamarga.es/politica-lgtb/lgtb-internacional/10299-el-proyecto-de-ley-de-matrimonio-igualitario-llega-al-parlamento-de-chile.html|title=El proyecto de ley de matrimonio igualitario llega al Parlamento de Chile|publisher=Cáscara Amarga|access-date=11 December 2014|archive-date=6 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506141246/http://www.cascaraamarga.es/politica-lgtb/lgtb-internacional/10299-el-proyecto-de-ley-de-matrimonio-igualitario-llega-al-parlamento-de-chile.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 February 2015, lawyers representing the Government and MOVILH met to discuss an amicable solution to the same-sex marriage lawsuit. The Government announced that they would drop their opposition to same-sex marriage. A formal agreement between the two parties and the [[Inter-American Commission of Human Rights]] was signed in April 2015.&lt;ref name="blade"&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/01/15/latin-america-countries-urged-to-abide-by-landmark-lgbt-rights-ruling/ Latin America countries urged to abide by landmark LGBT rights ruling] ''The Washington Blade'', 15 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Chilean Government pledged to legally recognize same-sex marriage.

On 28 January 2015, the National Congress approved a bill recognizing civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples offering some of the rights of marriage. President Michele Bachelet signed the bill on 14 April, and it came into effect on 22 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chile recognises same-sex civil unions|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-32296246|journal=BBC News|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters-bill-pass&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esposito|first1=Anthony|title=Socially-conservative Chile approves civil unions|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/chile-civilunions-idUSL1N0V71X020150128|access-date=28 January 2015|work=Reuters|archive-date=16 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016144837/http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/28/chile-civilunions-idUSL1N0V71X020150128|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, President Bachelet stated before a United Nations General Assembly panel that the Chilean Government would submit a same-sex marriage bill to Congress in the first half of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/chile-bachelet-gay-marriage-bill/3520246.html|title=Chile's President Plans to Send Gay Marriage Bill to Congress in 2017|website=VOA &amp; Reuters|date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A same-sex marriage bill was submitted in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.camara.cl/pley/pley_detalle.aspx?prmID=11934&amp;prmBoletin=11422-07|title=Modifica diversos cuerpos legales para regular, en igualdad de condiciones, el matrimonio de parejas del mismo sexo|publisher=[[Chamber of Deputies of Chile]]|access-date=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament began discussing the bill on 27 November 2017,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/11/27/chilean-lawmakers-begin-debate-sex-marriage-bill/ Chilean lawmakers begin debate on same-sex marriage bill] ''The Washington Blade'', 27 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; but it failed to pass before March 2018, when a new Government was inaugurated. On 16 January 2020, the bill was approved in the Senate by a 22 to 16 vote, then headed to the constitutional committee.

The 2018 Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling regarding the legalization of same-sex marriage in countries that have ratified the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] applies to Chile.

On 21 July 2021, the Senate approved the bill recognizing gay marriage by 28 votes to 14.

====China====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in China}}
The ''Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China'' explicitly defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman. No other form of civil union is recognized. The attitude of the Chinese Government towards homosexuality is believed to be "three nos": "No approval; no disapproval; no promotion." The Ministry of Health officially removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in 2001.

[[Li Yinhe]], a sociologist and sexologist well known in the Chinese gay community, has tried to legally recognize same-sex marriage several times, including during the National People's Congress in 2000 and 2004 (''Legalization for Same-Sex Marriage'' 《中国同性婚姻合法化》 in 2000 and the ''Same-Sex Marriage Bill'' 《中国同性婚姻提案》 in 2004). According to Chinese law, 35 delegates' signatures are needed to make an issue a bill to be discussed in the Congress. Her efforts failed due to lack of support from the delegates. CPPCC National Committee spokesman [[Wu Jianmin]]
when asked about Li Yinhe's proposal, said that same-sex marriage was still too "ahead of its time" for China. He argued that same-sex marriage was not recognized even in many Western countries, which are considered much more liberal in social issues than China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2006-03-05/10278364854s.shtml|title=政协发言人称同性婚姻太超前 李银河提案再受挫_新闻中心_新浪网|publisher=News.sina.com.cn|access-date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement is understood as an implication that the Government may consider recognition of same-sex marriage in the long run, but not in the near future.

On 5 January 2016, a court in [[Changsha]], southern [[Hunan|Hunan Province]], agreed to hear the lawsuit of 26-year-old Sun Wenlin filed in December 2015 against the Bureau of Civil Affairs of Furong District for its June 2015 refusal to let him marry his 36-year-old male partner, Hu Mingliang. On 13 April 2016, with hundreds of same-sex marriage supporters outside, the Changsha court ruled against Sun, who vowed to appeal, citing the importance of his case for LGBT progress in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/13/474065742/chinese-court-rules-against-gay-couple-seeking-to-get-married|title=Chinese Court Rules Against Gay Couple Seeking To Get Married|publisher=The Two-Way|date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2019, guardianship agreements have been signed in [[Jiangsu]] (the first one was registered in [[Nanjing]] in late 2017), [[Hunan]], [[Sichuan]], [[Guangdong]], [[Shanghai]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2019-08-06|title=Same-sex couples in China name each other as legal guardians|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/08/06/same-sex-couples-china-name-legal-guardians/|access-date=2021-06-13|website=PinkNews - Gay news, reviews and comment from the world's most read lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans news service|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hubei]] and [[Beijing]], among others.

The [[Constitution of Cuba|Cuban Constitution]] prohibited same-sex marriage until February 2019. In May 2019, the Government announced that the Union of Jurists of Cuba is working on a new family code, which would address same-sex marriage.

In September 2018, following some public concerns and conservative opposition against the possibility of paving the way to legalisation of same-sex marriage in Cuba, [[President of Cuba|President]] [[Miguel Díaz-Canel]] announced his support for same-sex marriage after he told [[Telesur (TV channel)|TV Telesur]] that he supports "marriage between people without any restrictions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/407066-new-cuban-president-says-he-supports-same-sex-marriage | title=New Cuban president says he supports same-sex marriage| date=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/cuban-president-miguel-diaz-canel-backs-sex-marriage-180917162537797.html|title=Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel backs same-sex marriage|first=Charlotte|last=Mitchell|date=17 September 2018|website=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposal for a new Family Code including same-sex marriage and adoption was presented in September 2021.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-publishes-draft-family-code-that-opens-door-gay-marriage-2021-09-15/ {{Bare URL inline|date=November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, a lawyer in El Salvador filed a lawsuit before the [[Supreme Court of El Salvador|country's Supreme Court]] asking for the nullification of Article 11 of the Family Code, which defines marriage as a heterosexual union. Labeling the law as discriminatory and explaining the lack of gendered terms used in Article 34 of the [[Constitution of El Salvador|Constitution]]'s summary of marriage, the lawsuit sought to allow same-sex couples the right to wed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theperchybird.wordpress.com/2016/08/18/same-sex-marriage-lawsuit-filed-in-el-salvador/ Same-sex Marriage Lawsuit Filed in El Salvador]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|es}} [http://elmundo.sv/piden-declarar-inconstitucional-exclusion-de-matrimonio-a-personas-del-mismo-sexo/ Piden declarar inconstitucional exclusión de matrimonio a personas del mismo sexo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190827033708/https://elmundo.sv/piden-declarar-inconstitucional-exclusion-de-matrimonio-a-personas-del-mismo-sexo/ |date=27 August 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 December, the [[Supreme Court of El Salvador|Salvadoran Supreme Court]] rejected the lawsuit on a [[legal technicality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|es}} [http://www.diariolasamericas.com/america-latina/sala-constitucional-el-salvador-rechaza-solicitud-matrimonio-homosexual-n4110535 Sala Constitucional de El Salvador rechaza solicitud de matrimonio homosexual]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in India}}
As of 2017, a draft of a [[Uniform Civil Code]] that would legally recognize same-sex marriage has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.catchnews.com/amp/india-news/a-new-ucc-for-a-new-india-progressive-draft-ucc-allows-for-same-sex-marriages-85386.html|title=A new UCC for a new India?

Although same-sex couples are not legally recognized currently by any form, performing a symbolic same-sex marriage is not prohibited under Indian law either. On 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India decriminalized homosexuality by declaring [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] unconstitutional. In 2020, several court cases were filed seeking a right to same-sex marriage under India's various denominational and non-denominational marriage laws.

In 2021 Netflix created a TV series, The Big Day. It was the first TV series to show a same-sex wedding in India, between makeup artist, [[Daniel Bauer (make-up artist)|Daniel Bauer]] and his partner, Tyrone Braganza

====Israel====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Israel}}
In 2006, Israel's High Court of Justice ruled to recognize foreign same-sex marriages for the limited purpose of registration with the Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration; however, this is merely for statistical purposes and grants no state-level rights. Israel does not recognize civil marriages performed under its own jurisdiction. A bill was raised in the [[Knesset]] (Israeli Parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but the Knesset did not advance the bill. A bill to legally recognize same-sex and interfaith civil marriages was defeated in the Knesset, 39–11, on 16 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Jerusalem Post|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=270221|title=Knesset rejects marriage equality bill|date=16 May 2012|author=Harkov, Lahav|access-date=28 May 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522013505/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=270221|archive-date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, the National LGBT Taskforce of Israel petitioned the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] to allow same-sex marriage in the country, arguing that the refusal of the rabbinical court to recognize same-sex marriage should not prevent civil courts from performing same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/NGO-The-Aguda-petitions-Supreme-Court-to-allow-same-sex-marriage-Israel-431733#article=6017RkIwRTRGQ0UyQzlCNUYxOUM3OUI5QTc1RTJGQkVGMkU=|title=NGO petitions High Court to allow same-sex marriage in Israel|website=The Jerusalem Post|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court handed down a ruling on 31 August 2017, determining the issue was the responsibility of the Knesset, and not the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpost.com/Israel-News/Supreme-Court-rejects-petition-to-recognize-same-sex-marriage-503894|date=31 August 2017|website=Jerusalem Post|title=Supreme Court rejects petition to recognize same-sex marriage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls have shown that Israelis overwhelmingly support recognizing same-sex unions. A 2017 opinion poll showed that 79% of the Israeli public were in favor of legal recognition of same-sex unions (either marriage or civil unions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/israeli-support-for-gay-marriage-is-at-an-all-time-high/|title=Israeli support for gay marriage is at an all-time high}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2018 poll showed that 58% of Israelis were specifically in favor of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/most-israelis-favor-same-sex-marriage-but-half-of-mks-mum-on-issue/ Most Israelis favor same-sex marriage, but half of MKs mum on issue], ''The Times of Israel'', 5 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2017, the Italian [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]] ruled that same-sex marriages performed abroad can be fully recognized by court order, when at least one of the two spouses is a citizen of a [[European Union]] country where same-sex marriage is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blitzquotidiano.it/cronaca-italia/nozze-gay-in-italia-cassazione-convalida-il-primo-matrimonio-tra-due-donne-2630868/|title=Nozze gay riconosciute dalla Cassazione: prima volta in Italia|website=www.blitzquotidiano.it|date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Japan}}
Same-sex marriage is not legal in Japan. Article 24 of the Japanese Constitution states that "Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitution of Japan|date=3 November 1946|location=Tokyo|url=http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html|access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 24 was created to establish the equality of both sexes in marriage, in opposition to the pre-war legal situation whereby the husband/father was legally defined as the head of household and marriage require permission from the male head of the family. In 2021, the district court in Sapporo ruled that this wording requires recognition of same-sex marriage, with similar suits pending in other district courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/japan-court-backs-right-to-same-sex-marriage-for-first-time/ar-BB1eFauB?ocid=msedgdhp|title = Japan Court Backs Right to Same-Sex Marriage for First Time|website = [[MSN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, three prefectures and dozens of municipalities and have begun issuing partnership certificates to same-sex couples that offer limited rights when accessing civil services.

According to a 2021 opinion poll, 65% of Japanese people support same-sex marriage, with 22% opposing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASP3P7DSCP3MUZPS003.html?iref=pc_ss_date_article|title=同性婚、法律で「認めるべき」65% 朝日新聞世論調査|publisher=Asahi Shimbun|date=March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latvia====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Latvia}}
On 27 May 2016, the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia]] overturned an administrative court decision that refused an application to register a same-sex marriage in the country. A Supreme Court press spokeswoman said that the court agrees with the administrative court that current regulations do not allow for same-sex marriages to be legally performed in Latvia. However, the matter should have been considered in a context not of marriage, but of registering familial partnership. Furthermore, it would have been impossible to conclude whether the applicants' rights were violated or not unless their claim is accepted and reviewed in a proper manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lsm.lv/en/article/societ/society/supreme-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-request-will-be-considered.a184891/ |title=Supreme Court rules same-sex marriage request will be considered |publisher=Public broadcasting of Latvia |date=27 May 2016 |access-date=15 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116173216/http://www.lsm.lv/en/article/societ/society/supreme-court-rules-same-sex-marriage-request-will-be-considered.a184891/ |archive-date=16 January 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court will now decide whether the refusal was in breach of the Latvian Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.

====Nepal====

In November 2008, the [[Supreme Court of Nepal]] issued final judgment on matters related to LGBT rights, which included permitting same-sex couples to marry. Same-sex marriage and protection for sexual minorities were to be included in the new Nepalese Constitution required to be completed by 31 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nepal/Nepal-charter-to-grant-gay-rights/Article1-499154.aspx|title=Nepal charter to grant gay rights|website=Hindustan Times|date=19 January 2010|access-date=1 February 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123144431/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nepal/Nepal-charter-to-grant-gay-rights/Article1-499154.aspx|archive-date=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Dean|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/7027736/Nepal-to-stage-gay-weddings-on-Everest.html|title=Nepal 'to stage gay weddings on Everest'|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=19 January 2010|access-date=1 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Legislature was unable to agree on the Constitution before the deadline and was dissolved after the Supreme Court ruled that the term could not be extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/world/asia/nepal-disbands-legislature-as-talks-on-constitution-fail.html|title=Legislature in Nepal Disbands in Failure|work=The New York Times|date=31 May 2012|access-date=1 June 2012|first1=Kiran|last1=Chapagain|first2=Jim|last2=Yardley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nepali Constitution was enacted in September 2015, but does not address same-sex marriage.

In October 2016, the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare constituted a committee for the purpose of preparing a draft bill to legally recognize same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pahichan.com/all-set-to-get-legal-status|title=All set to get legal status|date=21 October 2016|publisher=pahichan.com|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2016, a married same-sex couple filed an action of unconstitutionality seeking to recognize same-sex marriages performed abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|es}} [http://www.telemetro.com/nacionales/Surge-preocupacion-matrimonio-igualitario-Panama_0_964403965.html Surge preocupación ante recurso para que se reconozca el matrimonio igualitario en Panamá], Telemetro.com; accessed 5 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In early November, the case was admitted to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|es}} [http://impresa.prensa.com/panorama/Corte-conocera-matrimonios-igualitarios_0_4622537869.html Corte Suprema de Justicia conocerá sobre matrimonios igualitarios], Prensa.com; accessed 5 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A challenge seeking to fully legally recognize same-sex marriage in Panama was introduced before the Supreme Court in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/panama-activists-start-new-push-marriage-equality/ |title=Same-sex marriage could come to Panama if activists win legal fight |website=Gaystarnews.com |date=4 April 2017 |access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court heard arguments on both cases in summer 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/10/01/gay-lawyer-spearheads-panama-sex-marriage-efforts/|title=Gay lawyer spearheads Panama same-sex marriage efforts|date=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Supreme Court was deliberating on the two cases, the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] ruled on 9 January 2018 that countries signatory to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] must provide for same-sex marriage. On 16 January, the Panamanian Government welcomed the decision. Then Vice President [[Isabel Saint Malo]], speaking on behalf of the Government, announced that the country would fully abide by the ruling. Official notices, requiring compliance with the ruling, were sent out to various governmental departments that same day.&lt;ref name="panama1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laestrella.com.pa/panama/nacional/panama-acoge-opinion-corte-sobre-matrimonio/24043659 |title=Panamá acoge a la opinión de Corte IDH sobre matrimonio gay |publisher=[[La Estrella de Panamá]] |date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="panama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wradio.com.co/noticias/internacional/el-gobierno-panameno-acoge-opinion-de-la-corteidh-sobre-matrimonio-homosexual/20180116/nota/3691473.aspx |title=El Gobierno panameño acoge opinión de la CorteIDH sobre matrimonio homosexual |publisher=W Radio |date=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decision in this case is still pending.

However under the presidency of the more [[socially conservative]] [[Laurentino Cortizo]] a [[constitutional reform]] was approved by the [[National Assembly of Panama]] to ban same-sex marriage by establishing in the Constitution that marriage is between a man and a woman. The reform had to be voted again in 2020 and then submitted to referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parlamento panameño niega el derecho a casarse a parejas del mismo sexo |url=http://www.lr21.com.uy/mundo/1413942-panama-parlamento-prohibe-matrimonio-igualitario |access-date=29 October 2019 |agency=La Red 21 |date=29 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panamá cierra las puertas al matrimonio igualitario con reforma constitucional |url=https://teletica.com/240856_panama-cierra-las-puertas-al-matrimonio-igualitario-con-reforma-constitucional |access-date=29 October 2019 |agency=Teletica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panamá busca impedir con una reforma constitucional el matrimonio igualitario |url=https://www.elmundo.cr/mundo/panama-busca-impedir-con-una-reforma-constitucional-el-matrimonio-igualitario/ |access-date=29 October 2019 |agency=Mundo |date=29 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling regarding the legalization of same-sex marriage in countries that have ratified the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] applies to Peru. On 11 January, the president of the [[Supreme Court of Peru]] stated that the Peruvian Government should abide by the IACHR ruling.&lt;ref name="peru"&gt;{{in lang|es}} [http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20180112/434230085521/judicatura-peru-debe-respetar-decision-corteidh-sobre-matrimonio-homosexual.html Perú debe respetar decisión CorteIDH sobre matrimonio homosexual] lavanguardia&lt;/ref&gt;

====Romania====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Romania}}

On 5 June 2018, the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) ruled, in a case originating from Romania, that same-sex couples have the same residency rights as different-sex couples, when a national of an EU country gets married while resident in an EU country where same-sex marriage is legal, and the spouse is from a non-EU country.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44366898|title=Same-sex spouses have equal residency rights|journal=BBC News|date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conversation"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/rights-for-same-sex-married-couples-to-move-around-the-eu-confirmed-in-landmark-ruling-96387 |title=Rights for same-sex married couples to move around the EU confirmed in landmark ruling |first=Alina |last=Tryfonidou |work=The Conversation |date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the case was filed with the [[Constitutional Court of Romania|Romanian Constitutional Court]], which later decided to consult with the ECJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/romania-consult-european-court-over-same-sex-marriage-case-n689551|title=Romania to consult with European court over same-sex marriage case|website=[[NBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with the ECJ ruling, the Constitutional Court ruled on 18 July 2018 that the state must grant residency rights to the same-sex partners of European Union citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-lgbt/romania-must-give-residency-rights-to-same-sex-spouses-court-rules-idUSKBN1K81Y9|title=Romania must give residency rights to same-sex spouses, court rules|journal=Reuters|date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2019, [[Accept (organization)|ACCEPT]] and 14 people forming seven same-sex couples have sued the Romanian state to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR), asking for the legal recognition of their families in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.romania-insider.com/gay-couples-romania-echr |title=Seven gay couples take Romania to court to have family relation recognized |work=Romania-Insider.com |date=18 June 2019 |access-date=4 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704205954/https://www.romania-insider.com/gay-couples-romania-echr |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion poll in 2021 found that 43% ±3% of Romanians supported some form of legal protection for same-sex couples, with 26% supporting marriage. Support was 56% and 42% among respondents 18&amp;ndash;34 years old.&lt;ref&gt;https://euobserver.com/news/151711&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovenia recognizes registered partnerships for same-sex couples.

In December 2014, the eco-socialist [[United Left (Slovenia)|United Left]] party introduced a bill amending the definition of marriage in the 1976 ''Marriage and Family Relations Act'' to include same-sex couples. In January 2015, the Government expressed no opposition to the bill. In February 2015, the bill was passed with 11 votes to 2. In March, the Assembly passed the final bill in a 51–28 vote. On 10 March 2015, the National Council rejected a motion to require the Assembly to vote on the bill again, in a 14–23 vote. Opponents of the bill launched a petition for a referendum and managed to collect 40,000 signatures. The Parliament then voted to block the referendum with a clarification that it would be against the [[Constitution of Slovenia|Slovenian Constitution]] to vote on matters concerning human rights. Finally, the Constitutional Court ruled against the banning of the referendum (5–4) and [[2015 Slovenian same-sex marriage referendum|the referendum]] was held on 20 December 2015.

In the referendum, 63.4% of the voters voted against the law, rendering Parliament's same-sex marriage act invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/referendum/pobudniki-referenduma-uspeli-novela-zakona-o-zakonski-zvezi-zavrnjena/381559 |title=Pobudniki referenduma uspeli, sprememba zakona o zakonski zvezi zavrnjena |language=sl|date=20 December 2015 |access-date=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, [[Kim Jho Kwang-soo]] and his partner, Kim Seung-Hwan, filed a lawsuit seeking legal status for their marriage after their marriage registration form was rejected by the local authorities in [[Seoul]]. On 25 May 2016, a South Korean district court ruled against the couple and argued that without clear legislation a same-sex union can not be recognized as a marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/25/south-korea-rejects-film-director-kim-jho-gwang-so-same-sex-marriage-case|title=South Korean court rejects film director's same-sex marriage case|journal=The Guardian|date=25 May 2016|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple quickly filed an appeal against the district court ruling. Their lawyer, Ryu Min-Hee, announced that two more same-sex couples had filed separate lawsuits in order to be allowed to wed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/05/26/south-korea-set-for-more-court-battles-over-same-sex-marriage-ban|author=Duffy, Nick|title=South Korea set for more court battles over same-sex marriage ban|newspaper=Pink News|date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, a South Korean appeals court upheld the district court ruling. The couple vowed to bring the case to the [[Supreme Court of South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2016/12/06/52/0302000000AEN20161206010400315F.html|title=S.

In April 2016, the Supreme Court announced it would hear a lawsuit that seeks to declare Article 44 of the Civil Code unconstitutional for outlawing same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/11963|title=The Struggle isn't Over": Venezuela Moves Towards Marriage Equality|publisher=Venezuelanalysis.com|date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Nicolás Maduro]] supports same-sex marriage, and has suggested that the National Assembly agree to legally recognize it in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Reuters Staff|date=2020-10-22|title=Venezuela's Maduro, citing Pope, asks congress to consider same-sex marriage|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-lgbt-idUSKBN27737E|access-date=2021-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam====
{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Vietnam}}
In Vietnam, currently only a marriage between a man and a woman is recognized. Vietnam's Ministry of Justice began seeking advice on legalizing same-sex marriage from other governmental and non-governmental organizations in April and May 2012, and planned to further discuss the issue at the National Assembly in Spring 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnam government consults on same-sex marriage|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vietnam-government-consults-same-sex-marriage200612|access-date=26 January 2013|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2013, the Ministry of Justice requested that the National Assembly avoid action until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote on same-sex marriage in Vietnam likely to be delayed until 2014|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vote-same-sex-marriage-vietnam-likely-be-delayed-until-2014200213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese Government abolished an administrative fine imposed on same-sex weddings in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/345169/vietnam-ends-same-sex-marriage-fines|title=Vietnam ends same-sex marriage fines|newspaper=Bangkok Post|access-date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, the National Assembly began formal debate on a proposal to establish legal recognition for same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaynewsnetwork.com.au/news/world/11253-vietnam-national-assembly-begins-debate-on-marriage-equality.html|title=The latest entertainment news for Australia's LGBTIQ community|publisher=Gay News Network|access-date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2014, the National Assembly's Committee for Social Affairs removed the provision giving legal status and some rights to cohabiting same-sex couples from the Government's bill to amend the ''Law on Marriage and Family''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vietnamese-lawmakers-back-down-giving-rights-same-sex-couples300514|title=Vietnamese lawmakers back down on giving rights to same-sex couples|date=30 May 2014|website=Gay Star News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/vietnams-proposed-marriage-law-disappoints-lgbt-activists-/1925916.html|title=Vietnam's Proposed Marriage Law Disappoints LGBT Activists|website=VOA|access-date=26 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128133354/http://www.voanews.com/content/vietnams-proposed-marriage-law-disappoints-lgbt-activists-/1925916.html|archive-date=28 January 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was approved by the National Assembly on 19 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thanhniennews.com/politics/vietnam-allows-surrogacy-within-families-denies-samesex-marriage-27502.html|title=Vietnam allows surrogacy within families, denies same-sex marriage|website=Thanh Nien Daily|access-date=26 July 2015|date=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/20478/vietnam-removes-ban-on-same-sex-marriage|title=Vietnam removes ban on same sex marriage|newspaper=Tuoi Tre|access-date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2015, the ''2014 Law on Marriage and Family'' officially went into effect. It states that while Vietnam allows same-sex weddings, it will not offer legal recognition or protection to unions between people of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marilynstowe.co.uk/2014/12/29/vietnam-set-to-lift-gay-marriage-ban/|title=Vietnam set to lift gay marriage ban|website=Marilyn Stowe Blog|access-date=26 July 2015|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International organizations===
The terms of employment of the staff of [[international organizations]] (not [[Business|commercial]]) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.

Despite their relative independence, few organizations recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the [[United Nations]] recognize same-sex marriages if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Secretary-General Bulletin|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/522/40/PDF/N0452240.pdf|publisher=United Nations|access-date=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to mixed-sex married couples to de facto partners or [[domestic partner]]s of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into a mixed-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the [[World Bank]] does recognize domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTHRJOBS/0,,contentMDK:20522360~menuPK:1353209~pagePK:64262408~piPK:64262191~theSitePK:1058433,00.html|title=Jobs&amp;nbsp;— Compensation &amp; Benefits|publisher=The World Bank Group|access-date=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil union, [[civil partnership]], [[domestic partnership]], [[registered partnership]], unregistered partnership, and unregistered cohabitation statuses offer varying legal benefits of marriage. As of {{date}}, countries that have an alternative form of legal recognition other than marriage on a national level are: [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Andorra|Andorra]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Chile|Chile]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Croatia|Croatia]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Cyprus|Cyprus]], the [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Estonia|Estonia]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Greece|Greece]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Hungary|Hungary]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Israel|Israel]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Italy|Italy]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]], [[LGBT rights in San Marino|San Marino]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Switzerland|Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="countries and states legal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearson|first=Mary|title=Where is Gay Marriage Legal?|url=http://christiangays.com/marriage/legal.shtml|publisher=christiangays.com|access-date=20 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301004148/http://christiangays.com/marriage/legal.shtml|archive-date=1 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Steve|title=Which Countries Have Legalized Gay Marriage?|url=http://www.care2.com/causes/which-countries-have-legalized-gay-marriage.html|publisher=Care2.com (news.bbc.co.uk as source)|access-date=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Poland|Poland]] and [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Slovakia|Slovakia]] offer more limited rights. On a subnational level, the [[Same-sex marriage in Veracruz|Mexican state of Veracruz]], and [[Same-sex marriage in Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten|the Dutch constituent country of Aruba]] allow same-sex couples to access civil unions or partnerships, but restrict marriage to couples of the opposite sex. Additionally, various cities and counties in [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Cambodia|Cambodia]] and [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Japan|Japan]] offer same-sex couples varying levels of benefits, which include hospital visitation rights and others.

Additionally, sixteen countries that have legally recognized same-sex marriage have an alternative form of recognition for same-sex couples, usually available to heterosexual couples as well: [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|Australia]], [[Same-sex marriage in Austria|Austria]], [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]], [[Same-sex marriage in Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Same-sex marriage in Malta|Malta]], the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]], the [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eli.legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2004/07/09/n3 |title=Loi du 9 juillet 2004 relative aux effets légaux de certains partenariats. - Legilux |website=Eli.legilux.public.lu |access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=0F15B99854A4FE47659F950BE42DF000.tpdjo05v_3?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000005628705&amp;dateTexte=vig |title=Loi n° 99-944 du 15 novembre 1999 relative au pacte civil de solidarité |language=fr |website=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date=12 March 2007 |access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/mopdf/2000/03/02_1.pdf |title=WETTEN, DECRETEN, ORDONNANTIES EN VERORDENINGEN LOIS, DECRETS, ORDONNANCES ET REGLEMENTS |website=Ejustice.jkust.fgov.be |access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/33/contents|title=Civil Partnership Act 2004|website=Legislation.gov.uk|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-sexual same-sex marriage===
====Kenya====
{{main|LGBT rights in Kenya}}
Female same-sex marriage is practiced among the [[Gikuyu people|Gikuyu]], [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Kamba people|Kamba]], [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], and to a lesser extent neighboring peoples. About 5–10% of women are in such marriages. However, this is not seen as homosexual, but is instead a way for families without sons to keep their inheritance within the family.&lt;ref&gt;''Gender and Language in Sub-Saharan Africa,'' 2013:35&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nigeria====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Nigeria}}
Among the [[Igbo people]] and probably other peoples in the south of the country, there are circumstances where a marriage between women is considered appropriate, such as when a woman has no child and her husband dies, and she takes a wife to perpetuate her inheritance and family lineage.&lt;ref name=NigeriaTribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111010506/http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archive-date=11 January 2010|title=Tradition of same gender marriage in Igboland|first=Leo|last=Igwe|website=Nigerian Tribune|date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Anthropological Association]] stated on 26 February 2004:{{blockquote|text=The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution.

=== Adolescence ===
A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among school students in grades 9–12 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among high schoolers of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9–12 declined by 14% in states that established same-sex marriage, resulting in about 134,000 fewer attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among youth in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among youth in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among teenage youth occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="JAMA"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Raifman|first1=Julia|last2=Moscoe|first2=Ellen|last3=Austin|first3=S.

===Parenting===
{{main|LGBT parenting}}
[[File:Stephaniehaynes family.jpg|thumb|Lesbian couple with children]]
Professional organizations of psychologists have concluded that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents' relationship is recognized and supported by society's institutions, e.g. civil marriage. For example, the [[Canadian Psychological Association]] (CPA) stated in 2006 that "parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union."&lt;ref name="cpa2006" /&gt; The CPA has stated that the stress encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent.&lt;ref name="cpa2006" /&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded in 2006, in an analysis published in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'':{{blockquote|There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment... The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.''&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;}}

===Health===

The [[American Psychological Association]] stated in 2004: "Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status and so on." It has also averred that same-sex couples who may only enter into a civil union, as opposed to a marriage, "are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to those of married couples", which has adverse effects on the well-being of same-sex partners.&lt;ref name="psychological"&gt;{{cite web|author=American Psychological Association|author-link=American Psychological Association|year=2004|title=Resolution on Sexual Orientation and Marriage|url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511190536/http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf|archive-date=11 May 2011|access-date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2006}}, the data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.&lt;ref name="aap2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Herek, Gregory M.

According to the author, the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals.

While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the [[history of same-sex unions|historical and anthropological record]] reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, through full acceptance and integration, sympathetic toleration, indifference, prohibition and discrimination, to persecution and physical annihilation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising,&lt;ref name="Laurie"&gt;{{citation |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality|publisher=The Drum|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-blankenhorn19-2008sep19,0,6057126.story|title=Protecting marriage to protect children|last=Blankenhorn|first=David|date=19 September 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships,&lt;ref name="findlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements|title=See discussion of prenuptial and postmarital agreements at Findlaw|publisher=Family.findlaw.com|access-date=5 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025170627/http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements/|archive-date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="indegayforum1"&gt;Dale Carpenter is a prominent spokesman for this view.

===Parenting===

[[File:Same-sex male couple with child at the 2008 San Francisco Pride Parade.jpg|thumb|Male couple with a child]]
Scientific literature indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union (either a mixed-sex or same-sex union). As a result, professional scientific associations have argued for same-sex marriage to be legally recognized as it will be beneficial to the children of same-sex parents or carers.&lt;ref name="amici"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/10/27/amicus29.pdf|title=Brief of the American Psychological Association, The California Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy as amici curiae in support of plaintiff-appellees&amp;nbsp;– Appeal from United States District Court for the Northern District of California Civil Case No. 09-CV-2292 VRW (Honorable Vaughn R.

====Adoption====
{{main|LGBT adoption}}
[[File:World same-sex adoption laws.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Legal status of adoption by same-sex couples around the world: {{legend|#800080|Joint adoption allowed&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}
{{legend|#ba75ff|Second-parent (stepchild) adoption allowed&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}
{{legend|#e0e0e0|No laws allowing adoption by same-sex couples}}]]
All states that allow same-sex marriage also allow the joint [[adoption]] of children by people of the same sex{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} with the exceptions of Jalisco, Nayarit and Quintana Roo in Mexico. In addition, [[Andorra]] and [[Israel]], which do not recognize same-sex marriage nonetheless permit joint adoption by unmarried same-sex couples. Some additional states allow stepchild adoption by those who are in a same-sex relationship but are unmarried: [[Croatia]], [[Estonia]], [[Italy]] (on a case-by-case basis), [[Slovenia]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://euroclashblog.wordpress.com/2015/01/16/austrian-court-rules-to-allow-same-sex-adoptions/|title=Austrian court rules to allow same-sex adoptions|website=The Privateer|date=16 January 2016|access-date=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, more than 16,000 same-sex couples were raising an estimated 22,000 adopted children in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LGBT Adoption Statistics|url=http://www.lifelongadoptions.com/lgbt-adoption/lgbt-adoption-statistics|website=lifelongadoptions.com|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4% of all adopted children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Families are created with love|url=http://gayadoption.org/facts-supporting-gay-adoption|website=gayadoption.org|access-date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Surrogacy and IVF treatment====
{{main|Assisted reproductive technology}}
A gay or bisexual man has the option of [[surrogacy]], the process in which a woman bears a child for another person through [[artificial insemination]] or carries another woman's surgically implanted [[fertilized egg]] to birth. A lesbian or bisexual woman has the option of artificial insemination.&lt;ref&gt;The Fertility Sourcebook, Third Edition&amp;nbsp;– Page 245, M. Sara Rosenthal&amp;nbsp;– 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Family Social Work&amp;nbsp;– Page 348, Donald Collins, Catheleen Jordan, Heather Coleman&amp;nbsp;– 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Whether these arrangements are legal are subject to controversy in several jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Same-sex couples seeking IVF on the NHS face discrimination|url=https://vardags.com/family-law/same-sex-discrimination-fertility|access-date=2021-09-20|website=vardags.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender and intersex people===
{{synthesis|date=May 2017}}
{{See also|Transgender rights|Intersex human rights}}
The legal status of same-sex marriage may have implications for the marriages of couples in which one or both parties are [[transgender]], depending on how sex is defined within a jurisdiction. Transgender and [[intersex]] individuals may be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. "Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality." ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' 38.5 (October 2009): 688–701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the ''[[Gender Recognition Act 2004]]'' allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person had to dissolve their civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage|publisher=365gay.com|date=5 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|archive-date=17 October 2007|access-date=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. A similar provision including sterilization also existed in Sweden, but was phased out in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/sweden-ends-forced-sterilization-trans110113|title=Sweden ends forced sterilization of trans|date=11 January 2013|website=gaystarnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, transgender and intersex marriages was subject to legal complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deborah |first1=Anthony |title=CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE: TRANSSEXUAL MARRIAGE AND THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN SEX AND LEGAL SEX. |journal=Texas Journal of Women &amp; the Law |date=Spring 2012 |volume=21 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19brfs-USDEFENDSMAR_BRF.html|title=U.S. Defends Marriage Law|work=The New York Times|date=18 September 2009|access-date=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some of them prohibit legal changes of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps|title=Movement Advancement Project {{!}} Equality Maps|website=www.lgbtmap.org|language=en|access-date=2019-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce===
{{Main|Divorce of same-sex couples}}
In the United States of America before the case of ''Obergefell v. Hodges'', couples in same-sex marriages could only obtain a divorce in jurisdictions that recognized same-sex marriages, with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthew S. Coleman, Esq.|title=Obergefell v. Hodges|url=http://www.einhornharris.com/familylawblog/obergefell-v-hodges|publisher=Einhorn Harris|access-date=8 November 2015|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial and legislative===
{{Main|Conflict of marriage laws#Same-sex marriage}}
There are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A "[[direct democracy|majority rules]]" position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|title=Poll: Calif. gay marriage ban driven by religion|author=Leff, Lisa|agency=Associated Press|date=4 December 2008|work=USA Today|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208080418/http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|archive-date=8 December 2008}} archived here.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a [[civil rights]] view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7723645.stm|title= Divisions persist over gay marriage ban|author=Mirchandani, Rajesh|work=BBC News|date=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous polls and studies on the issue have been conducted. A trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage has been revealed across many countries of the world, often driven in large part by a generational difference in support. Polling that was conducted in developed democracies in this century shows a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage. Support for same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.&lt;ref name="Gallup2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Newport|first=Frank|title=For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/First-Time-Majority-Americans-Favor-Legal-Gay-Marriage.aspx|access-date=25 September 2012|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Opinion: Nationally|url=http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303043929/http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality/|archive-date=3 March 2011|access-date=25 September 2012|publisher=australianmarriageequality.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Life in Estonia|url=http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716100828/http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia|archive-date=16 July 2012|access-date=25 September 2012|publisher=globalgayz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jowit|first=Juliette|date=12 June 2012|title=Gay marriage gets ministerial approval|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/12/gay-marriage-receive-ministerial-approval|access-date=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 February 2011|title=Most Irish people support gay marriage, poll says|newspaper=PinkNews|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/24/most-irish-people-support-gay-marriage-poll-says|url-status=dead|access-date=25 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926032112/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/24/most-irish-people-support-gay-marriage-poll-says|archive-date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
