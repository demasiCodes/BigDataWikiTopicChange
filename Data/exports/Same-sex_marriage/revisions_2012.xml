'''Same-sex marriage''' (also known as '''gay marriage''') is marriage between two persons of the same [[biological sex]] or [[gender identity]]. Legal recognition for same-sex marriage is also referred to as '''marriage equality'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/06/25/2011-06-25_gay_marriage_in_new_york_lady_gaga_ricky_martin_ellen_de_generes_and_more_celebr.html |title=Gay marriage in New York |work=New York Daily News |quote=Celebs who have long advocated for marriage equality flooded the Twittersphere to rejoice with their fans, friends and partners after Friday's decision in New York. |first=Aliyah |last=Shahid |date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, eleven countries ([[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]], [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]], the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]], [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]], [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]], and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]]) and several sub-national jurisdictions (parts of [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico|Mexico]] and the [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|United States]]) have begun to allow same-sex couples to marry. Introduction of same-sex marriage has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through a legislative change to marriage laws, a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, a ballot initiative, or a referendum. The recognition of same-sex marriage is a political, social, civil-rights and religious issue in many nations, and debates continue to arise over whether same-sex couples should be allowed marriage, be required to hold a different status (a [[civil union]]), or not have any such rights.

Same-sex marriages can be performed in a secular [[Civil marriage|civil ceremony]] or in a religious setting. Various religious groups around the world practice same-sex marriages; for example: &lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY RELIGIOUS GROUPS WHICH ARE NOT MAJOR/NOTABLE DENOMINATIONS OR DISTINCT RELIGIONS WITHOUT PRIOR DISCUSSION. ALSO, DO NOT ADD SIMILAR SECTS OR RELIGIOUS GROUPS. THESE ARE MERELY EXAMPLES; THERE'S NO NEED TO OVERDO THIS LIST. PLEASE CONSIDER PLACING ANY ADDITIONAL DENOMINATIONS IN THE "RELIGION" SUBSECTION. THE CURRENT RELIGIOUS GROUPS DO NOT INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL CONGREGATIONS.--&gt;[[Quakers]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], the [[United Church of Christ]], the [[United Church of Canada]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews, [[Wicca]]ns, [[Neo-Druidism|Druids]], [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]] and [[Native American religion|Native American]] religions with a [[two-spirit]] tradition.

Studies conducted in several countries indicate that support for the legalization of same-sex marriage increases with higher levels of education and that support is strong among younger people. Additionally, polls show that there is rising support for same-sex marriage across all races, ethnicities, ages, religions, socioeconomic statuses, etc.&lt;ref&gt;See

The introduction of same-sex marriage has varied by jurisdiction, resulting from legislative changes to marriage laws, court challenges based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or a combination of the two. The recognition of same-sex marriages is a civil rights, equality, human rights, political, social, moral, and religious issue in many nations. Debates arise over whether same-sex couples should be allowed to enter into marriage, be required to use a different status (such as a civil union, which either grant equal rights as marriage or limited rights in comparison to marriage), or not have any such rights.&lt;ref name=MuslimWaPo&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Pamela K.|title=Marriage: Both Civil and Religious|url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/pamela_k_taylor/2009/07/marriage_both_civil_and_religious.html|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Susan K.|title=Marriage a Civil Right, not Sacred Rite|url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/susan_k_smith/2009/07/marriage_a_civil_right_not_sacred_rite.html|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision in Perry v.

====Adoption====
{{main|LGBT adoption}}
Same-sex marriage can remove legal obstacles to the [[adoption]] of children by lesbian, gay, [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) persons. Adoption can take the form of a joint adoption by a same-sex couple or adoption by one member of a same-sex couple of the other's biological child (step-parent adoption). All countries which allow same-sex marriage also allow joint adoption, with the exception of Portugal. In addition, several countries which do not have marriage equality nonetheless permit joint adoption: Brazil; most of the United Kingdom; Uruguay; Western Australia, NSW, and Canberra within Australia; Coahuilla in Mexico; a number of US states (Rhode Island, New Jersey, California, Indiana, Florida, Arkansas, Illinois, Oregon, Hawaii, Nevada, Delaware, and Guam); and in at least a few cases, Israel.

====Surrogacy and fertility treatment====
{{main|Assisted reproductive technology}}
A gay or bisexual man has the option of [[surrogacy]], the process in which a woman bears a child for another person through [[artificial insemination]] or carries another woman's surgically implanted [[fertilized egg]] to birth. A lesbian or bisexual woman has the option of artificial insemination.&lt;ref&gt;The Fertility Sourcebook, Third Edition – Page 245, M. Sara Rosenthal – 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Family Social Work – Page 348, Donald Collins, Catheleen Jordan, Heather Coleman – 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Major Alan G. Roger at Same-Sex Wedding Ceremony.jpg|thumb|190px|A same-sex wedding ceremony on June 2006.]]
The [[American Psychological Association]] stated in 2004:&lt;ref name="psychological" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The institution of civil marriage confers a social status and important legal benefits, rights, and privileges. ... Same-sex couples are denied equal access to civil marriage. ... Same-sex couples who enter into a civil union are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to married couples ... The benefits, rights, and privileges associated with domestic partnerships are not universally available, are not equal to those associated with marriage, and are rarely portable ... Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, and socioeconomic status ... the APA believes that it is unfair and discriminatory to deny same-sex couples legal access to civil marriage and to all its attendant benefits, rights, and privileges.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Sociological Association]] stated in 2004:&lt;ref name="asa" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman intentionally discriminates against lesbians and gay men as well as their children and other dependents by denying access to the protections, benefits, and responsibilities extended automatically to married couples ... we believe that the official justification for the proposed constitutional amendment is based on prejudice rather than empirical research ... the American Sociological Association strongly opposes the proposed constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Canadian Psychological Association]] stated in 2006:&lt;ref name=cpa2006 /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The literature (including the literature on which opponents to marriage of same-sex couples appear to rely) indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union. As the CPA stated in 2003, the stressors encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent. The CPA recognizes and appreciates that persons and institutions are entitled to their opinions and positions on this issue. However, CPA is concerned that some are mis-interpreting the findings of psychological research to support their positions, when their positions are more accurately based on other systems of belief or values. CPA asserts that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents' relationship is recognized and supported by society's institutions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Anthropological Association]] stated in 2005:&lt;ref name="aaa" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. Rather, anthropological research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded in 2006, in an analysis published in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'':&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;
{{quote|There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. These data have demonstrated no risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with 1 or more gay parents. Conscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, can be excellent parents. The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.}}

The United Kingdom's [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] has stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/PS01_2010x.pdf |author=Royal College of Psychiatrists |title=Royal College of Psychiatrists' Position Statement on Sexual Orientation |accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote| ... lesbian, gay and bisexual people are and should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar {{sic}} rights and responsibilities as all other citizens. This includes ... the rights and responsibilities involved in a civil partnership ...}}

===Health===
In 2010, a [[Columbia University]] [[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health|Mailman School of Public Health]] study examining the effects of institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of [[anxiety disorders]], among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author, the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasin|first=Deborah|title=Lesbian, gay, bisexual individuals risk psychiatric disorders from discriminatory policies|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/cums-lgb030210.php|publisher=[[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health]]|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite news|title=New study suggests bans on gay marriage hurt mental health of LGB people|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-sexual-continuum/201003/new-study-suggests-bans-gay-marriage-hurt-mental-health-lgb-people|accessdate=8 November 2010|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=22 March 2010|author=Dr. Brian Mustanski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York, NY: Henry Holt and Company, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to opposite-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and opposite-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex couples and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Herek, Gregory M.

===Divorce===
{{Main|Divorce of same-sex couples}}

==Transgender and intersex persons==
{{See also|Transsexualism|Legal aspects of transsexualism|Gender identity}}
When sex is defined legally, it may be defined by any one of several criteria: the [[XY sex-determination system]], the type of [[gonad]]s, the type of external sexual features, or the person's social identification. Consequently, both [[transsexual]]s and [[intersex]]ed individuals may be legally categorized into confusing gray areas, and could be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions. This could result in long-term marriages, as well as recent same-sex marriages, being overturned.

The problems of defining gender by the existence/non-existence of gonads or certain sexual features is complicated by the existence of [[Gender Reassignment Surgery|surgical methods]] to alter these features. Estimates&lt;ref&gt;(Fausto-Sterling ''et al.'', 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; run as high as 1 percent of live [[childbirth|birth]]s exhibiting some degree of sexual ambiguity, and between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births being ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including sometimes involuntary surgery to address their sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transsexual to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. "Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality." Archives of Sexual Behavior 38.5 (October 2009): 688–701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the UK marriages are for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her marriage or civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate. Such persons are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual persons to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm |title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage |publisher=365gay.com |date=5 July 2006 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm |archivedate=17 October 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quebec prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried persons could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped.

In the United States, transsexual and intersexual marriages typically run into the complications detailed above. As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Schwartz | first = John | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19brfs-USDEFENDSMAR_BRF.html | title = U.S. Defends Marriage Law |work=The New York Times | date = 18 September 2009 | accessdate =29 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies and polling ==

Polling and studies on the issue has been conducted throughout the first decade of the 21st century as well as before. These polls and studies have shown a consistent trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage across the world. Many developed countries achieved a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage in the first decade of the 21st century. Support for legalization has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race, and region of various developed countries in the world.&lt;ref name=Gallup2011 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Opinion: Nationally|url=http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality/|publisher=australianmarriageequality.com|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Life in Estonia|url=http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia/|publisher=globalgayz.com|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jowit|first=Juliette|title=Gay marriage gets ministerial approval|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/jun/12/gay-marriage-receive-ministerial-approval|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Irish people support gay marriage, poll says|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/24/most-irish-people-support-gay-marriage-poll-says/ Most Irish people support gay marriage, poll says|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=PinkNews|date=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various detailed polls and studies about same-sex marriage conducted in several countries generally show that support for same-sex marriage increases with higher levels of education, and that younger people are more likely to support the legalization of it than older generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey – Generations at Odds: The Millennial Generation and the Future of Gay and Lesbian Rights|url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/08/generations-at-odds/|publisher=[[Public Religion Research Institute]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pew Forum: Part 2: Gay Marriage|url=http://www.pewforum.org/PublicationPage.aspx?id=647|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poirier|first=Justine|title=Same-Sex Marriage: Let's Make a Change|url=http://www.montrealites.ca/justice/same-sex-marriage-lets-make-a-change.html|publisher=Montréalités Justice|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Data Points: Support for Legal Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Chart-Support-for-Legal/64683/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support for Same‐Sex Marriage in Latin America|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/insights/I0844.enrevised.pdf|publisher=[[Vanderbilt University]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls show the most right-wing religious people are more likely to oppose it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waldman|first=Steven|title=A Common Missed Conception|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/faithbased/2003/11/a_common_missed_conception.html|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)]]|date=19 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each U.S. state to hold a voter referendum on the issue prior to November 2012, the public has rejected same-sex marriage laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maine voters reject gay-marriage law|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8789627|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=Associated Press via [[The Guardian]]|date=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent polls indicate that more than half of Americans support same-sex marriage, approximately 53%.&lt;ref name=Gallup2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Newport|first=Frank|title=For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/First-Time-Majority-Americans-Favor-Legal-Gay-Marriage.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langerresearch.com/uploads/1137a2GayMarriage.pdf |title=ABC News/Washington Post poll: Strong Support for Gay Marriage Now Exceeds Strong Opposition – 23 May 2012 |format=PDF |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2012/images/06/06/rel5e.pdf |title=CNN Opinion Research – May 29–31, 2012 |format=PDF |accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several polls and studies have shown that people who personally know a person who is gay are much more likely to support LGBT rights and same-sex marriage than those who do not.&lt;ref name=ABC2012 /&gt; Voters in [[Maine]], [[Maryland]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] approved same-sex marriage by referendum on 6 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2012/11/07/gay-marriage-scores-victories-in-all-four-states-that-considered-it-but-tough-road-lies-ahead/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of same-sex unions|Timeline of same-sex marriage}}

===Ancient===
[[File:Nero 1.JPG|thumb|200px|Emperor [[Nero]] is reported to have married at least two men on different occasions.]]

In the southern Chinese province of [[Fujian]], through the [[Ming dynasty]] period, females would bind themselves in contracts to younger females in elaborate ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Neill&gt;''The origins and role of same-sex relations in human societies'', James Neill, McFarland (5 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Males also entered similar arrangements. This type of arrangement was also similar in ancient European history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Hinsch|first= Bret|title=Passions of the Cut Sleeve: The Male Homosexual Tradition in China|year=1990|publisher=Reed Business Information |isbn=0-520-07869-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of egalitarian male [[domestic partnership]] from the early [[Zhou Dynasty]] period of China is recorded in the story of [[Pan Zhang &amp; Wang Zhongxian]]. While the relationship was clearly approved by the wider community, and was compared to heterosexual marriage, it did not involve a religious ceremony binding the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Hinsch, Bret. (1990). ''Passions of the Cut Sleeve''. University of California Press. pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

The first historical mention of the performance of same-sex marriages occurred during the early [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=boswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=John|title=Same-sex unions in premodern Europe|year=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-75164-5|pages=80–85|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Same_sex_unions_in_premodern_Europe.html?id=iRL9cXA1m1IC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Nero|Emperor Nero]] is reported to have engaged in a marriage ceremony with one of his male slaves. [[Elagabalus|Emperor Elagabalus]] "married" a [[Carian]] slave named Hierocles.&lt;ref name=scarre&gt;{{cite book|last=Scarre|first=Chris|title=Chronicles of the Roman Emperors|year=1995|publisher=Thames and Hudson Ltd|location=London|isbn=0-500-05077-5|pages=151|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Chronicle_of_the_Roman_Emperors.html?id=s1tspwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were usually reported in a critical or satirical manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frier|first=Bruce|title=Roman Same-Sex Weddings from the Legal Perspective|url=http://www.umich.edu/~classics/news/newsletter/winter2004/weddings.html|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted, however, that ''conubium'' existed only between a ''civis Romanus'' and a ''civis Romana'' (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citizen), so that a marriage between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases).&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, ''The Roman Law of Marriage'' (Oxford, 1969), pp. 24–28; Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), pp. 43–49.; "Marriages where the partners had ''conubium'' were marriages valid in Roman law (''iusta matrimonia'')" [Treggiari, p. 49]. Compare Ulpian (''Tituli Ulpiani'' 5.3–5: "''Conubium'' is the capacity to marry a wife in Roman law. Roman citizens have ''conubium'' with Roman citizens, but with Latins and foreigners only if the privilege was granted. There is no ''conubium'' with slaves"; compare also Gaius (''Institutionum'' 1:55–56, 67, 76–80).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "''matrimonium'' is an institution involving a mother, ''mater''. The idea implicit in the word is that a man takes a woman in marriage, ''in matrimonium ducere'', so that he may have children by her."&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the lack of legal validity notwithstanding, there is a consensus among modern historians that same-sex relationships existed in ancient Rome, but the exact frequency and nature of "same-sex unions" during that period is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Eskridge|first= William N.|year= 1993|month= Oct|title= A History of Same-Sex Marriage |journal= Virginia Law Review |volume= 79|issue= 7|id= |url= |quote= The Romans may have accorded some same-sex unions the legal or cultural status of marriage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 342 AD Christian emperors [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]] issued a law in the [[Theodosian Code]] (''C.

A same-sex marriage between the two men Pedro Díaz and Muño Vandilaz in the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] municipality of [[Rairiz de Veiga]] in Spain occurred on 16 April 1061.

====Belgium====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Belgium}}

Belgium became the second country in the world to legally recognize same-sex marriages on 1 June 2003, with the coming into force of a bill passed by the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]]. Originally, Belgium allowed the marriages of foreign same-sex couples only if their country of origin also allowed these unions, however legislation enacted in October 2004 permits any couple to marry if at least one of the spouses has lived in the country for a minimum of three months. A 2006 law enabled legal [[LGBT adoption|adoption by same-sex spouses]].

====Brazil====

[[Supreme Federal Court|Brazil's Supreme Court]] ruled in May 2011 that same-sex couples are legally entitled to [[civil union]]s, stopping short of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BRASILIA|title=Brazil's supreme court recognizes gay partnerships|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/06/us-brazil-gayrights-idUSTRE74503V20110506|accessdate=16 February 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex couples had their civil unions converted into marriage in several Brazil states with the approval of a state judge.

====Canada====
[[File:Wedding-chantelois-gomez.jpg|thumb|150px|A Canadian couple on their wedding day.]]
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Canada}}
Legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Canada followed a series of constitutional challenges based on the [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|equality provisions]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. In the first such case, ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'', same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in [[Same-sex marriage in Ontario|Ontario]] on 14 January 2001 were subsequently validated when the [[common law]], opposite-sex definition of marriage was held to be unconstitutional. Similar rulings had legalized same-sex marriage in eight provinces and one territory when the 2005 ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]'' defined marriage throughout Canada as "the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others."

====Denmark====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Denmark}}
On 7 June 2012 the [[Folketing]] (Danish parliament) approved new laws regarding same-sex civil and religious marriage. These laws permit gay and lesbian couples to get married in the [[Church of Denmark]]. The bills received [[Royal Assent]] on 12 June and took effect on 15 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanners|first=Peter|title=Gay marriage legalised|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/national/updated-gay-marriage-legalised|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=The Copenhagen Post|date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iceland====

Same-sex marriage was introduced in Iceland through legislation establishing a gender-neutral definition of marriage introduced by the coalition government of the [[Social Democratic Alliance]] and [[Left-Green Movement]]. The legislation was passed unanimously by the Icelandic [[Althing]] on 11 June 2010, and took effect on 27 June 2010, replacing an earlier system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65A3V020100611 |title=Iceland passes gay marriage law in unanimous vote |agency=Reuters |date= 11 June 2010|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2010/06/28/new-gay-marriage-law-in-iceland-comes-into-force/ |title=New gay marriage law in Iceland comes into force |work=Icenews |date= 28 June 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] and her partner were among first married same-sex couples in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/iceland/7858150/Iceland-PM-weds-as-gay-marriage-legalised.html |location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph |title=Iceland PM weds as gay marriage legalised |date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Israel}}
Israel's High Court of Justice ruled to honor same-sex marriages granted in other countries even though Israel does not recognize such marriages performed under its own jurisdiction. A bill was raised in the [[Knesset]] (parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but the Knesset has not advanced the bill since December 2006. A bill to legalize same-sex and interfaith civil marriages was defeated in the Knesset 39-11, on 16 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= The Jerusalem Post |url= http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=270221 |title= Knesset rejects marriage equality bill |date= 16 May 2012 |author= Harkov, Lahav |accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2011, the first two same-sex marriages occurred in Quintana Roo after discovering that Quintana Roo's Civil Code did not explicitly prohibit same-sex marriage,&lt;ref name="QR marriages legal"&gt;{{cite news | author=Brisa Muñoz | publisher=CNN México | title=Dos matrimonios homosexuales se casaron en un municipio conservador | date=2 December 2011 | url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/12/02/los-matrimonios-del-mismo-sexo-despiertan-polemica-en-quintana-roo | language=Spanish| accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these marriages were later annulled by the [[governor of Quintana Roo]] in April 2012.&lt;ref name="QR marriages annulled"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=304595|work=[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]]|publisher=Comunicación e Información, S.A. de C.V|title=Anula gobernador de Quintana Roo dos bodas gay; lo acusan de homofóbico|language=Spanish|date=17 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2012|first=Rosa|last=Santana}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, the Secretary of State of Quintana Roo reversed the annulments and allowed for future same-sex marriages to be performed in the state.&lt;ref name="QR marriages reinstated"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/845171.html|language=Spanish|title=Revocan anulación de bodas gay en QRoo|first=Adriana|last=Varillas|work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]|date=3 May 2012|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Netherlands====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands}}

The Netherlands was the first country to extend marriage laws to include same-sex couples, following the recommendation of a special commission appointed to investigate the issue in 1995. A same-sex marriage bill passed the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] and the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] in 2000, taking effect on 1 April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/20/world/same-sex-dutch-couples-gain-marriage-and-adoption-rights.html |title=Same-Sex Dutch Couples Gain Marriage and Adoption Rights |work=The New York Times |date=20 December 2000 |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Norway====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Norway}}

Same-sex marriage became legal in Norway on 1 January 2009 when a gender neutral marriage bill was enacted after being passed by the Norwegian legislature in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway adopts gay marriage law|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jko_BIHizUFFqUtmEaUrAEoPXFWw|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse]] via [[Google]]|date=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-06-17-gaymarriage_N.htm |title=New law in Norway grants gay couples marriage rights |work=USA Today |location =Washington DC |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway became the first Scandinavian country and the sixth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.

Gender neutral marriage replaced Norway's previous system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Couples in registered partnerships are able to retain that status or convert their registered partnership to a marriage. No new registered partnerships may be created.

====Portugal====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Portugal}}
On 8 January 2010, the parliament approved, with 126 votes in favor, 97 against and 7 abstentions, same-sex marriage. The President promulgated the law on 8 April, same-sex marriage become legal since 5 June 2010, thus Portugal became the eighth country to conduct nationwide same-sex marriage.

====South Africa====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in South Africa}}
[[File:Gay troue.jpg|thumb|210px|Same-sex wedding in South Africa, 2007]]
Legal recognition of same-sex marriages in South Africa came about as a result of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]]'s decision in the case of ''[[Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie]]''. The court ruled on 1 December 2005 that the existing marriage laws violated the [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa|equality clause]] of the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]] because they discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. The court gave [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] one year to rectify the inequality. The [[Civil Union Act (South Africa)|Civil Union Act]] was passed by the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] on 14 November 2006, by a vote of 230 to 41, and it came into force on 30 November 2006. South Africa is the fifth country, the first in Africa, and the second outside Europe, to legalize same-sex marriage.

====Spain====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Spain}}
Same-sex marriage has been legal in Spain since 3 July 2005. In 2004, the nation's newly elected [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist]] government, led by [[Prime Minister of Spain|President]] [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], began a campaign for its legalization, including the right of [[LGBT adoption|adoption by same-sex couples]].&lt;ref name="SOD"&gt;{{cite web |title=Spain's new government to legalize gay marriage |work=Reuters |publisher=SignonSanDiego.com |date=15 April 2004 |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20040415-0750-spain-marriage.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kV80Iu9U |archivedate=13 October 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much debate, a law permitting same-sex marriage was passed by the ''[[Cortes Generales]]'' (Spain's [[bicameralism|bicameral parliament]], composed of the [[Spanish Senate|Senate]] and the [[Spanish Congress of Deputies|Congress of Deputies]]) on 30 June 2005 and published on 2 July 2005.

====Sweden====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Sweden}}
Same-sex marriage in Sweden has been legal since 1 May 2009, following the adoption of a new, gender-neutral law on marriage by the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish parliament]] on 1 April 2009, making Sweden the seventh country in the world to open marriage to same sex couples nationwide. Marriage replaced Sweden's registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Existing registered partnerships between same-sex couples remained in force with an option to convert them into marriages.&lt;ref name="swedishmarriagerights"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7978495.stm|title=Sweden allows same-sex marriage|work=BBC News|date=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church of Sweden says yes to gay marriage|url=http://www.thelocal.se/22810/20091022/|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=The Local|date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====

Although same-sex marriages are not recognized federally in the United States, same-sex couples can legally marry in nine states ([[Same-sex marriage in Connecticut|Connecticut]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iowa|Iowa]], [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Same-sex marriage in New York|New York]], [[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]], [[Same-sex marriage in Maine|Maine]], [[Same-sex marriage in Maryland|Maryland]], and [[Same-sex marriage in Washington|Washington]]) and the [[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia|District of Columbia]] and receive state-level benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Deprez |first= Esmé E. |title=State-by-State Laws on Gay Marriage Produce Patchwork Quilt |url= http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-02-09/state-by-state-laws-on-gay-marriage-produce-patchwork-quilt.html |work=BusinessWeek |date=9 February 2012 |location =New York |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Browning |first=William |title= Comparison of Gay Marriage Laws in NINE States |url= http://news.yahoo.com/comparison-gay-marriage-laws-six-states-173600424.html |date=2 August 2011 |author=Browning, William |work=Yahoo!

Also, several states offer [[#Other legally recognized same-sex unions|civil unions or domestic partnerships]], granting all or part of the state-level rights and responsibilities of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hrc.org/laws-and-legislation/state/c/new-jersey |title=LGBT Laws of New Jersey |publisher=HRC.org |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-one states have constitutional restrictions limiting marriage to one man and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aAsubiL17wkQ|accessdate=15 July 2010|newspaper=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=3 December 2009|title=New Jersey May Provide Next Gay Marriage Test After N.Y.

The [[104th United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) in 1996, defining marriage for the first time solely as a union between a man and a woman for all federal purposes, and allowing states to refuse to recognize such marriages created in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/1/7.html |title=US CODE: Title 1,7.

Bruning]]'' (2005), holding that prohibiting recognition of same-sex relationships violated the Constitution, was overturned on appeal by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 2006, which ruled that "laws limiting the state-recognized institution of marriage to heterosexual couples ... do not violate the Constitution of the United States." The [[Washington Supreme Court]], also in 2006, concluded that encouraging procreation within the framework of marriage can be seen as a legitimate government interest furthered by limiting marriage to between opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|opinion = No. 75934-1|pinpoint = p. 41|court = Supreme Court of the State of Washington|date = 26 July 2006|url= http://www.courts.wa.gov/newsinfo/content/pdf/759341opn.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for Northern California]] ruled in ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' that evidence did not show any historical purpose for excluding same-sex couples from marriage, as states have never required spouses to have an ability or willingness to procreate in order to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants = [[Perry v.

The Australian Capital Territory is the first jurisdiction in Australia to legalise [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the Australian Capital Territory|civil partnerships ceremonies]] for gay couples. However, they are not recognised in Australian jurisdictions outside of that territory. [[Registered partnerships]] are available in [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]], Queensland and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

====China====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in the People's Republic of China}}
The ''Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China'' explicitly defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman. No other form of civil union is recognized. The attitude of the Chinese government towards homosexuality is believed to be "three nos": "No approval; no disapproval; no promotion." The Ministry of Health officially removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in 2001.

[[Li Yinhe]], a sociologist and sexologist well known in the Chinese gay community, has tried to legalize same-sex marriage several times, including during the National People's Congress in 2000 and 2004 (''Legalization for Same-Sex Marriage'' 《中国同性婚姻合法化》 in 2000 and the ''Same-Sex Marriage Bill'' 《中国同性婚姻提案》 in 2004). According to Chinese law, 35 delegates' signatures are needed to make an issue a bill to be discussed in the Congress. Her efforts failed due to lack of support from the delegates. A government spokesperson, when asked about Li Yinhe's proposal, said that same-sex marriage was still too "ahead of time" for China. He argued that same-sex marriage was not recognized even in many Western countries, which are considered much more liberal in social issues than China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2006-03-05/10278364854s.shtml |title=政协发言人称同性婚姻太超前 李银河提案再受挫_新闻中心_新浪网 |publisher=News.sina.com.cn |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement is understood as an implication that the government may consider recognition of same-sex marriage in the long run, but not in the near future.

====Colombia====
{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Colombia}}
On Tuesday 26 July 2011, The Constitutional Court of Colombia ordered the Colombian Congress to legislate on the matter of same-sex marriage and that if they fail to, same-sex couples will be granted all marriage rights in two years (on 20 June 2013) automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/07/27/colombia.gay.marriage/ | work=CNN |title=Colombian court says Congress must decide on gay marriage |date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====

Finland may legalize same-sex marriage after the 2011 [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary elections]]; [[Minister of Justice (Finland)|Minister of Justice]] [[Tuija Brax]] said her Ministry was preparing to amend the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriage by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/07/gender-neutral_marriage_law_possible_by_2012_1804013.html |title= Gender-Neutral Marriage Law Possible by 2012 |work=[[YLE|Finnish Broadcasting Company]] |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in France}}
In France in 2006, a 30-member non-[[quorum]] parliamentary commission of the [[French National Assembly]] published a 453-page ''Report on the Family and the Rights of Children'', which [[Same-sex marriage in France|rejected same-sex marriages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2006_docs/Francesummary.pdf |title=Executive summary of "Report on the Family and the Rights of Children" prepared by the French National Assembly |date=25 January 2006|accessdate=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the French National Assembly [[Bill of Patrick Bloche about same-sex marriage|voted against same-sex marriage]] on 15 June 2011.

Following the election of [[François Hollande]] as President of France and the subsequent legislative election in which the Socialist party took a majority of seats in the French National Assembly, the new Prime Minister [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] stated that a same-sex marriage bill would be passed and said that it had already been drafted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Medien|first=Ahmed|title=Gay Marriage Will Soon Become Legal in France, Big Win for LGBT Rights in Europe|url=http://www.policymic.com/articles/9966/gay-marriage-will-soon-become-legal-in-france-big-win-for-lgbt-rights-in-europe|publisher=Policymic.com|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====

In June 2011, [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Germany|Germany]] faced a vote on same-sex marriage.  The issue was opened by the [[Senate of Hamburg|senate of the city-state]] of [[Hamburg]], and would be voted on in the Federal Bundesrat.

====Nepal====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Nepal}}
In November 2008, Nepal's highest court issued final judgment on matters related to LGBT rights, which included permitting gay couples to marry. Same-sex marriage and protection for sexual minorities were to be included in the new Nepalese constitution required to be completed by 31 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nepal/Nepal-charter-to-grant-gay-rights/Article1-499154.aspx |title=Nepal charter to grant gay rights |work=Hindustan Times |date=19 January 2010 |accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Nelson |first=Dean |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/7027736/Nepal-to-stage-gay-weddings-on-Everest.html |title=Nepal 'to stage gay weddings on Everest' |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 January 2010 |accessdate=1 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legislature was unable to agree on the constitution before the deadline and was dissolved after the Supreme Court ruled that the term could not be extended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/world/asia/nepal-disbands-legislature-as-talks-on-constitution-fail.html |title=Legislature in Nepal Disbands in Failure|work=New York Times |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |first1=Kiran |last1=Chapagain |first2=Jim |last2=Yardley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in New Zealand}}
New Zealand's Marriage Act 1955 recognizes marriage rights only for opposite-sex couples. New Zealand's Parliament rejected a bill that would have prohibited the recognition of [[same-sex marriage in New Zealand]] in December 2005. The marriage laws consider [[transsexuals]] who have undergone [[reassignment surgery]] as having changed sex for legal purposes, following Family Court and [[High Court of New Zealand]] decisions in 1995. However the 2005 Civil Union Act allows same-sex and opposite sex couples to have a civil union which under the law is identical to a marriage, with the exception that same-sex couples cannot jointly apply to adopt.

{{As of|November 2012}}, a bill is before [[New Zealand House of Representatives|Parliament]] to legalise same sex marriage in New Zealand. The Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill passed its first reading in August 2012, with 80 votes in favor and 40 votes in opposition (there was one abstention), and is currently before Select Committee for consideration and public submissions. The Committee is due to report back by 28 February 2013 on whether the bill should continue and recommend any amendments to the bill.

====Nigeria====
In 2006, [[Same-sex marriage in Nigeria|Nigerian]] President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] introduced legislation that prohibits same-sex marriages and criminalizes anyone who "performs, witnesses, aids or abets" such ceremonies.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleshman|first=Michael|title=African gays and lesbians combat bias: An ‘invisible’ minority seeks legal safeguards, acceptance|url=http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Igbo people]] of Nigeria, there are circumstances where a marriage between two women is allowed, such as when a woman has no child and the husband dies.&lt;ref name=NigeriaTribune&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100111010506/http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html |archivedate=11 January 2010 |title=Tradition of same gender marriage in Igboland |first=Leo |last=Igwe |publisher=Nigerian Tribune |date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====
In the process of rewriting the Turkish constitution, the opposition party [[Peace and Democracy Party|BDP]], called for the liberalization of the marriage policies, which would include same sex marriage. The biggest opposition party in the Turkish parliament, [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]], supported the idea. The largest party in the parliament, the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]], is against same sex marriage, although Premier [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], the leader of the AKP, supported full equal rights for LGBT citizens in 2002. Same sex marriage will soon be discussed again by members of the parliament, since all political parties gather in committees to establish a new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BDP'nin eşcinsel evlilik isteği tartışılıyor|url=http://www.haber10.com/haber/279069/|publisher=Haber10|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GL|first=Kaos|title=LGBT Initiative from Prime Minister Erdoğan!|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/guide/country_by_country/turkey/lgbt_initiative_from_prime_minister_erdogan|publisher=ILGA Europe|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====

{{main|Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom}}

Since 2005 same-sex couples have been allowed to enter into [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]], a separate union which provides the [[Legal consequences of marriage and civil partnership in the United Kingdom|legal consequences of marriage]]. In 2006 the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] rejected a legal bid by a British lesbian couple who had [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|married]] in Canada to have their union recognised as a marriage in the UK and not as a civil partnership. In September 2011, the Coalition government announced its intention to introduce same-sex civil marriage by the [[Next United Kingdom general election|next general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Jessica|title=Government proposes introducing gay marriage after Cameron intervention|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/09/16/government-proposes-introduction-of-full-gay-marriage-after-cameron-intervention/|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012 the UK government completed a consultation to allow both religious same-sex ceremonies and civil marriage for same-sex couples in England and Wales with the intention of legalising same-sex marriage at some point by 2015.&lt;ref name="grauni1127"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships may soon be welcomed |first=Alan |last=Travis |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/17/civil-partnerships-marriage |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=18 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Government]] conducted a three month long consultation which ended on 9 December 2011 and the analysis was published in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Consultation sees 50,000 responses |work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/politics/consultation_sees_50_000_responses_1_2001639 |accessdate=9 February 2012 |date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the consultation held in England and Wales, Scotland considered both civil and religious same-sex marriage. Whilst the Scottish Government is in favour of same-sex marriage, it stated that no religious body would be forced to hold such ceremonies once legislation is enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scottish Parliament Website |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/09/05153328/1 |publisher=Scottish Government |accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consultation received more than 77,000 responses, and in July the Scottish Cabinet announced plans to introduce legislation to legalise both civil and religious same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay marriage to be introduced in Scotland |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-18981287 |accessdate=25 July 2012 |publisher=BBC News |date=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International organizations===
The terms of employment of the staff of [[international organizations]] (not [[Business|commercial]]) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.

Despite their relative independence, few organizations recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the United Nations recognize same-sex marriages if and only if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Secretary-General Bulletin|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/522/40/PDF/N0452240.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to opposite-sex married couples to ''de facto'' partners or [[domestic partner]]s of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into an opposite-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the [[World Bank]] does recognize domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTHRJOBS/0,,contentMDK:20522360~menuPK:1353209~pagePK:64262408~piPK:64262191~theSitePK:1058433,00.html|title=Jobs&amp;nbsp;— Compensation &amp; Benefits|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main|Religious views on same-sex marriage}}

Arguments on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate are still often made on religious grounds and/or formulated in terms of religious doctrine.

==Controversies==
{{See also|LGBT rights opposition}}
While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the [[history of same-sex unions|historical and anthropological record]] reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, to sympathetic toleration, to indifference, to prohibition.

===Terminology===
Anthropologists have struggled to determine a definition of marriage that absorbs commonalities of the social construct across cultures around the world.&lt;ref name=Fedorak&gt;{{cite book|last=Fedorak|first=Shirley A.|title=Anthropology matters!|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=[Toronto], Ont.|isbn=1442601086|pages=Ch. 11; p. 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gough&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gough|first=Kathleen E.|title=The Nayars and the Definition of Marriage|journal=The Journal of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]]|year=1959|month=Jan. – Jun.|volume=89|issue=1|pages=23–34|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2844434|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many proposed definitions have been criticized for failing to recognize the existence of same-sex marriage in some cultures, including in more than 30 [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African cultures]], such as the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]].&lt;ref name=Gough /&gt;&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stephen O.|title=Boy-wives and female husbands : studies of African homosexualities|year=2001|publisher=St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=0312238290|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjbESL6YWU0C&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;ots=WdlOOaKAAq&amp;dq=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;f=false|edition=1st pbk. ed.|coauthors=Roscoe, Will}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kikuyu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Njambi|first=Wairimu|coauthors=O'Brien, William|title=Revisiting "Woman-Woman Marriage": Notes on Gikuyu Women|journal=[[NWSA Journal]]|year=2001|month=Spring|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–23|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/nwsa_journal/v012/12.1njambi.html|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With several countries revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their definition of the word ''marriage'' to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dictionairies take lead in redefining modern marriage|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/24/20040524-103201-1169r/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[Washington Times]]|date=24 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite web|title=Webster Makes It Official: Definition of Marriage Has Changed|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/webster_makes_it_official_definition_of_marriage_has_changed/|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Redman|first=Daniel|title=Noah Webster Gives His Blessing: Dictionaries recognize same-sex marriage—who knew?|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2215628/|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)]]|date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Dershowitz]] and others have suggested reserving the word ''marriage'' for religious contexts as part of [[privatizing marriage]], and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of [[civil union]]s, in part to strengthen the [[separation between church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Some proponents of legal recognition of same-sex marriage, such as [[Freedom to Marry]] and [[Canadians for Equal Marriage]], use the terms ''marriage equality'' and ''equal marriage'' to indicate that they seek equal benefit of marriage laws as opposed to special rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/issues/marriageequality/|title=Marriage Equality|publisher=Garden State Equality|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/marriage-101#faq3|title=Marriage 101|publisher=[[Freedom to Marry]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of same-sex marriage such as [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] use the term ''traditional marriage'' to mean marriages between one man and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Divine Institution of Marriage|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/the-divine-institution-of-marriage|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bishops discuss religious liberty, marriage, finances at annual meeting|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1104473.htm|work=Catholic New Service|location=Baltimore|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=23282 |work=Baptist Press|title=Marriage Protection Sunday: Churches encouraged to address 'gay marriage'|date=19 May 2006 |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-same-sex-marriage activist [[Maggie Gallagher]] argues that equating same-sex and opposite-sex marriages changes the meaning of marriage and its traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Maggie. "Traditional Marriage Trifecta in the Making?." Human Events 64.36 (20 October 2008): 17–17. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publications that oppose same-sex marriage, such as ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' and [[Baptist Press]], have an editorial style policy of placing the word ''marriage'' in [[scare quotes]] ("marriage") when it is used in reference to same-sex couples. In the United States, the mainstream press has generally abandoned this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/02/25/washington-times-scare-quotes-are-history/ |title=Washington Times Scare Quotes Are History |work=Washington City Paper |author= Wemple, Erik |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cliff Kincaid of the conservative [[Accuracy in Media]] argues for use of quotation marks on the grounds that marriage is a legal status denied same-sex couples by most state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/honest-versus-slanted-journalism/ |title=Honest Versus Slanted Journalism |work=[[Accuracy In Media]] |author=Kincaid, Cliff |date=26 February 2004 |accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage supporters argue that the use of scare quotes is an editorialization that implies illegitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[AP Stylebook|Associated Press style]] recommends the usages ''marriage for gays and lesbians'' or in space-limited headlines ''gay marriage'' with no hyphen and no scare quotes. The Associated Press warns that the construct ''gay marriage'' can imply that marriages of gay and lesbian couples are somehow legally different from those of opposite-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Robyn|title=When I Get Married, Will It Be a 'Gay Marriage'?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robyn-harper/marriage-equality_b_1572611.html|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Robyn|title=My Marriage Won't Be a 'Gay Marriage'|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/my-marriage-wont-gay-marriage-11514384.html?cat=41|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=Yahoo!|date=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Same-sex marriage also can be described with the term ''homogamous marriage'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Phillip|title=Homogamy Unmodified|journal=Journal of Family Theory and Review|year=2011|month=March|volume=3|issue=1|pages=47–51|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-2589.2010.00080.x/abstract|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the scientific tradition of [[English words of Greek origin|Greek]] and [[List of Latin words with English derivatives|Latin]] terms for family type.

===Judicial and legislative===
{{Main|Conflict of marriage laws#Same-sex marriage}}
There are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A "[[direct democracy|majority rules]]" position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm |title= Poll: Calif. gay marriage ban driven by religion |author=Leff, Lisa |agency=Associated Press |date=4 December 2008 |work=USA Today}} archived here [http://www.webcitation.org/68OwEop7Y].&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a "[[civil rights]]" view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7723645.stm |title= Divisions persist over gay marriage ban |author=Mirchandani, Rajesh |work=BBC News |date= 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fictional same-sex marriage ==
&lt;!-- This section is devoted solely to fictional places that feature same-sex marriage, please try not to mention fictional characters that are married, as that list could go on and on. --&gt;

Same-sex marriages and relationships have been a theme in several fictional story arcs, mythology, cult classics, and video games. Same-sex marriage is possible in an increasing number of modern video games including: ''[[Fable II]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masaki|first=Lyle|title=Same-sex marriage in the Fable games was no big deal for Peter Molyneux|url=http://www.afterelton.com/blog/lylemasaki/same-sex-marriage-in-fable2|publisher=[[AfterElton.com]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopkins|first=Tom|title=Skyrim Includes Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/news/1028931/skyrim_includes_samesex_marriage.html|publisher=nowgamer.com|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fallout 2]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hirshman |first=Linda |url= http://www.salon.com/2007/04/28/gay_dwarves/ |title=Why can't gay dwarves get married in Middle-earth? |work=Salon.com |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Sims 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masaki|first=Lyle|title="The Sims 3" makes full-on gay marriage a virtual reality|url=http://www.afterelton.com/blog/lylemasaki/the-sims-3-includes-gay-marriage|publisher=[[AfterElton.com]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is very little mention of [[Sexuality in Star Trek|homosexuality in the official works of the ''Star Trek'' franchise]], the independent fan series ''[[Star Trek: Hidden Frontier]]'' featured a same-sex marriage ceremony in the series finale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIY "Star Trek" movies|url=http://www.stevehoffman.tv/forums/archive/index.php/t-119521.html|publisher=stevehoffman.tv|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'', a spin-off series within the ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' saga and primary setting of the series features [[Sam Adama]], a prominent character who is married to another man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/detail.asp?id=26653 |title=Need To Know: Sasha Roiz |publisher=Out.com |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In issue #51 of the ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' comic series, the superhero [[Northstar|Jean-Paul Beaubier]] married his partner Kyle Jinadu, making him the first superhero in history to have a same-sex marriage in a mainstream comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peeples|first=Jase|title=Comic Books Take a Big Leap Forward With Gay Wedding|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/comics-and-graphic-novels/2012/06/19/get-early-look-how-marvel-comics-depicts|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Advocate]]|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
