'''Same-sex marriage''', also known as '''gay marriage''', is [[marriage]] between [[same-sex relationship|people of the same sex]], either as a secular [[Civil marriage|civil ceremony]] or in a religious setting.

In the late 20th century, religious rites of marriage without legal recognition became increasingly common. The first law providing for marriage of people of the same sex in modern times was enacted in 2001 in the [[Netherlands]]. {{As of|2015|11|16|df=y}}, fourteen countries ([[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]], [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]], [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]], [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Ireland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]], [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]], [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]], [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]]) and certain sub-jurisdictions (parts of [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]],&lt;ref group="nb" name="Denmark"&gt;[[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark proper]].

Introduction of same-sex marriage laws has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through legislative change to [[marriage laws]], a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or by direct popular vote (via [[ballot initiative]] or [[referendum]]). The recognition of same-sex marriage is a political and social issue, and also a religious issue in many countries, and debates continue to arise over whether people in same-sex relationships should be allowed marriage or some similar status (a [[civil union]]).&lt;ref name=MuslimWaPo&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Pamela K. |title= Marriage: Both Civil and Religious |url= http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2009/07/31/marriage-both-civil-and-religious/3855 |accessdate=15 July 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Susan K. |title= Marriage a Civil Right, not Sacred Rite |url= http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/susan_k_smith/2009/07/marriage_a_civil_right_not_sacred_rite.html |accessdate=20 September 2012 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision in Perry v.

Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that recognition of same-sex marriages would erode religious freedoms, undermine a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father or erode the institution of marriage itself. 

Some analysts state that financial, psychological and physical well-being are enhanced by marriage, and that children of same-sex parents or carers benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union supported by society's institutions.&lt;ref name="psychological"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf |title=Resolution on Sexual Orientation and Marriage |year=2004 |author=American Psychological Association |accessdate=10 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110511190536/http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.asanet.org/public/marriage_res.html |author=American Sociological Association |title=American Sociological Association Member Resolution on Proposed U.S. Constitutional Amendment Regarding Marriage |accessdate=10 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070812175917/http://www2.asanet.org/public/marriage_res.html |archivedate=12 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amici"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/10/27/amicus29.pdf|title=Brief of the American Psychological Association, The California Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy as amici curiae in support of plaintiff-appellees&amp;nbsp;– Appeal from United States District Court for the Northern District of California Civil Case No. 09-CV-2292 VRW (Honorable Vaughn R.

==Terminology==

===Alternative terms===
Some proponents of legal recognition of same-sex marriage, such as [[Freedom to Marry]] and [[Canadians for Equal Marriage]], use the terms ''marriage equality'' and ''equal marriage'' to indicate that they seek equal benefit of marriage laws as opposed to special rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenstateequality.org/issues/marriageequality/|title=Marriage Equality|publisher=Garden State Equality|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/marriage-101#faq3|title=Marriage 101|publisher=[[Freedom to Marry]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:AENN&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=13F21B414EDA8168&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46 |title=Albany area real estate and the Marriage Equality Act |date=29 May 2012|work=Albany Examiner |accessdate=25 December 2012 |author=Pratt, Patricia |quote=On July 24, 2011 the Marriage Equality Act became a law in New York State forever changing the state's legal view of what a married couple is.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Vote on Illinois marriage equality bill coming in January: sponsors |url= http://chicagophoenix.com/2012/12/13/illinois-marriage-equality-vote-january/ |accessdate=23 December 2012 |newspaper=Chicago Phoenix |date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission endorses marriage and adoption equality |url=http://www.hrc.co.nz/human-rights-environment/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity/commission-endorses-marriage-and-adoption-equality |publisher=Human Right Commission New Zealand |date=n.d. |accessdate=23 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121202132031/http://www.hrc.co.nz/human-rights-environment/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity/commission-endorses-marriage-and-adoption-equality |archivedate=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mulholland |first=Helene |title=Ed Miliband calls for gay marriage equality |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/27/ed-miliband-gay-wedding-equality |accessdate=23 December 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian|location =London |date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ring"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2012/12/20/newt-gingrich-accepts-marriage-equality-inevitable |title=Newt Gingrich: Marriage Equality Inevitable, OK |author=Ring, Trudy |work =The Advocate |location=Los Angeles |date=20 December 2012 |quote=He [Newt Gingrich] noted to HuffPo that he not only has a lesbian half-sister, LGBT rights activist Candace Gingrich, but has gay friends who've gotten married in Iowa, where their unions are legal.

Opponents of the legalization of same-sex marriage sometimes characterize it as ''redefining marriage'' or ''redefined marriage'', especially in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=State lacks authority to redefine marriage, says bishop|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/state-lacks-authority-to-redefine-marriage-says-bishop/|work=Catholic News Agency|publisher=CNA|accessdate=20 December 2013|date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Redefining marriage, one dictionary at a time|url=http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/redefining-marriage-one-dictionary-time|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=MSNBC|date=18 July 2013|author=Will Rabbe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AP Stylebook|Associated Press style]] recommends the usages ''marriage for gays and lesbians'' or in space-limited headlines ''gay marriage'' with no hyphen and no scare quotes. The Associated Press warns that the construct ''gay marriage'' can imply that marriages of same-sex couples are somehow legally different from those of mixed-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper|first=Robyn|title=When I Get Married, Will It Be a 'Gay Marriage'?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robyn-harper/marriage-equality_b_1572611.html|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harper |first=Robyn |title=My Marriage Won't Be a 'Gay Marriage' |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/my-marriage-wont-gay-marriage-11514384.html?cat=41 |accessdate=28 September 2012 |publisher=Yahoo! |date=30 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120928202736/http://voices.yahoo.com/my-marriage-wont-gay-marriage-11514384.html?cat=41 |archivedate=28 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of term ''marriage''===
Anthropologists have struggled to determine a definition of marriage that absorbs commonalities of the social construct across cultures around the world.&lt;ref name=Fedorak&gt;{{cite book|last=Fedorak|first=Shirley A.|title=Anthropology matters!|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=[Toronto], Ont.|isbn=1442601086|pages=Ch. 11; p. 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gough&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gough|first=Kathleen E.|title=The Nayars and the Definition of Marriage|journal=The Journal of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]]|date=Jan–Jun 1959 |volume=89|issue=1|pages=23–34|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/2844434|accessdate=28 September 2012|doi=10.2307/2844434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many proposed definitions have been criticized for failing to recognize the existence of same-sex marriage in some cultures, including in more than 30 [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African cultures]], such as the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]].&lt;ref name=Gough /&gt;&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Stephen O.|title=Boy-wives and female husbands : studies of African homosexualities|year=2001|publisher=St. Martin's|location=New York|isbn=0312238290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjbESL6YWU0C&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;ots=WdlOOaKAAq&amp;dq=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;f=false|edition=1st pbk.|author2=Roscoe, Will }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kikuyu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Njambi|first=Wairimu|author2=O'Brien, William|title=Revisiting "Woman-Woman Marriage": Notes on Gikuyu Women|journal=[[NWSA Journal]]|date=Spring 2001|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–23|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/nwsa_journal/v012/12.1njambi.html|accessdate=28 September 2012|doi=10.1353/nwsa.2000.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With several countries revising their marriage laws to recognize same-sex couples in the 21st century, all major English dictionaries have revised their definition of the word ''marriage'' to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dictionaries take lead in redefining modern marriage|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/24/20040524-103201-1169r/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=24 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;{{cite web|title=Webster Makes It Official: Definition of Marriage Has Changed|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/webster_makes_it_official_definition_of_marriage_has_changed/|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news|last=Redman|first=Daniel|title=Noah Webster Gives His Blessing: Dictionaries recognize same-sex marriage—who knew?|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2215628/|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)]]|date=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Dershowitz]] and others have suggested reserving the word ''marriage'' for religious contexts as part of [[privatizing marriage]], and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of [[civil union]]s, in part to strengthen the [[separation between church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rossde.com/editorials/Dershowitz_marriage.html|title=Government Should Quit the Marriage Business|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Dershowitz, Alan M.|authorlink=Alan Dershowitz|date=3 December 2003|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Roback Morse]], the president of the anti-same-sex marriage group [[National Organization for Marriage]]'s Ruth Institute project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruthinstitute.org/pages/boardMembers.html |title=Board of Advisors |publisher=Ruth Institute |accessdate=6 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20091004193603/http://ruthinstitute.org:80/pages/boardMembers.html |archivedate=4 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the conflation of marriage with contractual agreements is a threat to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/morse200405200926.asp |title=''Not'' a Social Contract |work=[[National Review]] |author=Morse, Jennifer Roback |authorlink=Jennifer Roback Morse |date=20 May 2004 |accessdate=8 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20061029161345/http://www.nationalreview.com:80/comment/morse200405200926.asp |archivedate=29 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publications that oppose same-sex marriage, such as ''[[WorldNetDaily]]'' and [[Baptist Press]], have an editorial style policy of placing the word ''marriage'' in [[scare quotes]] ("marriage") when it is used in reference to same-sex couples.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In the United States, the mainstream press has generally abandoned this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/02/25/washington-times-scare-quotes-are-history/|title=Washington Times Scare Quotes Are History|work=Washington City Paper|author=Wemple, Erik|date=25 February 2008|accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cliff Kincaid of the conservative [[Accuracy in Media]] argued for use of quotation marks on the grounds that marriage was a legal status denied same-sex couples by most US state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/honest-versus-slanted-journalism/|title=Honest Versus Slanted Journalism|publisher=[[Accuracy In Media]]|author=Kincaid, Cliff|date=26 February 2004|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage supporters argue that the use of scare quotes is an editorialization that implies illegitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/b/2004/05/21/washington-times-dismisses-gay-marriages.htm|title=Washington Times Dismisses Gay "Marriages"|publisher=About.com|author=Cline, Austin|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
The [[American Anthropological Association]] stated on February 26, 2004:&lt;ref name="aaa" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. Rather, anthropological research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2010, a [[Columbia University]] [[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health|Mailman School of Public Health]] study examining the effects of institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of [[anxiety disorders]], among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author, the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental health and well-being of LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasin|first=Deborah|title=Lesbian, gay, bisexual individuals risk psychiatric disorders from discriminatory policies|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/cums-lgb030210.php|publisher=[[Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health]]|accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite news|title=New study suggests bans on gay marriage hurt mental health of LGB people|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-sexual-continuum/201003/new-study-suggests-bans-gay-marriage-hurt-mental-health-lgb-people|accessdate=8 November 2010|newspaper=[[Psychology Today]]|date=22 March 2010|author=Dr. Brian Mustanski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Herek, Gregory M. "Legal recognition of same-sex relationships in the United States: A social science perspective." ''American Psychologist,'' Vol 61(6), September 2006, 607–621.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Psychological Association]] stated in 2004: "...Denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status and so on." It has also averred that same-sex couples who may only enter into a civil union, as opposed to a marriage, "are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to those of married couples," which has adverse affects on the well-being of same-sex partners.&lt;ref name="psychological" /&gt;

In 2009, a pair of economists at [[Emory University]] tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact: Elaine Justice: 404.727.0643|url=http://www.emory.edu/home/news/releases/2009/06/study-links-gay-marriage-bans-to-rise-in-hiv-rate.html|title=Study Links Gay Marriage Bans to Rise in HIV infections|publisher=Emory University|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peng|first=Handie|title= The Effect of Same-Sex Marriage Laws on Public Health and Welfare|url=http://emory.academia.edu/HandiePeng/Papers/430809/The_Effects_of_Same-Sex_Marriage_Laws_on_Public_Health_and_Welfare|publisher=academia.edu|accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study linked the passage of a same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Francis|first1=AM|last2=Mialon|first2=HM|author8=Andrew M.

===Parenting===
Many psychologist organizations have concluded that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents' relationship is recognized and supported by society's institutions, e.g. civil marriage. For example, the [[Canadian Psychological Association]] stated in 2006 that "parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union."&lt;ref name=cpa2006 /&gt; The CPA stated in 2003 the stressors encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent.&lt;ref name=cpa2006 /&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded in 2006, in an analysis published in the journal ''[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]]'':&lt;ref name="aap2006"/&gt;
{{quote|There is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. These data have demonstrated no risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with 1 or more gay parents. Conscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, can be excellent parents. The rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.}}

===Opinion polling===
[[File:Rainbow flag breeze.jpg|thumb| LGBT [[rainbow flag]]]]
Numerous polls and studies on the issue have been conducted, including those that were completed throughout the first decade of the 21st century. A consistent trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage has been revealed across the world. Much of the research that was conducted in developed countries in the first decade of the 21st century shows a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage. Support for legal same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.&lt;ref name=Gallup2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Newport|first=Frank|title=For First Time, Majority of Americans Favor Legal Gay Marriage|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/147662/First-Time-Majority-Americans-Favor-Legal-Gay-Marriage.aspx|publisher=[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Opinion: Nationally |url=http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality/ |publisher=australianmarriageequality.com |accessdate=25 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120924195125/http://www.australianmarriageequality.com/wp/who-supports-equality/a-majority-of-australians-support-marriage-equality/ |archivedate=24 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Life in Estonia |url=http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia/ |publisher=globalgayz.com |accessdate=25 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120716100828/http://www.globalgayz.com/europe/estonia/gay-life-in-estonia/ |archivedate=16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jowit|first=Juliette|title=Gay marriage gets ministerial approval|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/jun/12/gay-marriage-receive-ministerial-approval|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 June 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Most Irish people support gay marriage, poll says|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/02/24/most-irish-people-support-gay-marriage-poll-says/ |accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=PinkNews|date=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent polling in the [[United States]] has shown a further increase in public support for same-sex marriage. When adults were asked in 2005 if they thought "marriages between homosexuals should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages", 28 percent replied in the affirmative, while 68 percent replied in the negative (the remaining 4 percent stated that they were unsure). When adults were asked in March 2013 if they supported or opposed same-sex marriage, 50 percent said they supported same-sex marriage, while 41 percent were opposed, and the remaining 9 percent stated that they were unsure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law and Civil Rights|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/civil.htm|work=PollingReport.com|publisher=POLLING REPORT, INC|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various detailed polls and studies on same-sex marriage that were conducted in several countries show that support for same-sex marriage generally increases with higher levels of education and decreases with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey&amp;nbsp;– Generations at Odds: The Millennial Generation and the Future of Gay and Lesbian Rights|url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/08/generations-at-odds/|publisher=[[Public Religion Research Institute]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pew Forum: Part 2: Gay Marriage |url=http://www.pewforum.org/PublicationPage.aspx?id=647 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |accessdate=25 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120910053311/http://www.pewforum.org/PublicationPage.aspx?id=647 |archivedate=10 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poirier|first=Justine|title=Same-Sex Marriage: Let's Make a Change|url=http://www.montrealites.ca/justice/same-sex-marriage-lets-make-a-change.html|publisher=Montréalités Justice|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Data Points: Support for Legal Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Chart-Support-for-Legal/64683/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support for Same‐Sex Marriage in Latin America|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/insights/I0844.enrevised.pdf|publisher=[[Vanderbilt University]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient===
The first historical mention of the performance of same-sex marriages occurred during the early [[Roman Empire]] according to controversial&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;Shaw criticises Boswell's methodology and conclusions as disingenuous {{cite journal |last= Shaw|first= Brent|authorlink=Brent Shaw |date=July 1994|title= A Groom of One's Own?|journal= [[The New Republic]]|volume= |issue= |pages= 43–48|id= |url= http://www.learnedhand.com/shaw_boswell.htm |accessdate= 25 June 2009|quote= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060507014622/http://www.learnedhand.com/shaw_boswell.htm |archivedate = 7 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; historian [[John Boswell]].&lt;ref name=boswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Boswell|first=John|title=Same-sex unions in premodern Europe|year=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-75164-5|pages=80–85|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Same_sex_unions_in_premodern_Europe.html?id=iRL9cXA1m1IC}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were usually reported in a critical or satirical manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frier|first=Bruce|title=Roman Same-Sex Weddings from the Legal Perspective|url=http://www.umich.edu/~classics/news/newsletter/winter2004/weddings.html|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child emperor [[Elagabalus]] referred to his [[quadriga|chariot]] driver, a blond slave from [[Caria]] named [[Hierocles (charioteer)|Hierocles]], as his husband.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, M., ''Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire'',Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; He also married an athlete named Zoticus in a lavish public ceremony in Rome amidst the rejoicings of the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius '' Epitome '' 80.5, 80.14, 80.15, 80.16; Herodian ''Roman History '' 5.6.1–5.6.2.

The first Roman emperor to have married a man was [[Nero]], who is reported to have married two other males on different occasions.  The first was with one of Nero's own [[Freedman|freedmen]], [[Pythagoras (freedman)|Pythagoras]], with whom Nero took the role of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, CA., ''Roman Homosexuality: Second Edition'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, as a groom, Nero married [[Sporus]], a young boy, to replace the teenage female concubine he had killed&lt;ref name="dio-history-LXII-28"&gt;Nero missed her so greatly that, on learning of a woman who resembled her, he sent for her and kept her; but later he caused a boy of the freedmen, whom he used to call Sporus, ... "he formally "married" Sporus, and assigned the boy a regular dowry according to contract;" q.v., Suetonius ''Nero'' 28; Dio Cassius '' Epitome '' 62.28
Old Translation of passage at:http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html&lt;/ref&gt; and married him in a very public ceremony with all the solemnities of matrimony, after which Sporus was forced to pretend to be the female concubine that Nero had killed and act as though they were really married.&lt;ref name="dio-history-LXII-28"/&gt; A friend gave the "bride" away as required by law. The marriage was celebrated in both Greece and Rome in extravagant public ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius '' Epitome '' 62.28, 62.13. Old Translation of passage at: http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted, however, that ''conubium'' existed only between a ''civis Romanus'' and a ''civis Romana'' (that is, between a male Roman citizen and a female Roman citizen), so that a marriage between two Roman males (or with a slave) would have no legal standing in Roman law (apart, presumably, from the arbitrary will of the emperor in the two aforementioned cases).&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, ''The Roman Law of Marriage'' (Oxford, 1969), pp. 24–28; Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), pp. 43–49.; "Marriages where the partners had ''conubium'' were marriages valid in Roman law (''iusta matrimonia'')" [Treggiari, p. 49]. Compare Ulpian (''Tituli Ulpiani'') 5.3–5: "''Conubium'' is the capacity to marry a wife in Roman law. Roman citizens have ''conubium'' with Roman citizens, but with Latins and foreigners only if the privilege was granted. There is no ''conubium'' with slaves"; compare also Gaius (''Institutionum'' 1:55–56, 67, 76–80).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Susan Treggiari, "''matrimonium'' was then an institution involving a mother, ''mater''. The idea implicit in the word is that a man took a woman in marriage, ''in matrimonium ducere'', so that he might have children by her."&lt;ref&gt;Treggiari, ''Roman Marriage'' (Oxford, 1991), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, the lack of legal validity notwithstanding, there is a consensus among modern historians that same-sex relationships existed in ancient Rome, though the frequency and nature of "same-sex unions" during that period are obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eskridge|first=William N.|date=Oct 1993|title=A History of Same-Sex Marriage |journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=79|issue=7|quote=The Romans may have accorded some same-sex unions the legal or cultural status of marriage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 342 AD Christian emperors [[Constantius II]] and [[Constans]] issued a law in the [[Theodosian Code]] (''C. Th.'' 9.7.3) prohibiting [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|same-sex marriage in Rome]] and ordering execution for those so married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuefler|first=Mathew|year=2007|title=The Marriage Revolution in Late Antiquity: The Theodosian Code and Later Roman Marriage Law|journal=Journal of Family History|volume=32|pages=343–370|url=http://jfh.sagepub.com/cgi/content/short/32/4/343|doi=10.1177/0363199007304424|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
A same-sex marriage between the two men Pero Dias and Munho Vandilas in the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] municipality of [[Rairiz de Veiga]] in Spain occurred on 16 April 1061. They were married by a priest at a small chapel. The historic documents about the church wedding were found at [[Monastery of San Salvador de Celanova]].&lt;ref name="firstmarriage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farodevigo.es/portada-ourense/2011/02/27/primer-matrimonio-homosexual-galicia-oficio-1061-rairiz-veiga/522378.html |author=M.J.A. |title= El primer matrimonio homosexual de Galicia se ofició en 1061 en Rairiz de Veiga |accessdate=27 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
Writing in ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'' in 2013, legal historian [[Michael Klarman]] wrote that while there was a growth of gay rights activism in the 1970s United States, "Marriage equality was not then a priority."  He argued that many gay people were not initially interested in marriage, deeming it to be a traditionalist institution, and that the search for legal recognition of same-sex relationships began in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Same-Sex Marriage Came to Be|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/03/how-same-sex-marriage-came-to-be|date=March–April 2013|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Faramerz Dabhoiwala writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', say that the modern movement began in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The secret history of same-sex marriage|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/23/-sp-secret-history-same-sex-marriage|accessdate=26 July 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denmark was the first state to recognize a legal relationship for same-sex couples, establishing "registered partnerships" in 1989. This gave those in same-sex relationships "most rights of married heterosexuals, but not the right to adopt or obtain joint custody of a child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rule|first=Sheila|title=Rights for Gay Couples in Denmark|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/02/world/rights-for-gay-couples-in-denmark.html|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=2 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref group="nb" name="Netherlands" /&gt;  became the first nation in the world to grant [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|same-sex marriages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/05/26/f-same-sex-timeline.html|title=Same-sex marriage around the world|work=CBC News|location=Toronto|date=26 May 2009|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then same-sex marriages have been granted and mutually recognized by [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legislative record of the same-sex marriage bill (in Dutch)|url=http://www.senaat.be/www/?MIval=/dossier&amp;LEG=2&amp;NR=1173&amp;LANG=nl|publisher=senaat.be (Belgian Senate)|accessdate=25 September 2012}} and {{cite web|title=Legislative record of the same-sex marriage bill (in French)|url=http://www.senaat.be/www/?MIval=/dossier&amp;LEG=2&amp;NR=1173&amp;LANG=fr|publisher=senaat.be (Belgian Senate)|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Same-sex marriage in Norway|Norway]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009), [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|Portugal]] (2010),&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/05/17/portugal-gay017.html|title=Portugal's president signs gay marriage bill|work=CBC News|location =Toronto|date=17 May 2010|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Iceland]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|Argentina]] (2010), [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] (2012),&lt;ref group="nb" name="Denmark" /&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in France|France]] (2013), [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|Uruguay]]

In 2010 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled on ''[[Schalk and Kopf v Austria]]'', a case involving an Austrian same-sex couple who were denied the right to marry.&lt;ref name="CASE OF SCHALK AND KOPF v.

However, the ECHR stated in ''Schalk and Kopf v Austria'' that this provision was intended to limit marriage to heterosexual relationships, as it used the term "men and women" instead of "everyone".&lt;ref name="CASE OF SCHALK AND KOPF v.

[[File:Tchemiguel Liège Willy Demeyer.jpg|thumb|210px|Mayor of [[Liège]], Willy Demeyer, officiating at the wedding of a gay couple.]]

Belgium became the second country in the world to legally recognize same-sex marriages when a bill passed by the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]] took effect on 1 June 2003. Originally, Belgium allowed the marriages of foreign same-sex couples only if their country of origin also allowed these unions, however legislation enacted in October 2004 permits any couple to marry if at least one of the spouses has lived in the country for a minimum of three months. A 2006 statute legalized [[LGBT adoption|adoption by same-sex spouses]].

==== Brazil ====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Brazil}}
{{Same-sex marriage map South America|align=left}}
[[Supreme Federal Court|Brazil's Supreme Court]] ruled in May 2011 that same-sex couples are legally entitled to legal recognition of cohabitation (known as {{lang|pt|''união estável''}}, one of the two possible ''family entities'' in Brazilian legislation, it includes all family and married couple rights in Brazil – besides automatic opt-in for one of four systems of property share and automatic right to inheritance –, and was available for all same-sex couples since the same date), turning same-sex marriage legally possible as a consequence, and just stopping short of equalization of same-sex marriage (potentially confusing, a civil marriage or {{lang|pt|''casamento civil''}} is often rendered as {{lang|pt|''união civil''}} in legal Brazilian Portuguese; a same-sex marriage is a {{lang|pt|''casamento civil homoafetivo''}} or an {{lang|pt|''união civil homoafetiva''}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazil's supreme court recognizes gay partnerships|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/06/us-brazil-gayrights-idUSTRE74503V20110506|accessdate=16 February 2012|agency=Reuters|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between mid-2011 and May 2013, same-sex couples had their cohabitation issues converted into marriage in several Brazil states with the approval of a state judge. All legal Brazilian marriages were always recognized all over Brazil.&lt;ref name="WPost"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/brazil-judge-approves-what-appears-to-be-countrys-first-gay-marriage-between-2-men/2011/06/27/AGYN2znH_story.html |title=Brazilian judge gives male couple approval for what court says is country's first gay marriage |date=27 June 2011 |work=The Washington Post |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5zsXujTvb |archivedate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, the Court of Bahia equalized marriage in the state of [[Bahia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5.tjba.jus.br/corregedoria/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=420:uniaohomoafetiva&amp;catid=31:noticias&amp;Itemid=142 |title=Provimento Conjunto trata de união homoafetiva |work=Tribunal de Justiça do Estado da Bahia (official web site of the state supreme court) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130927065759/http://www5.tjba.jus.br/corregedoria/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=420:uniaohomoafetiva&amp;catid=31:noticias&amp;Itemid=142 |archivedate=27 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brasil247.com/pt/247/bahia247/86361/Bahia-já-pode-oficializar-casamento-homoafetivo.htm|language=Portuguese|date=27 November 2012|accessdate=27 November 2012|title=Bahia já pode oficializar casamento homoafetivo|work= Bahia24/7&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] likewise had same-sex marriage allowed in demand by Court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norma do TJ obriga cartórios de SP a registrar casamento gay|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/1203680-norma-do-tj-obriga-cartorios-de-sp-a-registrar-casamento-gay.shtml|newspaper=Folha de S. Paulo|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriages also became equalized in relation to opposite-sex ones between January 2012 and April 2013 by Court order in Alagoas, Ceará, Espírito Santo, the Federal District, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraíba, Paraná, Piauí, Rondônia, Santa Catarina and Sergipe, and in Santa Rita do Sapucaí, a municipality in Minas Gerais; in Rio de Janeiro, the State Court facilitated its realization by district judges in agreement with the equalization (instead of ordering notaries to accept same-sex marriages in demand as all others).

On 14 May 2013, The Justice's [[National Justice Council|National Council of Brazil]] issues a ruling requiring all civil registers of the country to perform same-sex marriages by a 14–1 vote, thus legalizing same-sex marriage in the entire country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/cidades,cnj-obriga-cartorios-a-celebrar-casamento-entre-homossexuais,1031678,0.htm |title=CNJ obriga cartórios a celebrar casamento entre homossexuais |publisher=Estadao.com.br |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2013/05/apos-uniao-estavel-gay-podera-casar-em-cartorio-decide-cnj.html|title=G1 - Decisão do CNJ obriga cartórios a fazer casamento homossexual - notícias em Política|work=Política|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jb.com.br/pais/noticias/2013/05/14/cnj-obriga-cartorios-a-converterem-uniao-estavel-gay-em-casamento/|title=Jornal do Brasil|work=Jornal do Brasil|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution came into effect on 16 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.cnj.jus.br/dje/jsp/dje/DownloadDeDiario.jsp?dj=DJ89_2013-ASSINADO.PDF&amp;statusDoDiario=ASSINADO DIÁRIO DA JUSTIÇA CONSELHO NACIONAL DE JUSTIÇA Edição nº 89/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2013/05/regra-que-obriga-cartorios-fazer-casamento-gay-vale-partir-do-dia-16.html Regra que obriga cartórios a fazer casamento gay vale a partir do dia 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, polls suggested that 47% of Brazilians supported marriage equalization and 57% supported adoption equalization for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portugues.christianpost.com/news/quase-metade-dos-internautas-brasileiros-aprova-o-casamento-gay-15398/ Almost half of Brazilian internet users support gay marriage – The Christian Post in Portuguese] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls in June 2013 also supported the conclusion that the division of opinion between acceptance and rejection of same-sex marriage is in about equal halves. When the distinction between same-sex unions that are not termed marriages in relation to same-sex marriage is made, the difference in the numbers of approval and disapproval is still insignificant, below 1%; the most frequent reason for disapproval is a supposed 'unnaturalness' of same-sex relationships, followed by religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telelistas.net/blog/62-das-pessoas-nao-aprovam-o-casamento-gay-segundo-enquete/ 62% of people aren't approving of gay marriage, according to poll – Telelistas] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.gospelmais.com.br/pesquisa-maioria-brasileiros-contra-casamento-gay-55261.html A majority of Brazilians is against same-sex marriage and regards church as the most trustworthy institution, reveals research – Gospel+] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Canada}}

Legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Canada followed a series of constitutional challenges based on the [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|equality provisions]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. In the first such case, ''[[Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'', same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in [[Same-sex marriage in Ontario|Ontario]] on 14 January 2001 were subsequently validated when the [[common law]], mixed-sex definition of marriage was held to be unconstitutional. Similar rulings had legalized same-sex marriage in eight provinces and one territory when the 2005 ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]'' defined marriage throughout Canada as "the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others."

==== Denmark ====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Denmark}}
On 7 June 2012, the [[Folketing]] (Danish parliament) approved new laws regarding same-sex civil and religious marriage. These laws permit same-sex couples to get married in the [[Church of Denmark]]. The bills received [[Royal Assent]] on 12 June and took effect on 15 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanners |first=Peter |title=Gay marriage legalised |url=http://cphpost.dk/news/national/updated-gay-marriage-legalised |accessdate=25 September 2012 |newspaper=The Copenhagen Post |date=7 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120818162542/http://cphpost.dk:80/news/national/updated-gay-marriage-legalised |archivedate=18 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark was previously the first country in the world to legally recognize same-sex couples through registered partnerships in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.cybercity.dk/~dko12530/s2.htm The Registered Partnership Act]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rule, Sheila (2 October 1989).

==== France ====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in France}}
Following the election of [[François Hollande]] as President of France in May 2012 and the subsequent legislative election in which the Socialist party took a majority of seats in the French National Assembly, the new Prime Minister [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] stated that a same-sex marriage bill had been drafted and would be passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gay Marriage Will Soon Become Legal in France, Big Win for LGBT Rights in Europe |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iCHjEwL13Lmoqv92kvpq7ADOWPlw |publisher=AFP |accessdate=3 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121228011837/http://www.google.com:80/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iCHjEwL13Lmoqv92kvpq7ADOWPlw? |archivedate=28 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government introduced a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, [[Bill 344 (2012)|Bill 344]], in the National Assembly on 17 November 2012. Article 1 of the bill defining marriage as an agreement between two people was passed on 2 February 2013 in its first reading by a 249–97 vote. On 12 February 2013, the National Assembly approved the entire bill in a 329–229 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=France's parliament passes gay marriage bill |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/02/12/france-gay-marriage-adoption.html |accessdate=24 April 2013 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2013, the upper house of the French parliament voted to legalise same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French senate votes to legalise gay marriage|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22126437|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April 2013 the law was approved by the National Assembly in a 331–225 vote.&lt;ref name="Same-sex marriage: France"&gt;{{cite news|title=Same-sex marriage: French parliament approves new law|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22261494|publisher=BBC News Europe|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law No.2013-404 grants same-sex couples living in France, including foreigners provided at least one of the partners has their domicile or residence in France, the legal right to get married.  The law also allows the recognition in France of same-sex couples' marriages that occurred abroad before the bill's enactment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lesur|first=Lionel|title=France Allows Same-Sex Marriages|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/france-allows-same-sex-marriages|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=13 June 2013|author2=Lisa A. Linsky|author3=McDermott Will &amp; Emery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement of the French parliament's vote results, those in opposition to the legalisation of same-sex marriage in France participated in public protests. In both Paris and Lyon, violence erupted as protesters clashed with police; the issue has mobilised right-wing forces in the country, including neo-Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hollande calls for calm as gay marriage opponents vow to fight on in France |url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/04/24/hollande-calls-for-calm-as-gay-marriage-opponents-vow-to-fight-on-in-france/ |accessdate=25 April 2013 |newspaper=Euronews|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main right-wing opposition party UMP challenged the law in the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], which had one month to rule on whether the law conformed to the Constitution. The Constitutional Council had previously ruled that the issue of same-sex marriage was one for the legislature to decide &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Décision n° 2010–92 QPC du 28 janvier 2011 |url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/decision/2011/2010-92-qpc/decision-n-2010-92-qpc-du-28-janvier-2011.52612.html |work=Les décisions |publisher=Conseil Constitutionel |accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was only little hope for UMP to overturn the parliament's vote.

On 17 May 2013, the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] declared the Bill legal in its entire redaction. President Hollande signed it into law on 18 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/2013/2013-669-dc/communique-de-presse.137047.html Communiqué de presse – 2013-669 DC – Loi ouvrant le mariage aux couples de personnes de même sexe], [[Constitutional Council of France]], retrieved on 17 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In individual cases, same-sex couples have been given judicial approval to marry in several other states.

On 11 February 2014, the Congress of Coahuila approved adoptions by same-sex couples and a bill legalizing same-sex marriages passed on September 1, 2014 making Coahuila the second state to reform its Civil Code to allow same sex marriages. It took effect on 17 September, and the first couple married on 20 September.

On 13 November 2014, the Supreme Court of Mexico ruled that [[Baja California]]'s constitutional ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexico's Supreme Court backs gay marriage in Baja California|date=2014-06-25|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/jun/25/mexico-supreme-court-gay-marrage-baja-california/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www2.scjn.gob.mx/red2/comunicados/comunicado.asp?id=2877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 2015, the governor of Chihuahua announced that his administration would no longer oppose same-sex marriages within the state.

On 3 June 2015, the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation]] released a "jurisprudential thesis" which deems the state-laws defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman unconstitutional. The ruling standardized court procedures across Mexico to authorize  same-sex marriages. However, the process is still lengthy and more expensive than that for an opposite-sex marriage, as&lt;ref name="Randal C. Archibold and Paulina Villegas"/&gt; the ruling did not invalidate any state laws, meaning gay couples will be denied the right to wed and will have to turn to the courts for individual injunctions. However, given the nature of the ruling, judges and courts throughout Mexico must approve any application for a same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/mexico-supreme-court-opens-door-to-gay-marriage-nationwide/307197801/|title=Mexico supreme court says state laws limiting marriage to man and woman unconstitutional|publisher=Minneapolis Star Tribune|date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official release of the thesis was on 19 June 2015, which took effect on 22 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mexico avalara matrimonio gay partir lunes|date=2015-06-19|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2015/06/19/nota/4972027/mexico-avalara-matrimonio-gay-partir-lunes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands was the first country to extend marriage laws to include same-sex couples, following the recommendation of a special commission appointed to investigate the issue in 1995.

On 14 May 2012, [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] MP [[Louisa Wall]] stated that she would introduce a [[private member's bill]], the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, allowing same-sex couples to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/6915784/MP-drafting-gay-marriage-bill|title=MP drafting gay marriage bill|first1=John|last1=Hartevelt|first2=Dayna|last2=Levy|publisher=Fairfax media (via Stuff.co.nz)|date=14 May 2012|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was submitted to the members' bill ballot on 30 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/ProposedBills/8/f/4/50HOH_MEMBILL074_1-Marriage-Definition-of-Marriage-Amendment-Bill.htm |title=Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill – Proposed Members' Bills – Legislation |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=19 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130805055702/http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/ProposedBills/8/f/4/50HOH_MEMBILL074_1-Marriage-Definition-of-Marriage-Amendment-Bill.htm |archivedate=5 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was drawn from the ballot and passed the first and second readings on 29 August 2012 and 13 March 2013, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marriage bill passes first reading|first1=Kate|last1=Shuttleworth|first2=Audrey|last2=Young|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10830345|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=29 August 2012|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8422263/Passions-fly-as-MPs-vote-on-gay-marriage|publisher =Fairfax Media (via Stuff.co.nz)|title=Passions fly as MPs vote on gay marriage|first=Tracy|last=Watkins|date=14 March 2013|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final reading passed on 17 April 2013 by 77 votes to 44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-17/nz-legalises-same-sex-marriage/4635086|title=NZ legalises same-sex marriage|work=ABC News|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/gay-marriage-bill-passed-5409720|title=Gay marriage bill passed|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill received [[Royal Assent]] from the Governor-General on 19 April and took effect on 19 August 2013.&lt;ref name="Radio NZ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/133170/marriage-legislation-becomes-law|title=Marriage legislation becomes law|date=19 April 2013|work=Radio New Zealand|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/auckland/news/nbnat/2103707089-the-country-s-first-gay-marriages-will-be-held-today|publisher=Newstalk ZB|title= Gay marriage becomes a reality| date= 19 August 2013 |accessdate= 19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand marriage law only applies to New Zealand proper and the [[Ross Dependency]] in Antarctica. Other New Zealand territories, including [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]] and [[Tokelau]], have their own marriage law and do not perform nor recognise same-sex marriage.

====Norway====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Norway}}

Same-sex marriage became legal in Norway on 1 January 2009 when a gender neutral marriage bill was enacted after being passed by the Norwegian legislature in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway adopts gay marriage law |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jko_BIHizUFFqUtmEaUrAEoPXFWw |accessdate=25 September 2012 |newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse]] via [[Google]] |date=11 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120913230714/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jko_BIHizUFFqUtmEaUrAEoPXFWw |archivedate=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-06-17-gaymarriage_N.htm|title=New law in Norway grants gay couples marriage rights|work=USA Today|location =Washington DC|date=17 June 2008|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway became the first [[Scandinavia]]n country and the sixth country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.

Gender neutral marriage replaced Norway's previous system of registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Couples in registered partnerships are able to retain that status or convert their registered partnership to a marriage. No new registered partnerships may be created.

====Portugal====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Portugal}}
{{See also|De facto union in Portugal}}
Portugal created de facto unions ({{lang|pt|''união de facto''}} in legal European Portuguese) similar to common-law marriage for cohabiting opposite-sex partners in 1999, and extended these unions to same-sex couples in 2001. However, the 2001 extension did not allow for same-sex adoption, either jointly or of stepchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netlibrary.net/articles/Same-sex_marriage |title=Same-Sex marriage &amp;#124; World Public Library - eBooks &amp;#124; Read eBooks online |publisher=Netlibrary.net |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistoriaconmapas.com/war-maps/Same-sex-marriage-Legal-recognition-War-Maps.htm |title=Historia con Mapas - Atlas &amp; Maps |publisher= |accessdate=26 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20150518082229/http://www.lahistoriaconmapas.com/war-maps/Same-sex-marriage-Legal-recognition-War-Maps.htm |archivedate=18 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2010, the parliament approved—126 votes in favor, 97 against and 7 abstentions—same-sex marriage. The Portuguese president promulgated the law on 8 April 2010 and the law was effective on 5 June 2010, making Portugal the eighth country to legalize nationwide same-sex marriage; however, adoption was still denied for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.57883.com/en/wiki/wiki/people/201502/Same-sex_marriage0_en.57883.com.html|title=Same-sex marriage in Portugal|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February 2012, the parliament rejected two bills allowing same-sex couples to adopt children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GAY RIGHTS: LAWMAKERS DEFEAT ADOPTION BILL FOR COUPLES|url=http://www.portugaldailyview.com/whats-new/gay-rights-lawmakers-defeat-adoption-bill-for-couples|work=Portugal Daily View|publisher=Portugal Daily View|accessdate=24 October 2013|author=Lusa News|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Slovenia ====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Slovenia}}
In December 2014, the eco-socialist [[United Left (Slovenia)|United Left]] party introduced a bill amending expansion of the definition of marriage in 1976 Marriage and Family Relations Act to include same-sex couples. In January 2015, the government expressed no opposition to the bill. In February 2015, the bill was passed with 11 votes to 2. In March, the Assembly passed the bill in a 51-28 vote. On 10 March 2015, the National Council rejected a motion to require the Assembly to vote on the bill again, in a 14-23 vote. The opponents of the bill launched a petition for a referendum and managed to collect 40.000 signatures. Then the parliament voted to block the referendum with a clarification that it's against the Slovenian constitution to vote about matters concerning human rights. Finally the constitutional court ruled agains the banning of the referendum (5 to 4) and the referendum will be held on 20th December 2015.

====South Africa====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in South Africa}}
Legal recognition of same-sex marriages in South Africa came about as a result of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]]'s decision in the case of ''[[Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie]]''. The court ruled on 1 December 2005 that the existing marriage laws violated the [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa|equality clause]] of the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]] because they discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. The court gave [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] one year to rectify the inequality. The [[Civil Union Act (South Africa)|Civil Union Act]] was passed by the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] on 14 November 2006, by a vote of 230 to 41. It became law on 30 November 2006. South Africa is the fifth country, the first in Africa, and the second outside Europe, to legalize same-sex marriage.

====Spain====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Spain}}
[[Spain]] was the third country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage, which has been legal since 3 July 2005, and was supported by the majority of the Spanish people.&lt;ref name="SPTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain approves liberal gay marriage law|publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=1 July 2005|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/07/01/Worldandnation/Spain_approves_libera.shtml|accessdate=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanOut&gt;{{cite web|last=Giles|first=Ciaran|title=Spain: Gay marriage bill clears hurdle|publisher=Planetout.com|date=21 April 2005|url=http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?2005/04/21/5|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227125726/http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?2005/04/21/5|archivedate=27 December 2007|accessdate=22 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the nation's newly elected [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist]] government, led by [[Prime Minister of Spain|President]] [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], began a campaign for its legalization, including the right of [[LGBT adoption|adoption by same-sex couples]].&lt;ref name="SOD"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spain's new government to legalize gay marriage |agency=Reuters |publisher=SignonSanDiego.com |date=15 April 2004 |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20040415-0750-spain-marriage.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kV80Iu9U |archivedate=13 October 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much debate, the law permitting same-sex marriage was passed by the ''[[Cortes Generales]]'' (Spain's [[bicameralism|bicameral parliament]]) on 30 June 2005.

====Sweden====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Sweden}}
Same-sex marriage in Sweden has been legal since 1 May 2009, following the adoption of a new, gender-neutral law on marriage by the [[Parliament of Sweden|Swedish parliament]] on 1 April 2009, making Sweden the seventh country in the world to open marriage to same-sex couples nationwide. Marriage replaced Sweden's registered partnerships for same-sex couples. Existing registered partnerships between same-sex couples remained in force with an option to convert them into marriages.&lt;ref name="swedishmarriagerights"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7978495.stm|title=Sweden allows same-sex marriage|publisher=BBC News|date=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church of Sweden says yes to gay marriage |url=http://www.thelocal.se/22810/20091022/ |accessdate=24 July 2012 |newspaper=The Local |date=22 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120111080159/http://www.thelocal.se/22810/20091022/ |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
[[File:Same-sex legislation Lesser Antilles (named).svg|thumb]]
{{main|Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom}}

Since 2005 same-sex couples have been allowed to enter into [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]], a separate union providing the [[Legal consequences of marriage and civil partnership in the United Kingdom|legal consequences of marriage]]. In 2006 the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] rejected a legal bid by a British [[Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson|lesbian couple]] who had [[Same-sex marriage in British Columbia|married]] in Canada to have their union recognised as a marriage in the UK rather than a civil partnership. In September 2011, the Coalition government announced its intention to introduce same-sex civil marriage in England and Wales by the [[Next United Kingdom general election|next general election]] in May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Jessica|title=Government proposes introducing gay marriage after Cameron intervention|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/09/16/government-proposes-introduction-of-full-gay-marriage-after-cameron-intervention/|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike the Scottish Government's Consultation, the UK Government's Consultation for England and Wales did not include provision for religious ceremonies. In May 2012, three religious groups (Quakers, Liberal Judaism and Unitarians) sent a letter to David Cameron, asking that they be allowed to solemnise same-sex weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/05/29/religious-groups-urge-david-cameron-to-maintain-equal-marriage-support/|title=Religious groups urge David Cameron to maintain equal marriage support|work=PinkNews|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012 the UK Government completed the Consultation to allow civil marriage for same-sex couples in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref name="grauni1127"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships may soon be welcomed|first=Alan|last=Travis|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/17/civil-partnerships-marriage|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its response to the Consultation, the Government said that it also intended "...to enable those religious organisations that wish to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies to do so, on a permissive basis only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/equal-marriage-consultation|title=Equal marriage consultation|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2012, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, announced that, whilst he favoured allowing same-sex marriage within a religious context, provision would be made guaranteeing no religious institution would be required to perform such ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20642428|title=Gay marriage: David Cameron backs church role|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 2013, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debated the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill]], approving it in a 400–175 vote at the second [[Reading (legislature)|reading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Sparrow |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2013/feb/05/gay-marriage-debate-politics-live-blog|title=MPs vote overwhelmingly in favour of gay marriage |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=5 February 2013 |location=London |date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third reading took place on 21 May 2013, and was approved by 366 votes to 161.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gay marriage: Commons passes Cameron's plan |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22605011 |accessdate=21 May 2013 |date=21 May 2013 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 2013 the Bill received its second reading in the [[House of Lords]], after a blocking amendment was defeated by 390 votes to 148.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm |title=Lords Hansard text for 4 Jun 201304 Jun 2013 (pt 0002) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 2013, the Bill was given a third reading by the House of Lords, meaning that it had been passed, and so it was then returned to Commons for the consideration of Lords' amendments. On 16 July 2013 the Commons accepted all of the Lords' amendments.&lt;ref name=BBC23338279&gt;{{cite news |work=BBC News |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23338279 |title=Same-sex marriage becomes law in England and Wales |date=17 July 2013 |accessdate=17 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July 2013 the bill received [[Royal Assent]] becoming the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]].&lt;ref name="BBC23338279"/&gt; The first same-sex marriages took place on 29 March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26793127|title=Same-sex marriage now legal as first couples wed|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Government]] conducted a three-month-long consultation which ended on 9 December 2011 and the analysis was published in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Consultation sees 50,000 responses|work=The Scotsman|location=Edinburgh|url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/politics/consultation_sees_50_000_responses_1_2001639|accessdate=9 February 2012|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the consultation held in England and Wales, Scotland considered both civil and religious same-sex marriage. Whilst the Scottish Government is in favour of same-sex marriage, it stated that no religious body would be forced to hold such ceremonies once legislation is enacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Parliament Website|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2011/09/05153328/1|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish Consultation received more than 77,000 responses, and on 27 June 2013 the Government published the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2013/06/same-sex-marriage-27062013|title=Same sex marriage|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preserve the freedom of both religious groups and individual clergy, the Scottish Government believed it necessary for changes to be made to the Equality Act 2010 and communicated with the UK Government on this matter; thus, the first same-sex marriages in Scotland did not occur until this had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-23067324|title=Scotland's gay marriage bill published at Holyrood|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Scottish bill concerning same-sex marriage had been published, the 'Australian' reported that LGBT rights campaigners, celebrating outside the UK parliament on 15 July 2013 for the clearance of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill in the House of Lords, declared that they would continue the campaign to extend same-sex marriage rights to both Scotland and Northern Ireland,&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay marriage moves a step closer in UK|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/gay-marriage-moves-a-step-closer-in-uk/story-fn3dxix6-1226679898796?utm_source=The%20Australian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=editorial&amp;net_sub_uid=44933799|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=The Australian|date=16 July 2013|author=Andrew Woodcock}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than solely Northern Ireland, where there are no plans to introduce such legislation.

The Northern Ireland Executive has stated that it does not intend to introduce legislation allowing for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions are treated as civil partnerships.

Hodges]]'' that state level bans on same-sex marriage to be unconstitutional as well, legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the entire U.S. proper and all incorporated territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2015/06/26/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-ruling-brown-dnt-tsr.cnn|title=U.S. 21st country to allow same-sex marriage nationwide|date=June 26, 2015|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the legalization of same-sex marriage in any U.S. jurisdiction, the [[104th United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) in 1996, attempting to define marriage for the first time solely as a union between a man and a woman for all federal purposes, and allowing states to refuse to recognize such marriages created in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/1/7.html|title=US CODE: Title 1,7. Definition of "marriage" and "spouse"|publisher=Cornell University|date=7 April 2010|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2013 ruling in ''Windsor'' invalidated the denial of federal recognition statute.

The movement to obtain [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|civil marriage rights]] and benefits for same-sex couples in the United States began in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gumbel|first=Andrew|title=The Great Undoing?|url=http://www.advocate.com/news/2009/06/20/great-undoing|work=[[The Advocate]]|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the 1971 case ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]'', the Minnesota Supreme Court denied that such a right existed on the grounds that procreation and childrearing were essential to the institution of marriage. The United States Supreme Court denied to hear the case on appeal, establishing it as a [[precedent]] as it came from mandatory appellate review. The issue did not become prominent in U.S. politics until the 1993 [[Hawaii Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Baehr v. Miike|Baehr v. Lewin]]'' that declared that state's prohibition to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Same Sex Marriage Laws – History|url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/human-services/same-sex-marriage-laws.aspx|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 21st century, public support for same-sex marriage has grown considerably,&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jrl2124/Lax_Phillips_Gay_Policy_Responsiveness_2009.pdf|title=Gay Rights in the States: Public Opinion and Policy Responsiveness|format=PDF|pages=67–86|doi=10.1017/S0003055409990050|date=August 2009|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=103|issue=3|accessdate=December 20, 2011|first=JEFFREY R.|last=LAX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silver|first=Nate|title=Support for Gay Marriage Outweighs Opposition in Polls |url=http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/support-for-gay-marriage-outweighs-opposition-in-polls/ |accessdate=October 28, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national polls conducted since 2011 show that a majority of Americans support legalizing it. On May 17, 2004, [[Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] became the first U.S. state and the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage following the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Judicial Court]]'s decision in ''[[Goodridge v.

In 2010, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for Northern California]] ruled in ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'' that evidence did not show any historical purpose for excluding same-sex couples from marriage, as states have never required spouses to have an ability or willingness to procreate in order to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=[[Perry v.

As a result, the Ninth Circuit's ruling was vacated, leaving only the district court's order overturning California's ban on same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-144_8ok0.pdf "Hollingsworth et al. v.

Australian federal law currently bans recognition of same-sex marriages. [[Registered partnerships]] are available in [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]], Queensland and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Since 1 July 2009, [[Social Security (Australia)|Centrelink]] has recognised same-sex couples equally with those who are married regarding social security, whether they are in a registered or de facto relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of a partner |url=http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/individuals/member_couple_ssr.htm|publisher=Australian Department of Human Services|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, Tasmania became the first Australian state to recognise same-sex marriages performed in other countries, although only with de facto status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-09-29/tasmania-to-recognise-same-sex-marriage/2279158|title=Tasmania to recognise same-sex marriage|publisher=ABC News|location=Sydney|date=30 September 2010|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, as one of his first speeches after returning as Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd made it clear that he was proud to be the first Australian PM to support same-sex marriage, declaring he would consider a plebiscite or referendum on the issue, although he was defeated before he could take this action.

On 22 October 2013, a bill was passed by the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) legalising same-sex marriage in the ACT. However, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] found that the legal change was never valid and an official reversal of the bill was announced on 12 December 2013. The High Court established that such a change to ACT legislation could not operate concurrently with the federal Marriage Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia: Gay marriage law reversed by high court less than a week after first weddings|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/australia-gay-marriage-law-reversed-less-than-a-week-after-first-weddings-8999422.html|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 December 2013|author=Adam Withnall|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 62% approval success of the constitutional amendment referendum in Ireland on 22 May 2015 regarding same-sex marriage, Labour leader [[Bill Shorten]] introduced a "marriage equality bill" to the House of Representatives on 1 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5470|title=Marriage Amendment (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that Liberal Party members may be allowed to have a [[conscience vote]], and said a vote on the issue in August would be more appropriate.

[[Michelle Bachelet]], the president of Chile, who was elected to a second term in March 2014, has promised to work for the implementation of same-sex marriage and has a majority in both houses of [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]].

On 10 December 2014, a group of [[Senate of Chile|senators]], from various parties, joined LGBT rights group [[MOVILH]] (Homosexual Movement of Integration and Liberation) in presenting a bill to allow same-sex marriage and adoption to Congress. MOVILH has been in talks with the Chilean government to seek an amiable solution to the pending marriage lawsuit brought against the state before the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]]. MOVILH has suggested that they would drop the case if Bachelet's Congress keeps their promise to legislate same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cascaraamarga.es/politica-lgtb/lgtb-internacional/10299-el-proyecto-de-ley-de-matrimonio-igualitario-llega-al-parlamento-de-chile.html|title=El proyecto de ley de matrimonio igualitario llega al Parlamento de Chile|publisher=Cáscara Amarga|date=2014-12-11|accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, on 28 January 2015, the National Congress approved a bill recognizing civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples offering some of the rights of marriage.

{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in China}}
The ''Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China'' explicitly defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman. No other form of civil union is recognized. The attitude of the Chinese government towards homosexuality is believed to be "three nos": "No approval; no disapproval; no promotion." The Ministry of Health officially removed homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses in 2001.

[[Li Yinhe]], a sociologist and sexologist well known in the Chinese gay community, has tried to legalize same-sex marriage several times, including during the National People's Congress in 2000 and 2004 (''Legalization for Same-Sex Marriage'' 《中国同性婚姻合法化》 in 2000 and the ''Same-Sex Marriage Bill'' 《中国同性婚姻提案》 in 2004). According to Chinese law, 35 delegates' signatures are needed to make an issue a bill to be discussed in the Congress. Her efforts failed due to lack of support from the delegates. CPPCC National Committee spokesman [[Wu Jianmin]]
when asked about Li Yinhe's proposal, said that same-sex marriage was still too "ahead of its time" for China. He argued that same-sex marriage was not recognized even in many Western countries, which are considered much more liberal in social issues than China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2006-03-05/10278364854s.shtml|title=政协发言人称同性婚姻太超前 李银河提案再受挫_新闻中心_新浪网|publisher=News.sina.com.cn|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement is understood as an implication that the government may consider recognition of same-sex marriage in the long run, but not in the near future.

====Colombia====
{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Colombia}}
Colombia has no laws providing for same-sex marriage. However, as a result of subsequent rulings by the country's Constitutional Court that started on February 2007, same-sex couples can apply for all the rights that heterosexual couples have in de facto unions (''uniones de hecho'').&lt;ref name="2009 ruling"&gt;[http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-029-2009.pdf Decision C-029 of 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-10938.html Colombian court confirms equal rights for same-sex couples], Pink News, 30 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2011, the Constitutional Court of Colombia ordered the Congress to pass the legislation giving same-sex couples similar rights to marriage by 20 June 2013. If such a law were not passed by then, same-sex couples would be granted these rights automatically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.corteconstitucional.gov.co/sentences/C-577-2011.pdf DECISION C-577/11 The homosexuals have the right to form a family]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/07/27/colombia.gay.marriage/|work=CNN| title=Colombian court says Congress must decide on gay marriage|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 Senator [[Armando Benedetti]] introduced a bill legalizing same-sex marriage. It initially only allowed for civil unions, but he amended the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/articulo-382915-matrimonio-gay-empieza-ser-tramitado-senado "Matrimonio gay" empieza a ser tramitado en Senado]&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate's First Committee approved the bill on 4 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia-politics.com/gay-marriage-bill-passes-first-hurdle/|title=Gay marriage bill passes first hurdle - Colombia Politics|work=Colombia Politics|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.semana.com/nacion/primera-vez-comision-del-congreso-aprueba-matrimonio-gay/189204-3.aspx Por primera vez una comisión del Congreso aprueba el matrimonio gay]&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2013, the bill was defeated in the full Senate on a 51–17 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/24/uk-colombia-gaymarriage-idUKBRE93N1EJ20130424|publisher=Reuters |title=Colombia lawmakers reject controversial gay marriage bill | date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2013, a civil court judge in Bogotá declared a male same-sex couple legally married, after a ruling on July 11, 2013 accepting the petition.

====Germany====
{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Germany}}

Since 1 August 2001, Germany has registered partnerships (''Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft'') for same-sex couples, providing most but not all rights of marriage. In 2004, this act was amended to include [[adoption]] rights (stepchild adoption only) and to reform previously cumbersome dissolution procedures with regard to [[division of property]] and alimony. Attempts to give equal rights to registered partners or to legalize same-sex marriage have generally been blocked by the [[CDU/CSU]], the main party in government since 2005. All other main parties ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], [[Alliance '90/The Greens|The Greens]], [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]) support full LGBT equality. The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] has issued various rulings in favor of equal rights for same-sex registered partners (such as joint tax filing benefits), requiring the governing coalition to change the law.

====India====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in India}}
Same-sex marriage is not explicitly prohibited under Indian law and at least one couple has had their marriage recognised by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.despardes.com/lifestyle/feb05/lesbian-marriages.htm |title=Lesbian marriages in India |publisher=despardes.com |accessdate=11 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140203064928/http://www.despardes.com:80/lifestyle/feb05/lesbian-marriages.htm |archivedate=3 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014 [[Medha Patkar]] of the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] stated that her party supports the legalisation of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Morgan |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/india-party-people-promises-legalize-gay-sex-marriage110414 |title=India ‘party of the people’ promises to legalize gay sex, marriage |publisher=Gay Star News |date=11 April 2014 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Israel}}
Israel's High Court of Justice ruled to recognize foreign same-sex marriages for the limited purpose of registration with the Administration of Border Crossings, Population and Immigration, however this is merely for statistical purposes and grants no state-level rights; Israel does not recognize civil marriages performed under its own jurisdiction. A bill was raised in the [[Knesset]] (parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but the Knesset has not advanced the bill since December 2006. A bill to legalize same-sex and interfaith civil marriages was defeated in the Knesset, 39–11, on 16 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Jerusalem Post|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=270221|title=Knesset rejects marriage equality bill|date=16 May 2012|author=Harkov, Lahav|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Italy}}
Notwithstanding a long history of legislative proposals for civil unions, Italy does not recognize any type of same-sex unions. Several regions have formally supported efforts for a national law on civil unions and some municipalities have passed laws providing for [[civil unions]].

On 9 April 2014, the Civil Court of [[Grosseto]] ordered that a same-sex marriage contracted abroad be recognised in the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Grosseto, il tribunale al Comune: 'Riconoscete quel matrimonio gay' | work =La Repubblica| date = 9 April 2014| url = http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2014/04/09/news/mtrimoni_gay_grosseto-83186168/?ref=HRER1-1 | accessdate = 9 April 2014|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Japan}}
Same-sex marriage is not legal in Japan. Article 24 of the Japanese constitution states that "Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitution of Japan|date=3 November 1946|location=Tokyo|url=http://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Article 24 was created to establish the equality of both sexes in marriage, in opposition to the pre-war legal situation whereby the husband/father was legally defined as the head of household and marriage require permission from the male head of the family. The wording, however, inadvertently defined marriage as the union of man and woman.

====Malta====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Malta}}
Malta has recognized same-sex unions since April 2014, following the enactment of the Civil Unions Bill, first introduced in September 2013.

====Taiwan====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Taiwan}}
On 22 December 2014, a proposed amendment to the Civil Code which would legalize same-sex marriage was due to go under review by the Judiciary Committee. If the amendment passes the committee stage it will then be voted on at the plenary session of the [[Legislative Yuan]] in 2015.  The amendment, called the marriage equality amendment, would insert neutral terms into the Civil Code replacing ones that imply heterosexual marriage, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage.  It would also allow same-sex couples to adopt children. Yu Mei-nu of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), who is the convener of the current legislative session, has expressed support for the amendment as have more than 20 other DPP lawmakers as well as two from the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] and one each from the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lii Wen |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/12/21/2003607251 |title=Gay marriage proposal set for review |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-12-21 |accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan would become the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage if the Civil Code is amended.

====Thailand====

A same-sex-marriage bill before the parliament has bipartisan support, but as of April 2014 has been stalled due to the political crisis in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lgbtweekly.com/2014/04/10/thai-marriage-equality-bill-unable-to-proceed-due-to-political-crisis/ |title=Thai marriage equality bill unable to proceed due to political crisis |publisher=LGBT Weekly |date=10 April 2014 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of 2014, reports emerged that a draft bill called the Civil Partnership Act will be submitted to the junta-appointed Thai Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prachatai.com/english/node/4390|title=Same-sex marriage may come true under Thai junta|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Turkey====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Turkey}}
In the process of rewriting the Turkish constitution, the opposition party [[Peace and Democracy Party|BDP]] called for the liberalization of marriage policies to include same-sex marriage. The largest opposition party in the Turkish parliament, [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]], supported the idea. The largest party in the parliament, the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]], opposes same-sex marriage, although Premier [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], the leader of the AKP, supported full equal rights for LGBT citizens in 2002, the year he launched his party. In response to a request from BDP, a parliamentary discussion of same-sex marriage is anticipated when all political parties gather in committees to establish a new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BDP'nin eşcinsel evlilik isteği tartışılıyor|url=http://www.haber10.com/haber/279069/|publisher=Haber10|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GL |first=Kaos |title=LGBT Initiative from Prime Minister Erdoğan! |url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/guide/country_by_country/turkey/lgbt_initiative_from_prime_minister_erdogan |publisher=ILGA Europe |accessdate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120724035733/http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/guide/country_by_country/turkey/lgbt_initiative_from_prime_minister_erdogan |archivedate=24 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a poll of Turkish attitudes towards sexuality, 3.6% of Turks supported same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bekâret ve eşcinsellik...|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalYazar&amp;ArticleID=1120726&amp;Yazar=DR.-ALPER-HASANOGLU&amp;CategoryID=41|publisher=[[Radikal]]|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, research revealed that 80% of the Turkish population is against same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iha.com.tr/haber-turkiyenin-yuzde-80i-escinsel-evlilige-karsi-481213/|title=Türkiye'nin yüzde 80'i eşcinsel evliliğe karşı|date=22 July 2015|work=İhlas Haber Ajansı|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Vietnam}}
In Vietnam, currently only a marriage between a man and a woman is recognized. Vietnam's Ministry of Justice began seeking advice on legalizing same-sex marriage from other governmental and non-governmental organizations in April and May 2012, and planned to further discuss the issue at the National Assembly in Spring 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnam government consults on same-sex marriage|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vietnam-government-consults-same-sex-marriage200612|accessdate=26 January 2013|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2013, the Ministry of Justice requested that the National Assembly avoid action until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote on same-sex marriage in Vietnam likely to be delayed until 2014|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/vote-same-sex-marriage-vietnam-likely-be-delayed-until-2014200213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a hearing to discuss marriage law reforms in April 2013, deputy minister of health Nguyen Viet Tien proposed that same-sex marriage be made legal immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/04/vietnam-flawed-on-human-rights-but-a-leader-in-gay-rights/275413/|title=Vietnam: Flawed on Human Rights, but a Leader in Gay Rights|author=Thomas Maresca|date=30 April 2013|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese government abolished an administrative fine imposed on same-sex weddings in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/345169/vietnam-ends-same-sex-marriage-fines |title=Vietnam ends same-sex marriage fines &amp;#124; Bangkok Post: breakingnews |publisher=Bangkok Post |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy will be enacted on 11 November 2013. The 100,000–500,000 [[VND]]  ($24[[USD]]) fine will be abolished. Although same-sex marriages are not permitted in Vietnam, the policy will decriminalize the relationship, habitual privileges such as household registry, property, child raising, and co-habitual partnerships are recognized.&lt;ref&gt;S.Sarkar, Gay Star News. 13 October 2013.'It's final Gay wedding fines to go in Vietnam.' http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/it%E2%80%99s-final-gay-wedding-fines-go-vietnam131013 retrieved 13 Oct 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2015, the 2014 Law on Marriage and Family officially went into effect. It states that while Vietnam allows gay weddings, it will not offer legal recognition or protection to unions between people of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marilynstowe.co.uk/2014/12/29/vietnam-set-to-lift-gay-marriage-ban/|title=Vietnam set to lift gay marriage ban|work=Marilyn Stowe Blog|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International organizations===
The terms of employment of the staff of [[international organizations]] (not [[Business|commercial]]) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country where their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality.

Despite their relative independence, few organizations recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the United Nations recognize same-sex marriages if and only if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Secretary-General Bulletin|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/522/40/PDF/N0452240.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to mixed-sex married couples to de facto partners or [[domestic partner]]s of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into a mixed-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the [[World Bank]] does recognize domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTHRJOBS/0,,contentMDK:20522360~menuPK:1353209~pagePK:64262408~piPK:64262191~theSitePK:1058433,00.html|title=Jobs&amp;nbsp;— Compensation &amp; Benefits|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-sexual same-sex marriage ===
Several traditional societies in Africa have traditionally allowed non-sexual marriage between two women.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  These arrangements usually involve one woman taking the role of a man and marrying another woman to secure her inheritance, and are not seen as homosexual.

====Kenya====
{{main|LGBT rights in Kenya}}
Female same-sex marriage is practiced among the [[Gikuyu people|Gikuyu]], [[Nandi people|Nandi]], [[Kamba people|Kamba]], [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], and to a lesser extent neighboring peoples.  Approximately 5–10% of women are in such marriages.  However, this is not seen as homosexual, but is instead a way for families without sons to keep their inheritance within the family.&lt;ref&gt;''Gender and Language in Sub-Saharan Africa,'' 2013:35&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws criminalizing homosexuality are generally specific to men, though in 2010 the prime minister called for women to be arrested as well.

====Nigeria====
{{main|Same-sex marriage in Nigeria}}
In Nigeria, homosexual activity between men, but not between women, is illegal.  In 2006, Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] introduced legislation that prohibits same-sex marriages and criminalizes anyone who "performs, witnesses, aids or abets" such ceremonies.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleshman |first=Michael |title=African gays and lesbians combat bias: An 'invisible' minority seeks legal safeguards, acceptance |url=http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=28 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120212183121/http://www.un.org:80/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html |archivedate=12 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Igbo people]] and probably other peoples in the south of the country, there are circumstances where a marriage between women is considered appropriate, such as when a woman has no child and her husband dies, and she takes a wife to perpetuate her inheritance and family lineage.&lt;ref name=NigeriaTribune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111010506/http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html|archivedate=11 January 2010|title=Tradition of same gender marriage in Igboland|first=Leo|last=Igwe|work=Nigerian Tribune|date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Civil union}}
[[File:New York City Proposition 8 Protest outside LDS temple 20.jpg|thumb|Many advocates, such as this protester at a demonstration in New York City against [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition 8]], reject the notion of [[civil unions]], describing them as inferior to the legal recognition of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=Towleroad&gt;{{cite web|last=Towle|first=Andy|title=NYC Protest and Civil Rights March Opposing Proposition 8|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2008/11/we-did-it.html|publisher=[[Towleroad]]|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Civil union, [[civil partnership]], [[domestic partnership]], [[registered partnership]], unregistered partnership, and unregistered cohabitation statuses offer varying legal benefits of marriage. As of October 2015, countries that have an alternative form of legal recognition other than marriage on a national level are: [[Same-sex marriage in Andorra|Andorra]], [[Same-sex marriage in Australia|Australia]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Chile|Chile]], [[Same-sex marriage in Colombia|Colombia]], [[Same-sex marriage in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Same-sex marriage in Croatia|Croatia]], [[Same-sex marriage in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[Same-sex marriage in Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[Same-sex marriage in Estonia|Estonia]], [[Same-sex marriage in Germany|Germany]], [[Same-sex marriage in Hungary|Hungary]], [[Same-sex marriage in Ireland|Ireland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Israel|Israel]], [[Same-sex marriage in Japan|Japan]] (Shibuya and Setagaya), [[Same-sex marriage in Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]], [[Same-sex marriage in Mexico|Mexico]] (Campeche, Colima, Jalisco and Michoacán), [[LGBT rights in San Marino|San Marino]], [[Same-sex marriage in Slovenia|Slovenia]], [[Same-sex marriage in Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|Taiwan]] (Kaohsiung, Taichung and Taipei), [[Same-sex marriage in Venezuela|Venezuela]] (Mérida) and the [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (Northern Ireland, the [[Recognition of same-sex unions in the Isle of Man|Isle of Man]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Jersey|Jersey]] and [[LGBT rights in Gibraltar|Gibraltar]]).&lt;ref name="countries and states legal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearson|first=Mary|title=Where is Gay Marriage Legal?|url=http://christiangays.com/marriage/legal.shtml|publisher=christiangays.com|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Steve|title=Which Countries Have Legalized Gay Marriage?|url=http://www.care2.com/causes/which-countries-have-legalized-gay-marriage.html|publisher=Care2.com (news.bbc.co.uk as source)|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Malta|Malta]] has established civil unions with the same rights and responsibilities as marriage, differing only in name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20131014/local/civil-liberties-bill-will-give-gay-couples-same-rights-duties-as-married-couples.490275 |title=Civil Unions law will give same sex couples same rights, duties, as married couples |publisher=timesofmalta.com |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Camilleri |first=Neil|title=President signs 'gay marriage' Bill |url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-04-17/news/president-signs-gay-marriage-bill-4664328194/|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=Malta Independent|date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
{{Further|Religious views on same-sex marriage|Blessing of same-sex marriages and same-sex unions in Christian churches}}
{{See also|#Freedom of religion}}

The legalization of same-sex marriage is characterized by some religious people as "redefining marriage".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opposing view: You can't redefine marriage|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/story/2012-05-09/marriage-Alliance-Defense-Fund/54865580/1|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=10 May 2012|author=Byron Babione}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World religions#Largest religions|world's largest religions]] vary widely in their [[Religious views on same-sex marriage|views on same-sex marriage]]. For example, among [[List of Christian denominations by number of members|larger Christian denominations]] the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s official position is to oppose same-sex marriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-05-13-pope-abortion-gays_N.htm|work=USA Today|location=Washington DC|title=Pope: Abortion, gay marriage among world's greatest threats|date=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the [[Orthodox Church]], some [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, a majority of [[Muslim]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Homosexuality-and-Same-Sex-Marriage-in-Islam.html|title=Homosexuality and Same - Sex Marriage in Islam|work=patheos.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]]. [[Buddhism]] is considered to be ambivalent on the subject as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Mettanando Bhikkhu (13 July 2005).

On the other hand, many faith communities around the world support allowing those of the same sex to marry or conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies; for example: [[Buddhism in Australia]],&lt;ref name=ausbuddhists&gt;{{cite news|last1=Potts|first1=Andrew M.|title=Buddhists come out for equality|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/buddhists-come-out-for-equality/75906|accessdate=28 February 2015|work=www.starobserver.com.au|publisher=Star Observer|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church of Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sweden allows gay weddings|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8321502.stm|accessdate=28 February 2015|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=22 October 2009|quote=The Lutheran Church of Sweden - the country's largest - is to conduct same-sex marriages from next month.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church of Denmark]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cphpost.dk/news14/national-news14/you-may-now-kiss-the-groom.html|title=You may now kiss the groom|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States]], the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], [[Native American religion|Native American]] religions with a [[two-spirit]] tradition, [[Neo-Druidism]], [[Wicca]], the [[Metropolitan Community Church]], the [[Quakers]], [[Reform Judaism]], the American branches of [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and [[Humanistic Judaism]], [[Unitarian Universalism]], the [[United Church of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=United Church endorses gay marriage|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/united-church-endorses-gay-marriage-1.357106|accessdate=28 February 2015|work=CBC News|agency=CBC|date=14 August 2003|quote=The United Church of Canada has overwhelmingly voted to endorse same-sex marriages after an extensive and emotional debate.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Church of Christ]], the [[United Protestant Church of France]], the [[United Protestant Church in Belgium]], the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], Lutheran, Reformed and United churches in the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and  the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcusa.org/news/2014/6/19/assembly-approves-allowing-pastors-perform-same-ge/|title=Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|date=19 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Parenting===
{{Main|LGBT parenting|Same-sex marriage and the family}}
Scientific literature indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union (either a mixed-sex or same-sex union). As a result, professional scientific associations have argued for same-sex marriage to be legally recognized as it will be beneficial to the children of same-sex parents or carers.&lt;ref name="amici" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cpa2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pediatrics /&gt;&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb, Ph.D.|first=Michael|title=Expert Affidavit for U.S. District Court (D.

====Adoption====
{{main|LGBT adoption}}
All states that allow same-sex marriage also allow the joint [[adoption]] of children by people of the same sex but Chihuahua, Guerrero and Quintana Roo in Mexico. In Portugal it wasn't allowed between 2010 and 2015, but then it was passed by parliament to change the law and permit it. In addition, [[Andorra]], [[Colombia]], [[Israel]] and [[Malta]] as well as several subnational jurisdictions which do not recognize same-sex marriage nonetheless permit joint adoption by unmarried same-sex couples: Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia in Australia as well as Bermuda, Gibraltar, the Isle of Man and Jersey in the United Kingdom. Some additional states allow step-child adoption by those who are in a same-sex relationship but are unmarried:  [[Germany]], [[Estonia]], [[Slovenia]] and the [[Philippines]]{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} as well as Victoria in Australia.

====Surrogacy and IVF treatment====
{{main|Assisted reproductive technology}}
A gay or bisexual man has the option of [[surrogacy]], the process in which a woman bears a child for another person through [[artificial insemination]] or carries another woman's surgically implanted [[fertilized egg]] to birth. A lesbian or bisexual woman has the option of artificial insemination.&lt;ref&gt;The Fertility Sourcebook, Third Edition&amp;nbsp;– Page 245, M. Sara Rosenthal&amp;nbsp;– 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Family Social Work&amp;nbsp;– Page 348, Donald Collins, Catheleen Jordan, Heather Coleman&amp;nbsp;– 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender and intersex people===
{{See also|Transgender|Transsexualism|Legal aspects of transsexualism|Gender identity}}
When sex is defined legally, it may be defined by any one of several criteria: the [[XY sex-determination system]], the type of [[gonad]]s, the type of external sexual features, or the person's social identification. Consequently, both [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] individuals may be legally categorized into confusing gray areas, and could be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions. This could result in long-term marriages, as well as recent same-sex marriages, being overturned.

The problems of defining gender by the existence/non-existence of gonads or certain sexual features is complicated by the existence of [[Gender Reassignment Surgery|surgical methods]] to alter these features. Estimates run as high as one percent of live [[childbirth|births]] exhibiting some degree of sexual ambiguity,&lt;ref&gt;(Fausto-Sterling ''et al.'', 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laurie"&gt;{{citation |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality|publisher=The Drum|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births being ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including sometimes involuntary surgery to address their sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency|title=How common is intersex?|publisher=Intersex Society of North America|accessdate=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. "Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality." ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' 38.5 (October 2009): 688–701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|title=Austria gets first same-sex marriage|publisher=365gay.com|date=5 July 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017161302/http://365gay.com/Newscon06/07/070506austria.htm|archivedate=17 October 2007|accessdate=20 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quebec prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender. With the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. A similar provision including sterilization also existed in Sweden, but was phased out in 2013.

In the United States, transgender and intersex marriages typically run into similar complications. As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19brfs-USDEFENDSMAR_BRF.html|title=U.S. Defends Marriage Law|work=The New York Times|date=18 September 2009|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some of them prohibit legal changes of gender.

===Divorce===
{{Main|Divorce of same-sex couples}}
Before the case of Obergefell v. Hodges couples in same-sex marriages could only obtain a divorce in jurisdictions that recognized same-sex marriages, with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Matthew S. Coleman, Esq.|title=Obergefell v. Hodges|url=http://www.einhornharris.com/familylawblog/obergefell-v-hodges/|publisher=Einhorn Harris|accessdate=November 8, 2015|date=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
{{See also|LGBT rights opposition}}
While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the [[history of same-sex unions|historical and anthropological record]] reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, through full acceptance and integration, sympathetic toleration, indifference, prohibition and discrimination, to persecution and physical annihilation. Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that recognition of same-sex marriages would erode religious freedoms,&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston&gt;{{cite news|url= http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/191kgwgh.asp|title=Banned in Boston|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]|date=5 May 2006|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising,&lt;ref name="Laurie"/&gt; undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological mother and father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-blankenhorn19-2008sep19,0,6057126.story|title=Protecting marriage to protect children|last=Blankenhorn|first=David|date=19 September 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships,&lt;ref name="findlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements/|title=See discussion of prenuptial and postmarital agreements at Findlaw|publisher=Family.findlaw.com|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="indegayforum1"&gt;Dale Carpenter is a prominent spokesman for this view. For a better understanding of this view, see Carpenter's writings at http://www.indegayforum.org/staff/show/91.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate regarding same-sex marriages includes debate based upon social viewpoints as well as debate based on majority rules, religious convictions, economic arguments, health-related concerns, and a variety of other issues.

====Freedom of religion====

Arguments on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate are still often made on religious grounds and/or formulated in terms of religious doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.c4me.org |title = Catholics for Marriage Equality |accessdate = 27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One source of controversy is whether same-sex marriage affects [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/samesexrights/beforethecourt.html |title=The Supreme Court decision |work=CBC News |location=Toronto |accessdate=5 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20101014072006/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/samesexrights/beforethecourt.html |archivedate=14 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilson, Robin J.; Laycock, Douglas; Picarello, Anthony R.|title=Same-sex marriage and religious liberty: emerging conflicts|publisher=Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty|location=Washington, D.C.|year=2008|isbn=0-7425-6326-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=1991700|title=The Civil Partnership Act 2004, Same-Sex Marriage and the Church of England|author=Humphreys, J.|journal=Ecclesiastical Law Journal|date=July 2006|issue=8|pages=289–306|doi=10.1017/S0956618X0000644X|volume=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2013/02/20/registrars-must-perform-gay-marriage-says-government/ |title=Minister: No conscience clause for registrars opposed to same-sex marriage|date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some religious organizations may refuse to provide employment, public accommodations, adoption services, and other benefits to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91486340|title=Gay Rights, Religious Liberties: A Three-Act Story|publisher=NPR|location=Washington DC|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments include freedom of religion provisions in marriage equality laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Steinfels|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/23/us/23beliefs.html|title=Same-Sex Marriage Laws Pose Protection Quandary|work=The New York Times|date=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judicial and legislative====
{{Main|Conflict of marriage laws#Same-sex marriage}}
There are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. A "[[direct democracy|majority rules]]" position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2008-12-04-gay-poll_N.htm|title=Poll: Calif. gay marriage ban driven by religion|author=Leff, Lisa|agency=Associated Press|date=4 December 2008|work=USA Today}} archived here [http://www.webcitation.org/68OwEop7Y].&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a [[civil rights]] view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7723645.stm|title= Divisions persist over gay marriage ban|author=Mirchandani, Rajesh|publisher=BBC News|date=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Same-sex marriages in popular culture==
&lt;!-- This section is devoted solely to fictional places that feature same-sex marriage, please try not to mention fictional characters that are married, as that list could go on and on. --&gt;

Same-sex marriages and relationships have been a theme in several fictional story arcs, mythology, and video games.

===Games===
Same-sex marriage is possible in an increasing number of modern video games including: ''[[Fable II]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masaki|first=Lyle|title=Same-sex marriage in the Fable games was no big deal for Peter Molyneux|url=http://www.afterelton.com/blog/lylemasaki/same-sex-marriage-in-fable2|publisher=[[AfterElton.com]]|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopkins|first=Tom|title=Skyrim Includes Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/news/1028931/skyrim_includes_samesex_marriage.html|publisher=nowgamer.com|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fallout 2]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hirshman |first=Linda |url= http://www.salon.com/2007/04/28/gay_dwarves/ |title=Why can't gay dwarves get married in Middle-earth? |work=Salon |date=28 April 2007 |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Sims 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masaki|first=Lyle|title="The Sims 3" makes full-on gay marriage a virtual reality |url= http://www.afterelton.com/blog/lylemasaki/the-sims-3-includes-gay-marriage |publisher=[[AfterElton.com]] |accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The popular fantasy game [[Dragon Age: Inquisition]] has several characters who espouse homosexual or bisexual orientations. In the final DLC, Trespasser, a female Inquisitor can marry the female elven rogue Sera if that character was romanced.

===Comics===

In September 2010, [[Kevin Keller (comics)|Kevin Keller]] was introduced as the first openly gay character in the [[Archie Comics]] universe.  Keller's marriage to Clay Walker was shown in the January 2012 issue of ''[[Life with Archie#The Married Life|Life with Archie:  The Married Life]]''.

In issue #51 of the ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' comic series, the superhero [[Northstar|Jean-Paul Beaubier]] marries his partner Kyle Jinadu, making him the first superhero in a mainstream comic book to have a same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peeples|first=Jase|title=Comic Books Take a Big Leap Forward With Gay Wedding|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/comics-and-graphic-novels/2012/06/19/get-early-look-how-marvel-comics-depicts|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Advocate]]|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Same-sex marriages have also been depicted, increasingly in a positive light, in TV series including ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[Modern Family]]'', ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (2000 TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', ''[[The New Normal (TV series)|The New Normal]]'', ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'', ''[[The Fosters (2013 TV series)|The Fosters]]'' and ''[[Marry Me (U.S. TV series)|Marry Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/medias-gay-marriage-consensus/|title=Media's Gay Marriage Consensus |publisher=Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting|date=1 February 2013|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Puente|first=Maria|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-08-24-gayshollywood23_CV_N.htm|title=Hollywood now opening arms to gay characters, families|work=USA Today|date=24 August 2010|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
