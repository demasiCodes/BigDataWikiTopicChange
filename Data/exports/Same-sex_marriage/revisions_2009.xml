'''Same-sex marriage''' (also called '''gay marriage''') is a [[Law|legally]] or [[society|social]]ly recognized [[marriage]] between two persons of the same [[biological sex]] or [[gender identity|social gender]].

Same-sex marriage is a civil rights, political, social, moral, and/or religious issue in many western nations. The conflict arises from the term "marriage" being used to include same-sex relationships as well as an often-overlapping government-endorsed civil status with legal benefits.&lt;ref name=MuslimWaPo&gt;[http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/pamela_k_taylor/2009/07/marriage_both_civil_and_religious.html Marriage: Both Civil and Religious], Pamela Taylor, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', July 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/susan_k_smith/2009/07/marriage_a_civil_right_not_sacred_rite.html Marriage a Civil Right, not Sacred Rite], Susan Smith, ''The Washington Post'', July 30, 2009; accessed 9/12/2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Support for same-sex marriage is often based upon what is regarded as a [[universal human rights]] issue,  mental and physical health concerns, [[equality before the law]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalrightsfoundation.org/pressDownloads/AFER_Case_Announce.pdf Prop. 8 Challenged in Federal Court], [[American Foundation for Equal Rights]], May 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the goal of [[Normalization|normalizing]] [[LGBT]] relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abraham|first=Julie|title=Public Relations: Why the Rush to Same-Sex Marriage?

Opposition to same-sex marriage is often based upon the inclusion of same-sex couples in the word marriage. Other reasons may include direct and indirect social consequences of same-sex marriages, [[parenting]] concerns, [[Religious arguments about same-sex marriage|religious grounds]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/09/16/2009-09-16_church_in_ukraine_calls_elton_john_a_sinner_in_adoption_inquiry.html Church in Ukraine calls Elton John a Sinner In Adoption Inquiry], Joshua Cinelli, ''[[New York Daily News]]'', September 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;, tradition, and [[heterosexism]].

== Etymology and terminological usage ==

The word "marriage" comes from Old French ''mariage'', from ''marier'' (“‘to marry’”), from Latin ''maritare'' (“‘to marry", literally “give in marriage’”), from ''maritus'' (“‘lover", "nuptial’”), from ''mas'' (“‘male", "masculine", "of the male sex’”).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myetymology.com/english/marriage.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists have struggled to come up with a definition of marriage that absorbs commonalities of the social construct across cultures.&lt;ref name=Fedorak&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=gJJ9Eu06JmEC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=anthropologists%20struggle%20define%20marriage&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA174#v=onepage&amp;q=anthropologists%20struggle%20define%20marriage&amp;f=false Anthropology Matters!], Shirley Fedorak, Broadview Press, 2007, Chapter 11, Page 174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gough&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2844434 The Nayars and the Definition of Marriage], Kathleen Gough, The Journals of [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]], 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edvard Westermarck]] defined marriage in the 1922 edition of ''The History of Human Marriage'' as "a relation of one or more men to one or more women which is recognized as [[custom]] or law and involves certain rights and [[duties]]" to the individuals who enter into it, and any children born from it.&lt;ref name=Westermarck&gt;''This History of Human Marriage'', Volume 1, Edvard Westermarck, Oxford University Press, Chapter 1, Page 26; 1922 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such definitions failed to recognize same-sex marriages that have been documented around the world, including in more than 30 [[Ethnic groups in Africa|African cultures]], such as the [[Kikuyu]] and [[Nuer]].&lt;ref name=Gough/&gt;&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjbESL6YWU0C&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;ots=WdlOOaKAAq&amp;dq=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Woman-woman%20marriage%20in%20Africa%22&amp;f=false Boy-wives and female husbands: studies of African homosexualities], Stephen O.

[[NWSA Journal]] - Volume 12, Number 1, Spring 2000, pp. 1-23&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[lexicography]], words have changed and expanded in accordance to the status quo. In the last ten years, in the English-speaking world, all major dictionaries have either dropped gender specifications, or supplemented them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or same-sex unions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/may/24/20040524-103201-1169r/ Dictionaries take lead in redefining modern marriage], ''[[Washington Times]]'', May 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABA&gt;[http://www.abajournal.com/news/webster_makes_it_official_definition_of_marriage_has_changed/ Webster Makes It Official: Definition of Marriage Has Changed], Martha Neil, ''[[American Bar Association]]'', March 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2215628/ Dictionaries recognize same-sex marriage—who knew?], Daniel Redman, ''[[Slate.com|Slate]]'', April 7, 2009; accessed 9/19/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of same-sex marriages use the term '''marriage equality'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://www.samesexmarriage.ca/
|title=Equal Marriage for Same-Sex Couples
|publisher=Kevin Bourassa and Joe Varnell
}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''gender-neutral marriage'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/09/08/BAIHS19CJ.DTL&amp;type=politics&lt;/ref&gt; to stress that they seek equality as opposed to special rights. Some opponents argue that equating same-sex and opposite-sex marriages changes the meaning of marriage and its traditions,&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Maggie. "Traditional Marriage Trifecta in the Making?." Human Events 64.36 (20 Oct. 2008): 17-17. Academic Search Premier.

[[Alan Dershowitz]] and others have suggested reserving the word "marriage" for religious contexts as part of [[privatizing marriage]], and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of [[civil union]]s, in part to strengthen the separation between church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Use in print and online media===
Some publications that oppose same-sex marriages adopt an editorial style policy of placing the word ''marriage'' in [[quotation marks]] ("marriage") when it is used in reference to same-sex couples. In the United States, the mainstream press has generally abandoned this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/02/25/washington-times-scare-quotes-are-history/|title=Washington Times Scare Quotes Are History|publisher=Washington City Paper|author=Erik Wemple|date=25 February 2008|accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some socially conservative online publications, such as [[WorldNetDaily]] and [[Baptist Press]], still follow the practice. Cliff Kincaid of [[Accuracy in Media]] argues for use of quotation marks on the grounds that marriage is a legal status denied same-sex couples by most state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[AP Stylebook|Associated Press style]] recommends the usages ''marriage for gays and lesbians'' or in space-limited headlines ''gay marriage'' with no hyphen and no scare quotes. AP warns that the construct ''gay marriage'' can imply that marriage licenses offered to gay and lesbian couples are somehow legally different, as such it should be avoided as much as possible in favor of ''marriage for gays and lesbians''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==History==
{{Main|History of same-sex unions|Timeline of same-sex marriage}}
=== Ancient===
Various types of same-sex marriages have existed,&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PT267&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from informal, unsanctioned relationships to highly ritualized unions.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=mlFp0nFhvbwC&amp;dq=Ritualized+Homosexuality+Herdt&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MBbOSvmjIIOa8Aao5PT6Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southern [[China|Chinese]] province of [[Fujian]], through the [[Ming dynasty]] period, females would bind themselves in contracts to younger females in elaborate ceremonies.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Males also entered similar arrangements. This type of arrangement was also similar in ancient European history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Book

The first recorded mention of the performance of same-sex marriages occurred during the early Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, "Same Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe." (New York: Random House, 1995). Pages 80-85.&lt;/ref&gt; While there is a consensus among modern historians that same-sex relationships were tolerated in ancient Rome, the frequency and nature of same-sex unions during that period is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Eskridge|first= William N.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1993|month= Oct|title= A History of Same-Sex Marriage |journal= Virginia Law Review |volume= 79|issue= 7|pages= |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= The Romans may have accorded some same-sex unions the legal or cultural status of marriage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 342 AD, Christian emperors Constantius II and Constans issued a law in the [[Theodosian Code]] (''C.

=== Modern ===
In October 1989, [[Denmark]] became the first country to recognize same-sex unions in the form of "registered partnerships".
In 2001, the [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] became the first nation to grant same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/05/26/f-same-sex-timeline.html|title=Same-sex marriage around the world|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriages are granted and mutually recognized by [[Same-sex marriage in Belgium|Belgium]] (2003),&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.senaat.be/www/?MIval=/dossier&amp;LEG=2&amp;NR=1173&amp;LANG=nl Legislative record of the same-sex marriage bill in Dutch] and [http://www.senaat.be/www/?MIval=/dossier&amp;LEG=2&amp;NR=1173&amp;LANG=fr in French], by the Belgian Senate.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|Spain]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|Canada]] (2005), [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] (2006), [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Norway|Norway]] (2009), and [[Same-sex marriage in Sweden|Sweden]] (2009). In [[Same-sex marriage in Nepal|Nepal]], their recognition has been judicially mandated but not yet legislated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=NLetter&amp;id=7c190914-f498-427c-ad0b-97559a3aae71&amp;Headline=Nepal+SC+approves+same-sex+marriage "Hindustan Times" (a news outlet in India) Article dated November 19, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Parliament]] approved the granting and recognition of same-sex marriages by defining marriage as “the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others” in July 2005. A Conservative Government motion inviting MPs to request repeal of [[same-sex marriage in Canada]] failed in December 2006, so same-sex marriages continue to be honored throughout the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equal-marriage.ca/resource.php?id=538 Canadians for Equal Marriage News Article dates December 7, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]] bans recognition of same-sex marriages at the federal level, but the current [[Australian Labor Party]] government favors synchronized state and territory [[registered partnership]] legislation (as in [[Tasmania]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]). The [[Australian Capital Territory]] has [[civil unions]].

[[New Zealand]]'s Parliament rejected a bill that would have prohibited the recognition of [[same-sex marriage in New Zealand]] in December 2005. However, New Zealand's Marriage Act 1955 still only recognizes marriage rights for opposite-sex couples. New Zealand's marriage laws consider [[transsexuals]] who have undergone [[reassignment surgery]] as having changed sex for legal purposes, following Family Court and [[High Court of New Zealand]] decisions in 1995.

[[Same-sex marriage in Israel|Israel]]'s High Court of Justice ruled to honor same-sex marriages granted in other countries even though Israel itself does not issue such licenses. A bill was raised in the [[Knesset]] (parliament) to rescind the High Court's ruling, but the Knesset has not advanced the bill since December 2006.

In France, in 2006, a 30-member non-[[quorum]] parliamentary commission of the [[Same-sex marriage in France|French]] National Assembly published a 453-page ''Report on the Family and the Rights of Children'', which rejected same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2006_docs/Francesummary.pdf|format=PDF|title=Executive summary of "Report on the Family and the Rights of Children" prepared by the French National Assembly, Paris, January 25, 2006|date=25 January 2006|accessdate=24 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Africa ===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Africa}}
Same-sex marriage became legal in [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|South Africa]] on 30 November 2006 when the Civil Unions Bill was enacted after having been passed by the South African Parliament earlier that month. A ruling by the Constitutional Court on 1 December 2005 had imposed a deadline of 1 December 2006 to make same-sex marriage legal. South Africa became the fifth country, the first in Africa, and the second outside Europe, to legalize same-sex marriage. In 2006, [[Same-sex marriage in Nigeria|Nigerian]] President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] introduced legislation that prohibits same-sex marriages and criminalizes anyone who "performs, witnesses, aids or abets" such ceremonies.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;[http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/afrec/vol21no1/211-gays-lesbians-combat-bias.html African gays and lesbians combat bias], Michael Fleshman, Africa Renewal, Vol.21 #1 (April 2007), page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the [[Igbo people]] of [[Nigeria]] there are circumstances where a marriage between two women is allowed, such as when a woman has no child and the husband dies.&lt;ref name=NigeriaTribune&gt;[http://www.tribune.com.ng/19062009/opinion.html Tradition of same gender marriage in Igboland], Leo Igwe, Nigerian Tribune, June 19, 2009; accessed September 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International organizations===
The terms of employment of the staff of [[international organizations]] (not [[Business|commercial]]) in most cases are not governed by the laws of the country in which their offices are located. Agreements with the host country safeguard these organizations' impartiality. 

Despite their relative independence, few organizations currently recognize same-sex partnerships without condition. The agencies of the [[United Nations]] voluntarily [[discriminate]] between opposite-sex marriages and same-sex marriages, as well as discriminating between employees on the basis of nationality. These organizations recognize same-sex marriages only if the country of citizenship of the employees in question recognizes the marriage. In some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to opposite-sex married couples to de facto partners or [[domestic partner]]s of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into an opposite-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. However, the [[World Bank]] does recognize domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the [[United States]], although same-sex marriages are not recognized federally, same-sex couples can currently marry in five states, and receive state level benefits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iGQ6LMSOvL9rjDHrAmyO9mHoVieAD9BOJN7G1&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several states offer civil unions or domestic partnerships, granting all or part of the state-level rights and responsibilities of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/issues/1548.htm HRC: LGBT Laws of NJ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrc.org/issues/904.htm HRC: LGBT Laws of Maryland]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 31 states that have put Same-sex marriage the ballot, each had failed to achieve a popular vote. In 1996, the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]] passed the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) defining marriage solely as a union between a couple of the opposite sex for all federal purposes and allowing for the nonrecognition amongst the states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/1/7.html US CODE: Title 1,7.

== Other legally recognized same-sex unions ==
{{Main|Civil union}}
Civil unions, [[civil partnership]]s, [[domestic partnership]]s, [[registered partnership]]s, or unregistered partnership/unregistered co-habitation legal status offer varying portions of the legal benefits of marriage and are available to same-sex couples in: [[Andorra]], [[Australia]], [[Colombia]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], Denmark, [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Israel]], [[Luxembourg]], [[New Zealand]], [[Portugal]], [[Slovenia]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Uruguay]]. They are also available in  parts of [[Argentina]] (Villa Carlos Paz, Río Cuarto, Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Río Negro), [[Mexico]] (Coahuila and the Federal District), and the [[United States]] ([[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Hawaii]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Washington]], and the federal [[District of Columbia]]).

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], Commonwealth law prohibits the recognition of same-sex marriage. However, all states and territories provide a range of rights to same-sex couples cohabiting, equal to those afforded to opposite-sex ''de facto'' couples. These rights are gained without registration. Furthermore, formal domestic partnership registries exist in [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Since November 2008, same-sex couples are recognized as ''de facto'' partners in a wide range of Commonwealth legislation, including superannuation, social security, health care and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/sweeping-gay-law-reform-finally-passes-20081127-6jgd.html Sweeping gay law reform finally passes]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Grace Abrams and Fiona Power became Australia's first legally recognized same-sex married couple after Grace Abrams had gender-modification surgery and was later officially granted a passport with female status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/16/2060485.htm Limited govt equals freedom for same-sex couples]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
{{Same-sex marriage map Europe|align=left|size=200px}}
In Denmark, [[Finland]], [[Hungary]] and Iceland, a [[registered partnership]] is "nearly" equal to marriage, including legal joint adoption rights in Denmark and Iceland.  [[Finland]] and [[Greenland]] have biological adoption only (no joint adoption). These partnership laws are short laws that state that wherever the word "marriage" appears in the country's law, it will now also be construed to mean "registered partnership", and wherever the word "spouse" appears, it will now also be construed to mean "registered partner" — thereby transferring the body of marriage laws onto same-sex couples in registered partnerships.

In the [[United Kingdom]], [[civil partnerships]] were introduced in 2005. The law gives civil partners the same benefits and associated legal rights of marriage; ranging from tax exemptions and joint property rights, to [[next-of-kin]] status and shared parenting responsibilities. The one notable exception is the use of [[courtesy titles]] by the partner of a male peer or knight.  In the first year, 16,100 ceremonies took place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/feb/03/gayrights.world Honeymoon is over for gay weddings]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil unions in New Zealand]] are identical to British civil partnerships in their association with equivalent spousal rights and responsibilities to marriage.

==Transgender and intersex persons==
{{Refimprovesect|date=December 2008}}
{{See also|Transsexualism|Legal aspects of transsexualism|Gender identity}}
When sex is defined legally, it may be defined by any one of several criteria: the [[XY sex-determination system]], the type of [[gonad]]s, or the type of external sexual features. Consequently, both [[transsexual]]s and [[intersex]]ed individuals may be legally categorized into confusing gray areas, and could be prohibited from marrying partners of the "opposite" sex or permitted to marry partners of the "same" sex due to legal distinctions. This could result in long-term marriages, as well as recent same-sex marriages, being overturned.

The problems of defining gender by the existence/non-existence of gonads or certain sexual features is complicated by the existence of [[Gender Reassignment Surgery|surgical methods]] to alter these features. Estimates&lt;ref&gt;(Fausto-Sterling et al., 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; run as high as 1 percent of live [[childbirth|birth]]s exhibiting some degree of sexual ambiguity, and between 0.1% and 0.2% of live births being ambiguous enough to become the subject of specialist medical attention, including sometimes involuntary [[surgery]] to address their sexual ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=8 March 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. In addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transsexual to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;Bockting, Walter, Autumn Benner, and Eli Coleman. "Gay and Bisexual Identity Development Among Female-to-Male Transsexuals in North America: Emergence of a Transgender Sexuality." Archives of Sexual Behavior 38.5 (Oct. 2009): 688-701. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 Sep. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the UK marriages are for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her marriage or civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate. Such persons are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity.

In the [[United States]], transsexual and intersexual marriages typically run into the complications detailed above. As definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;SCHWARTZ, JOHN. "U.S. Defends Marriage Law."

==Controversy==
{{Off-topic}}
{{See also|LGBT rights opposition}}
While few societies have recognized same-sex unions as marriages, the [[history of same-sex unions|historical and anthropological record]] reveals a large range of attitudes towards same-sex unions ranging from praise, to sympathetic toleration, to indifference, to prohibition. Opponents of same-sex marriages have argued that recognition of same-sex marriages would erode religious freedoms,&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston&gt;[http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/191kgwgh.asp Banned in Boston]&lt;/ref&gt; and that same-sex marriage, while doing good for the couples that participate in them and the children they are raising, undermines a right of children to be raised by their biological [[mother]] and [[father]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-blankenhorn19-2008sep19,0,6057126.story|title=Protecting marriage to protect children|last=Blankenhorn|first=David|date=19 September 2008|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supporters of same-sex marriages take the view that the government should have no role in regulating personal relationships,&lt;ref name="findlaw1"&gt;[http://family.findlaw.com/marriage/marriage-agreements/ See discussion of prenuptial and postmarital agreements at Findlaw]&lt;/ref&gt; while others argue that same-sex marriages would provide social benefits to same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="indegayforum1"&gt;Professor Dale Carpenter is a prominent spokesman for this view. For a better understanding of this view, see Professor Carpenter's writings at http://www.indegayforum.org/staff/show/91.html.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 Statement by the [[American Anthropological Association]] states that there is no evidence that society needs to maintain "marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution", and, further, that same-sex unions can "contribute to stable and humane societies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080117075617/http://www.aaanet.org/press/ma_stmt_marriage.htm Statement on Marriage and the Family from the American Anthropological Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]], and [[National Association of Social Workers]] state: "There is no scientific basis for distinguishing between same-sex couples and heterosexual couples with respect to the legal rights, obligations, benefits, and burdens conferred by civil marriage....  Empirical research has consistently shown that lesbian and gay parents do not differ from heterosexuals in their parenting skills, and their children do not show any deficits compared to children raised by heterosexual parents....  [I]f their parents are allowed to marry, the children of same-sex couples will benefit not only from the legal stability and other familial benefits that marriage provides, but also from elimination of state-sponsored stigmatization of their families."&lt;ref name=amici&gt;[http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/Amer_Psychological_Assn_Amicus_Curiae_Brief.pdf Case No. S147999 in the Supreme Court of the State of California, In re Marriage Cases Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 4365, Application for leave to file brief amici curiae in support of the parties challenging the marriage exclusion, and brief amici curiae of the American Psychological Association, California Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association, National Association of Social Workers, and National Association of Social Workers, California Chapter in support of the parties challenging the marriage exclusion]&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate regarding same-sex marriages includes debate based upon social viewpoints as well as debate based on majority rules, religious convictions, economic arguments, health-related concerns, and a variety of other issues.

===Judicial and legislative===
{{Main|Marriage (conflict)#Same-sex marriage}}
A "majority rules" position regards same-sex marriage as void and illegal unless it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;
"[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/12/03/state/n220022S18.DTL&amp;hw=same+sex+marriage+proposition&amp;sn=011&amp;sc=464 Poll: Calif. gay marriage ban driven by religion.]" By LISA LEFF, Associated Press Writer. Thursday, December 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a civil-rights view holds that, after carefully studying both sides of the controversy, an impartial judiciary, in upholding its constitutional duties, should decide whether the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is constitutionally guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;

In general, the legal effect marriage has on same-sex couples when marriage licenses are issued to them and honored by the states in which they live is indistinguishable from any other legal effect marriage has on any other couple under state law.  The United States has developed [[Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States#Case_law|extensive case law]] and [[Same-sex marriage legislation in the United States|legislation]] addressing the nuance of American legal conceptions of equality before the law.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religious arguments about same-sex marriage}}
Arguments on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate are often made on religious grounds and/or formulated in terms of religious doctrine. One source of controversy is how same-sex marriage affects [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston /&gt;&lt;ref name=number10&gt;[http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page14546 Government’s response]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/legislation_policies/submission_marriage-en.asp#Freedom%20of%20Religion Same-Sex Marriage and Freedom of Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/samesexrights/beforethecourt.html The Supreme Court decision]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/Same-Sex-Marriage-Religious-Liberty-Conflicts/dp/074256326X Same-Sex Marriage and Religious Liberty: Emerging Conflicts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=35C301F80C783C975F57C38497348379.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1991700 The Civil Partnership Act 2004, Same-Sex Marriage and the Church of England]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/blogs/talk/2008/06/gay_marriage_conflict_between_1.html Gay Marriage: Conflict Between Equal Rights and Religious Freedom?]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many churches (citing their religious beliefs) refuse to provide employment, public accommodations, adoption services and other benefits to same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91486340 Gay Rights, Religious Liberties: A Three-Act Story]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meridianmagazine.com/familyleadernetwork/080925freedom.html Religious Freedom Concerns are Real with Same-Sex Marriage]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some areas have made special provisions for religious protections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/23/us/23beliefs.html?_r=1 Same-Sex Marriage Laws Pose Protection Quandary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Christian groups have been vocal and politically active in opposing same-sex marriage laws in the United States. &lt;!--Cited list is in the [[Religious views on same-sex marriage]] subarticle  --&gt; Christians opposed to same-sex marriage have claimed that extending marriage rights to same-sex couples could undercut the conventional purpose of marriage, or would be contrary to God's will.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., Southern Baptist Convention, ''On Same-Sex Marriage'' (adopted 2003) http://www.sbc.net/resolutions/amResolution.asp?ID=1128 (visited January 20, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hatecrime.org/subpages/hatespeech/robertson.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021219203548/http://hatecrime.org/subpages/hatespeech/robertson.html|archivedate=2002-12-19|title=The Religious Right and Anti-Gay Speech: Messengers of Love or Purveyors of Hate?|publisher=Matthew Shepard Online Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apacny.net/The%20Christian%20Case%20Against%20Same-Sex%20Marriage.pdf|title=The Christian Case Against Same-Sex Marriage|date=January 2008|publisher=Association of Politically Active Christians|accessdate=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nogaymarriage.com/gaymarriagequestions.html Gay Marriage Questions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apacny.net/APACBiblicalPerspectiveSSMCU.pdf|title=A Biblical Perpective on Same-Sex "Marriage" and Civil Unions|date=January 2009|publisher=Association of Politically Active Christians|accessdate=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caucusforamerica.com/print.php?pID=41 America's Rabbi | Once Again Democrats Bow to “Unions”&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Christian opposition to same-sex marriage also comes from the belief that same-sex marriage normalizes homosexuality and would encourage individuals to act upon their homosexual feelings, rather than trying to overcome their [[same-sex attraction]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

Christian supporters of same-sex marriage have claimed that marriage rights for same-sex couples strengthens the institution of marriage and provides legal protection for children of gay and lesbian parents. Biblical apologetics for same-sex marriage rights include arguments that the word "homosexual", as found in many modern versions of the Bible, is an inaccurate translation of what is found in the original biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soulforce.org/article/homosexuality-bible-gay-christian|title=What the Bible Says - And Doesn't Say - About Homosexuality|last=White|first=Mel|publisher=Soulforce|accessdate=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaychurch.org/gay_and_christian_yes/calling_the_rainbow_nation_home/7_gac_the_clobber_passages.htm|title=The "Clobber" Passages|publisher=gaychurch.org|accessdate=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vines or Strong's biblical concordances do not contain the word "homosexual". There also is no direct biblical prohibition of marriage rights for same-sex couples. Certain biblical texts used by non-affirming Christian organizations to condemn homosexuality, and by extension same-sex marriage, may refer only to specific sex acts and idolatrous worship lacking any relevance to contemporary same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccchurch.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Resources|title=Resources|publisher=Metropolitan Community Church|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting marriage rights for gays and lesbians is viewed by affirming Christians as a Christ-like commitment to the equality and dignity of all persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedominchrist-sf.org/article_rd.htm|title=Before you Begin Studying the "Clobber" Passages|last=Davis|first=Richard|publisher=Freedom In Christ|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc2009.org/ViewLegislation/view_leg_detail.aspx?id=986&amp;type=Final|title=D025 - Anglican Communion: Commitment and Witness to Anglican Communion|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wouldjesusdiscriminate.com/|title=Would Jesus Discriminate?|publisher=Metropolitan Community Church|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Church of Canada asserts that "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, are a gift from God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Judaism]], like [[Christianity]], contains varying views on the issue of marriage rights, both politically and religiously, for same-sex couples. Many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] maintain the traditional Jewish bans on both sexual acts and marriages amongst members of the same sex,&lt;ref&gt; Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, Orthodox Response to Same-Sex Marriage, NY Jewish Week (Mar. 26, 2004) http://www.ou.org/public_affairs/article/ou_resp_same_sex_marriage/ (visited January 20, 2008); Rabbinical Council of America, Joining with Three Other Orthodox Organizations, RCA Opposes Redefinition of Marriage in New York State (June 21, 2007) http://www.rabbis.org/news/index.cfm?type=policies (visited January 20, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; but other orthodox rabbis, such as [[Steven Greenberg]], disagree.

[[Buddhist]] scripture and teachings do not take a consistent stance against homosexuality, and do not specifically proscribe nor endorse same-sex marriage; thus, there is no unified stance for or against the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,1429,0,0,1,0|title=Will gay marriage be allowed by Buddhists in Thailand?|last=Bhikkhu|first=Mettanando|date=13 July 2005|publisher=Buddhist Channel|agency=Bangkok Post|accessdate=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Findings from a longitudinal study of lesbian families.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cga.ct.gov/jud/old/SameSexMarriage/WhyWeOppose.pdf Why we oppose]&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted by Professor Judith Stacey, of [[New York University]]: “Rarely is there as much consensus in any area of social science as in the case of gay parenting, which is why the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] and all of the major professional organizations with expertise in child welfare have issued reports and resolutions in support of gay and lesbian parental rights”.&lt;ref&gt;cited in Cooper &amp; Cates, 2006, p. 36; citation available on http://www.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/LGBT-Families-Lit-Review.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]] and [[National Association of Social Workers]] have stated in an [[Amicus curiae]] brief presented to the [[Supreme Court]] of the State of [[California]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Although it is sometimes asserted in policy debates that heterosexual couples are inherently better parents than same-sex couples, or that the children of lesbian or gay parents fare worse than children raised by heterosexual parents, those assertions find no support in the scientific research literature. When comparing the outcomes of different forms of parenting, it is critically important to make appropriate comparisons. For example, differences resulting from the number of parents in a household cannot be attributed to the parents’ gender or sexual orientation. Research in households with heterosexual parents generally indicates that – all else being equal – children do better with two parenting figures rather than just one. The specific research studies typically cited in this regard do not address parents’ sexual orientation, however, and therefore do not permit any conclusions to be drawn about the consequences of having heterosexual versus nonheterosexual parents, or two parents who are of the same versus different genders. Indeed, the scientific research that has directly compared outcomes for children with gay and lesbian parents with outcomes for children with heterosexual parents has been remarkably consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents are every bit as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents. Amici emphasize that the abilities of gay and lesbian persons as parents and the positive outcomes for their children are not areas where credible scientific researchers disagree. Statements by the leading associations of experts in this area reflect professional consensus that children raised by lesbian or gay parents do not differ in any important respects from those raised by heterosexual parents. No credible empirical research suggests otherwise. Allowing same-sex couples to legally marry will not have any detrimental effect on children raised in heterosexual households, but it will benefit children being raised by same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="amici"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated in [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]], the most-cited journal in the field of pediatrics: "More than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents' sexual orientation and any measure of a child's emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. These data have demonstrated no risk to children as a result of growing up in a family with 1 or more gay parents. Conscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, can be excellent parents."&lt;ref name=pediatrics&gt;Pawelski, James G., Perrin, Ellen C., Foy, Jane M., Allen, Carole E., Crawford, James E., Del Monte, Mark, Kaufman, Miriam, Klein, Jonathan D., Smith, Karen, Springer, Sarah, Tanner, J.

The research indicates that parenting practices and children’s outcomes in families parented by lesbian and gay parents are likely to be at least as favourable as those in families of heterosexual parents, despite the reality that considerable legal discrimination and inequity remain significant challenges for these families.".&lt;ref name=apsp&gt;[http://www.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/LGBT-Families-Lit-Review.pdf Elizabeth Short, Damien W.

Proponents of same-sex marriage contend that by expanding marriage to LGBT individuals the state actually protects the rights of all married couples and, if they had any, of their children without discrimination while in no way affecting the rights of opposite sex married couples and their children, natural or adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter. "Changing families and communities: an LGBT contribution to an alternative development path." Development in Practice 19.7 (15 Nov. 2009): 825-836. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 29 Sep. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on marriage statistics of opposite-sex married couples by researcher [[Darren Spedale]] found that 15 years after Denmark had granted same-sex couples marriage-like partnership status, rates of opposite-sex marriage in those countries had gone up, and rates of opposite-sex divorce had gone down.  He says this is evidence that same-sex unions do not have a negative effect on traditional marriages, which he says would also apply to same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eskridge|first=William N.

However, a study on same-sex partnerships in [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] found that short-term divorce risks are higher in same-sex partnerships than in opposite-sex marriages.&lt;ref name="The Demographics of Same-Se"&gt;{{cite journal

A multi-method, multi-informant comparison of community samples of committed gay male and lesbian (30 participants each) couples with both committed (50 young engaged and 40 older married participants) and non-committed (109 exclusively dating) opposite-sex pairs was conducted in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Roisman, Glenn I.; Clausell, Eric; Holland, Ashley; Fortuna, Keren; Elieff, Chryle.

===Marriage privatization===

A libertarian argument for [[marriage privatization]] holds that the state has no role in defining the terms whereby individuals contract to arrange their personal relationships, regardless of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Lindenberger&gt;Lindenberger, M., "A Gay-Marriage Solution: End Marriage?" in ''Newsweek'', Mar. 16, 2009. [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1885190,00.html?xid=rss-topstories]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kinsella&gt;Kinsella, S. "Libertarian View on Gay Marriage" in ''LewRockwell.com'', June 6, 2006. [http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/010707.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boaz&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXrUdgTMG4E Boaz, D., speech to Commonwealth Club of California]&lt;/ref&gt; People holding this viewpoint argue that the state should have a limited role or no role in defining marriage, only in enforcing those contracts people construct themselves and willfully enter.  Those following this line of reasoning believe that efforts to "legitimize" same-sex marriages as a state institution are backwards-looking, and will have the effect of expanding state influence into personal affairs where state influence already does not belong.  People opposing same-sex marriages on these grounds, also support scaling back the definition by the state of contractual obligations between opposite sex partners to a same or similar degree.

=== Mental and physical health concerns ===
{{See also|LGBT topics in medicine}}
Several Canadian physicians and [[Paul Cameron]] of the US [[Family Research Institute]] argue that while people should have the choice whether to participate in [[same-sex relationship]]s, those relationships should not be given official recognition because of the health effects associated with [[men who have sex with men]] and [[women who have sex with women]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2005/feb/05021709.html Same-Sex ‘Marriage’ a Health Risk Doctors Warn Parliamentarians]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblebelievers.com/Cameron1.html SAME SEX MARRIAGE: Til Death Do Us Part? ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifesitenews.com/features/marriage_defence/SSM_MD_evidence.pdf ‘Gay marriage’ and homosexuality some medical comments]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massresistance.org/docs/marriage/effects_of_ssm.html What same-sex "marriage" has done to Massachusetts]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Concerned Women for America]] (a conservative US group promoting what they consider to be biblical values) argues that "The government should not condone behavior that is unhealthy, spreads disease and can result in death."&lt;ref&gt;[http://states.cwfa.org/articledisplay.asp?id=7927&amp;department=FIELD&amp;categoryid=family Several Reasons to Oppose Same-Sex Marriage]&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters of same-sex marriage argue that same-sex marriage would encourage monogamy and help stop the spread of disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebody.com/content/art8968.html Fostering Stable Relationships, Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage Could Help Reduce Number of HIV Cases Among MSM, Editorial Says]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education controversy ===

The subject of how the legalization of same-sex marriage affects public education is a source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/21/usa-gayrights Gay marriage opponents put California schools in centre of debate: Adverts claim public schools will teach same-sex marriage if measure fails to overturn state supreme court decision]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esposiblelaesperanza.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=922:espana-18-argumentos-contra-la-ley-del-qmatrimonioq-homosexual&amp;catid=61:13-cultura-pro-gay-y-matrimonio-y-familia&amp;Itemid=28 España: 18 argumentos contra la ley del "matrimonio" homosexual ]&lt;/ref&gt;  An argument sometimes used by supporters is that teaching same-sex marriage in schools will help children to be more open minded by exposing them to different types of families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kennebecjournal.mainetoday.com/news/local/7038960.html Same-sex marriage and Mass. education]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is concern from opponents of same-sex marriage that it will undermine parental rights over their children's education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1381702 Marriage Rights and Parental Rights: Parents, the State, and Proposition 8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/News/ci_13611733 Parents face court action for removing children from gay history lessons]&lt;/ref&gt;  They say that schools shouldn't teach that opposite-sex marriage is the same as same-sex marriage, and legalizing same-sex marriage will force them to treat it the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protectmarriage.com/about/ballot-arguments Ballot Arguments]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of same-sex marriage==
The American Psychological Association, [[American Psychiatric Association]] and [[National Association of Social Workers]] have stated in an [[Amicus curiae]] brief presented to the [[Supreme Court]] of the State of [[California]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Homosexuality is neither a disorder nor a disease, but rather a normal variant of human sexual orientation. The vast majority of gay and lesbian individuals lead happy, healthy, well-adjusted, and productive lives. Many gay and lesbian people are in a committed same-sex relationship. In their essential psychological respects, these relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships. The institution of marriage affords individuals a variety of benefits that have a favorable impact on their physical and psychological well-being. A large number of children are currently being raised by lesbians and gay men, both in same-sex couples and as single parents. Empirical research has consistently shown that lesbian and gay parents do not differ from heterosexuals in their parenting skills, and their children do not show any deficits compared to children raised by heterosexual parents. State policies that bar same-sex couples from marrying are based solely on sexual orientation. As such, they are both a consequence of the stigma historically attached to homosexuality, and a structural manifestation of that stigma. By allowing same-sex couples to marry, the Court would end the antigay stigma imposed by the State of California through its ban on marriage rights for same-sex couples. In addition, allowing same-sex couples to marry would give them access to the social support that already facilitates and strengthens heterosexual marriages, with all of the psychological and physical health benefits associated with that support. In addition, if their parents are allowed to marry, the children of same-sex couples will benefit not only from the legal stability and other familial benefits that marriage provides, but also from elimination of state-sponsored stigmatization of their families. There is no scientific basis for distinguishing between same-sex couples and heterosexual couples with respect to the legal rights, obligations, benefits, and burdens conferred by civil marriage.&lt;ref name="amici"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mental health===
Recently, several psychological studies&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Price, M. "UPFRONT - Research uncovers the stress created by same-sex marriage bans" in ''Monitor on Psychology'', Volume 40, No. 1, page 10, January 2009. Washington DC: American Psychological Association. [http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/01/marriage-bans.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potoczniak, Daniel J.; Aldea, Mirela A.; DeBlaere, Cirleen"Ego identity, social anxiety, social support, and self​-​concealment in lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(4), Oct 2007, 447-457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Balsam, Kimberly F.; Mohr, Jonathan J. "Adaptation to sexual orientation stigma: A comparison of bisexual and lesbian/gay adults." ''Journal of Counseling Psychology,'' Vol 54(3), Jul 2007, 306-319.
&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for the LGBT population that may affect their health and well-being.

Gay activist [[Jonathan Rauch]] has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity.&lt;ref&gt;Rauch, Jonathan. "For Better or Worse?" The case for gay (and straight) marriage. ''The New Republic'', May 6, 1996. [http://www.jonathanrauch.com/jrauch_articles/gay_marriage_1_the_case_for_marriage/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rauch, Jonathan (2004). ''Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America.'' New York, NY: Henry Holt and Company, LLC.[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805078150/independegayforu]&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to opposite-sex marriage, [[Gregory M. Herek]] claims that the data&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Herek, Gregory M. "Legal recognition of same-sex relationships in the United States: A social science perspective." ''American Psychologist,'' Vol 61(6), Sep 2006, 607-621.&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that same-sex and opposite-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Herek concludes that same-sex couples and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

=== Physical health ===

In 2009, a pair of economists at [[Emory University]] tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of [[HIV]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sovo.com/2009/6-12/news/localnews/10213.cfm Emory researchers: Gay marriage bans increase HIV infections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emory.edu/home/news/releases/2009/06/study-links-gay-marriage-bans-to-rise-in-hiv-rate.html Study Links Gay Marriage Bans to Rise in HIV infections]&lt;/ref&gt; The study linked the passage of same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.
