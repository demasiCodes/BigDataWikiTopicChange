The portrayal of men and women in [[video games]], as in other media, is a subject of research in [[gender studies]] and is discussed in the context of [[sexism in video gaming]].

Although women make up about half of video game players, they are significantly underrepresented as characters in mainstream games, despite the prominence of iconic heroines such as [[Samus Aran]] or [[Lara Croft]].&lt;ref name="GallupHalf" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=James D.|last1=Ivory|title=Still a Man's Game: Gender Representation in Online Reviews of Video Games|url=https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327825mcs0901_6|journal=Mass Communication and Society|date=1 February 2006|issn=1520-5436|pages=103–114|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0901_6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrayal of women in games often reflects traditional [[gender role]]s, [[sexual objectification]], or stereotypes such as that of the "[[damsel in distress]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Xeniya|last1=Kondrat|title=Gender and video games: How is female gender generally represented in various genres of video games?|url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=289532|journal=Journal of Comparative Research in Anthropology and Sociology|date= n.d. |issn=2068-0317|pages=171–193|volume=6|issue=01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tremblay2012" /&gt; Male characters are often stereotypically depicted as big and muscular, and [[LGBT]] characters have been slow to appear in video games as a result of the [[heteronormativity]] of the medium.&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VirtualMuscularity" /&gt;

Research indicates that how genders are portrayed in games can influence players' perception of gender roles, and that young girls prefer to play a character of their own gender much more than boys do.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dill" /&gt;  On average, female-led games sell fewer copies than male-led ones, but also have lower marketing budgets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2014 SuperData Research study found that men and women enjoy video games, but some genres are attracting one gender more than the other: Women compose 57.8 percent of the mobile market, 53.6 percent of the RPG market and 50.2 percent of the PC market (including social games). The study found that men make up 66 percent of MMO players, 66 percent of FPS players and 63 percent of digital console players.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt;

Playable female characters were found to appear less frequently than male characters in reviews for popular games in a 2006 study from [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Ivory, J.

In a sample of 669 action, shooter, and role-playing games selected by EEDAR in 2012, 300 (45%) provided the option of playing as a female, but only 24 (4%) had an exclusively female protagonist. EEDAR found in 2010 that 10% of games had a protagonist with an indiscernible gender.&lt;ref name="escapistEEDAR"/&gt; Downs and Smith (2010) analyzed the top 20 bestselling games in the US in 2003, finding that only 14% of characters were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Downs|first1=Edward|last2=Smith|first2=Stacy L.|date=2010-06-01|title=Keeping Abreast of Hypersexuality: A Video Game Character Content Analysis|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=62|issue=11|pages=721–733|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1|s2cid=143765365|issn=1573-2762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Madeline Messer writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 2015, among the top 50 [[Platform game#Endless running game|endless running]] games for mobile devices, 98% of those with gender-identifiable characters featured male protagonists, of which 90% were free to play. As many as 46% of these games offered female characters, and only 15% offered them for free. Playing as a girl required, on average, an additional purchase of $7.53, much more than the games themselves cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Messer|first1=Madeline|title=I'm a 12-year-old girl.

====Evolution====
[[Namco]]'s [[arcade video game]] ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980), while starring a male protagonist, was "the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women" as players. The game's popularity among women led to the game's North American distributor, [[Midway Games]], developing a sequel ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]'' (1982) starring a female protagonist as their "way of thanking all those lady arcaders who have played and enjoyed ''Pac-Man''."&lt;ref name="worley198205"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Worley |first=Joyce |date=May 1982 |title=Women Join the Arcade Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Games_Volume_01_Number_03_1982-05_Reese_Communications_US/page/n29 |magazine=Electronic Games |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=30–33 [33] |access-date=2019-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an earlier arcade game representing female characters, [[Exidy]]'s arcade game ''Score'' (1977), but no screenshots of the game are known to be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.acriticalhit.com/video-dames-the-history-of-playable-female-protagonists/ | title=Video Dames: The History Of Playable Female Protagonists | publisher=A Critical Hit! | access-date=6 October 2021 | author=Kate Willaert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samus Aran]], the heroine of ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' (1986) and its [[Metroid (series)|successors]], is often cited as "the first playable human female character in a mainstream video game".&lt;ref name="Guinness2013"&gt;{{cite book | title=Guinness World Records 2013: Gamer's Edition | publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd | year=2012 | page=154 | isbn=9781904994954}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several earlier less-popular video games with playable human female characters, including Billie Sue from ''[[Wabbit (video game)|Wabbit]]'' (1982), Becky from ''Otenba Becky no Daibouken'' (1983),&lt;ref&gt;[https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/msx/946031-otenba-becky-no-daibouken/reviews/166027 Otenba Becky no Daibouken – Review].

Studies of the prevalence of female characters in video games began to be conducted in sociological, educational, and cultural journals as early as the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1979, researchers publishing in ''[[The Psychological Record]]'' (Vol.29, No.1. Pp.&amp;nbsp;43–48) concluded from the results of a 201-person survey that 90% of male subjects and 85% of female subjects perceived the computer as masculine (in gameplay versus the computer).&lt;ref name=leroux&gt;Leroux, Yvan and Michel Pépin.

Pp.173–196. 1986. {{ISSN|0318-479X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, professor [[Sara Kiesler]] et al. published a study in ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (Vol.17, No.3. Pp.&amp;nbsp;40–48.) finding that female characters appeared in video games at a frequency of 1 game in 7.&lt;ref name=leroux/&gt; Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz suggested that the reduced presence of female characters implies a secondary status for women in video games and also suggesting playable female characters do appear in video games, they are more often scantily dressed and [[oversexualized]] than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effects of the Sexualization of Female Video Game Characters on Gender Stereotyping and Female Self-Concept|date=2009|journal=Sex Roles|volume=61|issue=11|pages=808–823|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9683-8|author1=Behm-Morawitz, Elizabeth|author2=Dana Mastro|s2cid=146385940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Australian ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'' magazine writer Virginia Barratt accused the [[video game industry]] of being sexist for the lack of female representation, stating video games "are made by boys for boys who play with other boys" and girls "rarely get a look in, unless of course there's a victim who needs to be rescued or someone needs to wear a bikini to cheer the macho men on."

A study of these games found that although the leading female characters in these games were able to subvert predominant gender stereotypes, women were still limited by men in the narratives, in particular through benevolent sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Perreault |first1=Mildred F. |last2=Perreault |first2=Gregory Pearson |last3=Jenkins |first3=Joy |last4=Morrison |first4=Ariel |date=December 16, 2016 |title=Depictions of Female Protagonists in Digital Games |journal=Games and Culture |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=843–860 |language=en |doi=10.1177/1555412016679584 |s2cid=152075784 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1555412016679584 |access-date=May 26, 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the developers' choice to omit playable women in the latest iterations of the top-tier gaming franchises ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Far Cry (series)|Far Cry]]'' became a focus of discussions in gaming media.

The announcement trailer for ''[[Battlefield V]]'' in 2018 was met with backlash from some fans of the [[Battlefield (video game series)|series]], who took issue with the potential portrayal of women in the game. Their main point of contention was with the British woman featured in the trailer, citing the character's presence as unrealistic due to women on the British side never participating in frontline combat during [[World War II]] and being mostly relegated to supporting roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Groux|first1=Christopher|title='Battlefield V' Trailer Sparks Outrage, But Did Women Fight in World War II?|url=https://www.newsweek.com/battlefield-v-5-trailer-outrage-did-women-fight-world-war-2-943856|website=Newsweek|access-date=September 1, 2018|date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game the hero was [[Mario]], and the objective of the game was to rescue a young princess named Peach from being kidnapped and trapped in a castle by the villain [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. By 2013, Peach has appeared in 14 of the main ''[[Super Mario]]'' games and is kidnapped in 13 of them. The only main games that Peach was not kidnapped in were in the North America release of ''[[Super Mario 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', but she was a character that can be played.

A number of games feature a female character as an ally or [[sidekick]] to the male hero. Some of them, like [[Ada Wong]] of ''[[Resident Evil]]'' and [[Mona Sax]] of ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'', were turned into [[player character]]s in later instances of their series. [[Alyx Vance]], a supporting protagonist of ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', was praised for her "stinging personality" and intelligence, developing a close bond with the player without simply being "eye candy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugo.com/games/video-game-hotties/?cur=alyx-vance&amp;morepics=17 Top 50 Videogame Hotties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215002247/http://ugo.com/games/video-game-hotties/?cur=alyx-vance&amp;morepics=17 |date=2009-02-15 }}.

Jeroen Jannsz and Raynel G. Martis conducted research on the representation of gender within video games and of the 12 games that were examined, there were 22 characters to look at. Two games did not have a second or supporting character in the intro [[cutscene]]: ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (video game)|Splinter Cell]]'' focused exclusively on protagonist [[Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)|Sam Fisher]], and ''[[Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness]]'' focused exclusively on Lara Croft.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jansz|first1=Jeroen|last2=Martis|first2=Raynel G.|date=2007-02-02|title=The Lara Phenomenon: Powerful Female Characters in Video Games|journal=Sex Roles|volume=56|issue=3–4|pages=141–148|doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9158-0|issn=0360-0025|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis showed a dominance of male characters in the games.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Thirteen of 22 game characters (about 60%) were men.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Among the leading characters there was an equal gender distribution (six men; six women), but supporting characters turned out to be seven men (70%) and three women (30%).&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; A difference appeared between characters who had a leading part in the game and those in a supporting role. Jannsz and Martis stated that there is a depiction of a lead role being in a commanding position and the narrative being about them.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; This is consistent with [[Virilization|masculinized]] traits such as leadership and independence that may be given to female characters along with sexualized attributes so they are "sexy" and appealing.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

===Sexualization===
[[File:Alison Carroll 6.jpg|thumb|upright|The video game heroine [[Lara Croft]], here portrayed by [[Alison Carroll]], is often used as an example of the [[sexual objectification]] of women in games.]]
The portrayal of women in video games has been the subject of academic study and controversy since the early 1980s. Recurring themes in articles and discussions on the topic include the [[sexual objectification]] and [[sexualization]] of female characters, done to appeal to a presumed male audience,&lt;ref name="Tremblay2012"/&gt; as well as the degree to which female characters are independent from their male counterparts within the same game. The sexualization of women involves the use of female bodies in a way that renders them the object of a sexual gaze or perception by others; their bodies are objectified and they are reduced to that of a sex object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Morawitz|first=Elizabeth|date=2007|title=Effects of the Sexualization of Female Characters in Video Games on Gender Stereotyping, Body Esteem, Self-Objectification, Self-Esteem, and Self-Efficacy|url=https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/194117|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on exposure to sexualized media representations of women in television and magazines has asked whether it reduces male compassion toward women, and reduces women's perceptions of their desire and suitability for various vocations.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

====Prevalence====
In their 2005 study, Karen E. Dill and K. P. Thill distinguish three major stereotypical depictions of women in gaming: (1) sexualized, (2) scantily clad, and (3) a vision of beauty. The study revealed that over 80% of women in video games represented one of these depictions. More than one quarter of female characters embodied all of the three stereotypical categories at once. Dill and Thill also note that another prevalent theme with which women were depicted was a combination of aggression and sex, referred to as "eroticized aggression".&lt;ref name="Dill"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dill|first=Karen E.|author2=Thill K.

A 2011 study regarding [[Gender identity|gender Identity]] and representation in Digital [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]] found that hyper-sexuality, which is often associated with female avatars, tends to negatively affect numerous types of [[gamer]]s, who deeply identify with their [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=McMenomy, Elizabeth Regina, 1974-|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/756868723|title=Game on girl : identity and representation in digital RPGS|date=2011|publisher=Washington State University|oclc=756868723}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that this issue reifies the idea that "a woman's power, in-game or out, comes entirely from her sexuality".

It also determined that there was no significant difference in sexualization between games rated as "Teen" (for ages 13 and up) and "Mature" (17 and up) by the [[ESRB]], indicating that sexualized women in games are so prevalent that they are not thought of as objectionable to children. Less sexualization was found in [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]], which are played more often by women, than in action and fighting games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Survey of 31 years of video games shows a decline in sexualized female characters|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-07-survey-years-video-games-decline.html|access-date=31 July 2016|work=[[Phys.org]]|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence against women===
Video games have been criticized for depicting [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://mediareporttowomen.com/issues/311.htm |title=Women's role in popular video games: Stripped down and killed off |journal=Media Report to Women |date=Winter 2003 |page=1 |volume=31 |issue=1 |access-date=2007-09-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720072203/http://www.mediareporttowomen.com/issues/311.htm |archive-date=2007-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 2013 game ''[[Dead Island: Riptide]]'' generated controversy when the special "zombie bait" edition of the game included a statue of a torso of a busty, dismembered woman in a skimpy bikini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/1/15/3878810/dead-island-riptides-bloody-torso-statue-sparks-anger-shock | title=Dead Island Riptide's bloody torso statue sparks anger, confusion | publisher=Polygon.com | date=January 15, 2013 | access-date=7 May 2014 | author=Brian Crecente}}&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' franchise has had issues with claims of violence against women,{{Vague|date=October 2018}} [[Rockstar North]]'s ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' was also surrounded in much criticism; so much so that [[Target Australia]] withdrew the game from sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makuch|first1=Eddie|title=GTA 5 "Violence Against Women" Criticisms Spur Ban from Australian Retailers|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-violence-against-women-criticisms-spurs-ban-/1100-6423950/|website=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1982 game ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' was first noted for containing elements of rape and some Native American groups and the [[National Organization for Women]] have criticised this as well as alleged [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/december02/shame/index4.shtml |title=Top Ten Shameful Games: 1.

==Portrayal of men==
Men are also often portrayed stereotypically in games. A recurring depiction of male sexuality is the ''power fantasy,'' where an apparent sexualization as an object of desire and [[hypermasculinity]] are overruled by the character's agency as the protagonist and  avatar for the player's power within the game world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/the-three-modes-of-male-sexuality-in-videogames.html|title=The Three Modes of Male Sexuality in Videogames|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotyping and violence===
Men in games tend to be shown as muscular and big. For instance, men in video games have chests that are about 2 inches (6%) larger, heads that are about 13 inches bigger, waists that are 5 inches wider, and hips that are 7 inches wider, than in reality.&lt;ref name="VirtualMuscularity"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Virtual muscularity: a content analysis of male video game characters|date=2011|journal=Body Image|volume=8|issue=1|pages=43–51|vauthors=Martins N, Williams DC, Ratan RA, Harrison K|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2010.10.002|pmid=21093394}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often characterized as overtly aggressive and violent.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; Following the releases of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', the developers were met with criticism regarding both the portrayal of women and torture, but also that of men. Two of the main characters, [[Trevor Philips]] and Michael De Santa, have since been interpreted by some as portraying men as "liars, cheats, bad husbands and fathers, and psychopaths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Tassi|first1=Paul|title=On Gender and 'GTA 5'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/09/26/on-gender-and-gta-5/|access-date=April 24, 2015|magazine=Forbes|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GamesRadar]] writer David Houghton, writing in an article on sexism in video games, was highly critical of many stereotypes that came with male protagonists, outlining them as "the primeval hunter/gatherer type [with] arm-cripplingly ripped biceps, necks too muscley to turn, emotion dials stuck on 'aggressive grimace' and a 50% lack of chest coverings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/are-video-games-really-sexist/?page=2|title=Are video games really sexist?|author=Houghton, David|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=2012-06-23|access-date=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jamin Warren]] on ''PBS Game/Show'' highlighted that video games could promote "unreasonable body expectations, or an inability to express emotion, or the pressure to 'man up' and be a leader". He also highlighted that the vast majority of characters who perform and experience violence in video games are men, while women and children are generally to be protected.&lt;ref name= GameShow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrActT_7X6U |title=Do Videogame Stereotypes Hurt Men? |access-date=2014-09-29|date=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexualization of men===
The [[sexualization]] of men in [[video game]]s is connected to the [[male gaze]], which is the act of depicting women and the world, in the [[visual arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-aesthetics/|title=Feminist Aesthetics|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|quote=Assumes a standard point of view that is masculine and heterosexual. . . .

''Soft-Shed Kisses: Re-visioning the Femme Fatale in English Poetry of the 19th Century'', Cambridge Scholars Publishing, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and [[Representation (arts)|represents]] women as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] for the pleasure of the male viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eaton|first=E.W.|title=Feminist Philosophy of Art|journal= Philosophy Compass|volume=3|issue=5|pages=873–893 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|doi=10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00154.x|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted that while video games tend to sexualize women more often than men, male characters are also sexualized in games.&lt;ref name="PopMatters"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brice |first1=Mattie |title=On Men's Sexualization in Video Games |url=https://www.popmatters.com/151713-on-mens-sexualization-in-video-games-2495914185.html |website=[[PopMatters]] |publisher=Sarah Zupko |accessdate=May 10, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108184955/https://www.popmatters.com/151713-on-mens-sexualization-in-video-games-2495914185.html |archivedate=November 8, 2019 |date=November 28, 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sexualization of men isn't as prevalent as that of women.&lt;ref name="Paste"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Douglas |first1=Dante |title=The Three Modes of Male Sexuality in Videogames |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/the-three-modes-of-male-sexuality-in-videogames/ |website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |publisher=Paste Media Group |accessdate=May 10, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200510125748/https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/the-three-modes-of-male-sexuality-in-videogames/ |archivedate=May 10, 2020 |date=April 7, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it's also been noted that while female characters' sexualization is done as [[fan service]] and treats them as objects, the sexualization of male characters is done as a male power fantasy.&lt;ref name="PopMatters"/&gt; Commenting on this topic, ''[[The Guardian]]'' Keith Stuart argues that while female characters are presented as sex objects, male characters are usually portrayed as something for straight male gamers to aspire towards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stuart |first1=Keith |title=Even teenage boys are sick of sexist video games, survey finds |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/10/teenage-boys-sexist-video-games |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=May 10, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200106181121/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/10/teenage-boys-sexist-video-games |archivedate=January 6, 2020 |date=July 10, 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine, Dante Douglas argued that men's sexualization and [[human sexuality|sexuality]] in video games falls in one of three categories: power fantasy, gender performance, and fan interpretation, with the power fantasy type being the most prevalent out of the three.&lt;ref name="Paste"/&gt;

Video game designer and industry activist [[Mattie Brice]], writing for ''[[PopMatters]]'', argues that a notable aspect of sexual objectification involves "emphasizing what is illegal/improper to show in public without crossing a line".&lt;ref name="PopMatters"/&gt; For women, these would include drawing attention to their breasts. However, drawing attention to a man's chest isn't viewed as improper, and thus, while male video game characters that act as power fantasies may have an exposed chest,&lt;ref name="Paste"/&gt; they don't qualify as sex objects, or their portrayal as sexualization. Brice goes on to state that true sexualization of men characters in video games would entail emphasizing what is improper for men to show in public; having them wear "low-rise pants and underwear" and drawing attention to their bulge or butts.&lt;ref name="PopMatters"/&gt;

According to a study conducted by Karen Dill and Kathryn P. Thill in 2005, around 39% of female characters in video games wear revealing clothes, versus 8% of male characters.{{sfn|Dill|Thill|2007|pages=857}} Moreover, only 1% of male characters have "sexualized figures", compared to 60% of female characters.{{sfn|Dill|Thill|2007|pages=857}}

====Men as power fantasies====
It's been noted that similarly to female characters, male characters in video games also often have unrealistic body proportions, with "perfectly chiseled bodies and rippling muscles".&lt;ref name="MCV"&gt;{{cite web |author1=MCV Staff |title=Let's talk about sexualisation in video games |url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development-news/lets-talk-about-sexualisation-in-video-games/ |website=[[MCV/Develop]] |publisher=Biz Media |accessdate=May 10, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200510163107/https://www.mcvuk.com/development-news/lets-talk-about-sexualisation-in-video-games/ |archivedate=May 10, 2020 |date=June 1, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This portrayal of men and their bodies, described as the "ideal hero form", has its roots in [[American comic book|American]] [[superhero comics]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tassi |first1=Paul |title=The One-Sided Problem of Oversexualization in Video Games |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/11/28/the-one-sided-problem-of-oversexualization-in-video-games/ |website=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=May 10, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608122816/https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/11/28/the-one-sided-problem-of-oversexualization-in-video-games/ |archivedate=June 8, 2019 |date=November 28, 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this isn't done to turn them into sex objects, but rather showcase how they are "powerful and strong".&lt;ref name="MCV"/&gt;

Regarding power fantasy, Douglas states that this is most prevalent form of male sexualization in video games, describing it as the "Muscle-Bound Warrior Man".&lt;ref name="Paste"/&gt; He points out that [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] from the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' franchise is a prominent example.&lt;ref name="Paste"/&gt; One of the main reasons Kratos and other examples of the ''power fantasy'' are different from female sexualized characters is that they have agency. Their sexual exploits are not made for [[sexual arousal]], but serve as [[avatar (computing)|avatars]] for the straight male gamers to showcase their strength through "conque[st]".&lt;ref name="Paste"/&gt; These type of characters are characterized by their [[hypermasculinity]].&lt;ref name="Paste"/&gt;

====Men as sexual objects====
Brice argues the main reason male characters aren't sexualized as often as female characters is because many video games—and by extension, other media—are developed by heterosexual men, with the "neutral vision of game design" being influenced by the "socially appropriate interests specific to straight men".&lt;ref name="PopMatters"/&gt; Since the "average straight guy avoid[s] appearing or feeling gay", male characters in game are usually not sexualized; the little sexualization that does occur, such as bare arms or an exposed chest, is done because it's viewed as "safe" for straight men.&lt;ref name="PopMatters"/&gt;

When men are sexualized in a similar manner to women, this is usually done for comedic effect. Examples include the video game franchise ''[[Cho Aniki]]'' and ''[[Muscle March]]'' which feature men in sexualized and [[homoerotic]] poses. However, this is done as part of the game's absurd humor, rather than true sexualization.&lt;ref name="PopMatters"/&gt; Discussing men's sexualization in video games in relation to comedy, Paul Tassi of ''[[Forbes]]'' compared [[Ivy Valentine]] and [[Heishiro Mitsurugi]] from the ''[[Soulcalibur]]'' franchise, while questioning why Ivy is viewed a sexualized while Mitsurugi isn't.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; While acknowledging that female characters in games usually wear more revealing outfits than men and have suggestive poses, he believes that it's impossible for male characters being sexualized in a similar fashion would be viewed as sex objects. He argues this as the main justification behind the lack of sexualized men in games.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

Regarding the treatment of men as sex objects, which her calls "gender performance", Douglas notes that due to the prevailing [[heteronormativity]] in video games, attributing "sexiness" to a character is intertwined with [[femininity]]. Furthermore, since being sexy is also viewed as being submissive, this contrasts with the [[masculinity|masculine]] ideal of being in control.&lt;ref name="Paste"/&gt; For this reason, many male video game characters that are characterized as "sexy" and objects of desire are coded by including feminine traits; their [[vanity]] and attention to personal attire, and [[queer coding]], usually for humorous purposes.&lt;ref name="Paste"/&gt;

=====''Bishōnen''=====
Regarding the presentation of male characters as sex objects who have some of the aforementioned feminine traits, such characters are often found in [[East Asia]]n video games, especially Japanese video games, and fall into the ''[[Bishōnen]]'' archetype, being characterized by their gracefulness and charm.&lt;ref name="Paste"/&gt;

=====Examples=====
[[Chris Redfield]], a prominent character in the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' franchise since the first game, had his appearance changed radically for ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'' (2009), which included increased muscle mass.

Attention regarding male sexualization in video games has also been given to [[Kaidan Alenko]] from [[BioWare]]'s ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series; especially his portrayal and potential romance in ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' (2012). In Chapter 1 of the book ''Digital Love: Romance and Sexuality in Games'', Michelle Clough presented a case study which illustrated how the character is an example of the shifting portrayal of male sexualization in the original trilogy.{{sfn|McDonald|2017|pages=23}} While Kaidan is presented as a love interest for a female Shepard who is conventionally attractive and has an appealing personality in the first game, she noted that there was little acknowledgment of the physical aspect of his appeal, and outside of a sex scene which mostly focuses on a female Shepard's body, little opportunity for the character to be appreciated in a sexual context.{{sfn|McDonald|2017|pages=23}} This is contrasted with Kaidan's more sexualized presentation in ''Mass Effect 3'', where the character is shirtless in multiple scenes, and more emphasis is placed on the intimacy between him and Shepard. During one scene where Kaidan is reboarding the ''Normandy'' and still in a relationship with Shepard, the camera alternates quick cuts between a close up of Kaidan's buttocks and a close up of Shepard's gaze, indicating that [[Female gaze|she enjoys looking at him in a sexual way]].{{sfn|McDonald|2017}} Clough concluded that Kaidan's overall depiction in ''3'' framed him as a good choice for Shepard as a romantic and sexual partner.{{sfn|McDonald|2017|pages=23-24}}

====Male sexualization within fandom====
Lastly, there is ''fan interpretation'', where Douglas notes that some male characters, despite not adhering to the masculine physical ideal are still viewed as attractive by the fanbase.&lt;ref name="Paste"/&gt; These male characters tend to be more open with their emotions, and are usually suave. Characters such as this—like [[Garrus Vakarian]] from the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series—are usually side characters, rather than the [[player character]]. ''Fan interpretation'' is characterize by the male character's limitations and interactions with other characters within the story.&lt;ref name="Paste"/&gt;

==Portrayal of LGBT characters==
{{Main|LGBT themes in video games|LGBT characters in video games}}

[[LGBT]] ([[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]]) characters have been included in video games as early as the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":rated m"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rated M for Mature : Sex and Sexuality in Video Games|last1=Wysocki|first1=Matthew|last2=Lauteria|first2=Evan W.|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781628925760|location=New York, NY|pages=42–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there has been a trend towards greater representation of LGBT people in video games, they are frequently identified as LGBT in secondary material, such as comics, rather than in the games themselves.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 4 October 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dale|first1=Laura Kate|title=The Video Game Characters You Never Knew Were LGBT|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/10/04/the-video-game-characters-you-never-knew-were-lgbt|access-date=8 October 2017|work=[[Kotaku]] UK|date=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[history of video games]], LGBT content has been subject to changing rules and regulations, which are generally examples of [[heterosexism]], in that heterosexuality is normalized, while homosexuality is subject to additional [[censorship]] or ridicule. Companies [[Nintendo]] of America, [[Sega]] of America and [[Maxis]] policed the content of games with content codes in which LGBT themes were toned down or erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steltenpohl|first=Crystal|title=GLBT History in Video Games: 1990s|url=http://www.gamingbus.com/2012/06/12/glbt-history-video-games-1990s/|publisher=Gaming Bus|access-date=9 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027104832/http://www.gamingbus.com/2012/06/12/glbt-history-video-games-1990s/|archive-date=27 October 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phantasy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Ripplinger|year=2002|title=The Two Phantasy Stars  |url=http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204060641/http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archive-date=2008-02-04|publisher=Camineet|access-date=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ModtheSims"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100128041935/http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=388170 "Autonomous Romantic Socials - Same Sex"], by werismyki&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sims3"&gt;[http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/30/191458.page "Why is My Town Gay?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213075234/http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/30/191458.page |date=2014-12-13 }}, by Srikandi&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Video gaming in Japan|Japanese video games]], for instance, originally included trans characters, such as [[Birdo]] from ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison]] from the ''[[Final Fight]]'' series, and [[Flea (Chrono Trigger)|Flea]] from ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''. Due to adherence to Nintendo of America's quality standards and translations based on preserving gameplay rather than literal meaning, these characters' identities were altered or erased in translation.&lt;ref name=":rated m" /&gt;

The video game industry is regarded as having [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] bias by numerous analysts.&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hot Dates and Fairytale Romances: Studying Sexuality in Video Games|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-0415965781|location=New York, NY|pages=172–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":gay in games"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|date=2009-07-01|title=Putting the Gay in Games Cultural Production and GLBT Content in Video Games|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=228–253|doi=10.1177/1555412009339729|s2cid=143962504|issn=1555-4120}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to industry professionals interviewed by Shaw, reasons for this heteronormativity include the demographic of those who play games, the views of those who create games, the risk of backlash in the industry, and the storytelling limitations of the medium.&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt;

Choice-based LGBT content, such as optional same sex romance in [[BioWare]] games,&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Krobová|first1=Tereza|last2=Moravec|first2=Ondřej|last3=Švelch|first3=Jaroslav|title=Dressing Commander Shepard in pink: Queer playing in a heteronormative game culture|journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace|volume=9|issue=3|doi=10.5817/cp2015-3-3|year=2015|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a low- risk&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; form of representation that occurs only in video games.&lt;ref name=":at the edge"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gaming at the Edge: Sexuality and Gender at the Margins of Gamer Culture|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-8166-9315-3|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=13–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When representation is included, it is often through these in-game choices, which place the responsibility for representation on players instead of developers.&lt;ref name=":at the edge" /&gt; Because they afford the most opportunity for player choice and in game romance, genres such as RPGs and [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]] are the most LGBT representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/01/25/a-gay-history-of-gaming|title=A Gay History of Gaming|last=MacDonald|first=Keza|date=2012-01-25|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another low risk method of LGBT representation is "Gay window gaming," which is LGBT representation that is either subtle or avoidable in games that serves to appeal to LGBT players without alienating straight or homophobic players. This can occur in sandbox games such as ''[[The Sims (video game)|The Sims]]''.&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances" /&gt;

In games with LGBT characters or the option of an LGBT avatar, some aspects of marginalization that occur in contemporary culture are depicted despite the game's overall adherence to reality.&lt;ref name=":at the edge" /&gt; These real social constraints are imposed on a virtual world due to the way games are constructed and the community that inhabits them. Games are made on contemporary culture's heteronormative basis, and this shapes narrative and characters. In the popular MMO ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', for example, this has "created an oppressive atmosphere for individuals who do not adhere to a heteronormative lifestyle", according to a 2013 assessment of the game's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulos|first=Alexis|date=2013-03-01|title=Confronting Heteronormativity in Online Games A Critical Discourse Analysis of LGBTQ Sexuality in World of Warcraft|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=77–97|doi=10.1177/1555412013478688|s2cid=146919257|issn=1555-4120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both members of the industry&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; and LGBT players&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink" /&gt; prefer LGBT representation to be normalized in game narratives rather than made to seem abnormal or special.

LGBT gamers use queer readings of media to compensate for their lack of representation in it.&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; As concluded in a study by Moravec,{{Who|date=May 2019}} this "imaginative play" is the most common method LGBT gamers use to relate to in game avatars&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink" /&gt; that are typically created for a presumed straight male player to relate to.&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances" /&gt;

[[Sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] have served a significant role in some video games, with the trend being toward greater visibility of LGBT identities.&lt;ref name="NeoSeeker"&gt;[https://archive.today/20130129224651/http://www.neoseeker.com/news/11314-sunday-musing-homosexuality-in-video games/ "Homosexuality in Video Games"], by Lydia Sung&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5232808/how-not-to-address-homosexuality-in-gaming "How Not To Address Homosexuality In Gaming"], by Mike Fahey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.joystiq.com/2007/02/26/gay-gamer-survey-results-with-large-hetero-inclusion/|title=Gay gamer survey results with large hetero inclusion|author=Alexander Sliwinski|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|access-date=2013-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922120028/http://i.joystiq.com/2007/02/26/gay-gamer-survey-results-with-large-hetero-inclusion/|archive-date=2013-09-22|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the [[Ubisoft]] blog, [[Lucien Soulban]], who is openly gay and was the writer for ''[[Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon]]'', said that openly gay or lesbian characters would not appear in video games for a long while as anything other than a one-off or something that was created through user choice as seen in the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/28/5456234/video-games-wont-feature-gay-protagonists-for-a-while-says-far-cry-3|title=Video games won't feature gay protagonists 'for a while,' says Far Cry 3 writer Lucien Soulban|author=Gera, Emily|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=2014-02-28|access-date=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Dorian Pavus in ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'' was regarded as a significant development for the portrayal of gay characters in games, in that his homosexuality informs plot elements that occur regardless of whether the player decides to interact with him romantically.&lt;ref name="outDorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/popnography/2015/7/13/dorian-dragon-age-inquisition-why-gamings-breakout-gay-character-matters|last=Baume|first=Matt|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|title=Dorian of Dragon Age: Inquisition: Why Gaming's 'Breakout' Gay Character Matters|date=July 13, 2015|access-date=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With more video games featuring themes related to LGBT characters and themes, the [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) will include a video game awards category, the "Outstanding Video Game Award" for games with "outstanding LGBTQ-inclusive content", starting in its 30th [[GLAAD Media Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/27/17909964/glaad-media-awards-video-game-category | title = GLAAD awards will spotlight video games for the first time | first=  Owen | last =Good | date = September 27, 2018 | access-date = September 28, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of gender representation in games==

=== Effect on attitudes towards gender ===
A 2008 study found that males reported playing more violent video games than females. This exposure was negatively correlated with men's certainty in their judgements when presented with a scenario of possible sexual harassment selected for its ambiguity. The exposure to violent video games was also correlated with attitudes supportive of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.06.002|title=Effects of exposure to sex-stereotyped video game characters on tolerance of sexual harassment|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1402–1408|year=2008|last1=Dill|first1=Karen E.|last2=Brown|first2=Brian P.|last3=Collins|first3=Michael A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on children===
Canadian non-profit [[MediaSmarts]] writes that "video games have the potential to influence how children perceive themselves and others", and despite their impact on the youth, "there is not a lot of research available in this area, and few of the existing studies stand up to critical examination. This lack of scrutiny means that we know very little about the effects that video games may have on children's development and socialization."&lt;ref name=MediaSmarts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediasmarts.ca/video-games/concerns-about-video-games |title=The Concerns About Video Games |access-date=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dietz, video game characters have the potential to shape players' perceptions of gender roles. Through social comparison processes, players learn societal expectations of appearances, behaviors and roles.&lt;ref name=Dietz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dietz|first=Tracy|title=An Examination of Violence and Gender Role Portrayals in Video Games: Implications for Gender Socialization and Aggressive Behavior|journal=Sex Roles|year=1998|volume=38|pages=425–442|doi=10.1023/A:1018709905920|issue=5/6|s2cid=56032975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls may expect that they be dependent victims and that their responsibilities include maintaining beauty and sexual appeal, while boys may determine that their role is to protect and defend women.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; Thus, Dietz claims, the roles internalized by the child, including gender, become for the child, and later for the adult, a basis for other roles and for action. The gender roles internalized by young individuals have a significant impact upon their perspectives and the additional roles they assume in later life. Feminine and masculine symbols are supposed to become a part of a child's identity.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt;

==Players' preferences==
Although games that included the option of selecting a female hero obtained better review scores, they sold fewer copies than games with exclusively male protagonists. [[Penny Arcade Report]] attributed the difference to larger marketing budgets for games with male heroes.&lt;ref name="PAR 21 November 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|title=Games with exclusively female heroes don't sell (because publishers don't support them)|url=http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321064024/http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them|archive-date=21 March 2013|access-date=21 November 2012|newspaper=Penny Arcade Report|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games with a female-only protagonist had, on average, only 50% of the marketing budget of female-optional games, and 40% of the marketing budget of games with male-only protagonists.&lt;ref name="PAR 21 November 2012" /&gt; Male-only games included popular sports and war franchises such as ''[[Madden NFL]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty]]'', and EEDAR's Jesse Divnich stated in 2010, "The factors that drive sales are based more on brand licensing, marketing budgets, development budget and a thousand other factors that have little to do with the gender of playable avatars."&lt;ref name="escapistEEDAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/103045-EEDAR-Says-the-Chicks-Are-Alright|last=Chalk|first=Andy|work=The Escapist|title=EEDAR Says the Chicks Are Alright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study showed that [[box art]] depicting sexualized female characters in non-central roles positively affected sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Near|first=Christopher E.|date=2013-02-01|title=Selling Gender: Associations of Box Art Representation of Female Characters With Sales for Teen- and Mature-rated Video Games|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=68|issue=3–4|pages=252–269|doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0231-6|pmid=23467816|issn=0360-0025|pmc=3586322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polling in 2015 by the Pew Research Center showed 16% of adults who play video games believe most games portray women poorly, compared to 26% who disagree, and 34% who say it depends on the game. Among those who do not play, 55% are unsure if games portray women poorly. Minimal differences were seen between male and female responses.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 survey of 1,583 U.S. students aged 11 to 18 by [[Rosalind Wiseman]] and [[Ashly Burch]] indicated that 60% of girls but only 39% of boys preferred to play a character of their own gender, and 28% of girls as opposed to 20% of boys said that they were more likely to play a game based on the character's gender. The authors interpreted this as meaning that the gaming industry's focus on male protagonists stifled sales to girls more than it promoted sales to boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Charlie|title=The games industry is wrong about kids, gaming and gender|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/5/8153213/the-games-industry-is-wrong-about-kids-gaming-and-gender|access-date=8 March 2015|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 survey of 1,266 gamers by Quantic Foundry, 89% of female gamers considered the inclusion of female protagonist option in games somewhat, very or extremely important; 64% of male gamers expressed the same views.
