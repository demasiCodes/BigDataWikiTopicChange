The portrayal of men and women in [[video games]], as in other media, is a subject of research in [[gender studies]] and is discussed in the context of [[sexism in video gaming]]. Women in particular are significantly underrepresented as characters in mainstream games, and their portrayals often reflect traditional [[gender role]]s, [[sexual objectification]] or negative stereotypes, such as that of the "[[damsel in distress]]."

According to the Entertainment Software Association, 48% of all American video game players in 2014 were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2014 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry|date=April 2014|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]|page=3|url=http://www.theesa.com/facts/pdfs/ESA_EF_2014.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 in the UK and in Spain, women comprised 52% and 48% of video game players respectively.&lt;ref name=PlayGround&gt;{{cite web|title=Ellas también juegan, o por qué el machismo gamer no tiene ningún sentido|author=Natxo Medina|url=http://www.playgroundmag.net/articulos/reportajes/videojuegos-mujeres-gamer-feminismo_0_1396060382.html|accessdate=2014-09-29|date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men and women play video games but studies seem to suggest some differences in typical platform and game genre preference.&lt;ref name=Joystiq&gt;{{cite web|title=LReport: Men play more MMOs, FPSes; women rule mobile, RPG|author=Jessica Conditt|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/10/27/report-men-play-more-mmos-fpses-women-rule-mobile-rpg|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Entertainment Software Rating Board reports that in 2010, 80% of female console gamers played on Wii, 11% on Xbox360 and 9% on PS3. By comparison, 38% of male console gamers in the year 2014 played Xbox 360, 41% played Wii and 21% played PS3.&lt;ref name="Video Game Stats"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Much Do You Know About Video Games?|author=ESRB|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/video-game-industry-statistics.jsp|accessdate=2014-11-09|date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study by [[Flurry (company)|Flurry]] looked at the different mobile gaming preferences between men and women. Women made up 60-80% of the solitaire, slots, social turn-based, match-three / bubble-shooter, management / simulation and quiz game markets. Men on the other hand, made up between 60-80% of the strategy, shooter, card battle, racing and action RPG markets.&lt;ref name="Furry App statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Love, Courtship and the Promiscuous Male Mobile Gamer|author=Dan Laughlin|url=http://www.flurry.com/bid/95605/Love-Courtship-and-the-Promiscuous-Male-Mobile-Gamer#.VIl21DGUfjU=2014-11-09|date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 SuperData Research study found that men and women enjoy video games, but some genres tend to attract one gender over the other: Women compose 57.8 percent of the mobile market, 53.6 percent of the RPG market and 50.2 percent of the PC market (including social games). The study found that men make up 66 percent of MMO players, 66 percent of FPS players and 63 percent of digital console players.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt; {{-}}

==Portrayal of women==
[[File:Cosplayers at Igromir 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Two women [[cosplay|dressed up]] as video game characters at Moscow's [[Igromir]] trade show in 2011]]

The portrayal of women in video games has been the subject of academic study and controversy since the early 1980s. Recurring themes in articles and discussions on the topic include the [[sexual objectification]] and [[sexualization]] of characters as well as the degree to which female characters are independent from their male counterparts within the same game. Exposure to sexualized media representations of women in television and magazines was alleged to reduce male compassion toward women and reduce females' perceptions of their desire and suitability for various vocations.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

===Roles of women===

====Prevalence====
Studies of the prevalence of female characters in video games began to be conducted in sociological, educational, and cultural journals as early as the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1979, researchers publishing in ''Psychological Record'' (Vol.29, No.1. Pp.&amp;nbsp;43–48) concluded from the results of a 201-person survey that 90% of male subjects and 85% of female subjects perceived the computer as masculine (in gameplay versus the computer).&lt;ref name=leroux&gt;Leroux, Yvan and Michel Pépin. "Jeu Sur Micro-Ordinateur et Différences Liées au Sexe". ''[[Revue des Sciences de l'Education]]''. Vol.XII, No.2. Pp.173-196. 1986. {{ISSN|0318-479X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, professor [[Sara Kiesler]] et al. published a study in ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (Vol.17, No.3. Pp.&amp;nbsp;40–48.) finding that female characters appeared in video games at a frequency of 1 game in 7.&lt;ref name=leroux/&gt; Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz suggested that the reduced presence of female characters implies a secondary status for women in video games. When playable female characters do appear in video games, they are more often scantily dressed and [[oversexualized]] than men.&lt;ref&gt;Behm-Morawitz, Elizabeth, and Dana Mastro. "The Effects of the Sexualization of Female Video Game Characters on Gender Stereotyping and Female Self-Concept." Sex Roles 61.11 (2009): 808-823. ProQuest. Web. 22 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism is evidenced by both protagonists and antagonists, perhaps most notably Lara Croft in the 2008 video game rendition of [[Tomb Raider]], in which Croft was depicted in "hot pants" and "middriffs" and was said to look like she "was dressed by a male".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomb Raider Lara Croft now Battling Video Game Sterotypes|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/games/tomb-raider-lara-croft-now-battling-video-game-stereotypes/#/0|website=Hero Comles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data gathered by [[Electronic Entertainment Design and Research]] (EEDAR) in 2012, few video games have exclusively female heroes. This is in part because, according to EEDAR, "there's a sense in the industry that games with female heroes won't sell", which [[Penny Arcade Report]] attributed in part to these games receiving much smaller marketing budgets than games with male heroes.&lt;ref name="PAR 21 November 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|title=Games with exclusively female heroes don't sell (because publishers don't support them)|url=http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321064024/http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them||archivedate=21 March 2013|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=Penny Arcade Report|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playable female characters were found to appear less frequently than male characters in reviews for popular games in a 2006 study from [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivory, J. D. (2006). [http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jivory/JIvory2006MassCommunicationandSociety.pdf Still a man's game: Gender representation in online reviews of video games.] Mass Communication &amp; Society, 9(1), 103-114. The sample of reviews was taken from the "Top Rated" and "Most Popular" lists from [[GameSpot]] in March 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M. K., &amp; Summers, A. (2007). [http://www.easternct.edu/~lugow/courses/videogames/gender_videogames.pdf Gender differences in video game characters' roles, appearances, and attire as portrayed in video game magazines.] Sex roles, 57(9-10), 733-742.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study by Melinda C. R. Burgess et al. found that men are featured much more often than women on the covers of console video games.&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Melinda C. R. |author2=Steven Paul Stermer |author3=Stephen R. Burgess|title=Sex, Lies, and Video Games: The Portrayal of Male and Female Characters on Video Game Covers|journal=Sex Roles|date=30 June 2007|pages=419–433|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9250-0|volume=57|issue=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sample of 669 action, shooter, and role-playing games selected by EEDAR in 2012, only 24 (4%) had an exclusively female protagonist, and 300 (45%) provided the option of selecting one. Examining the sales data and review scores of these games, EEDAR found that the games that included the option of selecting a female hero obtained better scores, but the ones with male-only protagonists sold better than the others. However, games with a female-only protagonist had, on average, only 50% of the marketing budget of female-optional games, and 40% of the marketing budget of games with male-only protagonists.&lt;ref name="PAR 21 November 2012" /&gt;

According to Madeline Messer writing in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 2015, among the top 50 [[endless running]] games for mobile devices, 98% of those with gender-identifiable characters featured male protagonists, of which 90% were free to play. Only 46% of these games offered female characters, and only 15% offered them for free. Playing as a girl required, on average, an additional purchase of $7.53, much more than the games themselves cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Messer|first1=Madeline|title=I’m a 12-year-old girl.

====Evolution====
{{category see also|Video games featuring female protagonists}}

[[Samus Aran]], the heroine of ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' (1986) and its successors, is often cited as "the first playable human female character in a mainstream videogame".&lt;ref name="Guinness2013"&gt;{{cite book | title=Guinness World Records 2013: Gamer's Edition | publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd | authorlink=Feature: Girl Power-Up | year=2012 | page=154 | isbn=9781904994954}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other earlier games featured female player characters, such as Toby Masuyo ("Kissy") from ''[[Baraduke]]'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/namcoxcapcom/namcoxcapcom2.htm#tobymasuyo | title=Obscure Namco characters | publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Kurt Kalata}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2009/10/nintendo_download_13_14_october_2009_japan | title=Nintendo Download: 13-14 October 2009 (Japan) | publisher=nintendolife.com | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Sean Aaron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lara Croft]], the protagonist of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' (1996), is among the best-known strong, fictional women in a variety of media.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Egenfeldt-Nielsen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Smith | first2 = Jonas Heide | last3 = Pajares Tosca | first3 = Susana | title = Understanding video games: the essential introduction | chapter = Player culture | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 2008 | page = 163 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=31XHdVXlbt0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22april%20ryan%22&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=%22april%20ryan%22&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-07-03 | isbn = 978-0-415-97721-0 | quote = "Helen Kennedy [...] summarizes these arguments, and Lara Croft's ambivalent role as both an action heroine [...], and an eroticized object of the male gaze with a great deal of voyeuristic appeal".}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[April Ryan (The Longest Journey)|April Ryan]] from ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' (1999) has been compared to Lara Croft in that respect, as she shows less prominent physical feminine attributes than Lara but more feminine psychological traits, as contrasted with Lara's masculine connotations like aggressiveness and force.&lt;ref name="merete"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csi.ensmp.fr/WebCSI/4S/download/download_page.php?file=lie.pdf | title = Lara Croft and her sisters | accessdate = 2011-07-03 | last = Lie | first = Merete | publisher = Norwegian University of Science and Technology | quote = "She is attractive, but no sex bomb"  "April may, however, appear as more feminine because even if she is tough and brave, she is depicted as both sensitive and vain"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, [[Jade (Beyond Good &amp; Evil)|Jade]], the protagonist of ''[[Beyond Good &amp; Evil]]'' (2003), was widely recognized as a strong and confident female character lacking any overt sexualisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rougeau|first=Michael|url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2013/01/the-50-greatest-heroines-in-video-game-history/jade|title=50 Greatest Heroines In Video Game History|publisher=Complex|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bayonetta: empowering or exploitative?|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/213466/bayonetta-empowering-or-exploitative/ |publisher=[[GamePro]] |accessdate=2010-01-16|date=2010-01-06|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100109032922/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/213466/bayonetta-empowering-or-exploitative/|archivedate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the developers' choice to omit playable women in the latest iterations of the top-tier gaming franchises ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Far Cry (series)|Far Cry]]'' became a focus of discussions in gaming media. This indicated, according to game industry professionals{{who|date=April 2015}} cited by ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', a shift in the industry's attention towards issues of diversity in gaming, in conjunction with video games as a whole growing beyond their former core audience of younger men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crecente|first1=Brian|title=As game players diversify, developers start to rethink the stars of their games|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/23/5834628/women-in-video-games-heroines-e3-2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|work=Polygon|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Female supporting characters====
A number of games feature a female character as an ally or [[sidekick]] to the male hero. Some of them, like [[Ada Wong]] and [[Mona Sax]], were turned into [[player character]]s in later instances of their series. [[Alyx Vance]], a supporting protagonist of ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', was praised for her "stinging personality" and intelligence, developing a close bond with the player without simply being "eye candy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugo.com/games/video-game-hotties/?cur=alyx-vance&amp;morepics=17 Top 50 Videogame Hotties]. [[UGO.com]]. Retrieved on 2008-12-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugo.com/games/gaming-girls/?cur=alyx-vance Top 11 Girls of Gaming]. [[UGO.com]]. Retrieved on 2008-12-28&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In video games, the major stereotyped myths of women are typically the damsel in distress, hyper-sexualized villain (Sylvia Christel from ''No More Heroes'') and the sexy/strong best friend (Tifa from ''Final Fantasy VII''). [...] In all of these instances, the female character is, more likely than not, in love with the male protagonist or trying desperately to bang him."&lt;ref name="Tremblay2012" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, female characters are often cast in the role of the [[damsel in distress]], with their rescue being the objective of the game.&lt;ref name="Tremblay2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/KaitlinTremblay/20120601/171613/Intro_to_Gender_Criticism_for_Gamers_From_Princess_Peach_to_Claire_Redfield_to_FemSheps.php?print=1 | title=Intro to Gender Criticism for Gamers: From Princess Peach, to Claire Redfield, to FemSheps. | publisher=[[Gamasutra]] | date=1 June 2012 | accessdate=8 October 2013 | author=Kaitlin Tremblay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/shigeru-miyamoto-and-the-damsel-in-distress-520259897 | title=Shigeru Miyamoto and the Damsel In Distress | publisher=[[Kotaku]] | date=2013-06-20 | accessdate=8 October 2013 | author=Stephen Totilo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princess Zelda]] in the early ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series and [[Princess Peach]] through much of the ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' series are [[wikt:paradigm|paradigmatic]] examples. According to Salzburge Academy on Media and Global Change, in 1981 Nintendo offered game designer Shigeru Miyamoto to create a new video game for the American market. In the game the hero was Mario, and the objective of the game was to rescue a young princess named Peach. Peach was depicted as having a pink dress and blonde hair. The princess was kidnapped and trapped in a castle by the evil villain character Bowser, who is depicted as a turtle. Princess Peach appears in 14 of the main Super Mario games and is kidnapped in 13 of them. The only main game that Peach was not kidnapped in was in the North America release of Super Mario 2, but she was a character that can be played. Her character had the ability to jump the farthest. Zelda became playable in the later games of the Legend of Zelda series or had the pattern altered.&lt;ref name="Objectification of Women in Video Games"&gt;[http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/unesco/objectification-women-video-games "Objectification of Women in Video Games"], Retrieved 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Female antagonists====
{{category see also|Video games featuring female antagonists}}

One of the first major female villains in video games was the [[Dark Queen (Battletoads)|Dark Queen]] in ''[[Battletoads]]'' (1991) and its sequels.&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Schwartz, Janet Schwartz, ''The Parent's Guide to Video Games'', Prima Pub., 1994 (p.8)&lt;/ref&gt; [[SHODAN]], an artificial intelligence with a female voice and a female face, was the main villain of the game ''[[System Shock]]'' (1994), praised as one of the most recognizable female characters in gaming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/features/tenspot_females/page9.html TenSpot: Ten Best Female Characters].

Retrieved on 19 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent female villain is [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Ultimecia|Ultimecia]], the main antagonist in ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' (1999).

===Depiction of women===

====Objectification and sexualization====
{{See also|List of adult video games}}

Many recent games have increased the sexualized portrayal of women so as to appeal to a male audience.&lt;ref name="Tremblay2012"/&gt; In 2012, for instance, ''[[Dead or Alive (series)|Dead or Alive]]'' director Yohei Shimbori admitted the developers received complaints from fans who had played the ''[[Dead or Alive 5]]'' demo packaged with ''[[Ninja Gaiden 3]]''. According to Shimbori, "We actually got a lot of feedback from people who were playing it, saying, 'We want bigger breasts. Make the characters more like that.' That was kind of surprising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Team Ninja learns to fear its fans|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/178358/Team_Ninja_learns_to_fear_its_fans.php#.UGVMR03A-RR |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2013-03-15 |date=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female video game characters have been criticized as having a tendency to be subjects of the "[[male gaze]]".&lt;ref name="maleprivilege"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5868595/nerds-and-male-privilege|title=Nerds and Male Privilege|author=Harris O'Malley|publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt; A print ad for the fighting game ''[[Soulcalibur V]]'' received some controversy for simply being a close up of a female character's{{who|date=April 2015}} breasts with a tagline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/videogame-ad-sets-new-low-objectifying-women-137421 | title=Videogame Ad Sets New Low for Objectifying Women | publisher=AdWeek | date=January 10, 2012 | accessdate=7 May 2014 | author=David Griner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two sequels{{which|date=April 2015}} of fighting games ''[[Soulcalibur]]'' and ''[[Tekken]]'' that take place several years after the original issue, recurring male characters were all aged but all female characters were kept the same age or were replaced by their daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/misc/22786_To_My_Someday_Daughter.html|author=Geordie Tait|title=To My Someday Daughter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since her introduction in 1996, the character of [[Lara Croft]] from the ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' series in particular has been criticized for her "unrealistic" breast size; Lara was claimed to personify "an ongoing culture clash over gender, sexuality, empowerment, and objectification."&lt;ref name="gettingthegirl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3137700 |author=Zoe Flower |title=Getting the Girl: The myths, misconceptions, and misdemeanors of females in games |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the game's creators maintain that she was not designed with marketing in mind, and have claimed to be rather surprised at her pinup-style adoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lara Croft, the Bit Girl |author=N'gai Croal and Jane Hughes |publisher=[[Newsweek]] |date=1997-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Tomb Raider: Legend]]'', Lara underwent a radical redesign, ostensibly to make her less sexualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Lara's curves reduced to appeal to female gamers |date=2005-05-21 |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Real-appeal/2005/05/21/1116533572111.html |accessdate=2007-07-09}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2005 study, Dill and Thill distinguish three major stereotypical depictions of women in gaming: (1) sexualized, (2) scantily clad, and (3) a vision of beauty. The study revealed that over 80% of women in video games represented one of these depictions. More than one quarter of female characters embodied all of the three stereotypical categories at once. Dill and Thill also note that another prevalent theme with which women were depicted was a combination of aggression and sex, referred to as "eroticized aggression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dill|first=Karen E.|author2=Thill K.

In [[Bioware]]'s [[Dragon Age]] franchise, while the optional female character dresses as the player wills, many female warrior/assassin class characters, such as Isabela, were remade in later installments to wear less clothing. In the case of Isabela, she appeared in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' in full armor but appeared in ''[[Dragon Age II]]'' wearing thigh high boots and a short, slitted dress. After ''Dragon Age II'' [[IGN]] went from not mentioning her at all to describing her as "everyone's favorite busty rogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isabela|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-age-2/Isabela|website=IGN|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In comparison to male characters====
Many early female video game characters (such as [[Ms. Pac-Man]]) are identical to an existing male character, except for a visual marker of their femininity, such as pink bows, lipstick and long eyelashes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sarkeesian, Anita. "[http://www.feministfrequency.com/2013/11/ms-male-character-tropes-vs-women/ Tropes vs Women Ms. Male Character]".

A 2007 study from [[Southwestern Oklahoma State University]] compared the appearances of male and female characters on video game covers, and found that male characters were five times more likely to be represented as the main character in the game, and women were merely portrayed as side kicks or accessories. Both male and female character's physiques were over-exaggerated on video game covers, but females were more "physically altered" (especially in the bust) than their male counterparts, and even more so if the female was the main character of the game.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

====Violence against women====

=====Sexual violence=====
The 1982 game ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' was first noted for containing elements of rape and some Native American groups and the [[National Organization for Women]] have criticised this as well as alleged [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/december02/shame/index4.shtml |title=Top Ten Shameful Games: 1. Custer's Revenge (Atari 2600) |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |date=2002-12-31 |accessdate=2007-07-09}} {{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 reboot of ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' series drew controversy when ''[[Kotaku]]'' claimed executive producer Ron Rosenberg said rape was utilized as a means for the eponymous character's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=You'll 'Want To Protect' The New, Less Curvy Lara Croft|url=http://kotaku.com/5917400/youll-want-to-protect-the-new-less-curvy-lara-croft |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crystal Dynamics]] denied that the scene depicted an attempted rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomb Raider Creators Are No Longer Referring to Game's Attempted 'Rape' Scene As an Attempted Rape Scene|url=http://kotaku.com/5918193/tomb-raider-creators-are-no-longer-referring-to-games-attempted-rape-scene-as-an-attempted-rape-scene |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomb Raider Creators Say 'Rape' Is Not A Word In Their Vocabulary|url=http://kotaku.com/5922228/tomb-raider-creators-say-rape-is-not-a-word-in-their-vocabulary |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Non-sexual violence=====
Violence in video games is a hotly debated topic; some sources condemned video games for promoting violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://mediareporttowomen.com/issues/311.htm |title=Women's role in popular video games: Stripped down and killed off |journal=Media Report to Women |date=Winter 2003 |page=p. 1 |volume=31 |issue=1 |accessdate=2007-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 2013 game ''[[Dead Island: Riptide]]'' generated controversy when the special "zombie bait" edition of the game included a statue of a torso of a busty, dismembered woman in a skimpy bikini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/1/15/3878810/dead-island-riptides-bloody-torso-statue-sparks-anger-shock | title=Dead Island Riptide's bloody torso statue sparks anger, confusion | publisher=Polygon.com | date=January 15, 2013 | accessdate=7 May 2014 | author=Brian Crecente}}&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|Grand Theft Auto]] franchise has had issues with claims of violence against women, [[Rockstar North]]'s ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' was also surrounded in much criticism; so much so that the sale of it was banned by certain retailers in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makuch|first1=Eddie|title=GTA 5 "Violence Against Women" Criticisms Spur Ban from Australian Retailers|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-violence-against-women-criticisms-spurs-ban-/1100-6423950/|website=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal of men==
{{Expand Section | date=January 2014}}

Men are also often portrayed stereotypically in games. They tend to be shown as muscular and big. For instance, men in video games have chests that are about 2 inches (6%) larger, heads that are about 13 inches bigger, waists that are 5 inches wider, and hips that are 7 inches wider, than in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, N., D.C. Williams, R.A. Ratan, and K. Harrison. 2011. "Virtual muscularity: A content analysis of male video game characters". ''Body Image.'' 8 (1): 43-51.&lt;/ref&gt; They are often characterized as overtly aggressive and violent.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; Following the releases of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', the developers were met with criticism regarding both the portrayal of women and torture, but also that of men. Two of the main characters, [[Trevor Philips]] and [[Michael De Santa]], have since been interpreted by some as portraying men as "liars, cheats, bad husbands and fathers, and psychopaths."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tassi|first1=Paul|title=On Gender and 'GTA 5'|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/09/26/on-gender-and-gta-5/|accessdate=April 24, 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GamesRadar]] writer David Houghton, writing in an article on sexism in video games, was highly critical of many stereotypes that came with male protagonists, outlining them as "the primeval hunter/gatherer type [with] arm-cripplingly ripped biceps, necks too muscley to turn, emotion dials stuck on 'aggressive grimace' and a 50% lack of chest coverings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/are-video-games-really-sexist/?page=2|title=Are video games really sexist?|author=Houghton, David|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=2012-06-23|accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamin Warren on PBS Game/Show highlighted that video games could promote "unreasonable body expectations, or an inability to express emotion, or the pressure to 'man up' and be a leader." He also highlighted that the vast majority of characters who perform and experience violence in video games are men, while women and children are generally to be protected.&lt;ref name= GameShow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrActT_7X6U |title=Do Videogame Stereotypes Hurt Men? |accessdate=2014-09-29|date=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal of LGBT characters==
{{main|LGBT themes in video games|LGBT characters in video games}}

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ([[LGBT]]) characters have been depicted in video games since the 1980s. Common depictions include comical gender confusion, transgender characters, gay characters in fighting and action games, and gay romance in role-playing games.

In the [[history of video games]], LGBT content has been subject to changing rules and regulations, which are generally examples of [[heterosexism]], in that heterosexuality is normalized, while homosexuality is subject to additional [[censorship]] or ridicule. Companies [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]] and [[Maxis]] policed the content of games with content codes in which LGBT themes were toned down or erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steltenpohl|first=Crystal|title=GLBT History in Video Games: 1990s|url=http://www.gamingbus.com/2012/06/12/glbt-history-video-games-1990s/|publisher=Gaming Bus|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phantasy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Ripplinger|year=2002|title=The Two Phantasy Stars  |url=http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080204060641/http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archivedate=2008-02-04|publisher=Camineet|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ModtheSims"&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20100128041935/http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=388170 "Autonomous Romantic Socials - Same Sex"], by werismyki&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sims3"&gt;[http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/30/191458.page "Why is My Town Gay?"], by Srikandi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] have served a significant role in some video games, with the trend being toward greater visibility of LGBT identities.&lt;ref name="NeoSeeker"&gt;[http://www.neoseeker.com/news/11314-sunday-musing-homosexuality-in-video games/ "Homosexuality in Video Games"], by Lydia Sung&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5232808/how-not-to-address-homosexuality-in-gaming "How Not To Address Homosexuality In Gaming"], by Mike Fahey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.joystiq.com/2007/02/26/gay-gamer-survey-results-with-large-hetero-inclusion/|title=Gay gamer survey results with large hetero inclusion|author=Alexander Sliwinski|publisher=[[Joystiq]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the Ubisoft blog, Lucien Soulband, who is openly gay and was the writer for ''[[Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon]]'', said that openly gay or lesbian characters would not appear in video games for a long while as anything other than a one-off or something that was created through user choice as seen in the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/28/5456234/video-games-wont-feature-gay-protagonists-for-a-while-says-far-cry-3|title=Video games won't feature gay protagonists 'for a while,' says Far Cry 3 writer Lucien Soulban|author=Gera, Emily|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=2014-02-28|accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Dorian in [[Dragon Age: Inquisition]] was regarded as a significant development for the portrayal of gay characters in games, in that his homosexuality informs plot elements that occur regardless of whether the player decides to interact with him romantically.&lt;ref name="outDorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/popnography/2015/7/13/dorian-dragon-age-inquisition-why-gamings-breakout-gay-character-matters|last=Baume|first=Matt|work=[[Out (magazine)]]|title=Dorian of Dragon Age: Inquisition: Why Gaming's 'Breakout' Gay Character Matters|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dragon Age: Inquisition was also noted for its respectful portrayal of a transgender character.

==Effect of gender representation in games==

=== Effect on attitudes towards gender ===
According to [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], there is no evidence that video games make men [[misogynist]]: "In fact, all the data we have suggest that millennial males—and these are people born and raised in 'Video Game Nation'—are far less prone to ... prejudices than previous generations."&lt;ref name=CHS&gt;{{cite web|author=Christina Hoff Sommers|title=Are video games sexist?|work=AEI|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MxqSwzFy5w|date=2014-09-06|accessdate=2014-09-29||}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dill, Brown, and Collins found that males reported playing more violent video games than females, and that this violent video game exposure was negatively correlated with men's certainty in their judgements when presented with a scenario of possible sexual harassment selected for its ambiguity. The exposure to violent video games was also correlated with rape supportive attitudes. Both of these tests resulted in a [[p-value]] of less than .001, meaning that it is extremely unlikely that these measured observations would occur without this relationship existing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103108001005], Dill, Karen E., Brian P. Brown, and Michael A. Collins. "Effects of exposure to sex-stereotyped video game characters on tolerance of sexual harassment." Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 44.5 (2008): 1402-1408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on children===
Canadian non-profit [[MediaSmarts]] writes that "video games have the potential to influence how children perceive themselves and others", and despite their impact on the youth, "there is not a lot of research available in this area, and few of the existing studies stand up to critical examination. This lack of scrutiny means that we know very little about the effects that video games may have on children's development and socialization."&lt;ref name=MediaSmarts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediasmarts.ca/video-games/concerns-about-video-games |title=The Concerns About Video Games |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dietz, video game characters have the potential to shape players' perceptions of gender roles. Through social comparison processes, players learn societal expectations of appearances, behaviors and roles.&lt;ref name=Dietz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dietz|first=Tracy|title=An Examination of Violence and Gender Role Portrayals in Video Games: Implications for Gender Socialization and Aggressive Behavior|journal=Sex Roles|year=1998|volume=38|pages=425–442|doi=10.1023/A:1018709905920|issue=5/6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls may expect that they be dependent victims and that their responsibilities include maintaining beauty and sexual appeal, while boys may determine that their role is to protect and defend women.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; Thus, Dietz claims, the roles internalized by the child, including gender, become for the child, and later for the adult, a basis for other roles and for action. The gender roles internalized by young individuals have a significant impact upon their perspectives and the additional roles they assume in later life. Feminine and masculine symbols are supposed to become a part of a child's identity.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt;

==Players' preferences==
A 2015 survey of 1,583 U.S. students aged 11 to 18 by [[Rosalind Wiseman]] and [[Ashly Burch]] indicated that 60% of girls but only 39% of boys preferred to play a character of their own gender, and 28% of girls as opposed to 20% of boys said that they were more likely to play a game based on the character's gender. The authors interpreted this as meaning that the gaming industry's focus on male protagonists stifled sales to girls more than it promoted sales to boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Charlie|title=The games industry is wrong about kids, gaming and gender|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/5/8153213/the-games-industry-is-wrong-about-kids-gaming-and-gender|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
