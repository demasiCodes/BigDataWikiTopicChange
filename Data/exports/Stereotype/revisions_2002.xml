This was generalized into a metaphor for repeating a set of ideas identically with no changes (as would have been possible in a form of movable type).

In modern usage, the metaphorical meaning predominates. The term is generally used to describe a view of a number of persons from the same group as sharing certain characteristic (''stereotypical'') qualities.  This usage is sometimes referred to as a [[social stereotype]].</rev></revisions></page></pages></query></api>
