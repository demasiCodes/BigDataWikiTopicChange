This was generalized into a [[metaphor]] for repeating a set of ideas identically with no changes (as would have been possible in a form of movable type).

In modern usage, the metaphorical meaning predominates. The term is generally used to describe an oversimplified mental picture of some group of people who are sharing a certain characteristic (or ''stereotypical'') qualities. The term is thus often used in a negative sense, with stereotypes being seen by many as illogical yet deeply held-beliefs that can only be changed through education. 

Common stereotypes of the past included a variety of allegations about various racial groups (see: [[racial stereotype]] and [[racial profiling]]) and predictions of behavior based on social status and wealth (See [[social stereotype]]). 

In literature and art, stereotypes are [[cliche|clich&amp;eacute;d]] or predictable characters or situations. For example, the stereotypical [[devil]] is a red, impish character with horns and a [[pitchfork]].

==In computing==
In computing, a '''stereotype''' is a concept in the [[Unified Modeling Language]], where it is used to encapsulate behaviors. Thus, a stereotype is used as a vehicle for communicating software requirements and designs, and lacks the negative connotation present in general usage.
