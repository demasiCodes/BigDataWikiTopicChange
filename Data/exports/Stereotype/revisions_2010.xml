A '''stereotype''' is a commonly held popular [[belief]] about specific social groups or types of individuals. The concepts of "stereotype" and "[[prejudice]]" are often confused with many other different meanings. Stereotypes are standardized and simplified conceptions of groups based on some prior assumptions.

==Etymology==
The term ''stereotype'' (''στερεότυπος'') derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''στερεός'' ([[Wiktionary:στερεός|''stereos'']]), "firm, solid"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dstereo%2Fs στερεός],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; and ''τύπος'' ([[Wiktionary:τύπος|''typos'']]), "impression",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtu%2Fpos τύπος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Libray&lt;/ref&gt; hence "solid impression".

It was invented by [[Firmin Didot]] in the world of [[printing]]; it was originally a duplicate impression of an original [[typographic]]al element, used for printing instead of the original. American journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] coined the metaphor, calling a stereotype a "picture in our heads" saying "Whether right or wrong (...) imagination is shaped by the pictures seen (...) originally printers' words, and in their literal printers' meanings were synonymous. Specifically, [[cliché]] was a French word for the printing surface for a stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN&amp;id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;ots=nXvVkdB_U4&amp;dq=cliche+origin&amp;sig=f5UQIqottU546aRBe3zlm-9Q7kM#PPA250,M1 Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage.]&gt; Springfield, Illinois: Merriam-Webster, Inc., 1994. p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; The first reference to "stereotype", in its modern, English use was in 1850, in the noun, meaning "image perpetuated without change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=stereotype Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, in its modern psychology sense, was first used by Walter Lippmann in his 1922 work ''[[Public Opinion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Hate Prejudice and Racism |publisher=State University of New York Press |date=August 1993 |isbn=079141535X |author=Milton Kleg}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in the [[Stereotype (printing)|printing]] sense it was first coined 1798.

==Dynamics==
[[Sociology|Sociologists]] believe that mental categorizing (or [[labelling]]) is necessary and inescapable.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} One perspective the stereotyping process are the concepts of ingroups and outgroups. Ingroups are viewed as normal and superior, and are generally the group that one{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} associates with or aspires to join. An outgroup is simply all the other groups. They are seen as lesser or inferior than the in-groups.

A second perspective is that of automatic and explicit or subconscious and conscious. Automatic or subconscious stereotyping is that which everyone does without noticing. Automatic stereotyping is quickly preceded by an explicit or conscious check which permits time for any needed corrections.  Automatic stereotyping is affected by explicit stereotyping because frequent conscious thoughts will quickly develop into subconscious stereotypes.

A third method to categorizing stereotypes is general types and sub-types. Stereotypes consist of hierarchical systems consisting of broad and specific groups being the general types and sub-types respectively. A general type could be defined as a broad stereotype typically known among many people and usually widely accepted, whereas the sub-group would be one of the several groups making up the general group. These would be more specific, and opinions of these groups would vary according to differing perspectives.

Certain circumstances can affect the way an individual stereotypes. For instance: Studies have shown that women stereotype more negatively than men, and that women read into appearance more than men. Some theorists argue in favor of the conceptual connection and that one's own subjective thought about someone is sufficient information to make assumptions about that individual. Other theorists argue that at minimum there must be a casual connection between mental states and behavior to make assumptions or stereotypes. Thus results and opinions may vary according to circumstance and theory. An example of a common, incorrect assumption is that of assuming certain internal characteristics based on external appearance.  The explanation for one's actions is his or her internal state (goals, feeling, personality, traits, motives, values, and impulses), not his or her appearance.

Sociologist Charles E. Hurst, "One reason for stereotypes is the lack of personal, concrete familiarity that individuals have with persons in other racial or ethnic groups. Lack of familiarity encourages the lumping together of unknown individuals".&lt;ref name="Hurst"&gt;Hurst, Charles E. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences. 6. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes focus upon and thereby exaggerate differences between groups.  Competition between groups minimizes similarities and magnifies differences.&lt;ref name="In-group"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brewer |first=M |title=In-group bias in the minimal intergroup situation: A cognitive-motivational analysis |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=86 |issue= |pages=307–324 |year=1979 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.86.2.307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This makes it seem as if groups are very different when in fact they may be more alike than different. For example, among [[African American]]s, identity as an American citizen is more salient than racial background; that is, African Americans are more American than African.&lt;ref name="African"&gt;
{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00224545.1995.9712238 |last=McAndrew |first=FT |coauthors=Akande, A |title=African perceptions of Americans of African and European descent |journal=Journal of Social Psychology |volume=135  |issue=5 |pages=649–655 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theories====
Different disciplines give different accounts of how stereotypes develop: Psychologists may focus on an individual's experience with groups, patterns of communication about those groups, and intergroup conflict. Pioneering psychologist William James cautioned psychologists themselves to be wary of their own stereotyping, in what he called the [[psychologist's fallacy]]. Sociologists focus on the relations among groups and the position of different groups in a social structure. Psychoanalytically-oriented humanists have argued (e.g., Sander Gilman) that stereotypes, ''by definition'', are representations that are not accurate, but a projection of one to another.

A number of theories have been derived from sociological studies of stereotyping and prejudicial thinking. In early studies it was believed that stereotypes were only used by rigid, repressed, and authoritarian people. Sociologists concluded that this was a result of conflict, poor parenting, and inadequate mental and emotional development. This idea has been overturned; more recent studies have concluded that stereotypes are commonplace.

One theory as to why people stereotype is that it is too difficult to take in all of the complexities of other people as individuals. Even though stereotyping is inexact, it is an efficient way to mentally organize large blocks of information. Categorization is an essential human capability because it enables us to simplify, predict, and organize our world. Once one has sorted and organized everyone into tidy categories, there is a human tendency to avoid processing new or unexpected information about each individual. Assigning general group characteristics to members of that group saves time and satisfies the need to predict the social world in a general sense.

Another theory is that people stereotype because of the need to feel good about [[Self (psychology)|oneself]]. Stereotypes protect one from anxiety and enhance [[self-esteem]]. By designating one's own group as the standard or normal group and assigning others to groups considered inferior or abnormal, it provides one with a sense of worth.

Some {{Who|date=March 2010}} believe that childhood influences are some of the most complex and influential factors in developing stereotypes. Though they can be absorbed at any age, stereotypes are usually acquired in early childhood under the influence of parents, teachers, peers, and the media. Once a stereotype is learned, it often becomes self-perpetuating.

==Effects, accuracy, terminology==
{{Main|Stereotype threat}}
Stereotypes can have a negative and positive impact on individuals. Joshua Aronson and Claude M. Steele have done research on the psychological effects of stereotyping, particularly its effect on African Americans and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steele CM, Aronson J |title=Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=797–811 |year=1995 |month=November |pmid= 7473032|doi= 10.1037/.69.5.797|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/69/5/797}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that psychological research has shown that competence is highly responsive to situation and interactions with others.&lt;ref name=AronsonBook&gt;Aronson J, Steele CM. (2005). [http://books.google.com/books?id=B14TMHRtYBcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PRA1-PA436,M1 Chapter 24:Stereotypes and the Fragility of Academic Competence, Motivation, and Self-Concept]. In ''Handbook of Competence'', [ p. 436].&lt;/ref&gt; They cite, for example, a study which found that bogus feedback to college students dramatically affected their IQ test performance, and another in which students were either praised as very smart, congratulated on their hard work, or told that they scored high. The group praised as smart performed significantly worse than the others. They believe that there is an 'innate ability bias'. These effects are not just limited to minority groups. Mathematically competent white males, mostly math and engineering students, were asked to take a difficult math test. One group was told that this was being done to determine why Asians were scoring better. This group performed significantly worse than the control group.&lt;ref name=AronsonBook/&gt;{{Rp|443}}

Possible prejudicial effects of stereotypes are:
*Justification of ill-founded prejudices or ignorance
*Unwillingness to rethink one's attitudes and behavior towards stereotyped group
*Preventing some people of stereotyped groups from entering or succeeding in activities or fields

The effects of stereotyping can fluctuate, but for the most part they are negative, and not always apparent until long periods of time have passed.  Over time, some victims of negative stereotypes display self-fulfilling prophecy behavior, in which they assume that the stereotype represents norms to emulate. Negative effects may include forming inaccurate opinions of people, scapegoating, erroneously judgmentalism, preventing emotional identification, distress, and impaired performance. Stereotyping painfully reminds those being judged of how society views them.

Stereotype accuracy is a growing area of study and for [[Yueh-Ting Lee]] and his colleagues they have created an EPA Model (Evaluation, Potency, Accuracy) to describe the continuously changing variables of stereotypes.

==Role in art and culture==
{{Unreferenced|date=December 2008}}

Stereotypes are common in various cultural [[media (communication)|media]], where they take the form of dramatic [[stock character]]s. These characters are found in the works of playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Dario Fo]], and [[Jacques Lecoq]], who characterize their actors as stereotypes for theatrical effect. In [[commedia dell'arte]] this is similarly common. The instantly recognizable nature of stereotypes mean that they are effective in [[advertising]] and [[situation comedy]]. These stereotypes change, and in modern times only a few of the stereotyped characters shown in [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' would be recognizable.

In [[literature]] and [[art]], stereotypes are [[cliché]]d or predictable characters or situations. Throughout history, storytellers have drawn from stereotypical characters and situations, in order to connect the audience with new tales immediately. Sometimes such stereotypes can be sophisticated, such as [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Shylock]] in ''The Merchant of Venice''. Arguably a stereotype that becomes complex and sophisticated ceases to be a stereotype ''per se'' by its unique characterization. Thus while Shylock remains politically unstable in being a stereotypical [[Jew]], the subject of [[prejudice|prejudicial]] derision in Shakespeare's era, his many other detailed features raise him above a simple stereotype and into a unique character, worthy of modern performance. Simply because one feature of a character can be categorized as being typical does not make the entire character a stereotype.

Despite their proximity in etymological roots, cliché and stereotype are not used synonymously in cultural spheres. For example a cliché is a high criticism in [[narratology]] where [[genre]] and [[categorization]] automatically associates a story within its recognizable group. Labeling a situation or character in a story as ''typical'' suggests it is fitting for its genre or category. Whereas declaring that a storyteller has relied on cliché is to pejoratively observe a simplicity and lack of originality in the tale. To criticize [[Ian Fleming]] for a ''stereotypically'' unlikely escape for [[James Bond]] would be understood by the reader or listener, but it would be more appropriately criticized as a cliché in that it is overused and reproduced. [[Narrative]] genre relies heavily on ''typical'' features to remain recognizable and generate meaning in the reader/viewer.

In movies and TV the [[halo effect]] is often used. This is when, for example, attractive men and women are assumed to be happier, stronger, nicer people .&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald and Banaji from Psychological Review&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial and ethnic stereotyping==
=== United States specific stereotypes ===
{{Main|Stereotypes of groups within the United States}}

Stereotypes exist of various groups of people as found within US culture. These stereotypes may be disproportionately well known to people worldwide, due to the transmission of US culture and values via the export of US made films and television shows. A result of these cause people to misjudge others by what the stereotype states.

===Inuit stereotypes===
[[Inuit]] or [[Eskimo]] people are usually dressed in [[parka]]s, carving out trinkets, living in [[igloo]]s, going fishing with a [[harpoon]], traveling by [[sleigh]] and [[husky|huskies]], eating [[cod-liver oil]] and the men are usually called [[Nanook]] in reference to the documentary ''[[Nanook of the North]]''. Eskimo children may have a [[Pinniped|seal]] for a best friend. Eskimos are often believed to have an [[Eskimo words for snow|unusually large number of words for snow]]. This is however, an [[urban legend]].

Eskimos are sometimes shown rubbing each other noses together as some sort of greeting ritual ([[Eskimo kissing]]). They're also often depicted surrounded by [[polar bear]]s, [[walrus]]es and inaccurately, with [[penguin]]s, which only live in the [[Southern hemisphere]] and not on the [[North Pole]]. Sometimes Eskimos themselves are depicted living on the South Pole, which is again wrong for the same reason.

===Irish stereotypes===
[[File:Irish-stereotypes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cartoon above (New [[Physiognomy]], New York, 1866), contrasts [[Florence Nightingale]], the [[Crimean War]] nurse, with "Bridget McBruiser", the stereotypical [[Irish people|Irish]] woman.]]
[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Scientific racism]] from an American magazine, ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', says that the [[Irish people|Irish]] are similar to '[[Negroes]].']]
An analysis of nineteenth-century British attitudes by [[Mary J. Hickman]] and Bronwen Walter wrote that the 'Irish Catholic' was one viewed as an "[[Other#The Other in the Social Sciences|other]]", or a different race in the construction of the English nationalist myth. Likewise, the Irish considered the English "other" and fought hard to break away.&lt;ref&gt;''Deconstructing Whiteness: Irish Women in Britain'' Mary J. Hickman, Bronwen Walter
''Feminist Review'', No. 50, The Irish Issue: The British Question (Summer, 1995), pp. 5-19 doi:10.2307/&lt;/ref&gt;

Benign in comparison to some of the more vulgar generalizations against other ethnicities but nonetheless incorrect are those accusing the Irish as quick-tempered brawlers and alcoholics. One 19th century British cartoonist even depicted Irish immigrants as simian and racially different from Anglo-Saxons. One American doctor in the 1850s, [[James Redfield]], argued that "facial angle" was a sign of intelligence and character; likening the [[physiognomy|physiognomies]] of human ethnic groups to animals. Thus [[Irish people|Irishmen]] resembled dogs, Yankees were like bears, Germans like lions, blacks like elephants and Englishmen like bulls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN&amp;id=qJW5iuEKdCMC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;ots=8CX0kmAm4f&amp;dq=James+Redfield+1852+Comparative+physiognomy&amp;sig=uYg9nTMRiF1XF1w7m37elYwKyZ0#PPA11,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 20th century physical stereotypes survived in the comic books until the 1950s, with Irish characters like [[Mutt and Jeff]], and Jiggs and Maggie appearing daily in hundreds of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Soper, "Performing 'Jiggs': Irish Caricature and Comedic Ambivalence toward Asøsimilation and the American Dream in George McManus's Bringing Up Father."

[[Jew|Jewish people]] have been stereotyped throughout the centuries and made [[scapegoats]] for a multitude of societal problems. Jews are still stereotyped as greedy, nit-picky, [[miser]]s. They have often been shown counting money or collecting [[diamond]]s. [[Antisemitism]] prevailed for centuries and reached a climax in [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] with the [[Holocaust]].

Early films such as ''Cohen's Advertising Scheme'' (1904, silent) stereotyped Jews as "scheming merchants.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/imagesjews.html The Movies, Race, and Ethnicity: Jews]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual stereotypes==
The British [[biologist]], Angus John Bateman was the one who first talked about sexual stereotypes in the late 1940s. His theory would say that males are [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] and females tend to be more selective when choosing their sexual partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6869/full/415254a.html Sexual stereotypes] International weekly journal of science.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bateman's principle was based on experiments made of [[Tephritidae|fruitflies]], later on he concluded that the theory applies also in the case of humans. His ideas were based on the fact that males presented an "undiscriminating eagerness" to mate while females displayed "discriminated passivity."

===Impact of sexual stereotypes===
Living up to stereotypes can have damaging effects. Intending to live up to sexual stereotypes may lead to frustration. Stereotypes have the ability to create an idea that some are better than others based on their sexual abilities and [[sex organ|sexual organs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/lessons/secondary/gender_portrayal/gender_impact.cfm The Impact of Gender Role Stereotypes] Media Awareness Network.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual orientation stereotypes===
{{Main|LGBT stereotypes}}
People with negative views of [[gay]], [[lesbian]], and [[transgender]] people often use stereotypes about them to justify their attacks. Sometimes, it has also fueled [[violence against LGBT people]]. According to [[ABC News]], "Gay activists often criticize media coverage of gay pride parades, saying, correctly, that the media focus on the extreme, the more flamboyantly feminine men and very masculine women. But that's not us, they say. Most of us are just like everyone else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay Stereotypes: Are They True?|publisher=[[ABC News]]|url=http://i.abcnews.com/2020/Story?id=&amp;page=3|date=September 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedophilia stereotypes===
Pedophiles and pedophilia, although not under the category of Sexual Orientation such as homosexuality or bisexuality are also victims of stereotypes. In mass media a [[pedophilia|pedophile]] is usually despicted a serial [[child molester]] or a person with several mental problems, while many organizations remark that most pedophiles , although attracted to young or teenage children, do not molest them  and that many of the stereotypes against pedophiles are false or are unacceptable as a generalization .&lt;ref&gt;Anecdotal evidences suggests that many pedophiles and ephebophiles do not act sexually with children or adolescents, but it is not known how many do not  [...] Other than the attraction to minors itself, studies fail to find any abnormal or pathological characteristics.|url=http://www.b4uact.org/facts.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The problem with all this information about pedophiles is that most of it is not true or is so qualified as to be useless as generalization. Indeed, say some psychologists, there may be no such thing as a "typical" pedophile, if there is such a thing as a pedophile at all. Qualities by which social scientists and the police have marked him, such as his purported shyness or childhood sexual trauma, do not bear out with statistical significance.
