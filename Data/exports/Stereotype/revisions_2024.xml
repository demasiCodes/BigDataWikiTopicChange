In [[social psychology]], a '''stereotype''' is a generalized belief about a particular category of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Dictionary of Psychology |last=Cardwell |first=Mike |location=Chicago |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn |date=1999 |isbn=9781579580643 |url= https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofpsyc0000card}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an expectation that people might have about every person of a particular group. The type of expectation can vary; it can be, for example, an expectation about the group's personality, preferences, appearance or ability.  Stereotypes are often [[faulty generalization|overgeneralized]], inaccurate, and [[Belief perseverance|resistant to new information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Meyer |first=David G. |title=Intuition: Its Powers and Perils |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2008 |isbn=9780300130270 |pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stereotype does not necessarily need to be a negative assumption. They may be positive, neutral, or negative.

==Explicit stereotypes==
An explicit stereotype refers to stereotypes that one is aware that one holds, and is aware that one is using to judge people. If person ''A ''is making judgments about a {{em|particular}} person ''B'' from group ''G'', and person ''A'' has an explicit stereotype for group ''G'', their decision bias can be partially mitigated using conscious control; however, attempts to offset bias due to conscious awareness of a stereotype often fail at being truly impartial, due to either underestimating or overestimating the amount of bias being created by the stereotype.

==Implicit stereotypes==
[[Implicit stereotype]]s are those that lay on individuals' subconsciousness, that they have no control or awareness of.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/faqs.html#faq1 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |website=Implicit.Harvard.edu |access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Implicit stereotypes are built based on two concepts, associative networks in semantic (knowledge) memory and automatic activation".&lt;ref name="Hinton"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hinton |first=Perry |title=Implicit stereotypes and the predictive brain: Cognition and culture in "biased" person perception |journal=Palgrave Communications |date=1 September 2017 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1057/palcomms.2017.86 |s2cid=54036730 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit stereotypes are automatic and involuntary associations that people make between a social group and a domain or attribute. For example, one can have beliefs that women and men are equally capable of becoming successful electricians but at the same time many can associate electricians more with men than women.&lt;ref name="Hinton" /&gt;

In [[social psychology]], a stereotype is any thought widely adopted about specific types of individuals or certain ways of behaving intended to represent the entire group of those individuals or behaviors as a whole.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al.

Even in the social sciences and some sub-disciplines of psychology, stereotypes are occasionally reproduced and can be identified in certain theories, for example, in assumptions about other cultures.&lt;ref name="Chakkarath, P.

==Etymology==
The term ''stereotype'' comes from the French adjective {{lang|fr|stéréotype}} and derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words {{lang|grc|στερεός}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:στερεός|stereos]]}}), 'firm, solid'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dstereo%2Fs |title=στερεός |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |work=A Greek-English Lexicon |via=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|τύπος}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:τύπος|typos]]}}), 'impression',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtu%2Fpos |title=τύπος |first1=Henry George |last1=Liddell |first2=Robert |last2=Scott |work=A Greek-English Lexicon |via=Perseus Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence 'solid impression on one or more [[ideas]]/[[theories]]'.

The term was first used in the [[Printing industry|printing trade]] in 1798 by [[Firmin Didot]], to describe a printing plate that duplicated any [[typography]]. The duplicate printing plate, or the [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]], is used for printing instead of the original.

Outside of printing, the first reference to ''stereotype'' in English was in 1850, as a noun that meant 'image perpetuated without change'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=stereotype |title=stereotype – Origin and meaning |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=22 October 2017 |first=Douglas |last=Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1922 that ''stereotype'' was first used in the modern psychological sense by American journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] in his work ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kleg |first=Milton |title=Hate, Prejudice and Racism |url= https://archive.org/details/hateprejudicerac0000kleg |url-access=registration |date=1993 |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |pages=[https://archive.org/details/hateprejudicerac0000kleg/page/135 135]–137 |isbn=9780585054919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although related, the three concepts can exist independently of each other.&lt;ref name="Denmark" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt; According to [[Daniel Katz (psychologist)|Daniel Katz]] and Kenneth Braly, stereotyping leads to racial prejudice when people emotionally react to the name of a group, ascribe characteristics to members of that group, and then evaluate those characteristics.&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Braly (1935)" /&gt;

Possible prejudicial effects of stereotypes&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)" /&gt; are:
* Justification of ill-founded prejudices or ignorance
* Unwillingness to rethink one's attitudes and behavior
* Preventing some people of stereotyped groups from entering or succeeding in activities or fields&lt;ref name=Tilcsik&gt;

Stereotype content refers to the attributes that people think characterize a group. Studies of stereotype content examine what people think of others, rather than the reasons and mechanisms involved in stereotyping.&lt;ref name="operario&amp;fiske"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Operario |first1=Don |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |editor1-first=Rupert |editor1-last=Brown |editor2-first=Samuel L. |editor2-last=Gaertner |title=Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Intergroup Processes |date=2003 |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |location=Malden, Massachusetts |isbn=9781405106542 |pages=22–44 |chapter=Stereotypes: Content, Structures, Processes, and Context |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Wfx55Z-Dw10C&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early theories of stereotype content proposed by social psychologists such as [[Gordon Allport]] assumed that stereotypes of [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]] reflected uniform [[antipathy]].&lt;ref name="fiske et al. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fiske |first1=Susan T. |last2=Cuddy |first2=Amy J.

By contrast, a newer [[Stereotype content model|model of stereotype content]] theorizes that stereotypes are frequently ambivalent and vary along two dimensions: warmth and competence. Warmth and competence are respectively predicted by lack of competition and [[Social status|status]]. Groups that do not compete with the in-group for the same resources (e.g., college space) are perceived as warm, whereas high-status (e.g., economically or educationally successful) groups are considered competent. The groups within each of the four combinations of high and low levels of warmth and competence elicit distinct emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dovidio |author1-link=John Dovidio |first1=John F. |last2=Gaertner |first2=Samuel L. |editor1-first=Fiske |editor1-last=Susan T. |editor2-first=Daniel T. |editor2-last=Gilbert |editor3-first=Gardner |editor3-last=Lindzey |title=Handbook of Social Psychology |edition=5th |volume=2 |date=2010 |publisher=John Wiley |location=Hooboken, New Jersey |isbn=9780470137475 |page=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofsocial5ed2unse/page/1085 1085] |chapter=Intergroup Bias |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Pye5IkCFgRYC&amp;pg=PA1085 |url= https://archive.org/details/handbookofsocial5ed2unse/page/1085}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model explains the phenomenon that some out-groups are admired but disliked, whereas others are liked but disrespected.

An even more recent model of stereotype content called the agency–beliefs–communion (ABC) model suggested that methods to study warmth and competence in the stereotype content model (SCM) were missing a crucial element, that being, stereotypes of social groups are often spontaneously generated.&lt;ref name="Koch, Imhoff, et al. 2016"&gt;Koch, A.; Imhoff, R.; Dotsch, R.; Unkelbach, C.; &amp; Alves, H. (2016). "The ABC of Stereotypes About Groups: Agency/Socioeconomic Success, Conservative-Progressive Beliefs, and Communion". ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 110, 675–709. https://doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000046&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments on the SCM usually ask participants to rate traits according to warmth and competence but this does not allow participants to use any other stereotype dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;"Groups' warmth is a personal matter: Understanding consensus on stereotype dimensions reconciles adversarial models of social evaluation". ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 89, 103995. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2020.103995&lt;/ref&gt; The ABC model, proposed by Koch and colleagues in 2016 is an estimate of how people spontaneously stereotype U.S social groups of people using traits. Koch et al. conducted several studies asking participants to list groups and sort them according to their similarity.&lt;ref name="Koch, Imhoff, et al. 2016" /&gt; Using statistical techniques, they revealed three dimensions that explained the similarity ratings. These three dimensions were agency (A), beliefs (B), and communion (C). Agency is associated with reaching goals, standing out and socio-economic status and is related to competence in the SCM, with some examples of traits including poor and wealthy, powerful and powerless, low status and high status. Beliefs is associated with views on the world, morals and conservative-progressive beliefs with some examples of traits including traditional and modern, religious and science-oriented or conventional and alternative. Finally, communion is associated with connecting with others and fitting in and is similar to warmth from the SCM, with some examples of traits including trustworthy and untrustworthy, cold and warm and repellent and likeable.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, A.; Yzerbyt, V.; Abele, A.; Ellemers, N.; &amp; Fiske, S. T. (2021). "Chapter One – Social evaluation: Comparing models across interpersonal, intragroup, intergroup, several-group, and many-group contexts". In: Gawronski, B. (ed.), ''Advances in Experimental Social Psychology'' (Vol. 63, pp. 1–68). Academic Press. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aesp.2020.11.001&lt;/ref&gt; According to research using this model, there is a curvilinear relationship between agency and communion.&lt;ref&gt;Dragon, P.; Holland, R.; Szumowska, E.; Suska, A.; Kossowska, M.; &amp; Wigboldus, D. (2022). "Explaining the relationship between agency and communion by means of lay personality theories and connectionist modelling". https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/g847b"&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a group is high or low in the agency dimension then they may be seen as un-communal, whereas groups that are average in agency are seen as more communal.&lt;ref&gt;Cao, Y.

''North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics''.&lt;/ref&gt; This model has many implications in predicting behaviour towards stereotyped groups. For example, Koch and colleagues recently proposed that perceived similarity in agency and beliefs increases inter-group cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, A.; Dorrough, A.; Glöckner, A.; &amp; Imhoff, R. (2020). "The ABC of society: Perceived similarity in agency/socioeconomic success and conservative-progressive beliefs increases intergroup cooperation".

==Functions==
Early studies suggested that stereotypes were only used by rigid, repressed, and authoritarian people. This idea has been refuted by contemporary studies that suggest the ubiquity of stereotypes and it was suggested to regard stereotypes as collective group beliefs, meaning that people who belong to the same social group share the same set of stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tajfel |first1=Henri |editor1-first=John C. |editor1-last=Turner |editor2-first=Howard |editor2-last=Giles |title=Intergroup behaviour |date=1981 |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |location=Oxford |isbn=9780631117117 |pages=144–167 |chapter=Social stereotypes and social groups}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern research asserts that full understanding of stereotypes requires considering them from two complementary perspectives: as shared within a particular culture/subculture and as formed in the mind of an individual person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Macrae |editor1-first=C. N. |editor2-last=Stangor |editor2-first=C. |editor3-last=Hewstone |editor3-first=M. |title=Stereotypes and Stereotyping |date=1995 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship between cognitive and social functions===
Stereotyping can serve cognitive functions on an interpersonal level, and social functions on an intergroup level.&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt; For stereotyping to function on an intergroup level (see social identity approaches: [[social identity theory]] and [[self-categorization theory]]), an individual must see themselves as part of a group and being part of that group must also be salient for the individual.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt;

Craig McGarty, Russell Spears, and Vincent Y. Yzerbyt (2002) argued that the cognitive functions of stereotyping are best understood in relation to its social functions, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="McGarty Spears et al. (2002)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McGarty |first1=Craig |last3=Yzerbyt |first3=Vincent Y. |last2=Spears |first2=Russel |title=Stereotypes as explanations: The formation of meaningful beliefs about social groups |url= https://archive.org/details/stereotypesasexp00mcga |url-access=limited |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521800471 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/stereotypesasexp00mcga/page/n197 186]–199 |chapter=Conclusion: stereotypes are selective, variable and contested explanations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive functions===
Stereotypes can help make sense of the world. They are a form of categorization that helps to simplify and systematize information. Thus, information is more easily identified, recalled, predicted, and reacted to.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt; Stereotypes are categories of objects or people. Between stereotypes, objects or people are as different from each other as possible.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt; Within stereotypes, objects or people are as similar to each other as possible.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt;

[[Gordon Allport]] has suggested possible answers to why people find it easier to understand categorized information.&lt;ref name="Allport (1954)"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nature of Prejudice |last=Allport |first=Gordon W. |author-link=Gordon Allport |date=1954 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=9780201001754 |page=[https://archive.org/details/natureofprejudic00gord/page/189 189] |url= https://archive.org/details/natureofprejudic00gord |url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, people can consult a category to identify response patterns. Second, categorized information is more specific than non-categorized information, as categorization accentuates properties that are shared by all members of a group. Third, people can readily describe objects in a category because objects in the same category have distinct characteristics. Finally, people can take for granted the characteristics of a particular category because the category itself may be an arbitrary grouping.

A complementary perspective theorizes how stereotypes function as time- and energy-savers that allow people to act more efficiently.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt; Yet another perspective suggests that stereotypes are people's biased perceptions of their social contexts.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt; In this view, people use stereotypes as shortcuts to make sense of their social contexts, and this makes a person's task of understanding his or her world less cognitively demanding.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt;

===Social functions===
====Social categorization====
In the following situations, the overarching purpose of stereotyping is for people to put their collective self (their in-group membership) in a positive light:&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511489877.009 |chapter=From personal pictures in the head to collective tools in the world: How shared stereotypes allow groups to represent and change social reality |title=Stereotypes as Explanations |date=2002 |last1=Haslam |first1=S. Alexander |last2=Turner |first2=John C. |last3=Oakes |first3=Penelope J. |last4=Reynolds |first4=Katherine J. |last5=Doosje |first5=Bertjan |pages=157–185 |isbn=9780521804820}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* when stereotypes are used for explaining social events
* when stereotypes are used for justifying activities of one's own group ([[ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]]) to another group ([[ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]])
* when stereotypes are used for differentiating the ingroup as positively distinct from outgroups

=====Explanation purposes=====
[[File:Antisemitic caricature 1873.jpg|thumb|An [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] 1873 caricature depicting the stereotypical physical features of a Jewish male]]

As mentioned previously, stereotypes can be used to explain social events.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)" /&gt; [[Henri Tajfel]]&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt; described his observations of how some people found that the antisemitic fabricated contents of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' only made sense if Jews have certain characteristics. Therefore, according to Tajfel,&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt; Jews were stereotyped as being evil and yearning for world domination to match the antisemitic "facts" as presented in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

=====Justification purposes=====
People create stereotypes of an outgroup to justify the actions that their in-group has committed (or plans to commit) towards that outgroup.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allport (1954)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)" /&gt; For example, according to Tajfel,&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt; Europeans stereotyped African, Indian, and Chinese people as being incapable of achieving financial advances without European help. This stereotype was used to justify European colonialism in Africa, India, and China.

=====Intergroup differentiation=====
An assumption is that people want their ingroup to have a positive image relative to outgroups, and so people want to differentiate their ingroup from relevant outgroups in a desirable way.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt; If an outgroup does not affect the ingroup's image, then from an image preservation point of view, there is no point for the ingroup to be positively distinct from that outgroup.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt;

People can actively create certain images for relevant outgroups by stereotyping. People do so when they see that their ingroup is no longer as clearly and/or as positively differentiated from relevant outgroups, and they want to restore the intergroup differentiation to a state that favours the ingroup.&lt;ref name="Tajfel (1981)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)" /&gt;

====Self-categorization====
Stereotypes can emphasize a person's group membership in two steps: Stereotypes emphasize the person's similarities with ingroup members on relevant dimensions, and also the person's differences from outgroup members on relevant dimensions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People change the stereotype of their ingroups and outgroups to suit context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once an outgroup treats an ingroup member badly, they are more drawn to the members of their own group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15298868.2012.712753 |volume=12 |title=Comparing Self-stereotyping with In-group-stereotyping and Out-group-stereotyping in Unequal-status Groups: The Case of Gender |date=2013 |journal=Self and Identity |pages=582–596 |last1=Cadinu |first1=Mara |last2=Latrofa |first2=Marcella |last3=Carnaghi |first3=Andrea |issue=6 |s2cid=145053003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen as members within a group are able to relate to each other though a stereotype because of identical situations. A person can embrace a stereotype to avoid humiliation such as failing a task and blaming it on a stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2007.01.008 |volume=44 |title=Endorsing a negative in-group stereotype as a self-protective strategy: Sacrificing the group to save the self |date=2008 |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |pages=37–49 |last1=Burkley |first1=Melissa |last2=Blanton |first2=Hart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social influence and consensus====
Stereotypes are an indicator of ingroup consensus.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)" /&gt; When there are intragroup disagreements over stereotypes of the ingroup and/or outgroups, ingroup members take collective action to prevent other ingroup members from diverging from each other.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)" /&gt;

John C. Turner proposed in 1987&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)" /&gt; that if ingroup members disagree on an outgroup stereotype, then one of three possible collective actions follow: First, ingroup members may negotiate with each other and conclude that they have different outgroup stereotypes because they are stereotyping different subgroups of an outgroup (e.g., Russian gymnasts versus Russian boxers). Second, ingroup members may negotiate with each other, but conclude that they are disagreeing because of categorical differences amongst themselves. Accordingly, in this context, it is better to categorise ingroup members under different categories (e.g., Democrats versus Republican) than under a shared category (e.g., American). Finally, ingroup members may influence each other to arrive at a common outgroup stereotype.

==Formation==
Different disciplines give different accounts of how stereotypes develop: Psychologists may focus on an individual's experience with groups, patterns of communication about those groups, and intergroup conflict. As for sociologists, they may focus on the relations among different groups in a social structure. They suggest that stereotypes are the result of conflict, poor parenting, and inadequate mental and emotional development. Once stereotypes have formed, there are two main factors that explain their persistence. First, the cognitive effects of schematic processing (see [[schema (psychology)|schema]]) make it so that when a member of a group behaves as we expect, the behavior confirms and even strengthens existing stereotypes. Second, the affective or emotional aspects of prejudice render logical arguments against stereotypes ineffective in countering the power of emotional responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aronson |first1=E. |last2=Wilson |first2=T. D. |last3=Akert |first3=R. M. |date=2010 |title=Social Psychology |edition=7th |location=New York |publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Correspondence bias===
{{Main|Correspondence bias}}
''Correspondence bias'' refers to the tendency to ascribe a person's behavior to [[disposition]] or personality, and to underestimate the extent to which situational factors elicited the behavior. Correspondence bias can play an important role in stereotype formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Mackie |first1=Diane M. |last2=Hamilton |first2=David L. |last3=Susskind |first3=Joshua |last4=Rosselli |first4=Francine |editor1-first=C.

For example, in a study by Roguer and Yzerbyt (1999) participants watched a video showing students who were randomly instructed to find arguments either for or against [[euthanasia]]. The students that argued in favor of euthanasia came from the same law department or from different departments. Results showed that participants attributed the students' responses to their attitudes although it had been made clear in the video that students had no choice about their position. Participants reported that group membership, i.e., the department that the students belonged to, affected the students' opinions about euthanasia. Law students were perceived to be more in favor of euthanasia than students from different departments despite the fact that a pretest had revealed that subjects had no preexisting expectations about attitudes toward euthanasia and the department that students belong to. The attribution error created the new stereotype that law students are more likely to support euthanasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Rogier |first1=Anouk |last2=Yzerbyt |first2=Vincent |title=Social attribution, correspondence bias, and the emergence of stereotypes |date=1999 |journal=[[Swiss Journal of Psychology]] |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=233–240 |doi=10.1024//1421-0185.58.4.233 |url= http://www.psor.ucl.ac.be/personal/yzerbyt/Rogier%20&amp;%20Yzerbyt%20SJP%201999.pdf |access-date=5 April 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130729071003/http://www.psor.ucl.ac.be/personal/yzerbyt/Rogier%20%26%20Yzerbyt%20SJP%201999.pdf |archive-date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nier et al. (2012) found that people who tend to draw dispositional inferences from behavior and ignore situational constraints are more likely to stereotype low-status groups as incompetent and high-status groups as competent. Participants listened to descriptions of two fictitious groups of [[Pacific Islander]]s, one of which was described as being higher in status than the other. In a second study, subjects rated actual groups&amp;nbsp;– the poor and wealthy, women and men – in the United States in terms of their competence. Subjects who scored high on the measure of correspondence bias stereotyped the poor, women, and the fictitious lower-status Pacific Islanders as incompetent whereas they stereotyped the wealthy, men, and the high-status Pacific Islanders as competent. The correspondence bias was a significant predictor of stereotyping even after controlling for other measures that have been linked to beliefs about low status groups, the [[just-world fallacy]] and [[social dominance orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Nier |first1=Jason A. |last2=Bajaj |first2=Priya |last3=McLean |first3=Meghan C. |last4=Schwartz |first4=Elizabeth |title=Group status, perceptions of agency, and the correspondence bias: Attributional processes in the formation of stereotypes about high and low status groups |date=2012 |journal=[[Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations]] |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=476–487 |doi=10.1177/1368430212454925 |s2cid=145399213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the anti-public sector bias,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Marvel |first=John D. |date=30 January 2015 |title=Unconscious Bias in Citizens' Evaluations of Public Sector Performance |journal=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory |pages=muu053 |doi=10.1093/jopart/muu053 |issn=1053-1858 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Döring and Willems (2021)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Döring |first1=Matthias |last2=Willems |first2=Jurgen |date=22 September 2021 |title=Processing stereotypes: Professionalism confirmed or disconfirmed by sector affiliation? |journal=International Public Management Journal |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=221–239 |doi=10.1080/10967494.2021.1971125 |s2cid=239261451 |issn=1096-7494 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that employees in the public sector are considered as less professional compared to employees in the private sector. They build on the assumption that the [[Red tape|red-tape]] and bureaucratic nature of the public sector spills over in the perception that citizens have about the employees working in the sector. With an experimental vignette study, they analyze how citizens process information on employees' sector affiliation, and integrate non-work role-referencing to test the stereotype confirmation assumption underlying the [[representativeness heuristic]]. The results show that sector as well as non-work role-referencing influences perceived employee professionalism but has little effect on the confirmation of particular public sector stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Willems |first=Jurgen |date=2020 |title=Public servant stereotypes: It is not (at) all about being lazy, greedy and corrupt |journal=Public Administration |volume=98 |issue=4 |pages=807–823 |doi=10.1111/padm.12686 |s2cid=221760839 |issn=1467-9299 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the results do not confirm a congruity effect of consistent stereotypical information: non-work role-referencing does not aggravate the negative effect of sector affiliation on perceived employee professionalism.

===Illusory correlation===
{{main|Illusory correlation}}
Research has shown that stereotypes can develop based on a cognitive mechanism known as illusory correlation&amp;nbsp;– an erroneous inference about the relationship between two events.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mullen&amp;johnson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mullen |first1=Brian |last2=Johnson |first2=Craig |date=1990 |title=Distinctiveness-based illusory correlations and stereotyping: A meta-analytic integration |journal=[[British Journal of Social Psychology]] |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=11–28 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1990.tb00883.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meiser |first1=Thorsten |editor1-first=Klaus |editor1-last=Fiedler |editor2-first=Peter |editor2-last=Justin |title=Information Sampling and Adaptive Cognition |date=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521831598 |pages=183–209 |chapter=Contingency Learning and Biased Group Impressions |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RMZL_2H8A4kC&amp;pg=PA183}}&lt;/ref&gt; If two statistically infrequent events co-occur, observers overestimate the frequency of co-occurrence of these events. The underlying reason is that rare, infrequent events are distinctive and [[Salience (neuroscience)|salient]] and, when paired, become even more so. The heightened salience results in more attention and more effective [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], which strengthens the belief that the events are [[Correlation|correlated]].&lt;ref name="hamilton&amp;gifford"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=David L. |last2=Gifford |first2=Robert K. |date=1976 |title=Illusory correlation in interpersonal perception: A cognitive basis of stereotypic judgments |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=392–407 |doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(76)80006-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berndsen et al.

In the inter-group context, illusory correlations lead people to misattribute rare behaviors or traits at higher rates to [[minority group]] members than to majority groups, even when both display the same proportion of the behaviors or traits. [[Black people]], for instance, are a minority group in the United States and interaction with blacks is a relatively infrequent event for an average [[white American]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ajrouch |first1=Kristine J. |last2=Antonucci |first2=Toni C. |last3=Janevic |first3=Mary R. |date=1 March 2001 |title=Social Networks Among Blacks and Whites: The Interaction Between Race and Age |journal=The Journals of Gerontology |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=S112–S118 |doi=10.1093/geronb/56.2.S112 |pmid=11245365 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, undesirable behavior (e.g. crime) is statistically less frequent than desirable behavior. Since both events "blackness" and "undesirable behavior" are distinctive in the sense that they are infrequent, the combination of the two leads observers to overestimate the rate of co-occurrence.&lt;ref name="hamilton&amp;gifford" /&gt; Similarly, in workplaces where women are underrepresented and negative behaviors such as errors occur less frequently than positive behaviors, women become more strongly associated with mistakes than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moskowitz |first1=Gordon B. |author-link1=Gordon Moskowitz |title=Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;pg=PA182 |date=2005 |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |location=New York |isbn=9781593850852 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a landmark study, David Hamilton and Richard Gifford (1976) examined the role of illusory correlation in stereotype formation. Subjects were instructed to read descriptions of behaviors performed by members of groups A and B. Negative behaviors outnumbered positive actions and group B was smaller than group A, making negative behaviors and membership in group B relatively infrequent and distinctive. Participants were then asked who had performed a set of actions: a person of group A or group B. Results showed that subjects overestimated the frequency with which both distinctive events, membership in group B and negative behavior, co-occurred, and evaluated group B more negatively. This despite the fact the proportion of positive to negative behaviors was equivalent for both groups and that there was no actual correlation between group membership and behaviors.&lt;ref name="hamilton&amp;gifford" /&gt; Although Hamilton and Gifford found a similar effect for positive behaviors as the infrequent events, a [[Meta-analysis|meta-analytic]] review of studies showed that illusory correlation effects are stronger when the infrequent, distinctive information is negative.&lt;ref name="mullen&amp;johnson" /&gt;

Hamilton and Gifford's distinctiveness-based explanation of stereotype formation was subsequently extended.&lt;ref name="Berndsen et al. (2002)" /&gt; A 1994 study by McConnell, Sherman, and Hamilton found that people formed stereotypes based on information that was not distinctive at the time of presentation, but was considered distinctive at the time of judgement.&lt;ref name="McConnell et al. (1994)" /&gt; Once a person judges non-distinctive information in memory to be distinctive, that information is re-encoded and re-represented as if it had been distinctive when it was first processed.&lt;ref name="McConnell et al. (1994)" /&gt;

===Common environment===
One explanation for why stereotypes are shared is that they are the result of a common environment that stimulates people to react in the same way.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt;

The problem with the 'common environment' is that explanation in general is that it does not explain how shared stereotypes can occur without direct stimuli.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt; Research since the 1930s suggested that people are highly similar with each other in how they describe different racial and national groups, although those people have no personal experience with the groups they are describing.&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Braly (1933)" /&gt;

===Socialization and upbringing===
Another explanation says that people are [[Socialisation|socialised]] to adopt the same stereotypes.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt; Some psychologists believe that although stereotypes can be absorbed at any age, stereotypes are usually acquired in early childhood under the influence of parents, teachers, peers, and the media.

If stereotypes are defined by social values, then stereotypes only change as per changes in social values.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt; The suggestion that stereotype content depends on social values reflects [[Walter Lippman]]'s argument in his 1922 publication that stereotypes are rigid because they cannot be changed at will.&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Braly (1935)" /&gt;

Studies emerging since the 1940s refuted the suggestion that stereotype contents cannot be changed at will. Those studies suggested that one group's stereotype of another group would become more or less positive depending on whether their [[intergroup relations]]hip had improved or degraded.&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Braly (1935)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meenes (1943)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meenes |first1=Max |date=1943 |title=A Comparison of Racial Stereotypes of 1935 and 1942 |journal=[[Journal of Social Psychology]] |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=327–336 |doi=10.1080/00224545.1943.9712287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al.

For example, after WWII, Black American students held a more negative stereotype of people from countries that were the United States's [[Axis powers|WWII enemies]].&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Braly (1935)" /&gt; If there are no changes to an intergroup relationship, then relevant stereotypes do not change.&lt;ref name="Oakes et al.

C. |date=1994 |title=Stereotyping and Social Reality |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intergroup relations===
According to a third explanation, shared stereotypes are neither caused by the coincidence of common stimuli, nor by socialisation. This explanation posits that stereotypes are shared because group members are motivated to behave in certain ways, and stereotypes reflect those behaviours.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt; It is important to note from this explanation that stereotypes are the consequence, not the cause, of [[intergroup relations]]. This explanation assumes that when it is important for people to acknowledge both their ingroup and outgroup, they will emphasise their difference from outgroup members, and their similarity to ingroup members.&lt;ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)" /&gt; International migration creates more opportunities for intergroup relations, but the interactions do not always disconfirm stereotypes. They are also known to form and maintain them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Palmer |first=Wayne |date=2019 |title=International Migration and Stereotype Formation: Indonesian Migrants in Hong Kong |journal=Journal of International Migration and Integration |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=731–744 |doi=10.1007/s12134-019-00680-1 |s2cid=195363006 |issn=1488-3473 |url= https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/12786728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activation==
The dual-process model of cognitive processing of stereotypes asserts that automatic activation of stereotypes is followed by a controlled processing stage, during which an individual may choose to disregard or ignore the stereotyped information that has been brought to mind.&lt;ref name="faculty.washington.edu" /&gt;

A number of studies have found that stereotypes are activated automatically. [[Patricia Devine]] (1989), for example, suggested that stereotypes are automatically activated in the presence of a member (or some symbolic equivalent) of a stereotyped group and that the unintentional activation of the stereotype is equally strong for high- and low-prejudice persons. Words related to the cultural stereotype of blacks were presented [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminally]]. During an ostensibly unrelated [[Impression formation|impression-formation]] task, subjects read a paragraph describing a race-unspecified target person's behaviors and rated the target person on several trait scales. Results showed that participants who received a high proportion of racial words rated the target person in the story as significantly more hostile than participants who were presented with a lower proportion of words related to the stereotype.

Subsequent research suggested that the relation between category activation and stereotype activation was more complex.&lt;ref name="Bargh 1994" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Rupert |title=Prejudice: Its Social Psychology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PygYKbRoZjcC&amp;pg=PA88 |edition=2nd |date=2010 |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |location=Oxford |isbn=9781405113069 |pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lepore and Brown (1997), for instance, noted that the words used in Devine's study were both neutral category labels (e.g., "Blacks") and stereotypic attributes (e.g., "lazy"). They argued that if only the neutral category labels were presented, people high and low in prejudice would respond differently. In a design similar to Devine's, Lepore and Brown [[Priming (psychology)|primed]] the category of African-Americans using labels such as "blacks" and "West Indians" and then assessed the differential activation of the associated stereotype in the subsequent impression-formation task. They found that high-prejudice participants increased their ratings of the target person on the negative stereotypic dimensions and decreased them on the positive dimension whereas low-prejudice subjects tended in the opposite direction. The results suggest that the level of prejudice and stereotype endorsement affects people's judgements when the category&amp;nbsp;– and not the stereotype per se – is primed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lepore |first1=Lorella |last2=Brown |first2=Rupert |date=1997 |title=Category and Stereotype Activation: Is Prejudice Inevitable? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=275–287 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.2.275 |url= http://www.atkinson.yorku.ca/~jsteele/PDF/Optional%20Readings/Lepore_Brown_JPSP_1997.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191944/http://www.atkinson.yorku.ca/~jsteele/PDF/Optional%20Readings/Lepore_Brown_JPSP_1997.pdf |archive-date=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that people can be trained to activate [[Counterstereotype|counterstereotypic]] information and thereby reduce the automatic activation of negative stereotypes. In a study by Kawakami et al. (2000), for example, participants were presented with a category label and taught to respond "No" to stereotypic traits and "Yes" to nonstereotypic traits.

Subjects primed with the stereotype walked significantly more slowly than the control group (although the test did not include any words specifically referring to slowness), thus acting in a way that the stereotype suggests that elderly people will act. And the stereotype of the elder will affect the subjective perception of them through depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/978-0-387-79948-3_489 |chapter=Alzheimer's Dementia |title=Encyclopedia of Clinical Neuropsychology |date=2011 |last1=Tschanz |first1=Joann T. |last2=Andersen |first2=Aaron |pages=99–105 |isbn=9780387799476}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another experiment, Bargh, Chen, and Burrows also found that because the stereotype about blacks includes the notion of aggression, subliminal exposure to black faces increased the likelihood that randomly selected white college students reacted with more aggression and hostility than participants who subconsciously viewed a white face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bargh |first1=John A. |last2=Chen |first2=Mark |last3=Burrows |first3=Lara |title=Automaticity of Social Behavior: Direct Effects of Trait Construct and Stereotype Activation on Action |date=1996 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=230–244 |url= http://www.yale.edu/acmelab/articles/bargh_chen_burrows_1996.pdf |access-date=10 June 2013 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.230 |pmid=8765481 |citeseerx=10.1.1.320.8563 |s2cid=6654763 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131009182408/http://yale.edu/acmelab/articles/bargh_chen_burrows_1996.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Correll et al. (2002) showed that activated stereotypes about blacks can influence people's behavior. In a series of experiments, black and white participants played a video game, in which a black or white person was shown holding a gun or a harmless object (e.g., a mobile phone). Participants had to decide as quickly as possible whether to shoot the target. When the target person was armed, both black and white participants were faster in deciding to shoot the target when he was black than when he was white. When the target was unarmed, the participants avoided shooting him more quickly when he was white. Time pressure made the shooter bias even more pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Correll |first1=Joshua |last2=Park |first2=Bernadette |last3=Judd |first3=Charles M. |last4=Wittenbrink |first4=Bernd |title=The Police Officer's Dilemma: Using Ethnicity to Disambiguate Potentially Threatening Individuals |date=2002 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=1314–1329 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314 |citeseerx=10.1.1.466.7243 |pmid=12500813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes can be efficient shortcuts and sense-making tools.

Research on the role of [[#Illusory correlation|illusory correlations]] in the formation of stereotypes suggests that stereotypes can develop because of incorrect inferences about the relationship between two events (e.g., membership in a social group and bad or good attributes). This means that at least some stereotypes are inaccurate.&lt;ref name="mullen&amp;johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hamilton&amp;gifford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stroessner&amp;plaks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McConnell et al.

A 2005 study by Terracciano et al. found that stereotypic beliefs about nationality do not reflect the actual personality traits of people from different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Terracciano |first1=A. |last2=Abdel-Khalek |first2=A.

In a 1973 paper, Marlene MacKie argued that while stereotypes are inaccurate, this is a definition rather than empirical claim – stereotypes were simply defined as inaccurate, even though the supposed inaccuracy of stereotypes was treated as though it was an empirical discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Marlene.

===Attributional ambiguity===
{{main|Attributional ambiguity}}
Attributive ambiguity refers to the uncertainty that members of stereotyped groups experience in interpreting the causes of others' behavior toward them. Stereotyped individuals who receive negative [[feedback]] can [[Attribution (psychology)|attribute]] it either to personal shortcomings, such as lack of ability or poor effort, or the evaluator's stereotypes and prejudice toward their social group. Alternatively, positive feedback can either be attributed to personal merit or discounted as a form of [[sympathy]] or [[pity]].&lt;ref name="zemore-fiske-kim"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zemore |first1=Sarah E. |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |last3=Kim |first3=Hyun-Jeong |editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-last=Eckes |editor2-first=Hanns Martin |editor2-last=Trautner |title=The Developmental Social Psychology of Gender |date=2000 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Mahwah, New Jersey |isbn=9780585300658 |pages=229–230 |chapter=Gender Stereotypes and the Dynamics of Social Interaction |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yJ43_5tJGycC&amp;pg=PA229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crocker-major-steele"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crocker |first1=Jennifer |last2=Major |first2=Brenda |last3=Stelle |first3=Claude |editor1-first=Daniel T. |editor1-last=Gilbert |editor2-first=Susan T. |editor2-last=Fiske |editor3-first=Gardner |editor3-last=Lindzey |title=The Handbook of Social Psychology |edition=4th |volume=2 |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195213768 |pages=519–521 |chapter=Social Stigma |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w27pSuHLnLYC&amp;pg=PA519}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whiteley |first1=Bernard E. |last2=Kite |first2=Mary E. |title=The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mXSJEjl4uZYC&amp;pg=PA428 |edition=2nd |date=2010 |publisher=Wadsworth / Cengage Learning |location=Belmont, California |isbn=9780495599647 |pages=428–435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jennifer Crocker|Crocker]] et al. (1991) showed that when black participants were evaluated by a white person who was aware of their race, black subjects mistrusted the feedback, attributing negative feedback to the evaluator's stereotypes and positive feedback to the evaluator's desire to appear unbiased. When the black participants' race was unknown to the evaluator, they were more accepting of the feedback.&lt;ref name="Crocker et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crocker |first1=Jennifer |last2=Voelkl |first2=Kristin |last3=Testa |first3=Maria |last4=Major |first4=Brenda |date=1991 |title=Social stigma: The affective consequences of attributional ambiguity |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=218–228 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.2.218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attributional ambiguity has been shown to affect a person's [[self-esteem]]. When they receive positive evaluations, stereotyped individuals are uncertain of whether they really deserved their success and, consequently, they find it difficult to take credit for their achievements. In the case of negative feedback, ambiguity has been shown to have a protective effect on self-esteem as it allows people to assign blame to external causes. Some studies, however, have found that this effect only holds when stereotyped individuals can be absolutely certain that their negative outcomes are due to the evaluators's prejudice. If any room for uncertainty remains, stereotyped individuals tend to blame themselves.&lt;ref name="crocker-major-steele" /&gt;

Attributional ambiguity can also make it difficult to assess one's skills because performance-related evaluations are mistrusted or discounted. Moreover, it can lead to the belief that one's efforts are not directly linked to the outcomes, thereby depressing one's [[motivation]] to succeed.&lt;ref name="zemore-fiske-kim" /&gt;

[[Claude Steele|Claude M. Steele]] and Joshua Aronson conducted the first experiments showing that stereotype threat can depress intellectual performance on [[standardized test]]s. In one study, they found that black college students performed worse than white students on a verbal test when the task was framed as a measure of intelligence. When it was not presented in that manner, the performance gap narrowed. Subsequent experiments showed that framing the test as diagnostic of intellectual ability made black students more aware of negative stereotypes about their group, which in turn impaired their performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steele |first1=Claude M. |last2=Aronson |first2=Joshua |title=Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=69 |issue=5 |pages=797–811 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7473032 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797 |s2cid=4665022 |url= http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Good-rec2-Steele_&amp;_Aronson_95.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotype threat effects have been demonstrated for an array of social groups in many different arenas, including not only academics but also sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stone |first1=Jeff |last2=Lynch |first2=Christian I. |last3=Sjomeling |first3=Mike |last4=Darley |first4=John M. |title=Stereotype threat effects on Black and White athletic performance |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=77 |issue=6 |date=1999 |pages=1213–1227 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1213 |citeseerx=10.1.1.687.5039 |s2cid=14568298}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chess]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maass |first1=Anne |last2=D'Ettole |first2=Claudio |last3=Cadinu |first3=Mara |title=Checkmate?

===Self-fulfilling prophecy===
{{Main|Self-fulfilling prophecy}}
Stereotypes lead people to expect certain actions from members of social groups. These stereotype-based expectations may lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, in which one's inaccurate expectations about a person's behavior, through social interaction, prompt that person to act in stereotype-consistent ways, thus confirming one's erroneous expectations and validating the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kassin |first1=Saul M. |last2=Fein |first2=Steven |last3=Markus |first3=Hazel Rose |title=Social psychology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3aCdjhGxDjgC&amp;pg=PA172 |edition=8th |date=2011 |publisher=Wadsworth / [[Cengage Learning]] |location=Belmont, California |isbn=9780495812401 |pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Rupert |title=Prejudice: Its Social Psychology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PygYKbRoZjcC&amp;pg=PA94 |edition=2nd |date=2010 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Oxford |isbn=9781405113069 |pages=94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Mark |last2=Bargh |first2=John A. |date=1997 |title=Nonconscious Behavioral Confirmation Processes: The Self-Fulfilling Consequences of Automatic Stereotype Activation |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=541–560 |doi=10.1006/jesp.1997.1329 |url= http://www.yale.edu/acmelab/articles/Chen_Bargh_1997.pdf |access-date=5 April 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130522080900/http://www.yale.edu/acmelab/articles/Chen_Bargh_1997.pdf |archive-date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word, [[Mark Zanna|Zanna]], and Cooper (1974) demonstrated the effects of stereotypes in the context of a [[job interview]]. White participants interviewed black and white subjects who, prior to the experiments, had been trained to act in a standardized manner. Analysis of the videotaped interviews showed that black job applicants were treated differently: They received shorter amounts of interview time and less eye contact; interviewers made more speech errors (e.g., [[Stuttering|stutters]], sentence incompletions, incoherent sounds) and physically distanced themselves from black applicants. In a second experiment, trained interviewers were instructed to treat applicants, all of whom were white, like the whites or blacks had been treated in the first experiment. As a result, applicants treated like the blacks of the first experiment behaved in a more nervous manner and received more negative performance ratings than interviewees receiving the treatment previously afforded to whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Word |first1=Carl O. |last2=Zanna |first2=Mark P. |last3=Cooper |first3=Joel |date=1974 |title=The nonverbal mediation of self-fulfilling prophecies in interracial interaction |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=109–120 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(74)90059-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1977 study by Snyder, Tanke, and [[Ellen S. Berscheid|Berscheid]] found a similar pattern in social interactions between men and women. Male [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate students]] were asked to talk to female undergraduates, whom they believed to be [[Physical attractiveness|physically attractive]] or unattractive, on the phone. The conversations were taped and analysis showed that men who thought that they were talking to an attractive woman communicated in a more positive and friendlier manner than men who believed that they were talking to unattractive women. This altered the women's behavior: Female subjects who, unknowingly to them, were perceived to be physically attractive behaved in a friendly, likeable, and sociable manner in comparison with subjects who were regarded as unattractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snyder |first1=Mark |last2=Tanke |first2=Elizabeth D. |last3=Berscheid |first3=Ellen |date=1977 |title=Social perception and interpersonal behavior: On the self-fulfilling nature of social stereotypes |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=656–666 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.656 |url= http://jefferson.library.millersville.edu/reserve/COMM301_Paul_SocialPerception.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120617031954/http://jefferson.library.millersville.edu/reserve/COMM301_Paul_SocialPerception.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study by J. Thomas Kellow and Brett D. Jones looked at the effects of self-fulfilling prophecy on African American and Caucasian high school freshman students. Both white and black students were informed that their test performance would be predictive of their performance on a statewide, high stakes [[standardized test]]. They were also told that historically, white students had outperformed black students on the test. This knowledge created a self-fulfilling prophecy in both the white and black students, where the white students scored statistically significantly higher than the African American students on the test. The [[stereotype threat]] of underperforming on standardized tests affected the African American students in this study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kellow |first=Thomas |date=February 2008 |title=The Effects of Stereotypes on the Achievement Gap: Reexamining the Academic Performance of African American High School Students |journal=Journal of Black Psychology |volume=34 |pages=94–120 |doi=10.1177/0095798407310537 |citeseerx=10.1.1.553.9188 |s2cid=145490359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes can cause [[Racism|racist]] prejudice. For example, scientists and activists have warned that the use of the stereotype "Nigerian Prince" for referring to [[Advance-fee scam]]mers is racist, i.e. "reducing [[Nigeria]] to a nation of scammers and fraudulent princes, as some people still do online, is a stereotype that needs to be called out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yékú |first=James |date=9 September 2020 |title=Anti-Afropolitan ethics and the performative politics of online scambaiting |url= https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02533952.2020.1813943 |journal=Social Dynamics |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=240–258 |doi=10.1080/02533952.2020.1813943 |s2cid=222232833 |issn=0253-3952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-stereotyping ===
{{Main|Self-stereotyping}}
Stereotypes can affect self-evaluations and lead to self-stereotyping.&lt;ref name="Cox et al.

(2006) has shown that Asian American women rated their math ability more favorably when their ethnicity and the relevant stereotype that Asian Americans excel in math was made salient. In contrast, they rated their math ability less favorably when their gender and the corresponding stereotype of women's inferior math skills was made salient. Sinclair et al. found, however, that the effect of stereotypes on self-evaluations is [[Mediation (statistics)|mediated]] by the degree to which close people in someone's life endorse these stereotypes. People's self-stereotyping can increase or decrease depending on whether close others view them in stereotype-consistent or inconsistent manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sinclair |first1=Stacey |last2=Hardin |first2=Curtis D. |last3=Lowery |first3=Brian S. |title=Self-Stereotyping in the Context of Multiple Social Identities |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=2006 |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=529–542 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.4.529 |url= http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/sinclair/pubs/self%20stereo%20and%20multiple%20identities.PDF |pmid=16649853 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140827125537/http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/sinclair/pubs/self%20stereo%20and%20multiple%20identities.PDF |archive-date=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotyping can also play a central role in depression, when people have negative self-stereotypes about themselves. According to [[William T. L. Cox|Cox]], [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012).,&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)" /&gt; stereotyping can also play a central role in depression, which is characterized by negative [[self-schema]]s. Stereotypes and self-schemas are the same type of cognitive structure, therefore, they suggest that an integrated perspective of prejudice and depression provides useful insight on how stereotypes are acquired. Negative stereotypes are set in motion within the Source, who conveys the prejudice towards the Target, which in turn will lead the Target to suffer from depression. Members of stigmatized groups may internalize the negative evaluation of their group and develop depression. People may also show prejudice internalization through self-stereotyping because of negative childhood experiences such as verbal and physical abuse. This depression that is caused by prejudice (i.e., "deprejudice") can be related to group membership (e.g., Me–Gay–Bad) or not (e.g., Me–Bad). If someone holds prejudicial beliefs about a stigmatized group and then becomes a member of that group, they may internalize their prejudice and develop depression. People may also show prejudice internalization through self-stereotyping because of negative childhood experiences such as verbal and physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sachs |first1=Nicole M. |last2=Veysey |first2=Bonita M. |last3=Rivera |first3=Luis M. |date=14 November 2017 |title=Implicit Social Cognitive Processes Underlying Victim Self and Identity: Evidence With College-Aged Adults |journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence |volume=36 |issue=3–4 |pages=1256–1282 |doi=10.1177/0886260517741625 |pmid=29294984 |s2cid=206565963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substitute for observations ===
Stereotypes are traditional and familiar symbol clusters, expressing a more or less complex idea in a convenient way. They are often simplistic pronouncements about gender, racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds and they can become a source of misinformation and delusion. For example, in a school when students are confronted with the task of writing a theme, they think in terms of literary associations, often using stereotypes picked up from books, films, and magazines that they have read or viewed.

The danger in stereotyping lies not in its existence, but in the fact that it can become a substitute for observation and a misinterpretation of a [[cultural identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hayakawa |first=S. I. |date=1950 |jstor=42581302 |journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=208–210 |title=Recognizing Stereotypes as Substitutes for Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; Promoting [[information literacy]] is a pedagogical approach that can effectively combat the entrenchment of stereotypes. The necessity for using information literacy to separate multicultural "fact from fiction" is well illustrated with examples from literature and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Rhonda Harris |last2=Patterson |first2=Lotsee |title=Using information literacy to promote critical thinking |journal=Teacher Librarian |volume=28 |issue=2 |date=December 2000 |pages=9–14 |oclc=425340563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in art and culture==

Stereotypes are common in various cultural media, where they take the form of dramatic [[stock character]]s. The instantly recognizable nature of stereotypes mean that they are effective in advertising and situation comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://tedb.byu.edu/?page_id=35 |title=Lesson 2 – Stock Characters {{!}} BYU Theatre Education Database|website=tedb.byu.edu|access-date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Fedorov (2015) proposed a concept of media stereotypes analysis. This concept refers to identification and analysis of stereotypical images of people, ideas, events, stories, themes, etc. in media context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fedorov |first=Alexander |title=Media Stereotypes Analysis in the Classroom at the Student Audience |journal=European Journal of Contemporary Education |date=2015 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=158–162 |doi=10.13187/ejced.2015.12.158 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characters that do appear in movies greatly affect how people worldwide perceive gender relations, race, and cultural communities. Because approximately 85% of worldwide ticket sales are directed toward Hollywood movies, the American movie industry has been greatly responsible for portraying characters of different cultures and diversity to fit into stereotypical categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lee |first=Kevin |date=January 2008 |title='The Little State Department': Hollywood and the MPAA's Influence on U.S. Trade Relations |url= https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1671&amp;context=njilb |journal=Northwestern Journal of International Law &amp; Business |volume=28 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the spread and persistence of gender, racial, ethnic, and cultural stereotypes seen in the movies.&lt;sup&gt;[[Stereotype#cite note-89|[89]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

For example, [[Russians]] are usually portrayed as ruthless agents, brutal mobsters and villains in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will the cliche of the 'Russian baddie' ever leave our screens? |url= https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/10/will-cliche-russian-baddie-ever-leave-screens-james-norton-mcmafia |work=The Guardian |date=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/russian-film-industry-and-hollywood-uneasy-with-one-another/ Russian film industry and Hollywood uneasy with one another]."

Khrushcheva]], "You can't even turn the TV on and go to the movies without reference to Russians as horrible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hollywood stereotypes: Why are Russians the bad guys? |url= https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20141106-why-are-russians-always-bad-guys |work=BBC News |date=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The portrayals of Latin Americans in film and print media are restricted to a narrow set of characters. Latin Americans are largely depicted as sexualized figures such as the Latino [[Machismo|macho]] or the Latina vixen, [[gang]] members, (illegal) immigrants, or entertainers. By comparison, they are rarely portrayed as working professionals, business leaders or politicians.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

In [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood films]], there are several Latin American stereotypes that have historically been used. Some examples are El Bandido, the Halfbreed Harlot, The Male Buffoon, The Female Clown, The Latin Lover, The Dark Lady, The Wise Old Man, and The Poor Peon. Many Hispanic characters in Hollywood films consists of one or more of these basic stereotypes, but it has been rare to view Latin American actors representing characters outside of this stereotypical criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Berg |first=Charles |date=Summer 1990 |title=Stereotyping in films in general and of the Hispanic in Particular |journal=The Howard Journal of Communications |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=294–296 |doi=10.1080/10646179009359721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media stereotypes of women first emerged in the early 20th century. Various stereotypic depictions or "types" of women appeared in magazines, including Victorian ideals of femininity, the [[New Woman]], the [[Gibson Girl]], the [[femme fatale]], and the [[Flapper]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Stereotype#cite note-88|[88]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Coltrane |first1=Scott |last2=Adams |first2=Michele |date=April 1997 |title=Work–Family Imagery and Gender Stereotypes: Television and the Reproduction of Difference |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879196915754 |url-access=subscription |journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=323–347 |doi=10.1006/jvbe.1996.1575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes are also common in video games, with women being portrayed as stereotypes such as the "[[damsel in distress]]" or as [[sexual object]]s (see [[Gender representation in video games]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Mou |first1=Yi |last2=Peng |first2=Wei |date=January 2008 |chapter=Gender and Racial Stereotypes in Popular Video Games |chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314671823_Gender_and_Racial_Stereotypes_in_Popular_Video_Games |title=Handbook of Research on Effective Electronic Gaming in Education |location=Hershey, Pa. |publisher=Information Science Reference |doi=10.4018/9781599048086.ch053 |isbn=9781599048086 |oclc=755871149}} Book: {{Doi|10.4018/978-1-59904-808-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show that minorities are portrayed most often in stereotypical roles such as athletes and gangsters&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Burgess |first1=Melinda |last2=Dill |first2=Karen |date=15 September 2011 |title=Playing With Prejudice: The Prevalence and Consequences of Racial Stereotypes in Video Games |journal=Media Psychology |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=289–311 |doi=10.1080/15213269.2011.596467 |s2cid=1416833}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{crossreference|(see [[Race and video games]])}}.

In literature and art, stereotypes are [[cliché]]d or predictable characters or situations. Throughout history, storytellers have drawn from stereotypical characters and situations to immediately connect the audience with new tales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Auracher |first1=Jan |last2=Hirose |first2=Akiko |date=2017 |title=The Influence of Reader's Stereotypes on the Assessment of Fictional Characters |jstor=10.5325/complitstudies.54.4.0795 |journal=Comparative Literature Studies |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=795–823 |doi=10.5325/complitstudies.54.4.0795 |s2cid=148778808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in sports ===
Female athletes encounter various pressures and stereotypes, which have significant psychological consequences. These stereotypes give rise to challenges in athletes' lives, including diminished self-esteem, leading to more profound psychological impacts.

Female athletes have made considerable strides in overcoming obstacles. They have transitioned from being unable to compete competitively due to biological misconceptions to having equal opportunities as male athletes, thanks to Title IX.&lt;ref name="Wartel"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wartel |first=Jennifer |date=5 May 2021 |title=Stereotypes in Women's Sports and their Psychological Effects |url= https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2021/all/47 |journal=Academic Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there is greater societal acceptance of female athletes. However, the intersection of being a female athlete adds additional pressures. Not only are they expected to excel in competition, but they are also required to conform to societal expectations of femininity. Furthermore, female athletes often face scrutiny and criticism regarding their appearance compared to non-athletic women.

Young athletes, in particular, confront an intensified amount of pressure, leading some to quit sports because it is no longer enjoyable and the implications of being a young female athlete become overwhelming. They are unfairly labeled as gay or delicate and subjected to derogatory comments such as "like a girl." Additionally, they grapple with body image concerns that can give rise to severe health issues. Even specific sports contribute to the scrutiny female athletes face, with criticism directed at the uniforms required for competition.&lt;ref name="Wartel" /&gt;

The proliferation of stereotypes in women's sports has resulted in a decline in female participation. These social stigmas, including being labeled as gay or delicate, and the expectation to play in a manner deemed "like a girl," have contributed to body image issues, eating disorders, and depression among numerous female athletes.
