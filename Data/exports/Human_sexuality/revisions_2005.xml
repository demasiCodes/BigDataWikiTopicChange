:''This article is about the issues and phenomena pertaining to sexual function and behavior.  For information about sexual activities and practices (i.e., "doing it"), see the article [[human sexual behavior]].

Human sexuality refers to the expression of sexual sensation and related emotional intimacy between human beings, as well as the expression of identity through [[sex]] and as influenced by or based on [[sex]].  There are a great many forms of human sexuality.  The '''[[sexuality]] of [[human]] beings''' comprises a broad range of behavior and processes, including the [[physiology|physiological]], [[psychology|psychological]], social, [[culture|cultural]], [[politics|political]], and [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[religion|religious]] aspects of [[sex]] and [[Human sexual behavior|human sexual behavior]]. [[Philosophy]], particularly [[ethics]] and the study of [[morality]], as well as [[theology]], also address the subject. In almost any historical era or culture, the arts, including literary and visual arts, as well as popular culture, present a substantial portion of a given society's views on sexuality. In most societies and legal jurisdictions, there are [[law|legal]] bounds on what sexual behavior is permitted. Sexuality varies across the cultures and regions of the world, and has continually changed throughout history.

A large variety of books, educational websites, and local education/support/social organizations exist for various forms of sexuality.  Anyone who is unfamiliar with the techniques and safety practices commonly employed during sexual activities would be wise to seek out such sources of information before engaging in unfamiliar practices.  Having sex can be as dangerous as it is fun.

== Physiological aspects ==

Human sexuality can be influenced by hormonal changes in the development of the [[fetus]] during [[pregnancy]]. Some claim its manner of expression is largely due to genetic predisposition. Others say it is due to one's own personal experimentation in early life, and thus the establishment of preferences. A less divisive approach recognises that both factors may have a mutual role to play.  [[Human physiology]] and gender makes certain forms of sexual expression possible.

== Social aspects ==

Human sexuality can also be understood as part of the social life of humans, governed by implied rules of behavior and the [[status quo]].  Thus, it is claimed, sexuality influences social [[norms]] and society in turn influences the manner in which sexuality can be expressed. Since the invention of the [[mass media]], such as advertising, sexuality has further molded some environments in which we live.  Some see sexuality as distilled (often into [[stereotypes]]) and then repeatedly expressed in commercialized forms.
 
Human sexuality is distinguished from [[Gender identity|gender identity]].  Gender identity includes the social environment that one is exposed to in childhood and adulthood, e.g. media may portray a little boy playing with a toy truck, and a girl a doll.

==Society and politics==
===Sex education===
[[Sex education]] is the component of education, typically pre-university/college level, which involves instruction in the health aspects of sexual functions and behavior. All, or nearly all, governments and societies today advocate some degree of sex education. In most educational systems, it reflects the dominant views on sexual behavior, typically attempting to achieve some kind of compliance with the policies of the educational authority, such as the use or non-use of contraception or views on non-marital/pre-marital intercourse.

== Cultural and psychiatric aspects ==

[[Human sexual behavior]] in most individuals is typically influenced, if not largely determined, by [[norms]] from the culture in which the individual lives. Examples of such norms are prohibitions on sexual intercourse before [[marriage]], or against [[anal intercourse]], or other activities, because the [[religion]] to which the individual's culture adheres forbids such activities. 

Those who wish to express a dissident sexuality often form [[sub-culture|sub-cultures]] within the main culture.  In many cases, forms of sexuality may develop into a [[fetish]] or develop into a psychiatric disorder ([[paraphilia]]). Paraphilias can also result from childhood abuse or mistreatment.
