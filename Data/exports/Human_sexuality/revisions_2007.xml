As [[Michel Foucault]] wrote in ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', the concept of what activities and sensations are "sexual" is historically (as well as regionally and culturally) determined, and it is therefore part of a changing "discourse".&lt;ref name="Ross81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foucault76"&gt;[[Michel Foucault|Foucault, M.]] (1976) ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', ''Vol I: [[The Will to Knowledge]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rathusp21"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MARY WEISMANTEL ''[http://www.anthrosource.net/doi/abs/10.1525/aa.2004.106.3.495 Moche Sex Pots: Reproduction and Temporality in Ancient South America]'' [[American Anthropologist]] September 2004, Vol. 106, No. 3, pp. 495-505 &lt;/ref&gt; The [[sexual meanings]] (meanings of the erotic dimension of human sexual experience), are [[social and cultural constructs]], they are made subjective only after cultural and social mediation.&lt;ref name="Parker89"&gt;Parker, Richard G. ''[Bodies and Pleasures: On the Construction of Erotic Meanings in Contemporary Brazil]'' Anthropology &amp; Humanism Quarterly. June 1989, Vol. 14, No. 2, pp. 58-64&lt;/ref&gt; Being the main force conditioning human relationship, sex is essentially [[political]]. In any social context, the construction of a "sexual universe" is fundamentally linked to the structures of power.&lt;ref name="Parker89"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gayle Rubin]] (1984) ''Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of  Sexuality''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toward a Conversation about Sex in Feminism: A Modest Proposal
[http://www.sms.mailman.columbia.edu/faculty/vance.html Vance, Carole S.] ''[Pleasure and danger: Toward a politics of sexuality]''&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of sexual meanings, is an instrument by which social institutions (religion, marketing, the educational system, psychiatry, etc.) control and shape human relationships.&lt;ref name="Weeks85"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Jeffrey Weeks (sociologist)|Weeks, Jeffrey]] |title=Sexuality and its Discontents; Meanings, Myths, and Modern Sexualities |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year= |pages= |isbn=0-415-04503-7 |oclc= |doi=|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QzkTiK9oQVIC}} pp.176-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foucault76"/&gt;

According to Foucault, sexuality began to be regarded as a concept part of human nature since the 19th century; so sexuality began to be used as a mean to define [[normality]] and its boundaries, and to conceive everything outside those boundaries in the realm of [[psychopathology]]. In the 20th century, with the theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and of [[sexology]], the "not-normal" was seen more as a "discontent of civilization" &lt;ref name="Cáceres2000"&gt;Cáceres ''The production of knowledge on sexuality in the AIDS era.''in {{cite book |author=Aggleton, Peter; Parker, Richard Bordeaux; Barbosa, Regina Maria |title=Framing the sexual subject: the politics of gender, sexuality, and power |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-520-21838-8 |oclc= |doi=}} pp.242-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foucault76"/&gt; In a well known passage of his work, Foucault noted that the development of the notion of sexuality organized [[sex]] as a "[[fictitious unity]]" of "disparate parts, functions, behaviours, and feelings with no natural or necessary relation among them"; therefore the conception of what is "natural" is a [[social construct]].&lt;ref name="Strozier"&gt;Strozier, Robert M. (2002) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=fuDdNSLXPI8C Foucault, Subjectivity, and Identity: : Historical Constructions of Subject and Self]'' pp.101-2, 108, 118-120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1976, p.154-5&lt;/ref&gt; To escape this cultural "sexuality" Foucault suggest to focus on "bodies and pleasures".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1976, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strozier"/&gt;

In many historical eras, recovered art and artifacts help to portray human sexuality of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rathus|Nevid|Fichner-Rathus|Herold|McKenzie|2005|pp=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological aspects ==

The biology of human sexuality examines the influence of biological factors, such as organic and neurological response,&lt;ref name="Ross81"&gt;Ellen Ross, Rayna Rapp ''[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0010-4175%28198101%2923%3A1%3C51%3ASASARN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-B Sex and Society: A Research Note from Social History and Anthropology]'' Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Jan., 1981), pp. 51-72&lt;/ref&gt; [[heredity]], [[hormones]], and [[sexual dysfunction]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rathus|Nevid|Fichner-Rathus|Herold|McKenzie|2005|pp=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; it examines the basic functions of reproduction and the physical means to carry it out. The biological perspective helps to analyze the factors, and ultimately aids in understanding them and using them to deal with sexual problems.

Sexual behavior can be a [[disease vector]]. [[Safe sex]] is a relevant [[harm reduction]] philosophy. [[Monogamy]] is also espoused, however, practicing safe sex with many committed partners, referred to as [[serial monogamy]] or [[polygamy]], is not as safe, particularly among adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Sociocultural aspects ==

Human sexuality can also be understood as part of the social life of humans, governed by implied rules of behavior and the [[status quo]]. This focus narrows the view to groups within a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rathus|Nevid|Fichner-Rathus|Herold|McKenzie|2005|pp=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociocultural aspect examines influences on and from [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]], including mediums such as politics and the [[mass media]]. These sorts of mediums can help to bring about massive changes in the social norm &amp;mdash; examples include the [[sexual revolution]] and the rise of [[feminism]].

The link between constructed [[sex meanings]] and [[racial ideologies]] has been studied. Sexual meanings are constructed to maintain racial-ethnic-national boundaries, by denigration of "[[others]]" and regulation of [[sexual behavior]] within the [[group]]. "Both [[adherence]] to and [[deviation]] from such [[approved behaviours]], define and reinforce racial, ethnic, and [[nationalist]] regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Joane Nagel ''[http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.107 ETHNICITY AND SEXUALITY]'' Annual Review of Sociology Vol. 26: 107-133 (August 2000) (doi:10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.107)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joane Nagel ''[http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/si.2001.24.2.123 Racial, Ethnic, and National Boundaries: Sexual Intersections and Symbolic Interactions]'' Symbolic Interaction&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex education ===
{{Main|Sex education}}
[[Sex education]] is the introduction of sexual topics within an educational context. Almost all western countries have some form of sex education, but the nature varies widely. In some countries (such as Australia and much of Europe) "age-appropriate" sex education often begins in pre-school, whereas other countries (notably the USA) leave sex education to the teenage years and even the late teenage years. Sex education covers a range of topics, including the physical, mental, and social aspects of sexual behavior.

== Psychological aspects ==

The psychological study of sexuality focuses on psychological influences that affect sexual behavior and experiences.&lt;ref name="Rathusp21"&gt;{{Harv|Rathus|Nevid|Fichner-Rathus|Herold|McKenzie|2005|pp=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early psychological analyses were carried out by [[Sigmund Freud]], who believed in a [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] point of view. He also conjectured the concepts of [[erogenous zone]]s, [[psychosexual development]], and the [[Oedipus complex]], among others. 

[[Behaviorism|Behavior theorists]] such as [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]] examine the actions and consequences and their ramifications. These theorists would, for example, study a child who is punished for sexual exploration and see if they grow up to associate negative feelings with sex in general. [[Social cognitivism|Social-learning theorists]] use similar concepts, but focus on cognitive activity and [[Mental model|modeling]].

[[Gender identity]] is a specific psychological aspect of human sexuality that can be affected by the  social environment.

== Sexual activity and lifestyles==
===Heterosexuality===
Heterosexuality involves two individuals of different [[sex]]es.

Different-sex sexual practices are limited by laws in many places. United States marriage laws may serve the purpose of encouraging people to only have sex (and children) within marriage. [[Sodomy]] laws were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing [[sexual abuse]], committing sexual acts with anyone under an age of consent, performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money ([[prostitution]]). Though these laws all cover same-sex sexual activities, they may differ with regards to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities. Laws also control the making and viewing of [[pornography]], including pornography which portrays different-sex sexual activities.

[[Courtship]], or dating, is the process through which some people choose potential sexual and/or marital partners. Among straight (presumably [[middle class]]) teenagers and adolescents in the mid-[[20th century]] in America, ''dating'' was something one could do with multiple people before choosing to "go steady" with only one, the eventual goal being either sex, marriage, or both. More recently ''dating'' has become what ''going steady'' was and the latter term has fallen into disuse.

Different-sex sexual practices may be [[monogamy|monogamous]], serially monogamous, or [[Polyamory|polyamorous]], and, depending on the definition of sexual practice, [[abstinence|abstinent]] or [[Autosexuality|autoerotic]] (including [[masturbation]]).

Different moral and political movements have waged for changes in different-sex sexual practices including courting and marriage, though in all countries, changes are usually made only at a slow rate. Especially in the [[USA]], campaigns have often sparked and been fueled by [[moral panic]]. There, movements to discourage same-sex sexual practices often claim to be strengthening different-sex sexual practices within marriage, such as [[Defense of Marriage Act]] and the proposed [[Federal Marriage Amendment]].

===Homosexuality===

{{main|Homosexuality}}
Same-sex sexuality involves two individuals of the same sex. It is possible for a person whose  sexual identity is heterosexual to get involved in sexual acts with people of the same sex, for example, [[mutual masturbation]] in the context of what may be considered "normal" heterosexual teen development.  Homosexual people who pretend to lead a life of heterosexuality are often referred to as living "closeted" lives, that is, they hide their sexuality in "[[the closet]]".  The term "closet case" is a derogatory term used to refer to another homosexual that hides his or her homosexuality or bisexuality, and "[[coming out]]" or "[[outing]]" refer to making that orientation (semi-) public voluntarily, or as an action by others, respectively.

The definition of [[homosexuality]] is a sexual attraction to members of one's own sex, though people who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as [[gay]] or [[lesbian]].  However, the degree of attraction complies with the varying levels of frequency, willingness, and/or interest.  In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek sex with others of their own sex (known as [[situational homosexuality]]).  In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (and/or different) sex sexual activity before defining their [[sexual identity]]. Health campaigns and officials often seek to target self-identified "straight" or bisexual [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) as opposed to self-identified "gay" or ''homosexual'' men.

Despite stereotypes and common misconceptions, there are no forms of sexual activity exclusive to same-sex sexual behavior that can not also be found in opposite-sex sexual behavior, save those involving contact of the same sex genitalia such as [[tribadism]] and [[frot]].

Among some communities (called "men on the DL" or "[[down-low]]"), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. Men on the "down-low" may engage in regular (though often covert) sex acts with other men while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with women.

===Auto-erotic sexuality===
{{main|Autoeroticism}}

Autoeroticism is sexual activity that does not involve another person as partner. It can involve [[masturbation]], though several [[paraphilia]]s do not require a partner.

Though many autoerotic practices are relatively physically safe, some can be dangerous. These include [[autoerotic asphyxiation]] and [[self-bondage]]. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these [[fetishes]] ([[choking game|choking]] and [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], respectively) becomes drastically increased due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.

===Alternative sexuality===
A number of "alternative sexualities" exist. These are usually based upon individual choice. They range from the broadly accepted or tolerated, through to the highly controversial and illegal. 

Examples of these less common or alternative sexualities include [[BDSM]] activities where [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|dominance and submission]] activities are central features of sexual activity, through to [[zoosexuality]] where there is human-animal sexual activity.

===Coercive and abusive sexuality===
{{main|Sexual abuse}}
Sexual activity can also encompass sexual abuse - that is, coercive or abusive use of sexuality. Examples include: [[rape]], [[lust murder]], [[child sexual abuse]], and [[zoosadism]] (animal abuse which may be sexual in nature), as well as (in many countries) certain non-consensual paraphilias such as [[frotteurism]], [[telephone scatophilia]] (indecent phonecalls), and non-consensual [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]] (known as "[[indecent exposure]]" and "[[peeping tom]]" respectively).

== Study of sexuality ==

In contemporary academia, sexuality is studied in the fields of [[sexology]] and [[gender and sexuality studies]], among many other fields.
