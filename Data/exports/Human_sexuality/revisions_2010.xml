'''Human sexuality''' is how people experience the erotic and express themselves as sexual beings. Human sexuality plays a major role in everyone's life. Regardless, whether we are young or old, man or woman, American or Japanese, it is an integral part of what we do and who we are. There has been much done by way of research and scholarly writing examining human sexuality (e.g., Abramson &amp; Pinkerton, 1995; Beach, 1976; Diamond, 1997; Reinisch et al., 1990; Stalcup, 1995; Tiefer, 1995). This article will explore the topic of human sexuality as a motivation. Of course, there are many emotions associated with human sexuality, but the primary aim of this particular article will be a general overview of sexuality with special attention to the various perspectives, including the: 1) biological perspective, 2) cognitive perspective, and 3) learning perspective. All the while, the lens through which we summarize these perspectives will be with the understanding that human sexual behavior is a motivation. Next to sleeping and eating, it seems that it is one of the most important drives we have to deal with as humans. That is, it takes up so much of our time in thought and behavior that it sometimes seems that every facet of our life revolves around this to a certain extent.

Human sexual behavior is different from the sexual behavior of other animals, in that, it seems to be governed by a variety and interplay of different factors. That is, while "lower" animals or species are driven by a "force" to reproduce and therefore partake in sexual behavior, humans (and some other species such as [[bonobo]]s) are not sexually active just for the sake of reproduction, rather, there are a variety of complex factors that lead people to have sex.

The term can also cover [[Culture|cultural]], [[Politics|political]], [[Law|legal]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] aspects. It may also refer to issues of [[morality]], [[ethics]], [[theology]], [[spirituality]] or [[religion]] and how they relate to all things sexual.

==Nature vs nurture debate==
Recent studies on human sexuality have highlighted that sexual aspects are of major importance in building up [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]] and in the [[social evolution]] of individuals:&lt;ref&gt;Boccadoro L., Carulli S., (2008) ''Il posto dell'amore negato. Sessualità e psicopatologie segrete'' ([http://www.sexology.it/abstract_english.html The place of the denied love. Sexuality and secret psychopathologies – ''Abstract'']). Tecnoprint Editrice, Ancona. ISBN 978-88-95554-03-7&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Human sexuality is not simply imposed by instinct or stereotypical conducts, as it happens in animals, but it is influenced both by superior mental activity and by social, cultural, educational, and normative characteristics of those places where the subjects grow up and their personality develops. Consequently, the analysis of sexual sphere must be based on the convergence of several lines of development such as affectivity, emotions, and relations.}}

Deleuze and Guattari, in their 1972 ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'', discuss how sexuality is a powerful force that invests all social activities:&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari (1972) ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' pp. 322, 114–5&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|[[Familialism]] maintains that sexuality operates only in the family [...] the truth is that sexuality is everywhere: the way a bureaucrat fondles his records, a judge administers justice, a business causes money to circulate; the way the burgeoisie fucks the proletariat; and so on. And there is no need to resort to metaphors, any more than for the libido to go by way of metamorphoses. }}

==Biology and physiology==
{{See also|Sexual intercourse#Health benefits}}
The biological aspects of human sexuality deal with [[human reproduction]] and the physical means with which to carry it out. They also deal with the influence of biological factors on other aspects of sexuality, such as [[sexual arousal|organic and neurological responses]],&lt;ref name="Ross81"&gt;Ellen Ross, Rayna Rapp ''[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0010-4175%28198101%2923%3A1%3C51%3ASASARN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-B Sex and Society: A Research Note from Social History and Anthropology]'' Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Jan., 1981), pp. 51–72&lt;/ref&gt; [[heredity]], [[hormones|hormonal issues]], [[gender]] issues and [[sexual dysfunction]].&lt;ref name="Rathus2007"&gt;Rathus, Spencer A., Jeffrey S.

===Benefits===
Apart from the possibility of its resulting in successful [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]], sex has a wide range of health benefits including relief from [[Stress (biology)|stress]], more immunity through increased [[antibody|immunoglobulin A]], reduced risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and of [[prostate cancer]], and sounder [[sleep]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/10-surprising-health-benefits-of-sex Kathleen Doheny: 10 Surprising Health Benefits of Sex.

==Sociocultural aspects==
[[File:Leffler - WomensLib1970 WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Second-wave feminism|Women's liberation]] demonstration, 1970]]
Human sexuality can also be understood as part of the [[social relation|social life]] of humans, governed by implied rules of behavior and the [[status quo]]. This focus narrows the view to groups within a society.&lt;ref name="Rathus2007"/&gt; The sociocultural aspect examines influences on and from [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]], including the effects of [[politics]] and the [[mass media]]. Such movements can help to bring about massive changes in the social norm&amp;nbsp;— examples include the [[sexual revolution]] and the rise of [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;.

The link between constructed [[sex meanings]] and racial ideologies has been studied. Sexual meanings are constructed to maintain racial-ethnic-national boundaries, by denigration of "others" and regulation of [[sexual behavior]] within the [[Group (sociology)|group]]. "Both adherence to and deviation from such approved behaviors, define and reinforce racial, ethnic, and [[nationalist]] regimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Joane Nagel | title=Ethnicity and Sexuality | journal=Annual Review of Sociology | volume=26 | pages=107–133 | date=August 2000 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Joane Nagel | title=Racial, Ethnic, and National Boundaries: Sexual Intersections and Symbolic Interactions | journal=Symbolic Interaction | doi=10.1525/si.2001.24.2.123 | year=2001 | volume=24 | issue=2 | pages=123–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age and manner in which children are informed of issues of sexuality is a matter of [[sex education]]. The school systems in almost all developed countries have some form of sex education, but the nature of the issues covered varies widely. In some countries (such as Australia and much of Europe) "age-appropriate" sex education often begins in pre-school, whereas other countries leave sex education to the pre-teenage and teenage years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/education-news/think-sex/2006/05/28/1148754861223.html Think Sex from TheAge.com.au.] Retrieved 11 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex education covers a range of topics, including the physical, mental, and social aspects of sexual behavior.

==Psychological aspects==
[[File:Sigmund en Anna.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Sigmund Freud]] with daughter Anna]]
Sexuality in humans generates profound emotional and psychological responses. Some theorists identify sexuality as the central source of human personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John Russon]] |title=Bearing Witness to Epiphany: Persons, Things, and the Nature of Erotic Life |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=978-1-4384-2504-7 |oclc= |doi=|url=http://www.amazon.com/Bearing-Witness-Epiphany-Contemporary-Continental/dp/143842504X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological studies of sexuality focus on psychological influences that affect sexual behavior and experiences.&lt;ref name="Rathus2007"/&gt; Early psychological analyses were carried out by [[Sigmund Freud]], who believed in a [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] approach. He also conjectured the concepts of [[erogenous zone]]s, [[psychosexual development]], and the [[Oedipus complex]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/ss/psychosexualdev.htm What is Psychosexual Development? Pschology from About.com.] Retrieved 12 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Behaviorism|Behavior theorists]] such as [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]] examine the actions and consequences and their ramifications. These theorists would, for example, study a child who is punished for sexual exploration and see if they grow up to associate negative feelings with sex in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essortment.com/all/bfskinner_rgjj.htm B. F. Skinner and behaviorism. From essortment.] Retrieved 12 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social cognitive theory|Social-learning theorists]] use similar concepts, but focus on cognitive activity and [[Mental model|modeling]].

[[Gender identity]] is a person's own sense of identification as female, male, both, neither, or somewhere in between. The [[social construction]] of gender has been discussed by a wide variety of scholars, [[Judith Butler]] notable among them. Recent contributions consider the influence of [[feminist theory]] and courtship research.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (2002) Human mating strategies. ''Samdunfsokonemen'', 4: 48–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, W. (1988) ''Why Men Are The Way They Are'', New York: Berkley Books&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual behavior==
[[File:Brigitte Bardot.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Brigitte Bardot]]: Famous for [[sex appeal]]]]
Human sexual behavior, driven by the desire for [[pleasure]], encompasses the [[flirting|search for a partner]] or partners, interactions between individuals, [[physical intimacy|physical]], [[emotional intimacy]], and sexual contact that may lead to [[foreplay]], [[masturbation]] and ultimately [[orgasm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likeitis.org/sex_print.html Sex. From Likeitis.org.] Retrieved 12 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual attraction===
[[Sexual attraction]] is an important aspect of the sexuality of the person being observed, as well as of the person observing. Each person determines the qualities that they find attractive, which vary from person to person. A person's [[sexual orientation]] has a significant influence on which qualities they will find attractive. The qualities that people can find sexually attractive may depend on the [[physical attraction|physical quality]], including both looks and movements of a person but can also be influenced by voice or smell as well as by [[individual]] preferences resulting from a variety of [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], and cultural factors.

===Creating a relationship===
[[File:Eugen de Blaas The Flirtation.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''The Flirt'', by [[Eugene de Blaas]]]]

People both consciously and subconsciously seek to attract others with whom they can form deeper relationships. This may be for [[companionship]], for [[procreation]], for an [[intimate relationship]], besides other possible purposes. This involves interactive processes whereby people find and attract potential partners, and maintain a relationship. These processes, which involve attracting a partner and maintaining sexual interest, can include:

*[[Flirting]] can be used to attract the sexual attention of another in order to encourage romance or sexual relations, and can involve [[body language]], conversation, joking or brief physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html SIRC Guide to Flirting. What Social Science can tell you about flirting and how to do it.] Retrieved 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Seduction]] is the process whereby one person deliberately enticing another to engage in some sort of [[human sexual behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Greene, Robert | authorlink=Robert Greene (author) | title=The Art of Seduction | publisher=[[Penguin Books]]| year=2003 | isbn=0-14-200119-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium of communication of sexual interest can be verbal or visual.
*[[Dating (activity)|Dating]] is the process of arranging meetings or outings with a potential partner with a view to investigating or enhancing their suitability for an [[Intimate relationship|intimate partnership]].
*The prospect of [[physical intimacy]] is at times the most effective means of sexual attraction, and can be by way of an expression of [[feeling]]s such as close [[friendship]] or [[love]], including [[holding hands]], [[hug]]ging, [[kiss]]ing, or [[petting|caressing]].

==Sexual morality==
{{Main|Religion and sexuality}}
Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc., which have sought to guide people's sexual activities and practices. However, the impact of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, despite most religions disapproving [[extramarital sex|extramarital sexual relations]], it has always been practiced, to a large extent due to lack of firm foundation and conviction in one's belief.

==Child sexuality==
In the past, children were often assumed not to have sexuality until later development. [[Sigmund Freud]] was one of the first researchers to take [[child sexuality]] seriously. While his ideas, such as [[psychosexual development]] and the [[Oedipus conflict]], have been rejected or labeled obsolete, acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was a milestone.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] also examined child sexuality in his [[Kinsey Reports]]. Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions. For example, they wonder where babies come from, they notice anatomical differences between males and females, and many engage in [[genital play]] (often mistaken for masturbation). Child sex play includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends.&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;Santrock, J.W. (2008). ''A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4''th''ed.).'' New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality in late adulthood==
Changes in sexual behavior occur with age and while humans in late adulthood may be impaired by infirmity, relationship needs such as closeness and sensuality remain. Aging produces changes in sexual performance. Men are more likely to experience these changes than women. For men, orgasms become less frequent and usually need more direct stimulation to produce an erection. One out of four men, ages 65 to 80, had severe problems getting or keeping erections and this percentage increased with men over 80 years of age. Yet, the use of drugs to treat [[erectile dysfunction]] increases the expectations of older adults to have sex. Despite medical complications and opinions that people in late adulthood should be asexual, many older adults continue to engage in sexual intercourse. The results of a recent interview study involving 3,000 adults 57 to 85 years of age have shown that health plays a role in the level of older adults' sexual activity. The percentage of sexually active older adults is higher for those that are in good health than those in poor health. Older women may be less sexually active due to outliving their partners or men's tendency to marry younger women. While older adults engage in sexual activity, intimacy and companionship tend to be more important than sex.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

==Sexuality in history==
{{Main|History of human sexuality}}
[[File:Wien NHM Venus von Willendorf.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The prehistoric [[Venus of Willendorf]]]]
Art and artifacts from past eras help to portray human perception of sexuality of the time.&lt;ref name="Rathus2007"/&gt;

===Ancient civilizations===
[[File:Min.jpg|right|thumb|120px|[[Min (god)|Min]]: the ancient Egyptian god of fertility]]
Many of the ancient civilisations provide evidence of developments in sexuality. In particular:
*[[Egypt]]: The couple [[Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum]], now buried in a joint [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth-dynasty]] (2498–2345 BC) era tomb in [[Saqqara]], [[Egypt]], are believed to be the oldest recorded same-sex couple in human history. The Ancient Egyptians related the cult of phallus with [[Osiris]]. When Osiris' body was cut in 13 pieces, Set scattered them all over Egypt and his wife [[Isis]] retrieved all of them except one, his penis, which was swallowed by a fish (see the [[Legend of Osiris and Isis]]). The phallus was a symbol of fertility, and the god [[Min (god)|Min]] was often depicted ''ithyphallic'' (with a penis).

*[[History of sex in India|India]]: Ancient texts from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] such as the [[Rig Veda|Vedas]] reveal moral perspectives on sexuality, marriage and fertility prayers. The epics of ancient India, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], possibly from as early as [[1400 BCE]], later influenced [[China|Chinese]], [[Japan]]ese, [[Tibet]]an and [[South East Asia]]n culture. They indicate that sex was considered a mutual duty between a married couple, but where sex was considered a private affair. The most publicly known sexual literature of India are the texts of the [[Kama Sutra|sixty-four arts]].
*[[Mesopotamia]]: In ancient Mesopotamia, [[Ishtar]] was the primary Goddess of life, men and women, nature and fertility, sex, sexual power and birth. Ishtar was also the goddess of war and weapons and any victory was celebrated in her temples with offerings of produce and money as well as through a feast and orgy of sex and intercourse with holy [[temple prostitute]]s.
*[[China]]: In the ''[[I Ching]]'' (The ''Book of Changes'', a Chinese classic text dealing with what would be in the West termed metaphysics), sexual intercourse is one of two fundamental models used to explain the world. Heaven is described as having sexual intercourse with Earth. The male lovers of early Chinese men of great political power are mentioned in one of the earliest great works of philosophy and literature, the ''[[Zhuang Zi]]''.
*[[Japan]]: In perhaps the earliest novel in the world, the ''[[Genji Monogatari]]'' (''[[Tale of Genji]]''), dating back to around the 11th century AD, eroticism is treated as a central part of the aesthetic life of members of the nobility.
*[[Greece]]: In ancient [[Greece]], the [[phallus]], often in the form of a [[herma]], was an object of worship as a symbol of fertility. One ancient Greek male idea of female sexuality was that women envied [[penis]]es of males. Wives were considered as commodity and instruments for bearing legitimate children. They had to compete sexually with [[eromenoi]], [[hetaera]]s and slaves in their own homes.
*[[Rome]]: Ancient Roman civilization included celebrations associated with human reproductive organs. Over time there emerged institutionalization of voluntary sex as well as prostitution. This resulted in a virtual sexual caste system in Roman civilization – different grades and degrees of sexual relationships. Apart from the legally wedded spouses, a number of males used to have [[Delicatue]], mistresses of wealthy and prominent men. The next were the Famosae, mostly the daughters and even wives of the wealthy families who enjoyed sex for its own sake. There was another class known as [[Lupae]], willing to have sexual union with anyone for a price. Copae were the serving girls in the taverns and inns and who did not mind being hired as bedmates for the night by travelers.

===Modern developments===
{{Main|Sexology}}

In contemporary academia, sexuality is studied in the fields of [[sexology]] and [[gender and sexuality studies]], among many other fields.

Sexology, the study of sexual interests, behavior, and function, covers [[sexual development]] and [[sexual relationship]]s including [[sexual intercourse]]. It also documents the sexualities of groups such as the disabled, children, and the [[geriatric sexology|elderly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/HISTORY.HTM Erwin J. Haeberle: A Brief History of Sexology. Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]. Retrieved 15 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Kinsey]] became interested in the different forms of sexual practices around 1933 when he developed the [[Kinsey Scale]], which ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 is exclusively heterosexual and 6 is exclusively homosexual. His [[Kinsey Reports]] starting with the publication of [[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]] in 1948 and [[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]] in 1953 contributed to the sexual revolution of the 1960s.
