: ''This article is about the issues and phenomena pertaining to human sexual function and behavior. For information about sexual activities and practices, see the article [[human sexual behavior]]. For information on animal sexuality see [[Animal sexuality]].
'''Human sexuality''' refers to the expression of sexual sensation and related intimacy between human beings, as well as the expression of identity through [[sex]] and as influenced by or based on sex. There are a great many forms of human sexuality ([[sexual function]]s). The '''sexuality of [[human]] beings''' comprises a broad range of behavior and processes, including the [[physiology | physiological]], [[psychology | psychological]], social, [[culture | cultural]], [[politics | political]], and [[spirituality | spiritual]] or [[religion | religious]] aspects of sex and [[human sexual behavior]]. [[Philosophy]], particularly [[ethics]] and the study of [[morality]], as well as [[theology]], also address the subject. In almost any historical era or culture, the arts, including literary and visual arts, as well as popular culture, present a substantial portion of a given society's views on sexuality. In most societies and legal jurisdictions, there are [[law | legal]] bounds on what sexual behavior is permitted. Sexuality varies across the cultures and regions of the world, and has continually changed throughout history.

A large variety of books, educational websites, and local education/support/social organizations exist for various forms of sexuality.

== Scope of human sexuality ==

The term ''human sexuality'' covers a very wide range including:

* The [[physiology]] (or actual [[biology]]) of human sexuality, and sexually-related aspects of how the [[human body | body]] works.
* Who and what others, people interact or are attracted to, sexually. ''([[Sexual orientation]])''
* How we see ourselves, which may differ from the physical form we have, ie, personal [[Gender identity | identity]]. ''([[Intersex]], [[transsexual]])
* How we come to choose the sexual choices we make. ''([[Environment, choice, and sexual orientation]])''
* How humans act in seeking [[sexual activity]], and with sexual partners, and the scope of sexually oriented behaviours. ''([[Human sexual behavior]])''
* The [[psychology | psychological]] significance of sex, which may be related to its [[emotion|emotional]] effects, its [[physiology|physiological]] effects, or tied up with other psychological aspects, such as [[Power (sociology)|power]], [[control]], or the need for [[security]].
* Sex and its relationship to social structure, thus sex within [[marriage]], [[religion]], [[morality]] and the [[law]].
* Arts and media [[depiction of sexuality]].
* [[Sex education]].
* Social [[norm]]s, [[tradition]]s and [[ritual]]s related to sexuality.
* Understanding of sexual activity outside those norms. ''(see [[Paraphilia]])''
* How [[society]] [[Criminal justice system | judges]] where lines are to be drawn, what constitutes unacceptable conduct, who is vulnerable to its [[sexual abuse | abuse]], and how they are protected or violators dealt with.
* Research into human sexuality. ''(such as the [[Kinsey Reports]])''
* [[Sexual positions]]

== Physiological aspects ==

Human sexuality can be influenced by hormonal changes in the development of the [[fetus]] during [[pregnancy]]. Some hypothesize that manner of expression is largely because of genetic predisposition. Others hypothesize it is because of personal experimentation in early life, and thus the establishment of preferences. A less divisive approach recognizes that both factors may have a mutual role to play. [[Human physiology]] and gender makes certain forms of sexual expression possible.

[[Sexual dysfunction]] addresses a variety of biological circumstances whereby human [[sexual function]] is impaired.  These manifestations can be in the form of [[libido]] diminution or performance limitations.  Both male and female can suffer from libido reduction, which can have roots in [[stress (medicine) | stress]], loss of intimacy, distraction or derive from other physiological conditions.

Performance limitations may most often affect the male in the form of [[erectile dysfunction]].  Causes of this may derive from various forms of disease pathology including [[cardiovascular disease]], which can reduce penile blood flow along with supply of blood to various parts of the body.  Moreover environmental stressors such as prolonged exposure to [[noise health effects | elevated sound levels]] or [[over-illumination]] can also induce cardiovascular changes especially if exposure is chronic.

== Social aspects ==

Human sexuality can also be understood as part of the social life of humans, governed by implied rules of behavior and the [[status quo]]. Thus, it is claimed, sexuality influences social [[norms]] and society in turn influences the manner in which sexuality can be expressed. Since the invention of the [[mass media]], things such as movies and advertising have given sexuality even more ability to shape the environments in which we live. Some see sexuality as distilled (often into [[stereotypes]]) and then repeatedly expressed in commercialized forms.

[[Gender identity]] is an aspect of human sexuality that can be affected by one's social environment, and differerent social environments can have specific attributes they associate with each sex, such as certain types of dress, colors, behaviors. A common example in Western media could be the portrayal of a little boy in blue shorts and a white T-shirt playing with a toy truck, while a girl is shown in a pink dress playing with a doll.

== Society and politics ==

=== Sex education ===

[[Sex education]] is the introduction of sexual topics within an educational context. Almost all western countries have some form of sex education, but the nature varies widely. In some countries (such as Australia and much of Europe) "age-appropriate" sex education often begins in pre-school, whereas other countries (notably the USA) leave sex education to the teenage years and even the late teenage years. Sex education covers a whole range of topics from "where do babies come from?" via the [[contraception]] versus [[abstinence]] debate to self-examination, signs of sexual diseases, and the social and psychological implications of sexual relationships.

== Cultural and psychiatric aspects ==

[[Human sexual behavior]] in most individuals is typically influenced, or heavily affected by [[norms]] from the culture in which the individual lives. Examples of such norms are prohibitions on [[sexual intercourse]] before [[marriage]], or against homosexual sexualities, or other activities, because the [[religion]] to which the individual's culture adheres forbids such activities (see [[taboo]]). Sometimes, if not most times, such culturally induced behaviors do not reflect the natural sexual inclinations of the individual.

Those who wish to express a dissident sexuality are often forced to form [[sub-culture]]s within the main culture due to various forms of oppression or repression. In other cases, forms of sexuality may develop into a [[Sexual fetishism | fetish]] or alternately develop as a form of psychiatric [[disorder]] or [[paraphilia]].

== Documentary films ==

* ''Filming Desire: A Journey Through Women's Film'', A film by Marie Mandy, 2000
* ''(Comedy)[[The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human]] (1999) Starring: David Hyde Pierce, Mackenzie Astin Director: Jeff Abugov
* "New Sex Now: Life's Ultimate Pleasure" (2002, New Sex Institute)
