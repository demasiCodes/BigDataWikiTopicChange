A '''gerontocracy''' is a form of [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] rule in which an entity is ruled by leaders who are significantly older than most of the adult population. Often the [[political]] structure is such that political power within the ruling class accumulates with age, so that the oldest hold the most power. Those holding the most power may not be in formal leadership positions, but often dominate those who are.

Gerontocracy's strength is seen as its stability, which can be more appropriate for institutions that teach principles that do not vary over time. In institutions that have to cope with rapid change, the decreased faculties of the aged can potentially be a handicap in providing effective leadership.

==Gerontocracy in various political systems==

Such a form of leadership is common in [[communist state]]s in which the length of one's service to the party is held to be the main qualification for leadership.  In the time of the [[Eight Immortals of Communist Party of China]], it was quipped, "the 80-year-olds are calling meetings of 70-year-olds to decide which 60-year-olds should retire".

Gerontocracy is also common in religious [[theocracy|theocratic]] states such as [[Iran]] ,in which leadership is concentrated in the hands of religious [[elder (religious)|elder]]s. Despite the age of the senior religious leaders, however, parliamentary candidates in Iran must be under 75.

Gerontocracy is also well-established in most western democracies. Legislators such as [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are disproportionately old, and positions of power within the legislatures - such as [[Chair (official)|chairmanships]] of various committees - being usually bestowed upon the [[seniority|more experienced]], that is, older, members of the legislature.

==Organizational examples==

Outside the political sphere, gerontocracy may be observed in other institutional hierarchies of various kinds. Generally the mark of a gerontocracy is the presence of a substantial number of [[septuagenarian]] or [[octogenarian]] leaders&amp;mdash;those younger than this are too young for the label to be appropriate, while those older than this have generally been too few to dominate the leadership in numbers. The rare [[centenarian]] who has retained a position of power is generally by far the oldest in the hierarchy.

Gerontocracy generally occurs as a phase in the development of an entity, rather than being part of it throughout its existence. Opposition to gerontocracy may cause weakening or elimination of this characteristic by instituting things like term limits or [[mandatory retirement age]]s.

Judges of the [[United States]] courts, for example, serve for life, but a system of incentives to retire at full pay after a given age and disqualification from leadership for those who fail to do so has been instituted. The [[International Olympic Committee]] instituted a mandatory retirement age in [[1965]], and [[Pope Paul VI]] removed the right of [[Roman Catholic]] Cardinals to vote for a new Pope once they reached the age of 80 (which was to limit the number of Cardinals that would vote for the new Pope, due to the proliferation of Cardinals that was occurring at the time and is continuing to occur.  It was not age discriminatory.).

On the other hand, gerontocracy may emerge in an institution not initially known for it. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] was founded by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], a 24-year-old man, who in [[1835]] constituted the first [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] with members ranging in age from 23 to 35. Once it was established that succession to the church presidency derived from longest tenure in an office held for life, the hierarchy aged markedly, and with the growth of the church the age at which officials were named to the highest bodies continued to rise. Six church presidents have held office past the age of 90, and as of [[2005]] the church is actively led by [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], a man who remembers the day his father replaced the family horse-wagon with a [[Ford Model T]].

==Impact of human longevity==

The increase in human [[longevity]] may change the definitions thereof, as ages formerly typified by [[senescence]] and survived to by a small proportion of the population are reached by larger numbers of healthier people. For this reason mandatory retirement ages may be raised or face increasing opposition. When [[Pope John Paul II]] was elected, about one tenth of the [[College of Cardinals]] was over 80, but as of the election of [[Pope Benedict XVI]], the proportion has surpassed one-third.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

==Fiction==
The science fiction novel ''[[Holy Fire (novel)|Holy Fire]]'' by [[Bruce Sterling]] deals with a future society, in which [[life expectancy]] has been expanded to more than two centuries by means of medicine and technology (see [[transhumanism]]) to the effect that the '''gerontocrats''' wield almost all [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[political power]]. [[Adolescent]]s and young (and by modern standards [[middle-aged]]) [[adults]] live as outsiders with virtually no access to wealth or [[Power (sociology)|power]].

This social projection [[invert]]s present-day [[ageism]] against seniors, as well as [[gerontophobia]].

In the fantasy series the ''[[The Wheel of Time|Wheel of Time]]'' by [[Robert Jordan]], The [[Kin]], a group of women that at some point failed to become [[Aes Sedai]], do not hold any value in the strength of someone in the [[One Power]], as opposed to Aes Sedai, and only defer to age.

In the [[Frederik Pohl]] novel ''[[Search the Sky]]'', the main character Ross, encounter's a planet with a geritocracy masquerading as a democracy. It uses phrases such as "Old Heads Are Wisest" and gives the population the right to choose who is oldest.
