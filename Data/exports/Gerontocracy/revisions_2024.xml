A '''gerontocracy''' is a form of rule in which an entity is ruled by leaders who are significantly older than most of the adult population. 

In many political structures, power within the ruling class accumulates with age, making the oldest individuals the holders of the most power. Those holding the most power may not be in formal leadership positions, but often dominate those who are. In a simplified definition, a gerontocracy is a society where leadership is reserved for elders.&lt;ref&gt;Maddox, G. L. (1987). ''The Encyclopedia of Aging'' (p. 284). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Although the idea of the elderly holding power exists in many cultures, the gerontocracy has its [[Western world|western]] roots in [[ancient Greece]]. [[Plato]] stated that "it is for the elder man to rule and for the younger to submit".&lt;ref&gt;Bytheway, B. (1995). ''Ageism'' (p. 45). Buckingham: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the ancient Greek gerontocracy can be seen in the [[city-state]] of [[Sparta]], which was ruled by a [[Gerousia]], a council made up of members who were at least 60 years old and who served for life.&lt;ref&gt;Palmore, E. B. (1999). ''Ageism: negative and positive'' (2nd ed., p. 39). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In political systems==
===China===
Between 1982 and 1992, the [[Central Advisory Commission]]'s power and authority often surpassed the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party]]. It was quipped, "the 80-year-olds are calling meetings of 70-year-olds to decide which 60-year-olds should retire",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2014-06-04 |title=Read TIME's 1989 cover story about the Tiananmen Square massacre |url=https://time.com/2822358/tiananmen-square-25th-anniversary/ |access-date=2024-03-25 |website=TIME |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission (China)|CMC chairman]] [[Deng Xiaoping]] did not retire until the age of 85.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} Also, before that, [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|CCP Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] died in office at the age of 82.

===Soviet Union===
[[File:Устинов и Брежнев.jpg|thumb|[[Leonid Brezhnev]] (then 72) and [[Dmitry Ustinov]] (then 71) at the 1979 Revolution Day Parade]]

In the [[Soviet Union]], gerontocracy became increasingly entrenched starting in the 1970s;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1970/07/06/archives/the-coming-change-of-generations-in-the-kremlin.html The Coming Change of Generations in the Kremlin], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 6 July 1970&lt;/ref&gt; it was prevalent in the country until at least 1985, when a more dynamic and younger, ambitious leadership headed by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] took power.&lt;ref&gt;Zwass, Adam.

During his last two years he was essentially a figurehead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerrold Post|Post, Jerrold M.]] ''Leaders and Their Followers in a Dangerous World'', p. 96. Cornell University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8014-4169-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His premier, [[Alexei Kosygin]], was 76 when he resigned in October 1980, by which time he was very ill and two months short of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Soviet Union: And Then There Was One | magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924497,00.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101125121814/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924497,00.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 25 November 2010 | access-date = 24 September 2024 | date = 3 November 1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the average [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] member — generally a young survivor of the [[Great Purge]] who rose to power in the 1930s and 1940s — was 70 years old (as opposed to 55 in 1952 and 61 in 1964), and by 1982, Brezhnev's minister of foreign affairs, [[Andrei Gromyko]]; his minister of defense, [[Dmitriy Ustinov]]; and his premier, [[Nikolai Tikhonov]] (who succeeded Kosygin), were all in their mid-to-late seventies.&lt;ref&gt;Kort, Michael.

Chernenko became the third Soviet leader to die in less than three years, and, upon being informed in the middle of the night of his death, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], who was seven months older than Chernenko and just over three years older than his predecessor Andropov, is reported to have remarked, "How am I supposed to get anyplace with the Russians if they keep dying on me?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author-link=Maureen Dowd | last=Dowd | first=Maureen | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/18/books/where-s-the-rest-of-him.html | title=Where's the Rest of Him? | newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=18 November 1990 | page=7:1 | access-date=10 December 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was replaced by his brother, [[Raúl Castro]], who was 89 years old at the time of his own retirement.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

===United States===
The observation of gerontocracy in the United States has been connected to broader themes of [[American decline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2020/06/americas-unhealthy-gerontocracy/|title=America's Unhealthy Gerontocracy|language=en|publisher=[[American Affairs]]|date=25 June 2020|access-date=21 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidency====

Many senior officials in Trump's administration, such as attorneys general [[Jeff Sessions]] and [[William Barr]], secretary of agriculture [[Sonny Perdue]], and secretary of commerce [[Wilbur Ross]], have been 70 or older.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

In the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]], Biden prevailed against Trump, setting a new age record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/06/politics/presidential-election-biden-trump-2020/index.html|title=Biden wins Pennsylvania, becoming the 46th president of the United States|language=en|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=7 November 2020|access-date=23 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biden was 78 when he was sworn in on January 20, 2021, making him the oldest person to be inaugurated president.

During his July 24, 2024 public address explaining the reasoning behind his withdrawal from the election, President Biden called for an end to America's gerontocracy by "passing the torch" to younger politicians, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2024-07-25 |title=Transcript: Biden's speech explaining why he withdrew from the 2024 presidential race |url=https://apnews.com/article/biden-speech-transcript-campaign-withdrawal-432dc25a5af4ddebf75d73bfcc0fa72a |access-date=2024-08-19 |website=AP News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2021, the average age of a senator was 64,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Manning |first1=Jennifer |title=Membership of the 117th Congress: A Profile |url=https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46705 |publisher=Congressional Research Service |access-date=25 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; and positions of power within the legislatures — such as chairmanships of various committees — are usually bestowed upon the [[seniority|more experienced]], that is, older, members of the legislature. [[Strom Thurmond]], a U.S. senator from [[South Carolina]], left office at age 100 after almost half a century in the body, while [[Robert Byrd]] of [[West Virginia]] was born in 1917 and served in the Senate from 1959 to his death in 2010 at age 92. Both Thurmond and Byrd had served as [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore of the Senate]], a position that is third in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]].

===Theocracy===
[[File:Ali Khamenei in 2020 Friday Prayer 014.jpg|thumb|Supreme Leader of Iran [[Ali Khamenei]] was 81 years old during this Friday service in 2020.]]
Gerontocracy is common in [[theocratic]] states and religious organizations such as [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in which leadership is concentrated in the hands of [[elder (Christianity)|religious elder]]s. Despite the age of the senior religious leaders, however, parliamentary candidates in Iran must be under 75. Nominally a theocratic monarchy, Saudi Arabia, likened to various late communist states, has been ruled by gerontocrats. Aged king Saud and his aged relatives held rule along with many elder clerics. They were in their eighties (born c. 1930).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/10/2011102673844479817.html|title=Saudi Arabia's old regime grows older|first=Mai|last=Yamani|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, power has become concentrated by [[Mohammed bin Salman]]–31 years old when he became [[crown prince of Saudi Arabia]] in 2017–who has sidelined powerful, older members of the Saudi family.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

===Stateless societies===
In Kenya, [[Samburu people|Samburu]] society is said to be a gerontocracy. The power of elders is linked to the belief in their curse, underpinning their monopoly over arranging marriages and taking on further wives. This is at the expense of unmarried younger men, whose development up to the age of thirty is in a state of social suspension, prolonging their adolescent status. The paradox of Samburu gerontocracy is that popular attention focuses on the glamour and deviant activities of these footloose bachelors, which extend to a form of gang warfare, widespread suspicions of adultery with the wives of older men, and theft of their stock.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Spencer, ''The Samburu: a Study of Gerontocracy in a Nomadic Tribe'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1965 {{ISBN|978-0-415-31725-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African societies such as this are known for their gerontocratic hierarchies. The [[Yoruba people]], for example, are led by titled elders known as [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]]s and [[Oloye]]s. Although not an explicit requirement, most of them are decidedly elderly due to a variety of factors.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

[[American Indian elder]]s and [[Australian Aboriginal elder]]s are traditional figures of wisdom and authority in many Native American and Aboriginal cultures.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

===Other countries===
The [[Roman Republic]] was originally an example; the word ''senate'' is related to the [[Latin]] word ''senex'', meaning "old man". [[Cicero]] wrote: "They wouldn't make use of running or jumping or spears from afar or swords up close, but rather wisdom, reasoning, and thought, which, if they weren't in old men, our ancestors wouldn't have called the highest council the senate."&lt;ref&gt;''Nec enim excursione nec saltu nec eminus hastis aut comminus gladiis uteretur, sed consilio, ratione, sententia; quae nisi essent in senibus, non-summum consilium maiores nostri appellassent senatum.'' [[De Senectute]], I.16&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]], the government headed by 87-year-old state chief minister [[M. Karunanidhi]] was another example of gerontocracy. In another Indian state, [[West Bengal]], [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPI(M)]] founder[[Jyoti Basu]] was 86 years old when he stepped down from the office of chief minister of the state after a record-setting 24 years of office, but he continued to remain a member of the [[Polit Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)|Polit Bureau]] until a few months before his death in 2010 and was consulted on all matters related to governance by [[Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee|his successor]] and his cabinet as well as his other party colleagues.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

Former Italian prime minister [[Mario Monti]] was 70 when he left office. His immediate predecessor, [[Silvio Berlusconi]], was 75 at the time of resignation in 2011. The previous head of the government [[Romano Prodi]] was nearly 69 when he stepped down in 2008. Italian president [[Sergio Mattarella]] is {{age|1941|7|23}}, while his predecessors [[Giorgio Napolitano]] and [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] were 89 and 85 respectively when they left office. This trend has been disrupted in recent years, with [[Matteo Renzi]] becoming prime minister at age 39 in 2014, and [[Giorgia Meloni]] assuming the office at age 45 in 2022.

Modern [[Japan]] has been described as a gerontocracy (or "silver democracy") and "generationally unjust, partially a product of the country's severely [[ageing population]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asiancenturyinstitute.com/society/980-japan-s-silver-democracy/|title=JAPAN'S SILVER DEMOCRACY|publisher=Asian Century Institute|date=5 October 2015|access-date=11 July 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Medieval England]], [[alderman|aldermen]] (literally "elder men") were local political leaders second to a mayor. The title is still used in some countries colonized by the [[British Empire]], such as the U.S., [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

During the 2010–2012 [[Arab Spring]], every state in North Africa which experienced a revolution had a leader in their late sixties or older: [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] of Tunisia was 74 when forced out; [[Hosni Mubarak]] of Egypt was 82 when forced out; and [[Muammar Gaddafi]] was 69 when [[Killing of Muammar Gaddafi|assassinated]]. Additionally, during the [[Second Arab Spring]] in North Africa and West Asia, [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] of Algeria was 82 when [[Hirak (Algeria)|forced out]]; [[Hani Mulki]] of Jordan was 66 when forced out; [[Adil Abdul-Mahdi]] of Iraq was 77 when forced out; and [[Omar al-Bashir]] of Sudan was 75 when deposed.

In [[Bangladesh]], prime minister [[Sheikh Hasina]] was 76 when she was ousted in the [[Non-cooperation movement (2024)|non-cooperation movement]]. In turn, [[Muhammad Yunus]] was 84 when he succeeded Hasina. Earlier Bangladeshi heads of state who left office in their 70s or higher include prime minister [[Ataur Rahman Khan]] (at 75) and president [[Iajuddin Ahmed]] (at 78, having also been [[Chief Adviser (Bangladesh)|Chief Adviser]] until age 76).

Outside the political sphere, gerontocracy may be observed in other institutional hierarchies of various kinds. Generally the mark of a gerontocracy is the presence of a substantial number of [[septuagenarian]] or [[octogenarian]] leaders—those younger than this are too young for the label to be appropriate, while those older than this have generally been too few in number to dominate the leadership. The rare [[centenarian]] who has retained a position of power is generally by far the oldest in the hierarchy.

Gerontocracy generally occurs as a phase in the development of an entity, rather than being part of it throughout its existence. Opposition to gerontocracy may cause weakening or elimination of this characteristic by instituting things like term limits or [[mandatory retirement age]]s.

Judges of the United States courts, for example, serve for life, but a system of incentives to retire at full pay after a given age and disqualification from leadership has been instituted. The [[International Olympic Committee]] instituted a mandatory retirement age in 1965, and [[Pope Paul VI]] removed the right of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]s to vote for a new [[pope]] once they reached the age of 80, which was to limit the number of cardinals that would vote for the new Pope, due to the proliferation of cardinals that was occurring at the time and is continuing to occur.

Gerontocracy may emerge in an institution not initially known for it.

American elites, some of whom feared a [[Bolshevik revolution]], consented to reform... Under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]... the U.S. raised taxes, took steps to protect [[labor union|union]]s, and established a [[minimum wage]]. The costs, [[Peter Turchin|[Peter] Turchin]] writes, 'were borne by the American [[ruling class]].'... Between the nineteen-thirties and the nineteen-seventies, a period that scholars call the [[Great Compression]], economic equality narrowed, except among Black Americans... But by the nineteen-eighties the Great Compression was over. As the rich grew richer than ever, they sought to turn their money into [[political power]]; spending on politics soared." (p. 22.) "[N]o democracy can function well if people are unwilling to lose power – if a generation of leaders... becomes so entrenched that it ages into gerontocracy; if one of two major parties denies the arithmetic of elections; if a cohort of the ruling class loses status that it once enjoyed and sets out to salvage it."
