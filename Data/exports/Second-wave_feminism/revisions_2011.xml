{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Waves}}

The "second-wave" of the '''Women's Movement''', '''Feminist Movement''', or the '''Women's Liberation Movement''' in the United States refers to a period of [[feminism|feminist]] activity which began during the early 1960s and lasted through the early 1990s.

Whereas [[first-wave feminism]] focused mainly on overturning legal obstacles to [[equality]] (i.e. [[Women's suffrage in the United States|voting rights]], [[property rights]]), second-wave feminism addressed a wide range of issues: [[de facto]] inequalities, official legal inequalities, sexuality, family, the workplace, and, perhaps most controversially, [[reproductive rights]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/647122/womens-movement&lt;/ref&gt; It also tried and failed to add the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. Many feminists view the second-wave feminist era as ending with the intra-feminism disputes of the [[Feminist Sex Wars]], over issues such as sexuality and [[pornography]].&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{Cite book | author=Duggan, Lisa; Hunter, Nan D. | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture| year=1995 | publisher=Routledge | location=New York  | isbn=0-415-91036-6 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{Cite book | author=Hansen, Karen Tranberg | coauthors= Philipson, Ilene J. | title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader | year=1990 | publisher=Temple University Press | location=Philadelphia  | isbn=0-87722-630-X | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{Cite book | author=Gerhard, Jane F. | title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 | year=2001 | publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York  | isbn=0-231-11204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{Cite book | author=Leidholdt, Dorchen | authorlink= Dorchen Leidholdt | coauthors=Raymond, Janice G | title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism | year=1990 | publisher=Pergamon Press | location=New York  | isbn=0-08-037457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{Cite book | author=Vance, Carole S | title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality | publisher=Thorsons Publishers| isbn=0-04-440593-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The second wave of feminism in North America came as a response to the experiences of women after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedan, Betty, ''The Feminine Mystique'' (N.Y.: W.W. Norton, 10th Anniversary ed. [2d printing?] 1974, 1963 (ISBN 0 393 08685 2)).&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1940s post-[[World War II|war]] boom, an era characterized by an unprecedented economic growth, a [[baby boom]], suburban expansion, and the triumph of [[capitalism]], encouraged patriarchal family life.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} This life was clearly illustrated by the media of the time; for example television shows such as ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' and ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' idealized domesticity, placing women in a closed sphere where they were only expected to fulfill the roles of housewives and mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Knuttila, Murray, 4th ed. 2008. ''Introducing Sociology: A Critical Approach''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not popularized until 20 years later, in her work ''[[The Second Sex]]'', [[Simone de Beauvoir]] examined as early as 1949 the notion of women being perceived as "other" in the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society. She went on to conclude that male-centered ideology was being accepted as a norm and enforced by the ongoing development of myths, and that the fact that women are capable of getting [[pregnant]], [[lactation|lactating]], and [[menstruation|menstruating]] is in no way a valid cause or explanation to place them as the "second sex".&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir, ''[[The Second Sex]]'', 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, in her bestselling book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', [[Betty Friedan]] explicitly objected to the mainstream media image of women, stating that placing women at home limited their possibilities, and wasted talent and potential. The perfect [[nuclear family]] image depicted and strongly marketed at the time, she wrote, did not reflect happiness and was rather degrading for women.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Cynthia Fuchs. 1988. ''Deceptive Distinctions: Sex, Gender, and the Social Order''. New Haven: Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; This book is widely credited with having begun second-wave feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/betty-friedan-465800.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Corinne | last=Sweet | title=Betty Friedan | date=February 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is widely accepted that the movement lasted from the 1960s into the late 1990s, the exact years of the movement are more difficult to pinpoint and are often disputed. The movement is usually believed to have begun in 1963, when "Mother of the Movement" [[Betty Friedan]] published her bestseller, ''The Feminine Mystique'' and President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] released its report on gender inequality. The report, which revealed great discrimination against women in American life, along with Friedan's book, which spoke to the discontent of many women (especially [[homemaker|housewives]]), led to the formation of many local, state, and federal government women's groups as well as many independent women's liberation organizations. Friedan was referencing a "movement" as early as 1964.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDZh3nY9clY&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement grew with legal victories such as the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and the ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling of 1965; in 1966 Friedan joined other women and men to found the [[National Organization for Women]].

Amongst the most significant legal victories of the movement after the formation of NOW were a 1967 Executive Order extending full [[Affirmative Action]] rights to women, [[Title IX]] and the [[Women's Educational Equity Act]] (1972 and 1974, respectively, educational equality), [[Title X]] (1970, health and family planning), the [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] (1974), the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978]], the illegalization of [[spousal rape|marital rape]] (although not illegalized in all states until 1993&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refugehouse.com/resources_marital_rape.html&lt;/ref&gt;), the legalization of [[no-fault divorce]] (although not allowed in all states until 2010 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.divorcenet.com/feed-item/no-fault-divorce-now-law-all-50-states&lt;/ref&gt;), a 1975 law requiring the U.S. Military Academies to admit women, and many Supreme Court cases, perhaps most notably ''[[Reed v. Reed]]'' of 1971 and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' of 1973. However, the changing of social attitudes towards women is usually considered the greatest success of the women's movement.

By the early 1980s, it was largely perceived that women had met their goals and succeeded in changing social attitudes towards gender roles, repealing oppressive laws that were based on sex, integrating the "boys' clubs" such as [[military academy|Military academies]], the [[United States armed forces]], [[NASA]], single-sex colleges, men's clubs, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], and illegalizing gender discrimination. However, in 1982 adding the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] failed, three states short of ratification.

Second-wave feminism was largely successful, with the failure of the ratification of the ERA the only major legislative defeat. Efforts to ratify it have continued, and twenty-one states now have ERAs in their state constitutions. Furthermore, many women's groups are still active and are major political forces. {{As of | 2011}}, more women earn [[bachelor's degree]]s than men,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mibn.org/site.php/snew/read/demographics_of_working_moms/&lt;/ref&gt; half of the [[Ivy League]] presidents are women, the numbers of women in government and traditionally male-dominated fields have dramatically increased, and in 2009 the percentage of women in the American workforce temporarily surpassed that of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/business/06women.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=women%20workforce&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=As Layoffs Surge, Women May Pass Men in Job Force | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | date=February 6, 2009 | accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salary of the average American woman has also increased over time, although as of 2008 it is only 77% of the average man's salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1983185,00.html | work=Time | first=Laura | last=Fitzpatrick | title=Why Do Women Still Earn Less Than Men? | date=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this is due to discrimination is very hotly disputed; feminist groups maintain that it is.

==View on popular culture==

Second-wave feminists viewed popular culture as sexist, and created pop culture of their own to counteract this. Artist [[Helen Reddy]]’s song “[[I Am Woman]]” played a large role in popular culture and became a feminist anthem; Reddy came to be known as a "feminist poster girl" or a "feminist icon." &lt;ref&gt;Arrow. Michelle. 2007. "It Has Become My Personal Anthem": “I Am Woman”, Popular Culture and 1970s Feminism. Australian Feminist Studies 22: 213-230.&lt;/ref&gt; “One project of second wave feminism was to create ‘positive’ images of women, to act as a counterweight to the dominant images circulating in popular culture and to raise women’s consciousness of their oppressions." (Arrow, Michelle. 2007).

==Education==
===Title IX===
{{Main|Title IX}}

===Coeducation===
One debate which developed in the [[United States]] during this time period revolved around the question of [[coeducation]]. Most [[men's colleges in the United States]] adopted coeducation, often by merging with [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's colleges]]. In addition, some women's colleges adopted coeducation, while others maintained a single-sex student body.

====Seven Sisters Colleges====
Two of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sister colleges]] made transitions during and after the 1960s. The first, [[Radcliffe College]], merged with [[Harvard University]]. Beginning in 1963, students at Radcliffe received Harvard diplomas signed by the presidents of Radcliffe and Harvard and joint commencement exercises began in 1970. The same year, several Harvard and Radcliffe dormitories began swapping students experimentally and in 1972 full co-residence was instituted. The departments of [[College athletics|athletics]] of both schools merged shortly thereafter. In 1977, Harvard and Radcliffe signed an agreement which put undergraduate women entirely in Harvard College. In 1999 Radcliffe College was dissolved and Harvard University assumed full responsibility over the affairs of female undergraduates. Radcliffe is now the ''Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study'' in [[women's studies|Women's Studies]] at Harvard University. 

The second, [[Vassar College]], declined an offer to merge with [[Yale University]] and instead became coeducational in 1969.

The remaining Seven Sisters decided against coeducation. [[Mount Holyoke College]] engaged in a lengthy debate under the presidency of [[David Truman]] over the issue of coeducation. On November 6, 1971, "after reviewing an exhaustive study on coeducation, the board of trustees decided unanimously that Mount Holyoke should remain a women's college, and a group of faculty was charged with recommending curricular changes that would support the decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/detailed.shtml|title=Mount Holyoke:A Detailed History|publisher=mtholyoke.edu|date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smith College]] also made a similar decision in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smith.edu/collegerelations/presidents.php|title=Smith Tradition|publisher=smith.edu|date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Bryn Mawr College]] and [[Haverford College]] (then all male) developed a system of sharing residential colleges. When Haverford became coeducational in 1980, Bryn Mawr discussed the possibly of coeducation as well, but decided against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/visit/history.shtml|title=A Brief history of Bryn Mawr College|publisher=brynmawr.edu|date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, [[Columbia University]] began admitting women after a decade of failed negotiations with [[Barnard College]] for a merger along the lines of Harvard and Radcliffe (Barnard has been affiliated with Columbia since 1900, but it continues to be independently governed). [[Wellesley College]] also decided against coeducation during this time.

====Mississippi University for Women====
In 1982, in a 5–4 decision, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan]]'' that the [[Mississippi University for Women]] would be in violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Equal Protection Clause]] if it denied admission to its nursing program on the basis of gender. Mississippi University for Women, the first [[Public university|public or government institution]] [[Women's colleges in the United States|for women in the United States]], changed its admissions policies and became coeducational after the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mississippi.edu/universities/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In what was her first opinion written for the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice Sandra Day O'Connor]] stated, "In limited circumstances, a gender-based classification favoring one sex can be justified if it intentionally and directly assists members of the sex that is disproportionately burdened."  She went on to point out that there are a disproportionate number of women who are nurses, and that denying admission to men "lends credibility to the old view that women, not men, should become nurses, and makes the assumption that nursing is a field for women a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]."&lt;ref&gt;"[[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan]]", 458 U.S. 718 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the dissenting opinions, Justices [[Harry A. Blackmun]], [[Warren E. Burger]], [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]], and [[William H. Rehnquist]] suggested that the result of this ruling would be the elimination of publicly supported single-sex educational opportunities. This suggestion has proven to be accurate as there are no public women's colleges in the United States today and, as a result of ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', the last all-male public university in the United States, Virginia Military Institute, was required to admit women. The ruling did not require the university to change its name to reflect its [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational status]] and it continues a tradition of academic and leadership development for women by providing [[liberal arts]] and professional education to women and men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muw.edu/pie/vision.html MUW - Planning and Institutional Effectiveness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mills College====
On May 3, 1990, the Trustees of [[Mills College]] announced that they had voted to admit male students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30610F73C540C778CDDAC0894D8494D81 |title=Venerable School for Women Is Going Co-ed|publisher=nytimes.com.com |date=1990-05-04|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision led to a two-week student and staff [[Strike action|strike]], accompanied by numerous displays of [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] protests by the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DE1738F936A35756C0A966958260 |title=Mills Students Protesting Admission of Men|publisher=nytimes.com.com |date=1990-05-05|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30616FC355E0C758CDDAC0894D8494D81 |title=Disbelieving and Defiant, Students Vow: No Men|publisher=nytimes.com.com |date=1990-05-06| first=Katherine | last=Bishop | accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, nearly 300 students blockaded the administrative offices and boycotted classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DE133EF93BA35756C0A966958260|title=Protest Continues at College Over Decision to Admit Men|publisher=nytimes.com.com |date=1990-05-08|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, the Trustees met again to reconsider the decision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DA1130F931A25756C0A966958260|title=College to Reconsider Decision to Admit Men|publisher=nytimes.com.com |date=1990-05-12|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading finally to a reversal of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30616F63C550C7A8DDDAC0894D8494D81|title=Women's College Rescinds Its Decision to Admit Men|publisher=nytimes.com.com |date=1990-05-19| first=Katherine | last=Bishop | accessdate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other colleges====
[[Pembroke College (Brown University)|Pembroke College]] merged with [[Brown University]]. [[Sarah Lawrence College]] declined an offer to merge with [[Princeton University]], becoming coeducational in 1969.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} [[Connecticut College]] also adopted coeducation during the late 1960s.
