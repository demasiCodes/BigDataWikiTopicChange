'''Second-wave feminism''' was a period of [[Feminism|feminist]] activity that began in the early 1960s and lasted roughly two decades, ending with the [[feminist sex wars]] in the early 1980s&lt;ref name="Douglas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Douglas |first=Carol Anne |title=Love and Politics: Radical Feminist and Lesbian Theories |date=July 1990 |publisher=ISM PRESS |isbn=9780910383172 |location=San Francisco, CA, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being replaced by [[third-wave feminism]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Stephanie |date=2004 |title=No Turning Back: The History of Feminism and the Future of Women, and: Tidal Wave: How Women Changed America at Century's End, and: Feminism in the Heartland (review) |journal=NWSA Journal |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=190–196 |doi=10.1353/nwsa.2004.0054 |issn=1527-1889 |s2cid=144734371}}&lt;/ref&gt; It occurred throughout the [[Western world]] and aimed to increase women's equality by building on the [[First-wave feminism|feminist gains of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.]]

Second-wave feminism built on [[first-wave feminism]] and broadened the scope of debate to include a wider range of issues: sexuality, family, domesticity, the workplace, [[reproductive rights]], ''de facto'' inequalities, and official legal inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=women's movement (political and social movement) |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/647122/womens-movement |access-date=July 20, 2012 |website=Britannica Online Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; First-wave feminism typically advocated for [[Equal opportunity#Formal equality of opportunity|formal equality]] and second-wave feminism advocated for [[substantive equality]].&lt;ref name="v819"&gt;{{cite book | last=Whelehan | first=Imelda | title=Modern Feminist Thought: From the Second Wave to 'Post-Feminism' | publisher=Edinburgh University Press | date=1 June 1995 | isbn=978-0-7486-3208-4 | doi=10.1515/9780748632084}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a movement focused on critiquing patriarchal or male-dominated institutions and cultural practices throughout society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pierceson, Jason, 1972- |title=Sexual minorities and politics : an introduction |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4422-2768-2 |location=Lanham, Maryland |oclc=913610005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second-wave feminism also brought attention to issues of [[domestic violence]] and [[marital rape]], created [[Rape crisis centre|rape crisis centers]] and [[women's shelter]]s, and brought about changes in custody law and divorce law.

Because white feminists' voices have dominated the narrative from the early days of the movement, typical narratives of second-wave feminism focus on the sexism encountered by white middle- and upper-class women, with the absence of black and other women of color and the experience of working-class women, although women of color wrote and founded feminist political activist groups throughout the movement, especially in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Thompson |first=Becky |title=2.

Writers like [[Audre Lorde]] argued that this homogenized vision of "sisterhood" could not lead to real change because it ignored factors of one's identity such as race, sexuality, age, and class.&lt;ref&gt;Lorde, Audre. 2000.

Mountain View, California: Mayfield.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[intersectionality]]" was  coined in 1989 by [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]] at the end of the second wave. Many scholars believe that the beginning of [[Third-wave feminism|third wave feminism]] was due to the problems of the second wave, rather than just another movement.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mann |first1=Susan Archer |last2=Huffman |first2=Douglas J. |date=2005 |title=The Decentering of Second Wave Feminism and the Rise of the Third Wave |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40404229 |journal=Science &amp; Society |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=56–91 |doi=10.1521/siso.69.1.56.56799 |issn=0036-8237 |jstor=40404229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview in the United States==
{{See also|Feminism in the United States#Second-wave feminism|Women's liberation movement in North America}}

The second wave of feminism in the United States came as a delayed reaction against the renewed domesticity of women after [[World War II]]: the late 1940s [[Post–World War II economic expansion|post-war boom]], which was an era characterized by an unprecedented economic growth, a [[baby boom]], a move to family-oriented suburbs and the ideal of companionate marriages. During this time, women did not tend to seek employment due to their engagement with domestic and household duties, which was seen as their primary duty but often left them isolated within the home and estranged from politics, economics, and law making. This life was clearly illustrated by the media of the time; for example television shows such as ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' and ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' idealized domesticity.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Knuttila, ''Introducing Sociology: A Critical Approach'' (4th ed. 2008 Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important events laid the groundwork for the second wave, specifically the work of French writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]] in the 1940s where she examined the notion of women being perceived as "other" in the patriarchal society. Simone de Beauvoir was an existentialist, meaning she believed in the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will. She went on to conclude in her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'' that male-centered ideology was being accepted as a norm and enforced by the ongoing development of myths, and that the fact that women are capable of getting pregnant, lactating, and menstruating is in no way a valid cause or explanation to place them as the "second sex".&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir, ''[[The Second Sex]]'', 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was translated from French to English (with some of its text excised) and published in America in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moi |first=Toril |title=While we wait: The English translation of The Second Sex |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=27 |number=4 |year=2002 |pages=1005–1035 |doi=10.1086/339635 |jstor=10.1086/339635|s2cid=146683607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] approved the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]], which was made available in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Tone, Andrea (2001). Devices &amp; Desires: A History of Contraceptives in America. New York: Hill and Wang.&lt;/ref&gt; This made it easier for women to have careers without having to leave due to unexpectedly becoming pregnant. It also meant young couples would not be routinely forced into unwanted marriages due to accidental pregnancies.

Though it is widely accepted that the movement lasted from the 1960s into the early 1980s, the exact years of the movement are more difficult to pinpoint and are often disputed. The movement is usually believed to have begun in 1963, when [[Betty Friedan]] published ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', and President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] released its report on gender inequality.

The administration of President Kennedy made women's rights a key issue of the [[New Frontier]], and named women (such as [[Esther Peterson]]) to many high-ranking posts in his administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aflcio.org/aboutus/history/history/peterson.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927032402/http://www.aflcio.org/aboutus/history/history/peterson.cfm |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |title=Esther Eggertsen Peterson (1906–1997) |website=AFL-CIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy also established a [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]], chaired by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and comprising cabinet officials (including Peterson and [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Robert F. Kennedy]]), senators, representatives, businesspeople, psychologists, sociologists, professors, activists, and public servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/laws/a/status_women.htm |title=President's Commission on the Status of Women 1961–1963 |publisher=Womenshistory.about.com |date=December 14, 1961 |access-date=July 20, 2012 |archive-date=March 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329084227/http://womenshistory.about.com/od/laws/a/status_women.htm |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommended changing this inequality by providing paid maternity leave, greater access to education, and help with child care to women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There were other actions by women in wider society, presaging their wider engagement in politics which would come with the second wave. In 1961, 50,000 women in 60 cities, mobilized by [[Women Strike for Peace]], protested above ground testing of nuclear bombs and tainted milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dagmar-wilson-20110130,0,5499397.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Elaine | last=Woo | title=Dagmar Wilson dies at 94; organizer of women's disarmament protesters | date=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Laurie Ouellette |title=Inventing the Cosmo Girl: class identity and girl-style American dreams |journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=359–383 |publisher=Mcs.sagepub.com |date=May 1, 1999 |doi=10.1177/016344399021003004 |s2cid=143024139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Betty Friedan, influenced by Simone de Beauvoir's ground-breaking, feminist ''The Second Sex'', wrote the bestselling book ''The Feminine Mystique''. Discussing primarily white women, she explicitly objected to how women were depicted in the mainstream media, and how placing them at home (as 'housewives') limited their possibilities and wasted potential. She had helped conduct a very important survey using her old classmates from [[Smith College]]. This survey revealed that the women who work in the workforce while also playing a role in the home were more satisfied with their life compared with the women who stayed home. The women who stayed home showed feelings of agitation and sadness. She concluded that many of these unhappy women had immersed themselves in the idea that they should not have any ambitions outside their home.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Transformed: 1945 to the Present |last=Hunt |first=Michael |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-19-937102-0 |location=New York |pages=220, 221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedan described this as "The Problem That Has No Name".&lt;ref&gt;DuBois and Dumenil. ''Through Women's Eyes: An American History Since 1865''. (Bedford; St Martin's, New York)&lt;/ref&gt; The perfect [[nuclear family]] image depicted and strongly marketed at the time, she wrote, did not reflect happiness and was rather degrading for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Cynthia Fuchs |date=1988 |title=Deceptive Distinctions: Sex, Gender, and the Social Order |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book is widely credited with having begun second-wave feminism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/betty-friedan-465800.html |location=London |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Corinne |last=Sweet |title=Betty Friedan |date=February 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems of the nuclear family in America are also heteronormative and is utilized often as a marketing strategy to sell goods within a capitalist driven society.&lt;ref&gt;Snider, Ashton R., "Heteronormativity and the Ideal Family" (2016). Theses. 220. https://irl.umsl.edu/thesis/220&lt;/ref&gt;

The report from the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women, along with Friedan's book, spoke to the discontent of many women (especially [[homemaker|housewives]]) and led to the formation of local, state, and federal government women's groups along with many independent feminist organizations. Friedan was referencing a "movement" as early as 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CBCtv |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDZh3nY9clY |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/iDZh3nY9clY |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live |title=Betty Friedan: Women | date=February 11, 2009 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=July 20, 2012}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement grew with legal victories such as the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and the ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling of 1965. In 1966 Friedan joined other women and men to found the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW); Friedan would be named as the organization's first president.&lt;ref name=fredianfap&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sixties Chronicle|first=David|last=Farber|publisher=Legacy Publishing|page=256|year=2004|isbn=978-1412710091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the early successes NOW achieved under Friedan's leadership, her decision to pressure the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) to use Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to enforce more job opportunities among American women met with fierce opposition within the organization.&lt;ref name="fredianfap"/&gt; Siding with arguments among several of the group's African-American members,&lt;ref name="fredianfap"/&gt; many of NOW's leaders were convinced that the vast number of male African-Americans who lived below the poverty line were in need of more job opportunities than women within the middle and upper class.{{sfnp|Farber|2004|p=257}} Friedan stepped down as president in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.now.org/press/02-06/02-04.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208133536/http://www.now.org/press/02-06/02-04.html|url-status=dead|title=NOW statement on Friedan's death|archive-date=December 8, 2013|access-date=March 1, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, freelance journalist [[Gloria Steinem]] gained widespread popularity among feminists after a diary she authored while working undercover as a [[Playboy Bunny]] waitress at the [[Playboy Club]] was published as a two-part feature in the May and June issues of ''[[Show (magazine)|Show]]''.{{sfnp|Farber|2004|p=150}} In her diary, Steinem alleged the club was mistreating its waitresses in order to gain male customers and exploited the Playboy Bunnies as symbols of male chauvinism, noting that the club's manual instructed the Bunnies that "there are many pleasing ways they can employ to stimulate the club's liquor volume".{{sfnp|Farber|2004|p=150}} By 1968, Steinem had become arguably the most influential figure in the movement and support for legalized [[abortion]] and federally funded day-cares had become the two leading objectives for feminists.{{sfnp|Farber|2004|p=377}}

Among the most significant legal victories of the movement after the formation of NOW were a 1967 Executive Order extending full [[affirmative action]] rights to women, a 1968 EEOC decision ruling illegal sex-segregated help wanted ads, [[Title IX]] and the [[Women's Educational Equity Act]] (1972 and 1974, respectively, educational equality), [[Title X]] (1970, health and family planning), the [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] (1974), the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978]], the outlawing of [[spousal rape|marital rape]] (although not outlawed in all states until 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refugehouse.com/resources_marital_rape.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110033706/http://www.refugehouse.com/resources_marital_rape.html |archive-date=November 10, 2006 |website=Refuge House |title=Resources – Marital Rape}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the legalization of [[no-fault divorce]] (although not legalized in all states until 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/ny-becomes-50th-state-with-no-fault-divorce-1.2212018 |title=NY becomes 50th state with no-fault divorce |work=Newsday |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a 1975 law requiring the U.S. Military Academies to admit women, and many Supreme Court cases such as ''[[Reed v. Reed]]'' of 1971 and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' of 1973. However, the changing of social attitudes towards women is usually considered the greatest success of the women's movement. In January 2013, US Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] announced that the longtime ban on women serving in US military combat roles had been lifted.&lt;ref name=ppippav /&gt;

In 2013, the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] (DoD) announced their plan to integrate women into all combat positions by 2016.&lt;ref name="ppippav"&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/us/military/women-history.html A History of Women in the U.S. Military]. ''Infoplease.com''. Accessed December 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-wave feminism also affected other movements, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[Student activism in the United States|student's rights movement]], as women sought equality within them. In 1965 in "Sex and Caste", a reworking of a memo they had written as staffers in civil-rights organizations [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]], [[Casey Hayden]] and [[Mary King (political scientist)|Mary King]] proposed that "assumptions of male superiority are as widespread and deep rooted and every much as crippling to the woman as the assumptions of white supremacy are to the Negro", and that in the movement, as in society, women can find themselves "caught up in a common-law caste system".&lt;ref name="Sex and Caste"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carolsim.com/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/memo.html|title=Sex and Caste: A Kind of Memo |website=The CWLU Herstory Website |access-date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331205231/http://www.carolsim.com/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/memo.html |archive-date=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dear Sisters"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2uMwEGfAMSQC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=Dear Sisters: Dispatches From The Women's Liberation Movement |editor1-first=Rosalyn |editor1-last=Baxandall |editor2-first=Linda |editor2-last=Gordon |year=2000 |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |isbn=978-0-465-01707-2 |via=[[Google Books]] }}{{Dead link|date=October 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1967, [[Jo Freeman]] attended a "free school" course on women at the University of Chicago led by [[Heather Booth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/feminism/_html/JWA004.htm|title=Feminism |website=Jewish Women's Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Naomi Weisstein]]. She invited them to organize a woman's workshop at the then-forthcoming [[National Conference of New Politics]] (NCNP), to be held over [[Labor Day]] weekend 1967 in [[Chicago]]. At that conference, a woman's caucus was formed (led by Freeman and [[Shulamith Firestone]]), who tried to present their own demands to the plenary session.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jhmQvhJMUagC&amp;pg=PA61 |title=American Patriotism, American Protest: Social Movements Since the Sixties |first=Simon |last=Hall |year=2011 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |page=61 |isbn=978-0-8122-4295-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the women were told their resolution was not important enough for a floor discussion, and when through threatening to tie up the convention with procedural motions they succeeded in having their statement tacked to the end of the agenda, it was never discussed.&lt;ref name="jofreeman.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jofreeman.com/socialmovements/origins.htm |title=On the Origins of Social Movements |first=Jo |last=Freeman |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the National Conference for New Politics (NCNP) Director William F. Pepper refused to recognize any of the women waiting to speak and instead called on someone to speak about [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], five women, including Firestone, rushed the podium demanding to know why.&lt;ref name="jofreeman.com"/&gt; But Willam F. Pepper allegedly patted Firestone on the head and said, "Move on little girl; we have more important issues to talk about here than women's liberation", or possibly, "Cool down, little girl. We have more important things to talk about than women's problems."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jofreeman.com"/&gt; Freeman and Firestone called a meeting of the women who had been at the "free school" course and the women's workshop at the conference; this became the first Chicago [[Women's liberation movement|women's liberation]] group. It was known as the Westside group because it met weekly in Freeman's apartment on Chicago's west side. After a few months, Freeman started a newsletter which she called ''Voice of the women's liberation movement.'' It circulated all over the country (and in a few foreign countries), giving the new movement of women's liberation its name. Many of the women in the Westside group went on to start other feminist organizations, including the [[Chicago Women's Liberation Union]].

In 1968, an [[Students for a Democratic Society|SDS]] organizer at the [[University of Washington]] told a meeting about white college men working with poor white men, and "[h]e noted that sometimes after analyzing societal ills, the men shared leisure time by 'balling a chick together.' He pointed out that such activities did much to enhance the political consciousness of poor white youth. A woman in the audience asked, 'And what did it do for the consciousness of the chick?{{'"}} (Hole, Judith, and Ellen Levine, ''Rebirth of Feminism'', 1971, pg. 120).&lt;ref name="jofreeman.com"/&gt; After the meeting, a handful of women formed [[Seattle]]'s first women's liberation group.&lt;ref name="jofreeman.com"/&gt;

The term "second-wave feminism" itself was brought into common parlance by American journalist Martha Lear in a March 1968 ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' article titled "The Second Feminist Wave: What Do These Women Want?".&lt;ref name="lear2"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lear |first=Martha Weinman |date=March 10, 1968 |title=The Second Feminist Wave: What do these women want? |url=https://nyti.ms/2h6kh3X |access-date=2020-06-25 |work=The New York Times |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote, "Proponents call it the Second Feminist Wave, the first having ebbed after the glorious victory of [[Women's suffrage in the United States|suffrage]] and disappeared, finally, into the great sandbar of Togetherness."&lt;ref name="lear2"/&gt;{{rp|323}} The term ''wave'' helped link the generation of suffragettes who fought for legal rights to the feminists of the 1960s and '70s. It is now used to not only distinguish the different priorities in feminism throughout the years but to establish an overarching fight for equity and equality as a way of understanding its history. This metaphor however is critiqued by feminists as it generalizes the contradictions within the movement and the different beliefs that feminists hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Grady |first=Constance |date=2018-03-20 |title=The waves of feminism, and why people keep fighting over them, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth |access-date=2023-05-18 |website=Vox |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some black feminists who were active in the early second-wave feminism include civil rights lawyer and author [[Florynce Kennedy]], who co-authored one of the first books on abortion, 1971's ''Abortion Rap''; Cellestine Ware, of New York's [[Stanton-Anthony Brigade]]; and Patricia Robinson. These women "tried to show the connections between racism and male dominance" in society.

The Indochinese Women's Conferences (IWC) in Vancouver and Toronto in 1971, demonstrated the interest of a multitude of women's groups in the Vietnam Antiwar movement. Lesbian groups, women of color, and Vietnamese groups saw their interests mirrored in the anti-imperialist spirit of the conference. Although the IWC used a Canadian venue, membership was primarily composed of American groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hewitt |first=Nancy A. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/642204450 |title=No Permanent Waves: Recasting Histories of U.S. Feminism |others=Nancy A.

The ideals of [[liberal feminism]] worked towards the idea of women's equality with that of men because liberal feminists felt that women and men have the same intrinsic capabilities and that society has socialized certain skills out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Evans |first=Judith |title=Feminist Theory Today: An Introduction to Second-Wave Feminism |publisher=Sage Publications |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8039-8478-3 |location=London |pages=13 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; This elimination of difference works to erase sexism by working within a pre-existing system of oppression rather than challenging the system itself.

The second wave of the feminist movement also marks the emergence of [[women's studies]] as a legitimate field of study. In 1970, [[San Diego State University]] was the first university in the United States to offer a selection of women's studies courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women's voices, feminist visions: classic and contemporary readings |others=Shaw, Susan M.

The [[1977 National Women's Conference]] in [[Houston]], Texas, presented an opportunity for women's liberation groups to address a multitude of women's issues.

However, in 1982, adding the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] failed, having been ratified by only 35 states, leaving it three states short of ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2088114_2087975_2087972,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311044029/http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2088114_2087975_2087972,00.html |archive-date=March 11, 2018 |url-status=live |date=August 12, 2011 |author=Megan Gibson |title=The Equal Rights Amendment Marches |magazine=A Brief History of Women's Protests |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=December 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-wave feminism was largely successful, with the failure of the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]'s veto of the [[Comprehensive Child Development Bill of 1972]] (which would have provided a multibillion-dollar national day care system) the only major legislative defeats. Efforts to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment have continued. Ten states have adopted constitutions or constitutional amendments providing that equal rights under the law shall not be denied because of sex, and most of these provisions mirror the broad language of the Equal Rights Amendment.

[[File:Betty Naomi Goldstein Friedan.jpg|thumb|109x109px|[[Betty Friedan]] published ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' in 1963]]

In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]] published her book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''&lt;ref name="Friedan 20102"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Friedan |first=Betty |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/823862686 |title=The feminine mystique |date=2010 |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |isbn=978-0-14-119205-5 |oclc=823862686}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the issues that many white-middle class housewives were facing at the time. Friedan's work catalyzed the second wave, and in particular the liberal feminist sector of the movement. Her work gave these women the language to be able to articulate the dissatisfaction they felt in their role of being a mother and a wife. Friedan coined the term "Feminine Mystique" to recognize the romanticization of being a "happy housewife" perpetuated by media such as TV and magazines and that women should feel satisfied with housework, marriage, child-rearing, and passivity around the home unit. Women were always seen as relational to the other people in their life and were not encouraged to have their own identity as a person with their own life and interests beyond the home. They are either seen as someone's wife or someone's mother. Women who read her work were able to realize that they were not alone in their feelings. Friedan's work only brought to life a problem experienced by a certain group of women however which left out women of color and who belonged to other marginalized groups since many of these people had to work outside the home for a source of income.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Saraswati |first1=L.

=== Finland ===

In 1970 there was a brief but strong women's movement belonging to second wave feminism. [[Rape in marriage]] was not considered a crime at the time, and victims of [[Domestic violence in Finland|domestic violence]] had few places to go. Feminists also fought for a [[day-care]] system that would be open to the public, and for the right for not only paid maternity leave but also paternity leave. Today there is a 263-day [[parental leave]] in Finland. It is illegal to [[Gender discrimination|discriminate]] against [[women in the workforce]]. Two feminist groups were created to help the movement: The Marxist-Feminists ({{lang|sv|Marxist-Feministerna}}) and The Red Women ({{lang|sv|Rödkäringarna}}, {{lang|fi|Puna-akat}}). The feminists in Finland were inspired by other European countries such as [[Feminism in Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Women in Switzerland|Switzerland]]. Other important groups for the Finnish women in the 1970s include [[Naisasialiitto Unioni|Unioni]] and The Feminists ({{lang|fi|Feministit-}}{{lang|sv|Feministerna}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www15.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/SOCPOL/ia-women.html |title=The {{as written|Wom|ens' [sic]|expecting=Women's}} Rights Movement in Finland |website=Fast-Fin-1 |publisher = Finnish Institutions Research Paper |access-date=21 April 2015 |archive-date=15 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115060927/http://www.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/SOCPOL/ia-women.html |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Irish Women's Liberation Movement]] was an alliance of a group of Irish women who were concerned about the sexism within Ireland both socially and legally. They first began after a meeting in [[Dublin|Dublin's]] Bewley's Cafe on [[Grafton Street]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tcd.ie/history/contesting/Undergrad/Module15/document6.pdf|title = Irish Women's Liberation Movement|publisher = Trinity College, Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later had their meetings in [[Margaret Gaj]]'s restaurant on [[Baggot Street]] every Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.independent.ie/world-news/the-matriarch-who-served-up-stew-and-social-progress-26747770.html|title = The Matriarch Who Served up Stew and Social Progress|last = Sweetman|first = Rosita|date = 7 February 2011|work = Independent|access-date = 21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Liffey Press Mondays at Gaj's: The Story of the Irish Women's Liberation Movement|url = http://www.theliffeypress.com/mondays-at-gaj-s-the-story-of-the-irish-women-s-liberation-movement.html|website = The Liffey Press|access-date = 2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was short-lived, but influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=9FY2673767236&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Celebrating Sisterhood|date = 26 May 2010|work = Irish Times|access-date = 21 August 2015|via = Newspaper Source - EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was initially started with twelve women, most of whom were [[journalist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 1968: Memories and Legacies of a Global Revolt|last = McCafferty|first = Nell|pages = 216–218|url = http://www.ghi-dc.org/files/publications/bu_supp/supp006/bus6_213.pdf|chapter = Ireland: Breaking the Shackles|access-date = 21 August 2015|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022050/http://www.ghi-dc.org/files/publications/bu_supp/supp006/bus6_213.pdf|archive-date = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the co-founders was [[June Levine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Levine, June {{!}} Dictionary of Irish Biography |url=https://www.dib.ie/biography/levine-june-a9670 |access-date=2023-11-21 |website=www.dib.ie |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, a group of Irish feminists (including [[June Levine]], [[Mary Kenny]], [[Nell McCafferty]], [[Máirín Johnston]], and other members of the [[Irish Women's Liberation Movement]]) travelled to [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], on the so-called "[[Contraceptive Train]]" and returned with [[condom]]s, which were then illegal in Ireland.

In 1973, a group of feminists, chaired by [[Hilda Tweedy]] of the [[Irish Housewives Association]], set up the Council for the Status of Women, with the goal of gaining equality for women. It was an umbrella body for women's groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwci.ie/about/history.html NWCI History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617212729/http://www.nwci.ie/about/history.html |date=June 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s the council's activities included supporting projects funded by the [[European Social Fund]], and running Women and Leadership Programmes and forums. In 1995, following a strategic review, it changed its name to the [[National Women's Council of Ireland]].

=== Spain ===
The 1960s in Spain saw a generational shift in Spanish feminist in response to other changes in Spanish society. This included increased emigration and tourism (resulting in the spread of ideas from the rest of the world), greater opportunities in education and employment for women and major economic reforms.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Nielfa Cristóbal, Gloria. ''Movimientos femeninos'', en ''Enciclopedia Madrid S.XX''&lt;/ref&gt; Feminism in the late Franco period and early transition period was not unified. It had many different political dimensions, however, they all shared a belief in the need for greater equality for women in Spain and a desire to defend the rights of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.elmundo.es/la-aventura-de-la-historia/2015/03/08/54faf788e2704ea15e8b4576.html |title=Y nos hicimos visibles |trans-title=And we became visible |date=March 8, 2015 |website=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es |access-date=March 27, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminism moved from being about the individual to being about the collective.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vocesvisibles.com/historia-del-feminismo/historia-del-feminismo-en-espana |title=Historia del Feminismo en España |language=es |trans-title=History of Feminism in Span |last=Seara |first=Marita |date=November 29, 2015 |website=Voces Visibles |access-date=March 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period that second-wave feminism arrived in Spain.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoHC6Oi-SGkC |title=Spanish Women's Writing 1849-1996 |last=Davies |first=Catherine |date=January 1, 1998 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=9780485910063 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-wave Spanish feminism was about the struggle for the rights of women in the context of the dictatorship. PCE would start in 1965 to promote this movement with MDM, creating a feminist political orientation around building solidarity for women and assisting imprisoned political figures. MDM launched its movement in Madrid by establishing associations among the housewives of the [[Tetuán (Madrid)|Tetuán]] and [[Getafe]] in 1969. In 1972, Asociación Castellana de Amas de Casa y Consumidora was created to widen the group's ability to attract members.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Second-wave feminism entered the Spanish comic community by the early 1970s. It was manifested in Spanish comics in two ways. The first was that it increased the number of women involved in comics production as writers and artists. The second was it transformed how female characters were portrayed, making women less passive and less likely to be purely sexual beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Almerini |first=Katia |date=March 1, 2017 |title=La irrupción del feminismo en el cómic español de los setenta / The Emergence of Feminism in the 1970s Spanish Comic |journal=Anuario del Departamento de Historia y Teoría del Arte |language=es |volume=27 |issue=2015 |doi=10.15366/anuario2015.009 |issn=2530-3562 |doi-access=free|hdl=10486/677364 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
:''See also [[Feminism in Sweden]]''
In Sweden, second-wave feminism is mostly associated with [[Group 8 (Sweden)|Group 8]], a feminist organization which was founded by eight women in Stockholm in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Matthis, Iréne; Dick Urban Vestbro. Kvinnokamp: för en revolutionär kvinnorörelse. Solna: Gidlund.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization took up various feminist issues such as demands for expansions of kindergartens, 6-hour working day, equal pay for equal work and opposition to pornography. Initially based in Stockholm, local groups were founded throughout the country. The influence of Group 8 on feminism in Sweden is still prevalent.

=== The Netherlands ===
In 1967, "The Discontent of Women", by [[Joke Smit|Joke Kool-Smits]], was published;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/js/werk/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw.pdf |title=De gis |language=nl |date=9 October 1967 |website=Emancipatie.nl |access-date=March 1, 2022 |archive-date=April 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412082405/http://www.emancipatie.nl/_documenten/js/werk/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw/hetonbehagenbijdevrouw.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; the publication of this essay is often regarded as the start of second-wave feminism in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://isgeschiedenis.nl/nieuws/joke-smit-feministe-en-journaliste |title=Joke Smit: feministe en journaliste |language=nl |website=Isgeschiedenis.nl |date=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Smit describes the frustration of married women, saying they are fed up being solely mothers and housewives.

== Beginning and consciousness raising ==
The beginnings of second-wave feminism can be studied by looking at the two branches that the movement formed in: the [[liberal feminists]] and the [[Radical feminism|radical feminists.]] The liberal feminists, led by figures such as Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem advocated for federal legislation to be passed that would promote and enhance the personal and professional lives of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Takin' it to the Streets |date=2015 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |editor1-last=Bloom |editor1-first=Alexander |location=New York |page=81 |editor2-last=Brines |editor2-first=Wini}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, radical feminists, such as Casey Hayden and Mary King, adopted the skills and lessons that they had learned from their work with student organizations such as the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] and [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and created a platform to speak on the violent and sexist issues women faced while working with the larger [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America |last=Rosen |first=Ruth |date=2000 |publisher=The Penguin Group |location=New York |page=100 |author-link=Ruth Rosen |title-link=The World Split Open}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The liberal feminist movement ===
{{Main|Liberal feminism}}
After being removed from the workforce, by either personal or [[social pressure]]s, many women in the post-war America returned to the home or were placed into female only jobs in the service sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945–1974 |last1=Patterson |first1=James T. |date=2000 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of Friedan's ''The Feminine Mystique'' in 1963, many women connected to the feeling of isolation and dissatisfaction that the book detailed. The book itself, however, was not a call to action, but rather a plea for self-realization and [[consciousness raising]] among middle-class women throughout America.{{sfnp|Rosen|2000|p=8}} Many of these women organized to form the [[National Organization for Women]] in 1966, whose "Statement of Purpose" declared that the right women had to equality was one small part of the nationwide civil rights revolution that was happening during the 1960s.{{sfnp|Rosen|2000|p=78}}

=== The radical feminist movement ===
{{Main|Radical feminism}}
Women who favoured radical feminism collectively spoke of being forced to remain silent and obedient to male leaders in [[New Left]] organizations. They spoke out about how they were not only told to do clerical work such as stuffing envelopes and typing speeches, but there was also an expectation for them to sleep with the male activists that they worked with.&lt;ref name="Shulman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shulman |first1=Alix Kates |date=1980 |title=Sex and Power: Sexual Bases of Radical Feminism |journal=Signs |volume=5 |issue=4, ''Women: Sex and Sexuality'' |page=592 |doi=10.1086/493754 |jstor=3173832 |s2cid=143235534}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these acts of sexual harassment took place, the young women were neglected their right to have their own needs and desires recognized by their male cohorts.&lt;ref name="Shulman" /&gt; Many radical feminists had learned from these organizations how to think radically about their self-worth and importance, and applied these lessons in the relationships they had with each other.{{sfnp|Bloom|Brines|2015|p=44}}

== Businesses ==
Feminist activists have established a range of [[feminist businesses]], including [[Feminist bookstore|women's bookstores]], feminist credit unions, feminist presses, feminist mail-order catalogs, feminist restaurants, and feminist record labels. These businesses flourished as part of the second and third waves of feminism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.&lt;ref name="Echols"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Daring to be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975 |last=Echols |first=Alice |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |year=1989 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Feminist Bookstore Movement: Lesbian Antiracism and Feminist Accountability |last=Hogan |first=Kristen |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |year=2016 |location=Durham, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In West Berlin sixteen projects emerged within three years (1974–76)&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Perincioli, "Berlin wird feministisch"(2015) p.137 translated in English [https://feministberlin1968ff.de/womens-center/womens-projects-berlin1972-74/]&lt;/ref&gt; all without state funding (except the women's shelter).

== Music and popular culture ==
Second-wave feminists viewed popular culture as sexist, and created pop culture of their own to counteract this. "One project of second wave feminism was to create 'positive' images of women, to act as a counterweight to the dominant images circulating in popular culture and to raise women's consciousness of their oppressions."&lt;ref name="Arrow2007" /&gt;

=== "I Am Woman" ===
{{Main|I Am Woman}}

Australian artist [[Helen Reddy]]'s 1972 song "[[I Am Woman]]" played a large role in popular culture and became a [[feminist anthem]]; Reddy came to be known as a "feminist [[poster child|poster girl]]" or a "feminist icon".&lt;ref name="Arrow2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arrow |first=Michelle |year=2007 |title='It Has Become My Personal Anthem': 'I Am Woman', Popular Culture and 1970s Feminism |journal=[[Australian Feminist Studies]] |volume=22 |issue=53 |pages=213–230 |doi=10.1080/08164640701361774 |s2cid=143230741}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reddy told interviewers that the song was a "song of pride about being a woman".&lt;ref name="Gourley"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ms. and the Material Girls: Perceptions of Women from the 1970s through the 1990s |last=Gourley |first=Catherine |publisher=Twenty-First Century |year=2008 |location=Minneapolis, MN |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks after "I Am Woman" entered the charts, radio stations refused to play it.

=== Olivia Records ===
{{Main|Olivia Records}}
In 1973, a group of five feminists created the first women's owned-and-operated record label, called [[Olivia Records]].&lt;ref name="Wollman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/seventies/essays/women-and-music-industry-1970s|title=Women and the Music Industry in the 1970s|last=Wollman|first=Elizabeth|website=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|access-date=March 9, 2017|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; They created the record label because they were frustrated that major labels were slow to add female artists to their rosters. One of Olivia's founders, Judy Dlugacz, said that, "It was a chance to create opportunities for women artists within an industry which at that time had few."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://0-hnpl.bigchalk.com.catalog.toledolibrary.org/hnweb/hnpl/do/document?set=searchalleras&amp;start=26&amp;rendition=x-article-image&amp;inmylist=false&amp;urn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3BPQDOC%3BHNP%3BPQD%3BHNP%3BPROD%3Bx-article-image%3B2166468282&amp;mylisturn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3BPQDOC%3BHNP%3BPQD%3BHNP%3BPROD%3Bx-citation%3B2166468282 |title=Olivia Records: A Healthy Gain in 15 Years |last=Liveton |first=Sharon |date=May 14, 1988 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=April 18, 2017 |archive-date=April 2, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200402170944/http://0-hnpl.bigchalk.com.catalog.toledolibrary.org/hnweb/hnpl/do/document?set=searchalleras&amp;start=26&amp;rendition=x-article-image&amp;inmylist=false&amp;urn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3BPQDOC%3BHNP%3BPQD%3BHNP%3BPROD%3Bx-article-image%3B2166468282&amp;mylisturn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3BPQDOC%3BHNP%3BPQD%3BHNP%3BPROD%3Bx-citation%3B2166468282 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, they had a budget of $4,000, and relied on donations to keep Olivia Records alive. With these donations, Olivia Records created their first LP, an album of feminist songs entitled ''I Know You Know.''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://0-hnpl.bigchalk.com.catalog.toledolibrary.org/hnweb/hnpl/do/document?set=searchalleras&amp;start=1&amp;rendition=x-article-image&amp;inmylist=false&amp;urn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3BPQDOC%3BHNP%3BPQD%3BHNP%3BPROD%3Bx-article-image%3B650283422&amp;mylisturn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3BPQDOC%3BHNP%3BPQD%3BHNP%3BPROD%3Bx-citation%3B650283422 |title=Feminist Record Company: Women Who Love the Spin They're In |last=McKenna |first=Kristine |date=December 11, 1977 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=April 18, 2017 |archive-date=April 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200422163341/https://catalog.toledolibrary.org/wamvalidate?url=https://0-search-proquest-com.catalog.toledolibrary.org:443/news |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The record label originally relied on volunteers and feminist bookstores to distribute their records, but after a few years their records began to be sold in mainstream record stores.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Olivia Records was so successful that the company relocated from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles in 1975.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Olivia Records released several records and albums, and their popularity grew.&lt;ref name="Wollman" /&gt; As their popularity grew, an alternative, specialized music industry grew around it. This type of music was initially referred to as "lesbian music" but came to be known as "women's music".&lt;ref name="Wollman" /&gt; However, although Olivia Records was initially meant for women, in the 1980s it tried to move away from that stereotype and encouraged men to listen to their music as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

One of the most successful examples included the sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson, who formed the famous hard rock band [[Heart (band)|Heart]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Film ===

==== German-speaking Europe ====
The [[:de:Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin|Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin]] gave women a chance in film in Germany: from 1968 on one third of the students were female. Some of them - pioneers of the women's movement - produced feminist feature films: [[Helke Sander]] in 1971 produced ''Eine Prämie für Irene'' [A Reward for Irene], and [[Cristina Perincioli]] (although she was Swiss not German) in 1971 produced ''Für Frauen – 1.Kap'' [For Women – 1st Chapter].

In West Germany [[Helma Sanders-Brahms]] and [[Claudia von Alemann]] produced feminist documentaries from 1970 on.

In 1973 Claudia von Alemann and Helke Sander organized the 1. Internationale Frauen-Filmseminar in Berlin.

In 1974 Helke Sander founded the journal ''[[:de:Frauen und Film|Frauen und Film]]'' – a first feminist film journal, which she edited until 1981.

In the 1970s in West Germany, women directors produced a whole series of [[:de:Frauenfilm|Frauenfilm]] - films focusing on women's personal emancipation. In the 1980s the [[Goethe Institute]] brought a collection of German women's films to every corner of the world.
"...here the term 'feminist filmmaking' does function to point to a filmmaking practice defining itself outside the masculine mirror. German feminism is one of the most active women's movements in Europe. It has gained access to television; engendered a spectrum of journals, a publishing house and a summer women's university in Berlin; inspired a whole group of filmmakers; ..." writes Marc Silberman in ''[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jump Cut, no. 27, July 1982, pp. 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt; But most of the women filmmakers did not see themselves as feminists, except [[Helke Sander]]&lt;ref&gt;Film and feminism in Germany, Jump Cut, no. 29, February 1984, pp. 60-62.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cristina Perincioli]]. Perincioli stated in an interview: "Fight first ... before making beautiful art".&lt;ref&gt;Jump Cut, 29, February 1984, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; There, she explains how she develops and shoots the film together with the women concerned: saleswomen, battered wives - and why she prefers to work with an all female team. Camera women were still so rare in the 1970 that she had to find them in Denmark and France. Working with an all women film crew Perincioli encouraged women to learn these then male dominated professions.

===== Association of women filmworkers of Germany =====
In 1979, German women filmworkers formed the Association of women filmworkers&lt;ref&gt;Petra Haffter in Jump Cut, no. 30, March 1985, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; which was active for a few years. In 2014, a new attempt with Proquote Film (then as [[:de:|Proquote Regie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://proquote-film.de|title=Pro Quote Film|website=Proquote-film.de|access-date=March 1, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;) turned out to be successful and effective.
A study by the University of Rostock shows that 42% of the graduates of film schools are female, but only 22% of the German feature films are staged by a woman director and are usually financially worse equipped. Similarly, women are disadvantaged in the other male-dominated film trades, where men even without education are preferred to the female graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.uni-rostock.de/fileadmin/PHF_IMD/Bilder/News/Gender-Report-Deutscher_Kinofilm_2015.pdf|title=''Wer dreht deutsche Kinofilme?

The initiative points out that the introduction of a quota system in Sweden has brought the proportion of women in key positions in film production around the same as the population share.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Statistics/Gender-equality/ ''Gender equality in Swedish Film'', Swedish Film Institute], retrieved 12 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Swedish initiative calls also for a parity of film funding bodies and the implementation of a gradual women's quota for the allocation of film and television directing jobs in order to achieve a gender-equitable distribution. This should reflect the plurality of a modern society, because diversity can not be guaranteed if more than 80% of all films are produced by men.
ProQuote Film is the third initiative with which women with a high share in their industry are fighting for more female executives and financial resources (see [[:de:|Pro Quote]] Medien (2012) and Quote Medizin).

=== Art ===
{{Main|Feminist art movement}}

Art during second wave feminism also flourished. Known as the [[Feminist art movement]], the works and artists during the movement fought to give themselves representation in a field dominated by white men. Their works came in all different mediums and aimed to end oppression, challenge gender norms, and highlight the fraught art industry rooted in white patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Feminist art {{!}} MoMA |url=https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/feminist-art |access-date=2023-05-18 |website=The Museum of Modern Art |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" (1971) has become one of the most influential works that came from the movement and questions gender stereotypes for women in the art field as well as the definition of art as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Nochlin |first=Linda |title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists? |date=2018-02-12 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780429502996-7 |work=Women, Art, and Power and Other Essays |pages=145–178 |access-date=2023-05-18 |publisher=Routledge |doi=10.4324/9780429502996-7 |isbn=978-0-429-50299-6|s2cid=53325846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social changes ==
===Use of birth control===
Finding a need to talk about the advantage of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] passing their approval for the use of [[birth control]] in 1960, liberal feminists took action in creating panels and workshops with the goal to promote conscious raising among sexually active women. These workshops also brought attention to issues such as [[venereal diseases]] and safe abortion.{{sfnp|Rosen|2000|p=176}} Radical feminists also joined this push to raise awareness among sexually active women. While supporting the "Free Love Movement" of the late 1960s and early 1970s, young women on college campuses distributed pamphlets on birth control, sexual diseases, abortion, and cohabitation.{{sfnp|Bloom|Brines|2015|p=66}}

While white women were concerned with obtaining birth control for all, women of color were at risk of sterilization because of these same medical and social advances: "Native American, African American, and Latina groups documented and publicized sterilization abuses in their communities in the 1960s and 70s, showing that women had been sterilized without their knowledge or consent... In the 1970s, a group of women... founded the Committee to End Sterilization Abuse (CESA) to stop this racist population control policy begun by the federal government in the 1940s – a policy that had resulted in the sterilization of over one-third of all women of child-bearing age in Puerto Rico."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Susan|last2=Lee|first2=Janet|title=Women's Voices, Feminist Visions|date=September 2008|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0073512280|page=342|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of forced sterilization disproportionately affected women of color and women from lower socioeconomic statuses. Sterilization was often done under the ideology of [[eugenics]]. Thirty states within the United States authorized legal sterilizations under eugenic sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schoen|first=Johanna|date=2001|title=Between Choice and Coercion: Women and the Politics of Sterilization in North Carolina, 1929–1975|journal=Journal of Women's History|volume=13|issue=1|pages=132–156|doi=10.1353/jowh.2001.0034|s2cid=143129170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence and sexual harassment===
The second-wave feminist movement also took a strong stance against physical violence and sexual assault in both the home and the workplace. In 1968, [[National Organization for Women|NOW]] successfully lobbied the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] to pass an amendment to Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which prevented discrimination based on sex in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=James T.|title=Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945–1974|url=https://archive.org/details/grandexpectation00patt|url-access=registration|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/grandexpectation00patt/page/646 646]|isbn=978-0-19-507680-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attention to women's rights in the workplace also prompted the EEOC to add sexual harassment to its "Guidelines on Discrimination", therefore giving women the right to report their bosses and coworkers for acts of sexual assault.

Domestic violence, such as battery and rape, were rampant in post-war America. Married women were often abused by their husbands, and as late as 1975 domestic battery and rape were both socially acceptable and legal as women were seen to be the possessions of their husbands.{{sfnp|Rosen|2000|pp=186, 183}} Because of activists in the second-wave feminist movement, and the local law enforcement agencies that they worked with, by 1982 three hundred shelters and forty-eight state coalitions had been established to provide protection and services for women who had been abused by male figures in their lives.{{sfnp|Rosen|2000|p=186}}

== Sex and sexuality ==
During the time of the second wave, with fighting against the stereotype that women are supposed to be passive and submissive, this topic extended to women's pleasure regarding sex, emotion, and intimacy. In anatomy textbooks and works by authors including neurologist [[Sigmund Freud]] before the 1950s, women's bodies in regards to sexuality and sexual intercourse were left out of the public eye and were instead centered around male pleasure. Through works like [[Anne Koedt]]'s "[[The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm]]" written in 1970, people could begin to break down the societal norm for male pleasure with a focus on the vaginal orgasm in heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1978, author [[Audre Lorde]] also discussed this in her essay "[[The Erotic|Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power]]". Lorde believed that the erotic is something that has been suppressed in women in order to keep them from feeling to their full potential in hopes of keeping them subservient. It is labeled as irrational and trivial so that women do not understand its full potential for power. Pornography to Lorde suppresses genuine emotion as it is only about the simulation of the senses.&lt;ref&gt;Lorde, Audre. [http://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/11881_Chapter_5.pdf "The Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power" (PDF)]. ''Sage UK''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine "[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]" also decided to rebrand their company as a women's magazine in 1965 coinciding with the second wave feminist movement. The editor in chief, [[Helen Gurley Brown]], dedicated the magazine to focus on the modern, working, and independent woman so that they can find independence in themselves and embrace their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Hunsberger |first=Ashley |date=2017 |title=The Framing of Feminism in Cosmopolitan Magazine During Second-Wave Feminism |url=https://eloncdn.blob.core.windows.net/eu3/sites/153/2017/12/02_Cosmopolitan_Hunsberger.pdf |website=Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; The articles are however criticized by many for its unrealistic portrayal of women and how ultimately, the woman curated by the magazine end up playing into men's fantasies about what a woman should be. It is another form of control and rules for women to abide by.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, Gabriella, "Fun, Fearless, Feminist?: Gender and Sexuality In Cosmopolitan" (2012). American Studies Senior Theses. 21. https://fordham.bepress.com/amer_stud_theses/21&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of criticism was especially touched on by [[Naomi Wolf]]'s "[[The Beauty Myth]]" in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |title=The Beauty Myth |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-385-42397-7 |location=UK |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With emotion and the ability to be able to feel to the fullest extent for women, that comes with the idea of separate space. The need to find women-only space so that feminists can organize and work towards liberation. In advocating for these spaces, many accused them of being "radical - separatists" and/or "lesbians". Homophobia was also, and still is, very prevalent and while the intersectional experiences were not completely researched until years later, homophobia and sexism were always interconnected. With the [[Gay liberation|gay liberation movement]] and the second wave, people were afraid of the questions that both movements addressed that would change the foundation of a heterosexual, oppressive patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Enke |first=Anne |date=2003 |title=Smuggling Sex through the Gates: Race, Sexuality, and the Politics of Space in Second Wave Feminism |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30041999 |journal=American Quarterly |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=635–667 |doi=10.1353/aq.2003.0038 |jstor=30041999 |s2cid=145331696 |issn=0003-0678}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Audre Lorde|Lorde]] speaks of this fear in her work "Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference" (1980) where she writes about how lesbians challenge the patriarchy and heteronormative society by creating a fear of a society that is no longer dependent on men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lorde |first=Audre |title=Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference |date=2021-01-07 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780429038556-22 |work=Campus Wars |pages=191–198 |access-date=2023-05-18 |publisher=Routledge |doi=10.4324/9780429038556-22 |isbn=978-0-429-03855-6|s2cid=67817829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===Title IX===
{{Main|Title IX}}

===Coeducation===
One debate which developed in the [[United States]] during this time period revolved around the question of [[coeducation]]. Most [[men's colleges in the United States]] adopted coeducation, often by merging with [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's colleges]]. In addition, some women's colleges adopted coeducation, while others maintained a single-sex student body.

====Seven Sisters Colleges====
Two of the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sister colleges]] made transitions during and after the 1960s. The first, [[Radcliffe College]], merged with [[Harvard University]]. Beginning in 1963, students at Radcliffe received Harvard diplomas signed by the presidents of Radcliffe and Harvard and joint commencement exercises began in 1970. The same year, several Harvard and Radcliffe dormitories began swapping students experimentally and in 1972 full co-residence was instituted. The departments of [[College athletics|athletics]] of both schools merged shortly thereafter. In 1977, Harvard and Radcliffe signed an agreement which put undergraduate women entirely in Harvard College. In 1999, Radcliffe College was dissolved and Harvard University assumed full responsibility over the affairs of female undergraduates. Radcliffe is now the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in [[Women's Studies]] at Harvard University.

The second, [[Vassar College]], declined an offer to merge with [[Yale University]] and instead became coeducational in 1969.

The remaining Seven Sisters decided against coeducation. [[Mount Holyoke College]] engaged in a lengthy debate under the presidency of [[David Truman]] over the issue of coeducation. On November 6, 1971, "after reviewing an exhaustive study on coeducation, the board of trustees decided unanimously that Mount Holyoke should remain a women's college, and a group of faculty was charged with recommending curricular changes that would support the decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/detailed.shtml|title=Mount Holyoke:A Detailed History|publisher=mtholyoke.edu|access-date=July 23, 2007|archive-date=September 26, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222407/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/cic/about/detailed.shtml|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smith College]] also made a similar decision in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smith.edu/collegerelations/presidents.php |title=Smith Tradition |publisher=smith.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101215838/http://www.smith.edu/collegerelations/presidents.php |archive-date=January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Bryn Mawr College]] and [[Haverford College]] (then all male) developed a system of sharing residential colleges. When Haverford became coeducational in 1980, Bryn Mawr discussed the possibly of coeducation as well, but decided against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/visit/history.shtml|title=A Brief history of Bryn Mawr College|publisher=brynmawr.edu|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120065225/http://www.brynmawr.edu/visit/history.shtml|archive-date=January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, [[Columbia University]] began admitting women after a decade of failed negotiations with [[Barnard College]] for a merger along the lines of Harvard and Radcliffe (Barnard has been affiliated with Columbia since 1900, but it continues to be independently governed). [[Wellesley College]] also decided against coeducation during this time.

====Mississippi University for Women====
In 1982, in a 5–4 decision, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan]]'' that the [[Mississippi University for Women]] would be in violation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Equal Protection Clause]] if it denied admission to its nursing program on the basis of gender. Mississippi University for Women, the first [[Public university|public or government institution]] [[Women's colleges in the United States|for women in the United States]], changed its admissions policies and became coeducational after the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mississippi.edu/universities/ |title=Mississippi Public Universities – Mississippi's University System |publisher=Mississippi.edu |date=September 15, 1925 |access-date=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what was her first opinion written for the Supreme Court, [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice Sandra Day O'Connor]] stated, "In limited circumstances, a gender-based classification favoring one sex can be justified if it intentionally and directly assists members of the sex that is disproportionately burdened." She went on to point out that there are a disproportionate number of women who are nurses, and that denying admission to men "lends credibility to the old view that women, not men, should become nurses, and makes the assumption that nursing is a field for women a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan]]'', 458 U.S. 718 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the dissenting opinions, Justices [[Harry A. Blackmun]], [[Warren E. Burger]], [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]], and [[William H. Rehnquist]] suggested that the result of this ruling would be the elimination of publicly supported single-sex educational opportunities. This suggestion has proven to be accurate as there are no public women's colleges in the United States today and, as a result of ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', the last all-male public university in the United States, [[Virginia Military Institute]], was required to admit women. The ruling did not require the university to change its name to reflect its [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational status]] and it continues a tradition of academic and leadership development for women by providing [[liberal arts]] and professional education to women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.muw.edu/pie/vision.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017083159/http://www.muw.edu/pie/vision.html |url-status=dead |title=MUW – Planning and Institutional Effectiveness |archive-date=October 17, 2010|access-date=March 1, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mills College ====
On May 3, 1990, the Trustees of [[Mills College]] announced that they had voted to admit male students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30610F73C540C778CDDAC0894D8494D81 |title=Venerable School for Women Is Going Co-ed |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 4, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision led to a two-week student and staff [[Strike action|strike]], accompanied by numerous displays of [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] protests by the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DE1738F936A35756C0A966958260 |title=Mills Students Protesting Admission of Men |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 5, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30616FC355E0C758CDDAC0894D8494D81 |title=Disbelieving and Defiant, Students Vow: No Men |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 6, 1990 |first=Katherine |last=Bishop |access-date=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, nearly 300 students blockaded the administrative offices and boycotted classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DE133EF93BA35756C0A966958260 |title=Protest Continues at College Over Decision to Admit Men |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 8, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, the Trustees met again to reconsider the decision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DA1130F931A25756C0A966958260 |title=College to Reconsider Decision to Admit Men |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 12, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading finally to a reversal of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30616F63C550C7A8DDDAC0894D8494D81 |title=Women's College Rescinds Its Decision to Admit Men |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 19, 1990 |first=Katherine |last=Bishop |access-date=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other colleges ====
[[Sarah Lawrence College]] declined an offer to merge with [[Princeton University]], becoming coeducational in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Studentdocs/Coed.html|title=Chicks and Bricks|website=etcweb.princeton.edu|access-date=April 30, 2019|archive-date=June 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622051707/http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Studentdocs/Coed.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Connecticut College]] also adopted coeducation during the late 1960s.
[[Wells College]], previously with a student body of women only, became co-educational in 2005. Douglass College, part of [[Rutgers University]], was the last publicly funded women's only college until 2007 when it became coed.

== Criticism ==
Some black and/or working class and poor women felt alienated by the main planks of the second-wave feminist movement, which largely advocated women's right to work outside the home and expansion of reproductive rights. Women of color and poor white women in the U.S. had been working outside of the home in blue-collar and service jobs for generations. Additionally, [[Angela Davis]] wrote that while Afro-American women and white women were subjected to multiple unwilled pregnancies and had to clandestinely [[Abortion|abort]], Afro-American women were also suffering from [[compulsory sterilization]] programs that were not widely included in dialogue about reproductive justice.

Beginning in the late 20th century, numerous feminist scholars such as [[Audre Lorde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lewis |first=Gail |date=July 2005 |title=Audre Lorde: vignettes and mental conversations |journal=[[Feminist Review]] |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=130–145 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.fr.9400222 |s2cid=189905287 |issn=0141-7789}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Winona LaDuke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jenks |first=Tom |date=February 2001 |title=From the Conferences |journal=The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=53–66 |doi=10.1525/jung.1.2001.19.4.53 |issn=0270-6210}}&lt;/ref&gt; critiqued the second wave in the United States as reducing feminist activity into a homogenized and whitewashed chronology of [[feminist history]] that ignores the voices and contributions of many [[women of color]], working-class women, and LGBT women.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{Cite book |title=¡Chicana Power!: Contested Histories of Feminism in the Chicano Movement |last=Blackwell |first=Maylei |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=9780292726901 |location=Austin |pages=11, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rethinking Women's and Gender Studies |last=Henry |first=Astrid |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0415808316|location = New York |page=2071 |editor1-last=Orr |editor1-first=Catherine M. |editor2-last=Braithwaite|editor2-first=Ann |editor3-last=Lichtenstein |editor3-first=Diane |chapter=Chapter 6: Waves |type=Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second-wave feminist movement in the United States has been criticized for failing to acknowledge the struggles of women of color, and their voices were often silenced or ignored by white feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rewire.news/article/2013/07/28/women-of-color-and-feminism-a-history-lesson-and-way-forward/ |title=Women of Color and Feminism: A History Lesson and Way Forward |website=Rewire.News |date=July 29, 2013 |access-date=April 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; It has been suggested that the [[Dominant narrative|dominant historical narratives]] of the feminist movement focuses on white, East Coast, and predominantly middle-class women and women's [[Consciousness raising|consciousness-raising]] groups, excluding the experiences and contributions of lesbians, women of color, and working-class and lower-class women.&lt;ref name=Douglas /&gt; [[Chela Sandoval]] called the dominant narratives of the women's liberation movement "[[Hegemony|hegemonic]] feminism" because it [[Essentialism|essentializes]] the feminist historiography to an exclusive population of women, which assumes that all women experience the same oppressions as the white, East Coast, and predominantly middle-class women.{{sfnp|Blackwell|2011|p=16}} [[Multiracial Feminist Theory|Multiracial feminist theory]] also confronts the second-wave feminist movement's focus on white middle-class women by arguing that it neglected the interplay between racism and misogyny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thompson |first=Becky |date=2002 |title=Multiracial Feminism: Recasting the Chronology of Second Wave Feminism |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3178747 |journal=Feminist Studies |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=337–360 |doi=10.2307/3178747 |jstor=3178747 |issn=0046-3663|hdl=2027/spo.0499697.0028.210 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This restricting view purportedly ignored the oppressions women face determined by their race, class, and sexuality, and gave rise to women-of-color feminisms that separated from the [[women's liberation movement]], such as [[Black feminism]], [[Womanism|Africana womanism]], and the Hijas de Cuauhtémoc that emerged at California State University, Long Beach, which was founded by [[Anna Nieto-Gómez]], due to the [[Chicano Movement]]'s [[sexism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thompson |first=Becky |title=Multiracial Feminism: Recasting the Chronology of Second Wave Feminism |journal=Feminist Studies |year=2002 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=337–360 |doi=10.2307/3178747 |jstor=3178747 |s2cid=152165042 |hdl=2027/spo.0499697.0028.210 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Arrastía |first1=Lisa |last2=Watson |first2=Cathryn Merla |last3=Nagar |first3=Richa |date=December 7, 2007 |title=Black, Brown, Yellow and Left: Radical Activism in Los Angeles by Laura Pulido |journal=Antipode |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=943–947 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.2007.00564.x |issn=0066-4812|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dicochea |first=Perlita R. |date=2004 |title=Chicana Critical Rhetoric: Recrafting La Causa in Chicana Movement Discourse, 1970-1979 |journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=77–92 |doi=10.1353/fro.2004.0032 |s2cid=143518721 |issn=1536-0334}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]] coined the term "[[intersectionality]]" in 1989 in response to the white, middle-class views that dominated second-wave feminism.

Feminist scholars, particularly those from the late 20th and early 21st centuries to the present day, have revisited diverse writings,&lt;ref name=Douglas /&gt; oral histories, artwork, and artifacts of women of color, working-class women, and lesbians during the early 1960s to the early 1980s to decenter what they view as the dominant historical narratives of the second wave of the women's liberation movement, allowing the scope of the historical understanding of feminist consciousness to expand and transform. By recovering histories that they believe have been erased and overlooked, these scholars purport to establish what Maylei Blackwell termed "[[Retrofitting|retrofitted]] memory".{{sfnp|Blackwell|2011|pp=2–3}} Blackwell describes this as a form of "countermemory" that creates a transformative and fluid "alternative archive" and space for women's feminist consciousness within "hegemonic narratives".{{sfnp|Blackwell|2011|pp=2–3}} For Blackwell, looking within the gaps and crevices of the second wave allows fragments of historical knowledge and memory to be discovered, and new historical feminist subjects as well as new perspectives about the past to emerge, forcing existing dominant histories that claim to represent a [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] experience to be decentered and refocused.{{sfnp|Blackwell|2011|p=101}}
