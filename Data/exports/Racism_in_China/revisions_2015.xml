Ethnic issues have driven multiple Chinese historical movements, including [[Red Turban Rebellion]] — which targeted [[Mongol]] leaderships of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] — as well as in the [[Xinhai Revolution]] which overthrew the Manchus, [[Qing Dynasty]]. An ethnic dynamic is sometimes seen in modern unrest, such as the [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]].

==Racism and ethnic tensions in pre-modern China==

Pejorative statements about non-Han Chinese can be found in some ancient Chinese texts. For example, a 7th-century commentary to the [[Hanshu]] by [[Yan Shigu]] on the [[Wusun]] people likens "barbarians who have green eyes and red hair" to [[macaque]] monkeys.&lt;ref name="yanshigu"&gt;''[[Book of Han]]'', [http://www.guoxue123.com/shibu/0101/01hsyz/111.htm with commentary by Yan Shigu] '''Original text''':　烏孫於西域諸戎其形最異。今之胡人青眼、赤須，狀類彌猴者，本其種也。&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conflicts between different races and ethnicities resulted in genocide.  [[Ran Min]], a Han Chinese leader, during the [[Wei–Jie war]], massacred non-Chinese [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] peoples around 350 A.D. in retaliation for abuses against the Chinese population, with the [[Jie people]] particularly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ch04UBWfplQC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=ran+min+non+chinese&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_zNOTInoEIK88gbInd2-Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ran%20min%20non%20chinese&amp;f=false|title=China between empires: the northern and southern dynasties|author=Mark Edward Lewis|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|isbn=0-674-02605-5|page=76|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebels slaughtered many Arabs and Persian merchants in the [[Yangzhou massacre (760)]]. The Arab historian Abu Zayd Hasan of Siraf reports when the rebel [[Huang Chao]] captured Guang Prefecture, his army killed a large number of foreign merchants resident there: Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Parsees, in the [[Guangzhou massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Gabriel Ferrand |year=1922 | title=Voyage du marchand arabe Sulaymân en Inde et en Chine, rédigé en 851, suivi de remarques par Abû Zayd Hasan (vers 916)| pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign Arab and Persians residing in Quanzhou were massacred in the [[Ispah Rebellion]].

In the 20th century, the social and cultural critic [[Lu Xun]] commented that, "throughout the ages, Chinese have had only two ways of looking at foreigners, up to them as superior beings or down on them as wild animals." &lt;ref&gt;Simon Leys, ''Chinese Shadows'' (New York: The Viking Press, 1977), 1. Leys has noted that Lu Xun's polemical utterance can be applied to the Maoist bureaucracy at the time Leys wrote his book. However, Leys also pointed out that it would be unfair to apply Lu Xun's statement to the Chinese people in general. As according to Leys, the Chinese people themselves are friendly and hospitable to foreigners.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism and ethnic prejudice among minorities==

The [[Mongols]] divided different races into a four-class [[caste|caste system]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]].

The [[List of emperors of the Yuan Dynasty|Mongol Emperor]] [[Kublai Khan]] had introduced a hierarchy of reliability by dividing the population of the Yuan Dynasty into the following classes:

*Mongols
*[[Semu]]ren, immigrants from the west and some clans of [[Central Asia]] (Muslims, Christians, Jews, Buddhists)
*North Chinese, [[Kitans]], [[Jurchens]] and [[Koreans]]
*Southerners, or all subjects of the former Song Dynasty

Partner merchants and non-Mongol overseers were usually either immigrants or local ethnic groups. Thus, in China they were [[Turkestani]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] Muslims, and [[Christian]]s. Foreigners from outside the Mongol Empire entirely, such as the [[Marco Polo|Polo family]], were welcomed everywhere.

Despite the high position given to Muslims, the Yuan Mongols discriminated against them severely, restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like Circumcision, as well as [[Kosher]] butchering for Jews, forcing them to eat food the Mongol way. Genghis Khan directly called Muslims "slaves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QyhCTMOnLoL_8AbNt5DADw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=yuan%20dynasty%20halal&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=24|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QyhCTMOnLoL_8AbNt5DADw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=yuan%20dynasty%20halal&amp;f=false|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|author=Johan Elverskog|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=|pages=229, 230|isbn=0-8122-4237-8|pages=340|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end, corruption and persecution became so severe that Muslim Generals joined the [[Han Chinese]] in rebelling against the Mongols. The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim Generals including [[Lan Yu (general)|Lan Yu]] who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had the name which in Chinese means "baracks" or "thanks". Many Hui Muslims claim it is because they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and in thanks by the Han Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_hJ9aht6nZQC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=barracks+hui+mongol&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lSlCTPvjFMT48AbY9djrAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22barracks%22%20and%20%22thanks%20mongols&amp;f=false|title=Muslim Chinese: ethnic nationalism in the People's Republic|author=Dru C.

Uyghurs have also exhibited racism as well. The Uyghur leader [[Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki]] made the following proclamation on Han Chinese and Tungans ([[Hui people|Hui Muslims]]):

"The Tungans, more than the Han, are the enemy of our people. Today our people are already free from the oppression of the Han, but still continue under Tungan subjugation. We must still fear the Han, but cannot fear the Tungans also. The reason we must be careful to guard against the Tungans, we must intensely oppose, cannot afford to be polite. Since the Tungans have compelled us, we must be this way. Yellow Han people have not the slightest thing to do with Eastern Turkestan. Black Tungans also do not have this connection. Eastern Turkestan belongs to the people of Eastern Turkestan. There is no need for foreigners to come be our fathers and mothers...From now on we do not need to use foreigners language, or their names, their customs, habits, attitudes, written language, etc. We must also overthrow and drive foreigners from our boundaries forever. The colors yellow and black are foul. They have dirtied our land for too long. So now it is absolutely necessary to clean out this filth. Take down the yellow and black barbarians! Long live Eastern Turkestan!"&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Xinjiang Fengbao Qishinian [Xinjiang in Tumult for Seventy Years]'', 3393-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Islamic Republic of Eastern Turkestan and the Formation of Modern Uyghur Identity in Xinjiang'', by JOY R. LEE [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA455923]&lt;/ref&gt;

American telegrams reported that certain Uyghur mobs in parts of Xinjiang were calling for White Russians to be expelled from Xinjiang during the [[Ili Rebellion]], along with Han Chinese. They were reported to say, "We freed ourselves from the yellow men, now we must destroy the white". The telegram also reported that "Serious native attacks on people of other races frequent.  White Russians in terror of uprising."&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1947v07/reference/frus.frus1947v07.i0008.pdf UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO RESEOLVE POLITICAL PROBLEMS IN SINKIANG; EXTENT OF SOVIET AID AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO REBEL GROUPS IN SINKIANG; BORDER INCIDENT AT PEITASHAN]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 19th century around [[Qinghai]] tensions exploded between different Muslim sects, between different ethnic groups, with emminty and division rising between Hui Muslims and Salar Muslims, and all tensions rising between Muslims, Tibetans and Han.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nietupski|1999|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=xGvECiS-uEgC&amp;pg=PA82 82]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Encyclopædia of religion and ethics, Volume 8" stated that the Dungan and Panthay revolts by the Muslims was set off by racial antagonism and class warfare, rather than the mistaken assumption that it was all due to Islam and religion that the rebellions broke out.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia_893"/&gt;

==Racial and ethnic segregation==
Several laws enforcing [[racial segregation]] of foreigners were passed during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. In 779 AD, Tang dynasty issued an [[edict]] which forced [[Uyghur people|Uighurs]] to wear their ethnic dress, and restricted them from marrying Chinese.

In 836 AD Lu Chun was appointed as governor of [[Guangzhou|Canton]], he was disgusted to find Chinese living with foreigners and [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]]. Lu enforced separation, banning [[interracial marriage]]s, and restricting foreigners to own properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jqAGIL02BWQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=chinese+uighurs+779+edict+lure+canton+836+foreigners+and+chinese+lu+governor+forbade+marriages+forced+separate&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SOTQTPwQgYGUB5OXibUM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20uighurs%20779%20edict%20lure%20canton%20836%20foreigners%20and%20chinese%20lu%20governor%20forbade%20marriages%20forced%20separate&amp;f=false|title=The golden peaches of Samarkand: a study of Tʻang exotics|author=Edward H.

==Racial and ethnic composition==
China's [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic composition]] is largely homogeneous with 91.9% of the population being [[Han Chinese]], other ethnicities are [[Mongols]], [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Tibetans]], [[Uyghurs]] and [[Koreans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People|title= China|accessdate= 2007-04-24|publisher= [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ethnic groups are more distinguishable due to [[physical appearance]]s and relatively low [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] rates. Many others have intermarried with Han Chinese, and have similar appearances. They are therefore less distinguishable from Han Chinese people, especially because a growing number of ethnic minorities are fluent at a native level in Mandarin Chinese. In addition, children often adopts "ethnic minority status" at birth if one of their parents is an [[ethnic minority]], even though their ancestry is overwhelmingly Han Chinese. There is a growing number of [[White people|Europeans]], [[South Asian]]s, and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]] living in large Chinese cities. Although relatively few acquire Chinese citizenship, the number of immigrants belonging to different racial groups has markedly increased recently due to China's economic success{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. There are concentrated pockets of immigrants and foreign residents in some cities.

In May 2012, a 100-day crackdown on illegal foreigners in Beijing began, with many Beijing locals wary of foreign nationals as a result of recent crime events.&lt;ref name=steinfeld&gt;Jemimah Steinfeld, 25 May 2012, [http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/24/world/asia/china-foreigners/index.html?hpt=ias_t2 Mood darkens in Beijing amid crackdown on 'illegal foreigners'], CNN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;15 May 2012, [http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/05/15/beijing-pledges-to-clean-out-illegal-foreigners/ Beijing Pledges to ‘Clean Out’ Illegal Foreigners], China Real Time Report, Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt; [[China Central Television]] host Yang Rui made a controversial statement that "foreign trash" should be cleaned out of Beijing.&lt;ref name=steinfeld/&gt;

==Anti-Japanese sentiment==
{{Main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in China}}

Anti-Japanese sentiment exists in China, most of it stemming from [[Japanese war crimes]] committed in the country during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. [[Japanese history textbook controversies|History textbook revisionism]] in Japan and the denial or whitewashing of events such as the [[Nanking Massacre]] by right-wing Japanese groups has continued to inflame anti-Japanese feelings in China. It has been alleged that anti-Japanese sentiment in China is partially the result of political manipulation by the [[Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref name="fragile"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cceia.org/resources/transcripts/5425.html|title= China: Fragile Superpower: How China's Internal Politics Could Derail its Peaceful Rise |accessdate=2007-07-29 |date= 2007-04-05|author= Shirk, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[BBC]] report, anti-Japanese demonstrations are said to have received tacit approval from Chinese authorities, although the Chinese ambassador to Japan, Wang Yi, stated that the Chinese government does not condone such protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4429809.stm|title= China's anti-Japan rallies spread|date= 2005-04-10|publisher= [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tensions with Uyghurs==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''''“We have to conquer our own country and purify it of all infidels. Then, we should conquer the infidels’ countries and spread Islam. The infidels who are usurping our countries have announced war against Islam and Muslims, forcing Muslims to abandon Islam and change their beliefs.”''''' - [[Abdullah Mansour]], leader of the Uyghur separatist movement [[Turkistan Islamic Party]] (East Turkestan Islamic Movement), from “The Duty of Faith and Support,” Voice of Islam/al-Fajr Media Center, August 26, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/uploads/media/TM_008_04.pdf|title= Will Xinjiang’s Turkistani Islamic Party Survive the Drone Missile Death of its Leader?|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|journal=Terrorism Monitor|volume=8 |issue=10|first=Andrew|last=McGregor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a 1.7 growth in the Uyghur population in Xinjiang while there was a 4.4% growth from 1940-1982 in the Hui population in Xinjiang. Uyghur Muslims and Hui Muslims have experiened a growth in major tensions against each other due to the Hui population surging in its growth. Some old Uyghurs in [[Kashgar]] remember that the Hui army at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]] massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which caused tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=THis+dramatic+increase+in+the+hui+population+led+inevitably+to+significant+tensions+between+the+hui+and&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Uo0-lvm3LC&amp;sig=nSX6__Yia6RTdRn19YTIWt8cou4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gUpGTJm2EMSclgf0_oDoBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=This%20dramatic%20increase%20in%20the%20hui%20population%20led%20inevitably%20to%20significant%20tensions%20between%20the%20hui%20and&amp;f=false|title=Xinjiang: China's Muslim borderland|author=S.

==Tibetan racism and ethnic prejudice==

Ethnic [[Tibetan Muslims]] (called Kache in Tibetan) have lived peacefully alongside [[Tibetan Buddhist]]s for over a thousand years, because Buddhist Tibetans are prohibited by their religion from killing animals, yet require meat to survive in their mountain climate.

===Tibetan-Muslim sectarian violence===

In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibeans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]]'s rule in Qinghai such as [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]], but in 1949 the Communists put an end to to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the [[Tibetan exile]] community. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims.&lt;ref name="Demick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23|title=Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China|last=Demick|first=Barbara|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2010-06-28|deadurl=yes|date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking [[Kache]] minority of Muslims).&lt;ref name="Mayaram 2009 75"&gt;{{cite book| first = Shail |last=Mayaram| title = The other global city| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=tOZ1pBTJvp4C}}| accessdate = 2010-07-30| year = 2009| publisher = Taylor Francis US| isbn = 0-415-99194-3| page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Chinese government supports and backs up the Hui Muslims, the Tibetans deliberately attack the Hui Muslims as a way to demonstrate anti-government sentiment and because they have a background of sectarian violence against each other since Ma Bufang's rule due to their separate religions and ethnicity and Tibetans resent Hui economic domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2012/11/tibetan-protest|title=The living picture of frustration |author=A.A. |date=Nov 11, 2012 &lt;!-- 8:26 --&gt; |accessdate=2014-01-15|newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnic slurs==

===Against Europeans and Westerners===
{{Main|Anti-Western sentiment in China}}

*[[Yang guizi|洋鬼子]] (''yáng guǐzi'') - "Western devil", a derogatory term for [[white people]] or [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] popularized during the [[First Opium War]], when the British empire waged and won a war so that their merchants could legally sell opium. This term is no longer widely used.
*鬼佬 (''guǐlǎo'') - Borrowed from Cantonese "[[Gweilo]]", literally "ghost guy", a slur for White people. 
*红毛 (''[[ang mo]]'') - "Red Hair" or "Red Fur", a slur used by [[Hokkien]] ([[Min-nan]]) people in Taiwan and Singapore to primarily refer to Dutch colonists who settled in [[Taiwan]] and British colonists who settled in Singapore during the 17th century and early 19th century respectively.
*毛子 (''máo zi'') - literally “body hair”, it is a derogatory term for Caucasian peoples. However, because most white people in contact with China were Russians before the 19th century, 毛子 became a derogatory term that refers specifically to Russians.&lt;ref&gt;2012-05-02, [http://www.focustt.com/2012/0502/12751.shtml 中俄军演刚结束:毛子这举动让北京狼狈不堪!] (China-Russia military exercises conclude, the actions of ''Mao zi'' force Beijing into a dilemma), 环球视线&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2012-08-26, [http://www.cankaoa.com/bbs/201208/thread_52633_1.html 毛子告诉中国：美国佬不敢惹俄罗斯只是因为这] (''Mao zi'' tell China: Yankees won't mess with Russia because of this), 参考啊&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Frank Dikötter]] explains.
&lt;blockquote&gt;A common historical response to serious threats directed towards a symbolic universe is 'nihilation', or the conceptual liquidation of everything inconsistent with official doctrine. Foreigners were labelled 'barbarians' or 'devils' to be conceptually eliminated. The official rhetoric reduced the Westerner to a devil, a ghost, an evil and unreal goblin hovering on the border of humanity. Many texts of the first half of the nineteenth century referred to the English as 'foreign devils' (''yangguizi''), 'devil slaves' (''guinu''), 'barbarian devils' (''fangui''), 'island barbarians' (''daoyi''), 'blue-eyed barbarian slaves' (''biyan yinu''), or 'red-haired barbarians' (''hongmaofan'').&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank (1992). The Discourse of Race in Modern China. Stanford University Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Against indigenous peoples===
*番鬼 (Fan Guai) -  a slur that is used by some Southern Chinese from the Guangdong area to refer to foreigners, where 番 (Fan) means "Tribal people". In the past, The [[Minnan]] and [[Chaozhou]] people used 山番 (mountain tribal people) and 生番 (raw tribal people) to describe the [[Taiwanese aborigines|natives and aboriginals of Taiwan]].

===Against Japanese===
[[File:2012 Anti-Japan demonstrations7.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Demonstrators in Taiwan host signs telling "Japanese devils" to "get out" of the [[Senkaku Islands]] following an escalation in disputes in 2012.]]
*[[Xiao riben|小日本]] (xiǎo Rìběn) — Literally "little Japan"(ese). This term is so common that it has very little impact left (Google Search returns 21,000,000 results as of August 2007). The term can be used to refer to either Japan or individual Japanese. "小", or the word "little", is usually construed as "puny", "lowly" or "small country", but not "spunky".
*[[Riben guizi|日本鬼子]] (Rìběn guǐzi) — Literally "Japanese devil". This is used mostly in the context of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], when Japan invaded and occupied large areas of China. This is the title of [[Japanese Devils|a Japanese documentary on Japanese war crimes during WWII]].
*倭 (Wō) — An ancient [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name for Japan, but it was also adopted by the Japanese, pronounced [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]. In current Chinese usage, Wō is usually intended to give a negative connotation (see Wōkòu below). Two commonly proposed etymologies for this word are "submissive; obedient" or "dwarf; short person".&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Michael (1992). "Wa 倭 Wa 和 Lexicography." ''International Journal of Lexicography'' 5.1, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 7th century, Japanese scribes replaced 倭 (Wō/Wa) with 和  (Hé/Wa) meaning "harmony."
*倭寇 (Wōkòu) — Originally referred to Japanese pirates and armed sea merchants who raided the Chinese coastline during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (see [[Wokou]]). The term was adopted during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] to refer to invading Japanese forces, (similarly to Germans being called [[Hun]]s). 
*自慰队 (zì wèi duì) - A pun on the homophone "自卫队" (zì wèi duì, literally "Self-Defence Forces", see [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]), the definition of 慰 (wèi) used is "to comfort". This phrase is used to refer to Japanese (whose military force is known as "自卫队") being stereotypically hypersexual, as "自慰队" means "Self-comforting Forces", referring to [[masturbation]].
*架佬 (Ga Lou)-A neutral term for Japanese used by Cantonese (especially Hong Kong Cantonese), because Japanese use a lot of "Ga" at the end of a sentence. 架妹 (Ga Mui) is used for female Japanese.
* [[:zh:蘿蔔頭|蘿蔔頭]] (Lo Baat Tau) — Literally meaning "Radish Head," used by the Cantonese to refer to the Japanese during World War II. This term was a reference to the popular Japanese hair style at the time which was regarded as making their heads look like a [[Daikon|white radish]].

===Against Koreans===
*[[:zh:高麗棒子|高丽棒子]] (Gāolì bàng zǐ) - Derogatory term used against all ethnic Koreans. 高丽 ([[Traditional Chinese character|Traditional]]: 高麗) refers to Ancient Korea ([[Goryeo|Koryo]]), while 棒子 means ''"club"'' or ''"corncob"'', referring to the weapon used by the puppet Korean police during the Anti-Japanese War of China.
*[[Er guizi|二鬼子]] (èr guǐ zǐ)&lt;ref name=people20111216&gt;[http://dangshi.people.com.cn/BIG5/16632423.html 第一滴血──從日方史料還原平型關之戰日軍損失 (6)] News of the Communist Party of China December 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; - A disparaging designation of puppet armies and traitors during the Anti-Japanese War of China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nciku.com/search/zh/detail/%E4%BA%8C%E9%AC%BC%E5%AD%90/99788?query=during&amp;internal=true Comprehensive Chinese-English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddict&amp;wdqchi=%E4%BA%8C%E9%AC%BC%E5%AD%90&amp;wdrst=0&amp;wdqchim=3&amp;wddmtm=1 mdbg Chinese English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese were known as "鬼子" (devil), and the 二鬼子 literally means "second devils". During World War II, some [[Korean people|Koreans]] were involved in Imperial Japanese Army, and so 二鬼子 refers to [[hanjian]] and ethnic Koreans. The definition of 二鬼子 has changed throughout time{{Or|date=September 2008}}, with modern slang usage entirely different from its original meaning during World War II and the subsequent [[Chinese civil war]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===Against Africans and Blacks===
*黑鬼 (hei guǐ) - "Black devil"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2009-07/31/content_8496740.htm|title= The disunited colors of prejudice|author= Hooi, Alexis|date= 2009-07-31|work= |publisher= China Daily|accessdate=2009-11-24|quote= Even now, some Guangzhou residents might admit using the generic and derogatory term "hei gui" or "ghost" to refer to Africans in the community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against Indians===
*阿差 (Ah Cha)-Ah Cha means "Good" in some Indian languages, is a derogatory Cantonese term used against Indians. During the 1950s-1970s, there were many Indians working in Hong Kong as laborers, or doormen, especially doormen for hotels.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
*阿三 (A Sae) or 红头阿三 (Ghondeu Asae) - Originally a Shanghainese term used against South Asians. This term is now used in Mandarin as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edubridge.com/erxiantang/l2/asan.htm|title=上海滩的"红头阿三"|author= |date= |work= |publisher=|accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against mixed races===
*erzhuanzi (二转子) children who are mixed Uyghur and Han.&lt;ref name="David Westerlund, Ingvar Svanberg 1999 204"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ildikó Bellér-Hann 2007 223"/&gt; This term "Erh-hun-tze", was said by European explorers in the 19th century to refer to a people who were descended from a mixture of Chinese, Taghliks, and Mongols living in the area from Ku-ch'eng-tze to Barköl in Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yBO3pmzzhWkC&amp;pg=PA526&amp;dq=erh-hun-tze+a+mongols+chinese+inhabit&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=81-GTazoJYHQgAfrnfDYCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=erh-hun-tze%20a%20mongols%20chinese%20inhabit&amp;f=false|title=Journal Of Urusvati Himalayan Research Institute, Volumes 1-3|author=Roerich Museum, George Roerich|year=2003|publisher=Vedams eBooks (P) Ltd|location=|page=526|isbn=81-7936-011-3|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthographic pejoratives==
{{main|Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese}}

[[Chinese orthography]] can provide opportunities to write ethnic insults [[logograph]]ically that do not exist in alphabetical languages. Some [[Chinese characters]] used to [[transcription into Chinese characters|transcribe]] the names of non-Chinese peoples were graphically pejorative [[ethnic slurs]], where the insult derived not from the Chinese word but from the character used to write it. For example, the name of the [[Yao people]] used to be transcribed as [[wikt:猺|猺]], a character which also means "jackal" and is written with the [[Radical 94|dog radical]] 犭. This name for the Yao was chosen by 11th-century [[Song dynasty]] authors, but has been replaced twice under 20th-century language reforms: first with the invented character ''yao'' [[wikt:傜|傜]] (with the [[Radical 9|human radical]] 亻); then with ''yao'' [[wikt:瑤|瑤]] (with the [[Radical 96|jade radical]] 玉), which can also mean "precious jade". These characters have the same pronunciation, but they have different radicals which convey different connotations.
