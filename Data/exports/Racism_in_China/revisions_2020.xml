'''Ethnic issues in China''' arise from [[History of China|Chinese history]], [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]], and other factors. They have driven historical movements such as the [[Red Turban Rebellion]] (which targeted the [[Mongol]] leadership of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]) and the [[Xinhai Revolution]], which overthrew the [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]]. Ethnic tensions have led to [[List of ethnic riots#China|incidents]] in the country such as the [[Xinjiang conflict]], the [[2010 Tibetan language protest]], the [[2020 Inner Mongolia protests]], [[Anti-Western sentiment in China]] and discrimination against Africans and people of African descent.

{{main|Demographics of China}}
{{See also|Heihe–Tengchong Line|Qinling–Huaihe Line|Administrative divisions of China|Template:PRC provinces big imagemap|Autonomous administrative divisions of China|Autonomous regions of China|}}

China is a largely homogenous society; over 90% of its population has historically been [[Han Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People|title= China|access-date= 2007-04-24|publisher= [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the country's [[List of ethnic groups in China and Taiwan|ethnic groups]] are distinguishable by [[physical appearance]] and relatively-low [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] rates. Others have married Han Chinese and resemble them. A growing number of ethnic minorities are fluent at a native level in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Children sometimes receive ethnic-minority status at birth if one of their parents belongs to an [[ethnic minority]], even if their ancestry is predominantly Han Chinese. Pockets of immigrants and foreign residents exist in some cities.

A 100-day crackdown on illegal foreigners in Beijing began in May 2012, with Beijing residents wary of foreign nationals due to recent crimes.&lt;ref name=steinfeld&gt;Jemimah Steinfeld, 25 May 2012, [http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/24/world/asia/china-foreigners/index.html?hpt=ias_t2 Mood darkens in Beijing amid crackdown on 'illegal foreigners'], CNN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;15 May 2012, [https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/05/15/beijing-pledges-to-clean-out-illegal-foreigners/ Beijing Pledges to ‘Clean Out’ Illegal Foreigners], China Real Time Report, Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt; [[China Central Television]] host Yang Rui said, controversially, that "foreign trash" should be cleaned out of the capital.&lt;ref name=steinfeld/&gt;

China is the most populated country in the world and its national population density (137/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is similar to [[List of countries by population density|those]] of [[Switzerland]] and the [[Czech Republic]]. The overall population density of China conceals major regional variations, the western and northern part have a few million people, while eastern half has about 1.3&amp;nbsp;billion. The vast majority of China's population lives near the east in major cities.
&lt;!--
In 1986 about 94% of the population lived on approximately 36% of the land.
But overall density was about 109 people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Density was only about one-third that of [[Demography of Japan|Japan]] and less than that of many other countries in Asia and in Europe.{{Reference necessary|date=June 2011}}
--&gt;

In the 11 provinces, special municipalities, and autonomous regions along the southeast coast, population density was 320.6 people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Broadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the [[Yangtze River Valley]] (of which the delta region was the most populous), [[Sichuan Basin]], [[North China Plain]], [[Pearl River Delta]], and the industrial area around the city of [[Shenyang]] in the northeast.

Population is most sparse in the mountainous, desert, and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest. In [[Inner Mongolia]] Autonomous Region, portions are completely uninhabited, and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[Inner Mongolia]], Xinjiang, and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] autonomous regions and [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]] account for 55% of the country's land area but in 1985 contained only 5.7% of its population.

==Language issues in China==
{{Main|Languages of China}}

There are several hundred '''languages in China'''. The predominant language is [[Standard Chinese]], which is based on central [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], but there are hundreds of related [[Chinese language]]s, collectively known as ''Hanyu'' ({{zh|s=汉语|t=漢語|p=Hànyǔ}}, 'Han language'), that are spoken by 92% of the population. The Chinese (or 'Sinitic') languages are typically divided into [[Varieties of Chinese|seven major language groups]], and their study is a distinct academic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Xinjiang Conflict: Uyghur Identity, Language Policy, and Political Discourse | last=Dwyer | first=Arienne | series=Political Studies 15 | publisher=East-West Center | location=Washington | year=2005 | isbn=978-1-932728-29-3 | url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS015.pdf | pages=31–32 | quote=Tertiary institutions with instruction in the languages and literatures of the regional minorities (e.g., Xinjiang University) have faculties entitled ''Hanyu xi'' ("Languages of China Department") and ''Hanyu wenxue xi'' ("Literatures of the Languages of China Department").}}&lt;/ref&gt; They differ as much from each other [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] and [[phonetic]]ally as do English, German and Danish. There are in addition approximately 300 [[Ethnic minorities in China|minority languages]] spoken by the remaining 8% of the population of China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CN Languages of China] – from Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. "The number of individual languages listed for China is 299. "&lt;/ref&gt; The ones with greatest state support are [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] and [[Standard Zhuang|Zhuang]].

Cantonese is a [[varieties of Chinese|variety]] of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] spoken in the city of [[Guangzhou]] (also known as Canton) and its surrounding area in [[southeastern China]]. It is the traditional [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige variety]] and [[Standard language|standard form]] of [[Yue Chinese]], one of the major subgroups of Chinese. [[Mandarin Chinese]] as their first language, accounting for 71% of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;Mikael Parkvall, "Världens 100 största språk 2007" (The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007), in Nationalencyklopedin.

==History==
===Racial and Ethnic Conflicts in Imperial China===
[[File:1900 killing of foreigners.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=See caption|1861 [[Woodblock printing|woodblock print]] of Chinese officials executing Westerners]]
[[Racial slurs]] by the ruling Han Chinese in [[History of China#Imperial China|imperial China]] has been documented in historical texts such as [[Yan Shigu]]'s commentary on the ''[[Book of Han]]'', in which the [[Wusun]] people were called "barbarians who have green eyes and red hair" and compared to [[macaque]]s.&lt;ref name="yanshigu"&gt;''[[Book of Han]]'', [http://www.guoxue123.com/shibu/0101/01hsyz/111.htm with commentary by Yan Shigu] '''Original text''':　烏孫於西域諸戎其形最異。今之胡人青眼、赤須，狀類彌猴者，本其種也。&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massacres of Jie===
Some ethnic conflicts were violent. During the 350 AD [[Wei–Jie war]], the Chinese leader [[Ran Min]] massacred non-Chinese [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] in retaliation for abuses against the Chinese population; the [[Jie people]] were particularly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chinabetweenempi00lewi|url-access=registration|quote=ran min non chinese.|title=China between empires: the northern and southern dynasties|author=Mark Edward Lewis|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02605-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/chinabetweenempi00lewi/page/76 76]|access-date=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jie people#History|Jie were identified by their big noses and beards]] while being slaughtered.

Rebels slaughtered Arab and Persian merchants in the [[Yangzhou massacre (760)]]. They were killed by Chinese rebels under Tian Shengong (T'ien Shen-kung).

===Yuan dynasty===
[[File:Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms 923 CE.png|thumb|200px|[[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]]]

The [[Mongols]] divided groups into a four-class [[caste|caste system]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Merchants and non-Mongol overseers were usually immigrants or local ethnic groups: [[Turkestani]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] Muslims and [[Christians]]. Foreigners from outside the Mongol Empire, such as the [[Marco Polo|Polo family]], were welcomed.

Bukhara and Samarqand were visited by [[Qiu Chuji|Changchun]]. At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara and Samarqand in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. The surname of Li was held by one of Yelu Ahai's staff of Han Chinese. There were various Chinese craftsmen. Tangut, Khitan and Han Chinese took control over gardens and fields from the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=41930343 |journal=Journal of Asian History |title=Sino-Khitan administration in Mongol Bukhara |last=Buell |first=Paul D. |volume=13 |issue=2 |date=1979 |pages=135–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq, Almaliq, and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers.&lt;ref name="Biran2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michal Biran|title=The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B934LaVBaz8C&amp;pg=PA96 |date=15 September 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84226-6|pages=96–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called "Right Alan Guard" which was combined with "recently surrendered" soldiers, Mongols, and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former [[Kingdom of Qocho]] and in Besh Balikh the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi (Ch'i Kung-chih).&lt;ref name="Rossabi1983 2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Morris Rossabi|title=China Among Equals: The Middle Kingdom and Its Neighbors, 10th-14th Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNpD5UKmkswC&amp;pg=PA255 |year=1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04562-0|pages=255–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Mongol conquest by Genghis Khan, foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays (Khitans) of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them.&lt;ref name="E.J.W. Gibb"&gt;{{cite book|title=E.J.W. Gibb memorial series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35pFAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA451 |year=1928|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |others=E.

Despite the Muslims' high position, the Yuan Mongols discriminated against them: restricting [[halal]] slaughter and other Islamic practices, such as [[circumcision]] (and [[kosher]] butchering for Jews).

[[Ming dynasty]] founder [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang]] had Muslim generals (including [[Lan Yu (general)|Lan Yu]]) who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in battle. [[Semu]]-caste Muslims revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah rebellion, although the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims massacred by Yuan commander Chen Youding.

====Anti-Muslim persecution by the Yuan dynasty and Ispah rebellion====
{{main|Ispah rebellion}}
The Yuan dynasty started passing anti-Muslim and anti-Semu laws and getting rid of Semu Muslim privileges towards the end of the Yuan dynasty, in 1340 forcing them to follow Confucian principles in marriage regulations, in 1329 all foreign holy men including Muslims had tax exemptions revoked, in 1328 the position of Muslim Qadi was abolished after its powers were limited in 1311. In the middle of the 14th century this caused Muslims to start rebelling against Mongol Yuan rule and joining rebel groups. In 1357-1367 the Yisibaxi Muslim Persian garrison started the [[Ispah rebellion]] against the Yuan dynasty in Quanzhou and southern Fujian. Persian merchants Amin ud-Din (Amiliding) and Saif ud-Din) Saifuding led the revolt. Persian official Yawuna assassinated both Amin ud-Din and Saif ud-Din in 1362 and took control of the Muslim rebel forces. The Muslim rebels tried to strike north and took over some parts of Xinghua but were defeated at Fuzhou two times and failed to take it. Yuan provincial loyalist forces from Fuzhou defeated the Muslim rebels in 1367 after A Muslim rebel officer named Jin Ji defected from Yawuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liu 刘|first1=Yingsheng 迎胜|title=The East Asian Mediterranean: Maritime Crossroads of Culture, Commerce and Human Migration|date=2008|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3447058094|editor1-last=Schottenhammer|editor1-first=Angela|edition=illustrated|volume=Volume 6 of East Asian economic and socio-cultural studies: East Asian maritime history|page=121|chapter=Muslim Merchants in Mongol Yuan China|issn=1860-1812|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&amp;q=muslim+persecution&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2020}}

The Muslim merchants in Quanzhou who engaged in maritime trade enriched their families which encompassed their political and trade activities as families. Historian [[John W. Chaffee]] saw the violent Chinese backlash that happened at the end of the Yuan dynasty against the wealth of the Muslim and Semu as something probably inevitable, although anti-Muslim and anti-Semu laws had already been passed by the Yuan dynasty. In 1340 all marriages had to follow Confucian rules, in 1329 all foreign holy men and clerics including Muslims no longer were exempt from tax, in 1328 the Qadi (Muslim headmen) were abolished after being limited in 1311. This resulted in anti-Mongol sentiment among Muslims so some anti-Mongol rebels in the mid 14th century were joined by Muslims. Quanzhou came under control of Amid ud-Din (Amiliding) and Saif ud-Din (Saifuding), two Persian military officials in 1357 as they revolted against the Mongols from 1357-1367 in southern Fujian and Quanzhou, leading the Persian garrison (Ispah) They fought for Fuzhou and Xinghua for 5 years. Both Saifuding and Amiliding were murdered by another Muslim called Nawuna in 1362 so he then took control of Quanzhou and the Ispah garrison for 5 more years until his defeat by the Yuan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chaffee |first1=John W. |title=The Muslim Merchants of Premodern China: The History of a Maritime Asian Trade Diaspora, 750–1400 |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1108640091 |page=157 |series=New Approaches to Asian History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfBmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yuan Massacres of Muslims====
The historian Chen Dasheng theorized that Sunni-Shia sectarian war contributed to the Ispah rebellion, claiming that the Pu family and their in-law Yawuna were Sunnis and there before the Yuan while Amiliding and Saifuding's Persian soldiers were Shia originally in central China and moved to Quanzhou and that Jin Ji was a Shia who defected to Chen Youding after Sunni Yawuna killed Amiliding and Saifuding. Three fates befell the Muslims and foreigners in Quanzhou, the ones in the Persian garrison were slaughtered, many Persians and Arab merchants fled abroad by ships, another small group that adopted Chinese culture were expelled into coastal Baiqi, Chendi, Lufu and Zhangpu and mountainous Yongchun and Dehua and one other part took refuge in Quanzhou's mosques. The genealogies of Muslim families which survived the transition are the main source of information for the rebellion times. The Rongshan Li family, one of the Muslim survivors of the violence in the Yuan-Ming transition period wrote about their ancestors Li Lu during the rebellion who was a businessman and shipped things, using his private stores to feed hungry people during the rebellion and using his connections to keep safe. The Ming takeover after the end of the Persian garrison meant that the diaspora of incoming Muslims ended. After the Persian garrison full and the rebellion was crushed, the common people started a slaughter of the Pu family and all Muslims: ''All of the Western peoples were annihilated, with a number of foreigners with large and big noses mistakenly killed while for three days the gates were closed and the executions were carried out. The corpses of the Pus were all stripped naked, their faces to the west. ... They were all judged according to the "five mutilating punishments" and then executed with their carcasses throwing into pig troughs. This was in revenge for their murder and rebellion in the Song.’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liu 刘 |first1=Yingsheng 迎胜 |editor1-last=Schottenhammer |editor1-first=Angela |title=The East Asian Mediterranean: Maritime Crossroads of Culture, Commerce and Human Migration |date=2008 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3447058094 |page=122 |edition=illustrated |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&amp;pg=PA122 |volume=Volume 6 of East Asian economic and socio-cultural studies: East Asian maritime history |issn=1860-1812 |chapter=Muslim Merchants in Mongol Yuan China}}&lt;/ref&gt; (“是役也，凡西域人尽歼之，胡发高鼻有误杀者，闭门行诛三日。”“凡蒲尸皆裸体，面西方……悉令具五刑而诛之，弃其哉于猪槽中。”)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=朱元璋为什么要将蒲寿庚家族中男的世世为奴，女的代代为娼？ |url=https://www.sohu.com/a/336088558_120049831 |agency=Sohu |date=2019-08-24&lt;!-- 14:30--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=蒲寿庚背叛宋朝投降元朝，为何蒲家后人却遭到元廷残酷打压！ |url=https://www.360kuai.com/pc/9ff5e9a894a3ff2c9?cota=3&amp;kuai_so=1&amp;sign=360_7bc3b157 |access-date=2020-02-07 |work=360kuai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=南宋胡商蒲寿庚背叛南宋，他的子孙在明朝遭到怎样的对待？ |url=https://share.wukongwenda.cn/answer/6657878697367830798/ |work=wukongwenda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=朱元璋最恨的一个姓，男的世世为奴，女的世世代代为娼！ |url=https://xw.qq.com/cmsid/20190820A05CQO00 |work=优质资讯推荐 |date=2019-08-20&lt;!-- 10:02--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=朱元璋为什么要将蒲寿庚家族中男的世世为奴，女的代代为娼？ |url=https://new.qq.com/omn/20190824/20190824A0DKV100.html?pc |work=优质资讯推荐 |date=2019-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=此人屠殺三千宋朝皇族，死後被人挖墳鞭屍，朱元璋：家族永世為娼 原文網址：https://kknews.cc/history/xqx8g3q.html |url=https://kknews.cc/history/xqx8g3q.html |work=每日頭條 |agency=每日頭條 |date=2018-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=蒲寿庚背叛宋朝投降元朝，为何蒲家后人却遭到元廷残酷打压 |url=https://k.sina.cn/article_1141244644_440602e400100fs2v.html |work=新浪首页 |agency=新浪首页 |date=12 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=此人屠杀三千宋朝皇族，死后被人挖坟鞭尸，朱元璋：家族永世为娼 |url=http://www.bajieyou.com/new/fc234fa20f0e4a9cba16fe2aca95b030 |work=最新新闻 英雄联盟 |agency=最新新闻 英雄联盟 |date=2019-11-26&lt;!-- 15:49:33--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

80 merchant ships were commanded by Fo Lian, from Bahrain who was Pu Shougeng's son-in-law. The Qais born Supterintendent of Taxes for Persian and the Island, Jamal al-din Ibrahim Tibi had a son who was sent in 1297-1305 as an envoy to China. Wassaf, and Arab historian said that Jamal became wealthy due to trade with India and China. Patronage networks and monopolies controlled Yuan maritime trade unlike in the Song dynasty where foreigners and Chinese of the Song merchant elite reaped profits. Quanzhou's end as an international trading port was rapid as in 1357 rebellions borke out in central China so the Persian merchants Amin ud-din (Amiliding) and Saif ud-din (Saifuding) led soldiers to take over Quanzhou. A Pu family relative by marriage, Yawuna, another Muslim assassinated those two. The Muslim rebels of the Persian garrison in Quanzhou lasted a decade by exploiting maritime trade and plunder. Yawuna and his army were captured and defeated by provincial forces in 1366 and then the Ming took over Quanzhou 2 years later in 1368. Maritime trade was regulated and implemented extremely differently in the Ming dynasty. Guangzhou, Ningbo and Quanzhou all had maritime trade offices but they were limited to specific areas. The South Sea trade was no longer permitted in Quanzhou and only trade with Ryukyu was allowed in Quanzhou. The Muslim community in Quanzhou became a target of the people's anger. In the streets there was widescale slaughter of "big nosed" westerners and Muslims as recorded in a genealogical account of a Muslim family. The era of Quanzhou as an international trading port of Asia ended as did the role of Muslims as merchant diaspora in Quanzhou. Some Muslims fled by sea or land as they were persecuted by the locals and others tried to hide and lay low as depicted in the genealogies of Quanzhou Muslims despite the Ming emperors attempted to issue laws tolerating Islam in 1407 and 1368 and putting the notices in mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chaffee |first1=John |editor1-last=Hall |editor1-first=Kenneth R. |title=Secondary Cities and Urban Networking in the Indian Ocean Realm, C. 1400-1800 |date=2008 |publisher=Lexington Books |series=G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |isbn=978-0739128350 |page=115 |volume=Volume 1 of Comparative urban studies |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gyPjBevBHxcC&amp;pg=PA115 |chapter=4 At the Intersection of Empire and World Trade: The Chinese Port City of Quanzhou (Zaitun), Eleventh-Fifteenth Centuries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qais was the island of [[Kish]]{{disambiguation needed|date=November 2020}} and its king Jamal al-Din Ibrahim bin Muhammad al-Tibi briefly seized control of Hormuz while he traded with China and India and earned great wealth from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Park |first1=Hyunhee |title=Mapping the Chinese and Islamic Worlds: Cross-Cultural Exchange in Pre-Modern Asia |date=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1107018686 |page=151 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-2iWcxD2e8C&amp;pg=PA151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Sayyid [[Ajall Shams al-Din Omar]]'s descendants, the [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]] [[Ding (surname)|Ding]] fled to Chendai (Jinjiang) on the coast of Quanzhou to avoid the violence of the Ispah rebellion. The Li family survived through philanthropy activities however they said that in the rebellion "great families scattered from their homes, which were burned by the soldiers, and few genealogies survived." and used the words "a bubbling cauldron" to describe Quanzhou. In 1368 Quanzhou came under Ming control and the atmosphere calmed down for the Muslims. The Ming [[Yongle emperor]] issued decrees of protection from individuals and officials in mosques such as Quanzhou mosques and his father before him [[Ming Taizu]] had support from Muslim generals in his wars to reunify the country so he showed tolerance to them. The Ming passed some laws saying that Muslims not use Chinese surnames. Some genealogies of Muslims like the Li family show debate over teaching Confucian culture and classics like [[The Book of Odes|Odes]] and [[Book of Documents|History]] or to practice Islam. Ming Taizu passed laws concerning maritime trade which were the major impact upon the life of Quanzhou Muslims. He restricted official maritime trade in Quanzhou to [[Ryukyu]] and [[Guangzhou]] was to monopolize south sea trade in the 1370s and 1403-1474 after initial getting rid of the Office of Maritime Trade altogether in 1370. Up to the late 16th century, private trade was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liu 刘 |first1=Yingsheng 迎胜 |editor1-last=Schottenhammer |editor1-first=Angela |title=The East Asian Mediterranean: Maritime Crossroads of Culture, Commerce and Human Migration |date=2008 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3447058094 |page=123 |edition=illustrated |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&amp;pg=PA123 |volume=Volume 6 of East Asian economic and socio-cultural studies: East Asian maritime history |issn=1860-1812 |chapter=Muslim Merchants in Mongol Yuan China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian Sunni Muslims Sayf al-din (Sai-fu-ding) and Awhad al-Din (A-mi-li-ding) started the Ispah rebellion in 1357 against the Yuan dynasty in Quanzhou and attempted to reach Fuzhou, capital of Fujian. Yuan general Chen Youding defeated the Muslim rebels and slaughtered Muslims of foreign descent in Quanzhou and areas next to Quanzhou. This led to many Muslim foreign fleeing to Java and other places in Southeast Asia to escape the massacres, spreading the Islamic religion. [[Gresik]] was ruled by a person from China's Guangdong province and it had a thousand Chinese families who moved there in the 14th century with the name Xin Cun (New Village) in Chinese. THis information was reported by [[Ma Huan]] who accompanied [[Zheng He]] to visit Java in the 15th century. Ma Huan also mentions Guangdong was the source of many Muslims from China who moved to Java.  Cu Cu/Jinbun was said to be Chinese. And like most Muslims form China, [[Wali Sanga]] [[Sunan Giri]] was Hanafi according to [[Stamford Raffles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wain |first1=Alexander |editor1-last=Peacock |editor1-first=A.

In 1366 the Mongols slaughtered the Sunni Muslims of Quanzhou and ended the rebellion. The Yuan dynasty's violent end saw repeated slaughters of Muslims until the Ming dynasty in 1368. The role of trade in Quanzhou ended as Sunni Muslims fled to Southeast Asia from Quanzhou. The surviving Muslims who fled Quanzhou moved to Manila bay, Brunei, Sumatra, Java and Champa to trade. Zheng He's historian Ma Huan noticed the presence of these Muslim traders in Southeast Asia who had fled form China in his voyages in [[Barus]] in Sumatra, [[Trengganu]] on the Malayan peninsula, Brunei and Java. The Nine Wali Sanga who converted Java to Islam had Chinese names and originated from Chinese speaking Quanzhou Muslims who fled there in the 14th century around 1368.

Ethnic resentment resurfaced in at the end of the Qing Dynasty, in the early 20th century, as expemplified by Uyghur leader [[Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki]]'s remarks about ROC Chinese and Tungans ([[Hui people|Hui Muslims]]):

{{quote|The Tungans, more than the Han, are the enemy of our people. Today our people are already free from the oppression of the Han, but still continue under Tungan subjugation. We must still fear the Han, but cannot fear the Tungans also. The reason we must be careful to guard against the Tungans, we must intensely oppose, cannot afford to be polite. Since the Tungans have compelled us, we must be this way. Yellow Han people have not the slightest thing to do with Eastern Turkestan. Black Tungans also do not have this connection. Eastern Turkestan belongs to the people of Eastern Turkestan. There is no need for foreigners to come be our fathers and mothers ... From now on we do not need to use foreigners language, or their names, their customs, habits, attitudes, written language, etc. We must also overthrow and drive foreigners from our boundaries forever. The colors yellow and black are foul. They have dirtied our land for too long. So now it is absolutely necessary to clean out this filth. Take down the yellow and black barbarians! Long live Eastern Turkestan!"&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Xinjiang Fengbao Qishinian [Xinjiang in Tumult for Seventy Years]'', 3393-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"&gt;''The Islamic Republic of Eastern Turkestan and the Formation of Modern Uyghur Identity in Xinjiang'', by JOY R.

An American telegram reported that Uyghur groups in parts of Xinjiang demanded the expulsion of White Russians and Han Chinese from Xinjiang during the [[Ili Rebellion]]. The Uyghurs reportedly said, "We freed ourselves from the yellow men, now we must destroy the white". According to the telegram, "Serious native attacks on people of other races frequent.

===Anti-Japanese sentiment===
{{Main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in China}}
Anti-Japanese sentiment primarily stems from [[Japanese war crimes]] which were committed during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. [[Japanese history textbook controversies|History-textbook revisionism]] in Japan and the denial (or [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]]) of events such as the [[Nanking Massacre]] by the Japanese far-right  has continued to inflame anti-Japanese feeling in China. It has been alleged that anti-Japanese sentiment is also partially the result of political manipulation by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP).&lt;ref name="fragile"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cceia.org/resources/transcripts/5425.html|title= China: Fragile Superpower: How China's Internal Politics Could Derail its Peaceful Rise|access-date= 2007-07-29|date= 2007-04-05|author= Shirk, Susan|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070707074249/http://www.cceia.org/resources/transcripts/5425.html|archive-date= 2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[BBC]] report, anti-Japanese demonstrations received tacit approval from Chinese authorities (although Chinese ambassador to Japan [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]] said that the Chinese government does not condone such protests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4429809.stm|title= China's anti-Japan rallies spread|date= 2005-04-10|work= [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Tibetans clash with the Hui (known as ''Kyangsha'' in Tibetan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Tibetans and [[Mongols]] refused to allow other ethnic groups (such as the [[Kazakhs]]) to participate in a ritual  ceremony in [[Qinghai]] until Muslim general [[Ma Bufang]] reformed the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&amp;q=ma+bufang+genocidal+golog&amp;pg=PA54|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=54|isbn=0-7425-1144-8|access-date=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, anti-Tibetan racism is also common among ethnic Han Chinese. Ever since its inception, the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP), the [[One-party state|sole legal ruling political party]] of the PRC (including Tibet), has been distributing historical documents which portray Tibetan culture as barbaric in order to justify Chinese control of the territory of Tibet, and is widely endorsed by Han Chinese nationalists. As such, many members of Chinese society have a negative view of Tibet which can be interpreted as racism. The traditional view is that [[Serfdom in Tibet controversy|Tibet was historically a feudal society]] which practiced serfdom/slavery and that this only changed due to Chinese influence in the region.

The CCP also promotes the view that some ancient Chinese historical figures strongly influenced many aspects of Tibet's fundamental culture as part of its campaign to legitimize Chinese control of Tibet. One such figure is [[Princess Wencheng]], an ancient Chinese princess who purportedly married king [[Songsten Gampo]] of Tibet and introduced [[Buddhism]] as well as many other forms of "[[civilization]]" to Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.chinaculture.org/focus/focus/60PLT/2011-04/28/content_412853.htm|title=Tibetan Ethnic Group|date=2011|website=ChinaCulture.org|type=This is a state-owned website which reflects the official views of the Chinese government.|quote=''In the 7th century AD, the Tibetan king, Songtsan Gampo, unified the whole region and established the Tubo Dynasty (629-846).

According to Edward Friedman at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], many Han Chinese believe that ethnic minorities in China should be incorporated as part of the larger Chinese state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Edward Friedman|date=2008|title=Friedman: Chinese Believe Tibetans, Other Ethnic Groups Should be Incorporated into One China|url=https://www.cfr.org/interview/friedman-chinese-believe-tibetans-other-ethnic-groups-should-be-incorporated-one-china|access-date=2020-11-19|website=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Muslims in Tibet are Hui. Although hostility between Tibetans and Muslims stems from the Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]]'s rule in Qinghai (the [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]]), in 1949 the Communists ended violence between Tibetans and Muslims. However, recent Tibetan-Muslim violence occurred. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over a bone in soups and the price of balloons; Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans, attacking Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans burned the apartments and shops of Muslims, and Muslims stopped wearing their traditional headwear and began to pray in secret.&lt;ref name="Demick"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |title=Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China |last=Demick |first=Barbara |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2010-06-28 |url-status=dead |date=23 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622013126/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |archive-date=June 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese-speaking Hui also have problems with the Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan-speaking [[Kache]] Muslim minority).&lt;ref name="Mayaram 2009 75"&gt;{{cite book| first = Shail |last=Mayaram| title = The other global city| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=tOZ1pBTJvp4C}}| access-date = 2010-07-30| year = 2009| publisher = Taylor Francis US| isbn = 978-0-415-99194-0| page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] has been accused of [[sinicization]] by gradually replacing Mongolian languages with [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Critics call it [[cultural genocide]] for dismantling people's minority languages and eradicating their minority identities. The implementation of the Mandarin language policy began in [[Tongliao]], because 1 million ethnic [[Mongols]] live there making it the most Mongolian-populated area.

According to historian [[Frank Dikötter]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;A common historical response to serious threats directed towards a symbolic universe is "nihilation", or the conceptual liquidation of everything inconsistent with official doctrine. Foreigners were labelled "barbarians" or "devils", to be conceptually eliminated. The official rhetoric reduced the Westerner to a devil, a ghost, an evil and unreal goblin hovering on the border of humanity. Many texts of the first half of the nineteenth century referred to the English as "foreign devils" (''yangguizi''), "devil slaves" (''guinu''), "barbarian devils" (''fangui''), "island barbarians" (''daoyi''), "blue-eyed barbarian slaves" (''biyan yinu''), or "red-haired barbarians" (''hongmaofan'').&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank (1992).

=={{anchor|Etymology}}Etymology and ethnic biases==
{{Main|Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese}}
[[Chinese orthography]] provides opportunities to write ethnic insults [[logograph]]ically. Some [[Chinese characters]] used to [[transcription into Chinese characters|transcribe]] the names of non-Chinese peoples were graphically-pejorative [[ethnic slurs]], where the insult was not the Chinese word but the character used to write it. For example, the name of the [[Yao people]] was transcribed as [[wikt:猺|猺]], a character which also means "jackal" and is written with the [[Radical 94|dog radical]] 犭. Being called a dog is a pejorative term in China. This name for the Yao, developed by 11th-century [[Song dynasty]] authors, has been replaced twice in 20th-century language reforms: with the invented character ''yao'' [[wikt:傜|傜]] (with the [[Radical 9|human radical]] 亻) and with ''yao'' [[wikt:瑤|瑤]] (with the [[Radical 96|jade radical]] 玉), which can also mean "precious jade". Although the characters have the same pronunciation, they have different [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radicals]] (which convey different meanings).
