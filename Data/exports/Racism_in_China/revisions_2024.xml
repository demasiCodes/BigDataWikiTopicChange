'''Racism in China''' ({{zh|s=种族主义|t=種族主義|p=zhòngzú zhǔyì}}) arises from [[History of China|Chinese history]], [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]], [[sinicization]], and other factors. [[Racism]] in the [[People's Republic of China]] has been documented in numerous situations. Ethnic tensions have led to numerous [[List of ethnic riots#China|incidents]] in the country such as the [[Xinjiang conflict]], the ongoing [[Xinjiang internment camps|internment]] and [[persecution of Uyghurs in China|state persecution of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities]], the [[2010 Tibetan language protest]] (a protest against the [[sinicization of Tibet]]), the [[2020 Inner Mongolia protests]] (a protest against the sinicization of [[Inner Mongolia]]), discrimination against [[Africa]]ns in particular and discrimination against [[Black people]] in general. {{TOC limit}}

China is a largely homogeneous society; over 90% of its population is [[Han Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/china/|access-date=2007-04-24|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]|archive-date=2021-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213122152/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/china/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic taxonomies were an aspect of [[Qing dynasty]] governance since the 1600s.&lt;ref name=":Laikwan"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Laikwan |first=Pang |title=One and All: The Logic of Chinese Sovereignty |date=2024 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=9781503638815 |location=Stanford, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|page=59}}

Claims about "race" being based in science and physiological differences were introduced to China by Europeans.&lt;ref name=":Laikwan" /&gt;{{Rp|page=59}} The idea of East Asian people belonging to a single "yellow race" was invented by European scientists in the 1700s and later introduced to China.&lt;ref name=":Laikwan" /&gt;{{Rp|page=59}} Chinese intellectuals initially embraced European concepts of race due to admiration of Western science.&lt;ref name=":Laikwan" /&gt;{{Rp|page=59}} These intellectuals also accepted a view categorizing Chinese as "yellow," in part due to favorable connotations of "[[yellow]]" in Chinese culture.&lt;ref name=":Laikwan" /&gt;{{Rp|page=59}}

According to academic David Tobin, since 2012, "Chinese education about Uyghurs tends to frame Uyghur identities as racialised, culturally external existential threats to be defeated by state violence or teaching them to be Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tobin |first=David |date=2024-01-23 |title=Visualising insecurity: the globalisation of China's racist 'counter-terror' education |journal=[[Comparative Education]] |volume=60 |language=en |pages=195–215 |doi=10.1080/03050068.2023.2298130 |issn=0305-0068 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Central Asia-Caucasus Institute]]'s founder [[S. Frederick Starr|S.

Most [[Tibetan Muslims|Muslims in Tibet]] are Hui. Although hostility between Tibetans and Muslims stems from the Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]]'s rule of [[Qinghai]] (the [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]]), in 1949, the Communists ended the violence between Tibetans and Muslims. However, acts of Tibetan-Muslim violence have recently occurred. Riots between Muslims and Tibetans broke out over bones in soups and the price of balloons; Tibetans accused Muslims of being [[Human cannibalism|cannibals who cooked humans]], attacking Muslim restaurants.

The CCP has been accused of sinicizing [[Inner Mongolia]] by gradually replacing [[Mongolian language]]s with Mandarin Chinese. Critics have accused the Chinese government of committing cultural genocide because it is [[Linguistic discrimination|dismantling people's minority languages]] and eradicating their minority identities. The [[2020 Inner Mongolia protests]] were caused by a [[curriculum]] reform which was imposed on ethnic schools by [[China]]'s Inner Mongolian Department of Education. The two-part reform replaced Mongolian with [[Standard Mandarin]] as the [[medium of instruction]] in three particular subjects and it also replaced three regional textbooks which were printed in the [[Mongolian script]], with the {{ill|Nationally-unified textbook series in China|lt=nationally-unified textbook series|zh|中华人民共和国教育部中小学统编教材}} edited by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]], written in Standard Mandarin.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Qin |first=Amy |date=2020-08-31 |title=Curbs on Mongolian Language Teaching Prompt Large Protests in China |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/world/asia/china-protest-mongolian-language-schools.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201216033718/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/world/asia/china-protest-mongolian-language-schools.html |archive-date=2020-12-16 |access-date=2020-09-02 |work=[[The New York Times]] |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="state_media_response_0831"&gt;{{cite news|date=2020-08-31|title=全区民族语言授课学校小学一年级和初中一年级使用国家统编《语文》教材实施方案政策解读|trans-title=Policy Interpretation: the Implementation of Nationally-unified Textbook Series on "Language and Literature" in Ethnic schools across Inner Mongolia starting from First and Seventh Grade|publisher=Government of [[Wuda District]], [[Wuhai City]], [[Inner Mongolia]]|agency=Inner Mongolia Daily (内蒙古日报)|url=http://www.wuda.gov.cn/qnyw/32938.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200904063237/http://www.wuda.gov.cn/qnyw/32938.jhtml|archive-date=2020-09-04|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mongolian_officials_response_0904"&gt;{{Cite news|title="五個不變"如何落地 自治區教育廳權威回應|trans-title=How "Five things unchanged" is implemented?

{{Main|Anti-Western sentiment in China}}
According to historian [[Frank Dikötter]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;A common historical response to serious threats directed towards a symbolic universe is "nihilation", or the conceptual liquidation of everything inconsistent with official doctrine. Foreigners were labelled "barbarians" or "devils", to be conceptually eliminated. The official rhetoric reduced the Westerner to a devil, a ghost, an evil and unreal goblin hovering on the border of humanity. Many texts of the first half of the nineteenth century referred to the English as "foreign devils" (''yangguizi''), "devil slaves" (''guinu''), "barbarian devils" (''fangui''), "island barbarians" (''daoyi''), "blue-eyed barbarian slaves" (''biyan yinu''), or "red-haired barbarians" (''hongmaofan'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dikötter |first=Frank |url=https://archive.org/details/discourseofracei0000diko |title=The Discourse of Race in Modern China |date=2015-08-01 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-023113-2 |pages=36 |language=English |author-link=Frank Dikötter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==={{anchor|Etymology}}Graphic pejoratives about race and ethnicity===
{{Main|Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese}}
[[Chinese orthography]] provides opportunities to write ethnic insults [[logograph]]ically; this is known as "graphic pejoratives". This originated in the fact that [[Chinese characters]] used to [[transcription into Chinese characters|transcribe]] the names of non-Chinese peoples were graphically pejorative [[ethnic slurs]], where the insult was not the Chinese word but the character used to write it. The sinologist [[Endymion Wilkinson]] says,&lt;blockquote&gt;At the same time as finding characters to fit the sounds of a foreign word or name it is also possible to choose ones with a particular meaning, in the case of non-Han peoples and foreigners, usually a pejorative meaning. It was the practice, for example, to choose characters with an animal or reptile signific for southern non-Han peoples, and many northern peoples were given characters for their names with the dog or leather hides signific. In origin this practice may have derived from the animal totems or tribal emblems typical of these peoples. This is not to deny that in later Chinese history such graphic pejoratives fitted neatly with Han convictions of the superiority of their own culture as compared to the uncultivated, hence animal-like, savages and barbarians.&lt;ref name="WilkinsonWilkinson2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilkinson|first=Endymion Porter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC|title=Chinese History: A Manual|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|year=2000|isbn=978-0-674-00249-4|access-date=2021-04-07|archive-date=2021-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417213144/https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
