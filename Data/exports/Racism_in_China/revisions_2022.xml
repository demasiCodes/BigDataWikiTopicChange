'''Racism in China''' arises from [[History of China|Chinese history]], [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]], [[sinicization]], and other factors. Racism in modern China has been documented in numerous situations. Ethnic tensions have led to [[List of ethnic riots#China|incidents]] in the country such as the [[Xinjiang conflict]], the ongoing [[Xinjiang internment camps|internment]] and [[Uyghur genocide|state persecution of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities]], the [[2010 Tibetan language protest]], the [[2020 Inner Mongolia protests]], [[anti-Western sentiment in China]] and discrimination against Africans and people of African descent. {{TOC limit}}

==Demographic background==
{{main|Demographics of China}}China is a largely homogeneous society; over 90% of its population has historically been [[Han Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/china/|access-date=2007-04-24|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]|archive-date=2021-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213122152/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/china/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the country's [[List of ethnic groups in China and Taiwan|ethnic groups]] are distinguishable by [[physical appearance]] and relatively-low [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] rates. Others have married Han Chinese and resemble them. A growing number of ethnic minorities are fluent at a native level in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Children sometimes receive ethnic-minority status at birth if one of their parents belongs to an [[ethnic minority]], even if their ancestry is predominantly Han Chinese. Pockets of immigrants and foreign residents exist in some cities.

===Massacres of Jie===
Some ethnic conflicts were violent. During the 350 AD [[Wei–Jie war]], the Chinese leader [[Ran Min]] massacred non-Chinese [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] in retaliation for abuses against the Chinese population; the [[Jie people]] were particularly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chinabetweenempi00lewi|url-access=registration|quote=ran min non chinese.|title=China between empires: the northern and southern dynasties|author=Mark Edward Lewis|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02605-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/chinabetweenempi00lewi/page/76 76]|access-date=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the period between 350 and 352, during the Wei–Jie war, General [[Ran Min]] ordered the complete extermination of the Jie, who were easily identified by high noses and full beards, leading to large numbers being killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maenchen-Helfen |first=Otto J. |author-link=Otto J.

Despite the Muslims' high position, the Yuan Mongols discriminated against them: restricting [[halal]] slaughter and other Islamic practices, such as [[circumcision]] (and [[kosher]] butchering for Jews). [[Genghis Khan]] called Muslims "slaves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;pg=PA24|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=24|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|access-date=2010-06-28|archive-date=2021-05-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508021417/https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;pg=PA24|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;pg=PA230|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|author=Johan Elverskog|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=229, 230|isbn=0-8122-4237-8&lt;!--|no-pp=340--&gt;|access-date=2010-06-28|archive-date=2021-05-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508021431/https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;pg=PA230|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim generals eventually joined the Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. [[Ming dynasty]] founder [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang]] had Muslim generals (including [[Lan Yu (general)|Lan Yu]]) who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in battle. [[Semu]]-caste Muslims revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah rebellion, although the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims massacred by Yuan commander Chen Youding.

====Anti-Muslim persecution by the Yuan dynasty and Ispah rebellion====
{{main|Ispah rebellion}}
The Yuan dynasty started passing anti-Muslim and anti-Semu laws and getting rid of Semu Muslim privileges towards the end of the Yuan dynasty, in 1340 forcing them to follow Confucian principles in marriage regulations, in 1329 all foreign holy men including Muslims had tax exemptions revoked, in 1328 the position of Muslim Qadi was abolished after its powers were limited in 1311. In the middle of the 14th century this caused Muslims to start rebelling against Mongol Yuan rule and joining rebel groups. In 1357-1367 the Yisibaxi Muslim Persian garrison started the [[Ispah rebellion]] against the Yuan dynasty in Quanzhou and southern Fujian. Persian merchants Amin ud-Din (Amiliding) and Saif ud-Din) Saifuding led the revolt. Persian official Yawuna assassinated both Amin ud-Din and Saif ud-Din in 1362 and took control of the Muslim rebel forces. The Muslim rebels tried to strike north and took over some parts of Xinghua but were defeated at Fuzhou two times and failed to take it. Yuan provincial loyalist forces from Fuzhou defeated the Muslim rebels in 1367 after A Muslim rebel officer named Jin Ji defected from Yawuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liu 刘|first1=Yingsheng 迎胜|title=The East Asian Mediterranean: Maritime Crossroads of Culture, Commerce and Human Migration|date=2008|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3447058094|editor1-last=Schottenhammer|editor1-first=Angela|edition=illustrated|volume=6 of East Asian economic and socio-cultural studies: East Asian maritime history|page=121|chapter=Muslim Merchants in Mongol Yuan China|issn=1860-1812|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&amp;q=muslim+persecution&amp;pg=PA121|access-date=2020-12-18|archive-date=2021-05-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508021422/https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&amp;q=muslim+persecution&amp;pg=PA121|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2020}}

The Muslim merchants in Quanzhou who engaged in maritime trade enriched their families which encompassed their political and trade activities as families. Historian [[John W. Chaffee]] saw the violent Chinese backlash that happened at the end of the Yuan dynasty against the wealth of the Muslim and Semu as something probably inevitable, although anti-Muslim and anti-Semu laws had already been passed by the Yuan dynasty. In 1340 all marriages had to follow Confucian rules, in 1329 all foreign holy men and clerics including Muslims no longer were exempt from tax, in 1328 the Qadi (Muslim headmen) were abolished after being limited in 1311. This resulted in anti-Mongol sentiment among Muslims so some anti-Mongol rebels in the mid 14th century were joined by Muslims. Quanzhou came under control of Amid ud-Din (Amiliding) and Saif ud-Din (Saifuding), two Persian military officials in 1357 as they revolted against the Mongols from 1357 to 1367 in southern Fujian and Quanzhou, leading the Persian garrison (Ispah) They fought for Fuzhou and Xinghua for 5 years. Both Saifuding and Amiliding were murdered by another Muslim called Nawuna in 1362 so he then took control of Quanzhou and the Ispah garrison for 5 more years until his defeat by the Yuan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chaffee |first1=John W. |title=The Muslim Merchants of Premodern China: The History of a Maritime Asian Trade Diaspora, 750–1400 |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1108640091 |page=157 |series=New Approaches to Asian History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfBmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157 |access-date=2020-12-18 |archive-date=2021-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508020050/https://books.google.com/books?id=IfBmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yuan Massacres of Muslims====
The historian Chen Dasheng theorized that Sunni-Shia sectarian war contributed to the Ispah rebellion, claiming that the Pu family and their in-law Yawuna were Sunnis and there before the Yuan while Amiliding and Saifuding's Persian soldiers were Shia originally in central China and moved to Quanzhou and that Jin Ji was a Shia who defected to Chen Youding after Sunni Yawuna killed Amiliding and Saifuding. Three fates befell the Muslims and foreigners in Quanzhou, the ones in the Persian garrison were slaughtered, many Persians and Arab merchants fled abroad by ships, another small group that adopted Chinese culture were expelled into coastal Baiqi, Chendi, Lufu and Zhangpu and mountainous Yongchun and Dehua and one other part took refuge in Quanzhou's mosques. The genealogies of Muslim families which survived the transition are the main source of information for the rebellion times. The Rongshan Li family, one of the Muslim survivors of the violence in the Yuan-Ming transition period wrote about their ancestors Li Lu during the rebellion who was a businessman and shipped things, using his private stores to feed hungry people during the rebellion and using his connections to keep safe. The Ming takeover after the end of the Persian garrison meant that the diaspora of incoming Muslims ended. After the Persian garrison full and the rebellion was crushed, the common people started a slaughter of the Pu family and all Muslims: "All of the Western peoples were annihilated, with a number of foreigners with large and big noses mistakenly killed while for three days the gates were closed and the executions were carried out. The corpses of the Pus were all stripped naked, their faces to the west. ... They were all judged according to the "five mutilating punishments" and then executed with their carcasses throwing into pig troughs. This was in revenge for their murder and rebellion in the Song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liu 刘 |first1=Yingsheng 迎胜 |editor1-last=Schottenhammer |editor1-first=Angela |title=The East Asian Mediterranean: Maritime Crossroads of Culture, Commerce and Human Migration |date=2008 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3447058094 |page=122 |edition=illustrated |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&amp;pg=PA122 |volume=6 of East Asian economic and socio-cultural studies: East Asian maritime history |issn=1860-1812 |chapter=Muslim Merchants in Mongol Yuan China |access-date=2020-12-18 |archive-date=2021-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508020052/https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&amp;pg=PA122 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

80 merchant ships were commanded by Fo Lian, from Bahrain who was Pu Shougeng's son-in-law. The Qais born Supterintendent of Taxes for Persian and the Island, Jamal al-din Ibrahim Tibi had a son who was sent in 1297-1305 as an envoy to China. Wassaf, and Arab historian said that Jamal became wealthy due to trade with India and China. Patronage networks and monopolies controlled Yuan maritime trade unlike in the Song dynasty where foreigners and Chinese of the Song merchant elite reaped profits. Quanzhou's end as an international trading port was rapid as in 1357 rebellions broke out in central China so the Persian merchants Amin ud-din (Amiliding) and Saif ud-din (Saifuding) led soldiers to take over Quanzhou. A Pu family relative by marriage, Yawuna, another Muslim assassinated those two. The Muslim rebels of the Persian garrison in Quanzhou lasted a decade by exploiting maritime trade and plunder. Yawuna and his army were captured and defeated by provincial forces in 1366 and then the Ming took over Quanzhou 2 years later in 1368. Maritime trade was regulated and implemented extremely differently in the Ming dynasty. Guangzhou, Ningbo and Quanzhou all had maritime trade offices but they were limited to specific areas. The South Sea trade was no longer permitted in Quanzhou and only trade with Ryukyu was allowed in Quanzhou. The Muslim community in Quanzhou became a target of the people's anger. In the streets there was widescale slaughter of "big nosed" westerners and Muslims as recorded in a genealogical account of a Muslim family. The era of Quanzhou as an international trading port of Asia ended as did the role of Muslims as merchant diaspora in Quanzhou. Some Muslims fled by sea or land as they were persecuted by the locals and others tried to hide and lay low as depicted in the genealogies of Quanzhou Muslims despite the Ming emperors attempted to issue laws tolerating Islam in 1407 and 1368 and putting the notices in mosques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chaffee |first1=John |editor1-last=Hall |editor1-first=Kenneth R. |title=Secondary Cities and Urban Networking in the Indian Ocean Realm, C. 1400-1800 |date=2008 |publisher=Lexington Books |series=G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |isbn=978-0739128350 |page=115 |volume=1 of Comparative urban studies |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gyPjBevBHxcC&amp;pg=PA115 |chapter=4 At the Intersection of Empire and World Trade: The Chinese Port City of Quanzhou (Zaitun), Eleventh-Fifteenth Centuries |access-date=2020-12-18 |archive-date=2021-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508020011/https://books.google.com/books?id=gyPjBevBHxcC&amp;pg=PA115 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Qais was the island of [[Kish Island|Kish]] and its king Jamal al-Din Ibrahim bin Muhammad al-Tibi briefly seized control of Hormuz while he traded with China and India and earned great wealth from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Park |first1=Hyunhee |title=Mapping the Chinese and Islamic Worlds: Cross-Cultural Exchange in Pre-Modern Asia |date=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1107018686 |page=151 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-2iWcxD2e8C&amp;pg=PA151 |access-date=2020-12-18 |archive-date=2020-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109151601/https://books.google.com/books?id=W-2iWcxD2e8C&amp;pg=PA151 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Sayyid [[Ajall Shams al-Din Omar]]'s descendants, the [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]] [[Ding (surname)|Ding]] fled to Chendai (Jinjiang) on the coast of Quanzhou to avoid the violence of the Ispah rebellion. The Li family survived through philanthropy activities however they said that in the rebellion "great families scattered from their homes, which were burned by the soldiers, and few genealogies survived." and used the words "a bubbling cauldron" to describe Quanzhou. In 1368 Quanzhou came under Ming control and the atmosphere calmed down for the Muslims. The Ming [[Yongle emperor]] issued decrees of protection from individuals and officials in mosques such as Quanzhou mosques and his father before him [[Ming Taizu]] had support from Muslim generals in his wars to reunify the country so he showed tolerance to them. The Ming passed some laws saying that Muslims not use Chinese surnames. Some genealogies of Muslims like the Li family show debate over teaching Confucian culture and classics like [[The Book of Odes|Odes]] and [[Book of Documents|History]] or to practice Islam. Ming Taizu passed laws concerning maritime trade which were the major impact upon the life of Quanzhou Muslims. He restricted official maritime trade in Quanzhou to [[Ryukyu]] and [[Guangzhou]] was to monopolize south sea trade in the 1370s and 1403-1474 after initial getting rid of the Office of Maritime Trade altogether in 1370. Up to the late 16th century, private trade was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liu 刘 |first1=Yingsheng 迎胜 |editor1-last=Schottenhammer |editor1-first=Angela |title=The East Asian Mediterranean: Maritime Crossroads of Culture, Commerce and Human Migration |date=2008 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3447058094 |page=123 |edition=illustrated |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&amp;pg=PA123 |volume=6 of East Asian economic and socio-cultural studies: East Asian maritime history |issn=1860-1812 |chapter=Muslim Merchants in Mongol Yuan China |access-date=2020-12-18 |archive-date=2021-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508020122/https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&amp;pg=PA123 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian Sunni Muslims Sayf al-din (Sai-fu-ding) and Awhad al-Din (A-mi-li-ding) started the Ispah rebellion in 1357 against the Yuan dynasty in Quanzhou and attempted to reach Fuzhou, capital of Fujian. Yuan general Chen Youding defeated the Muslim rebels and slaughtered Muslims of foreign descent in Quanzhou and areas next to Quanzhou. This led to many Muslim foreign fleeing to Java and other places in Southeast Asia to escape the massacres, spreading the Islamic religion. [[Gresik]] was ruled by a person from China's Guangdong province and it had a thousand Chinese families who moved there in the 14th century with the name Xin Cun (New Village) in Chinese. THis information was reported by [[Ma Huan]] who accompanied [[Zheng He]] to visit Java in the 15th century. Ma Huan also mentions Guangdong was the source of many Muslims from China who moved to Java.  Cu Cu/Jinbun was said to be Chinese. And like most Muslims form China, [[Wali Sanga]] [[Sunan Giri]] was Hanafi according to [[Stamford Raffles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wain |first1=Alexander |editor1-last=Peacock |editor1-first=A.

In 1366 the Mongols slaughtered the Sunni Muslims of Quanzhou and ended the rebellion. The Yuan dynasty's violent end saw repeated slaughters of Muslims until the Ming dynasty in 1368. The role of trade in Quanzhou ended as Sunni Muslims fled to Southeast Asia from Quanzhou. The surviving Muslims who fled Quanzhou moved to Manila bay, Brunei, Sumatra, Java and Champa to trade. Zheng He's historian Ma Huan noticed the presence of these Muslim traders in Southeast Asia who had fled form China in his voyages in [[Barus]] in Sumatra, [[Trengganu]] on the Malayan peninsula, Brunei and Java. The Nine Wali Sanga who converted Java to Islam had Chinese names and originated from Chinese speaking Quanzhou Muslims who fled there in the 14th century around 1368.

=== Republic of China (20th century) ===

Ethnic resentment resurfaced in at the end of the Qing Dynasty, in the early 20th century, as exemplified by Uyghur leader [[Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki]]'s remarks about ROC Chinese and Tungans ([[Hui people|Hui Muslims]]):

{{blockquote|The Tungans, more than the Han, are the enemy of our people. Today our people are already free from the oppression of the Han, but still continue under Tungan subjugation. We must still fear the Han, but cannot fear the Tungans also. The reason we must be careful to guard against the Tungans, we must intensely oppose, cannot afford to be polite. Since the Tungans have compelled us, we must be this way. Yellow Han people have not the slightest thing to do with Eastern Turkestan. Black Tungans also do not have this connection. Eastern Turkestan belongs to the people of Eastern Turkestan. There is no need for foreigners to come be our fathers and mothers ... From now on we do not need to use foreigners language, or their names, their customs, habits, attitudes, written language, etc. We must also overthrow and drive foreigners from our boundaries forever. The colors yellow and black are foul. They have dirtied our land for too long. So now it is absolutely necessary to clean out this filth. Take down the yellow and black barbarians! Long live Eastern Turkestan!"&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Xinjiang Fengbao Qishinian [Xinjiang in Tumult for Seventy Years]'', 3393-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"&gt;''The Islamic Republic of Eastern Turkestan and the Formation of Modern Uyghur Identity in Xinjiang'', by JOY R.

===Anti-Japanese sentiment===
{{Main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in China}}
Anti-Japanese sentiment primarily stems from [[Japanese war crimes]] which were committed during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. [[Japanese history textbook controversies|History-textbook revisionism]] in Japan and the denial (or [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]]) of events such as the [[Nanking Massacre]] by the Japanese far-right  has continued to inflame anti-Japanese feeling in China. It has been alleged that anti-Japanese sentiment is also partially the result of political manipulation by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP).&lt;ref name="fragile"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cceia.org/resources/transcripts/5425.html|title= China: Fragile Superpower: How China's Internal Politics Could Derail its Peaceful Rise|access-date= 2007-07-29|date= 2007-04-05|author= Shirk, Susan|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070707074249/http://www.cceia.org/resources/transcripts/5425.html|archive-date= 2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=The allegation is not presented in the article|date=May 2021}} According to a [[BBC]] report, anti-Japanese demonstrations received tacit approval from Chinese authorities, however the Chinese ambassador to Japan [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]] said that the Chinese government does not condone such protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4429809.stm|title= China's anti-Japan rallies spread|date= 2005-04-10|work= [[BBC News]]|access-date= 2007-05-28|archive-date= 2006-05-12|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060512161244/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4429809.stm|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Anti-Manchu sentiment}}
The Manchus were a heavily Sinicized ethnic group after the Qing conquest of Beijing and especially during the Republic of China period in the mainland, but the [[Manchu people]] are often still criticized by many Han Chinese people due to the historical problems of the [[Manchu invasion of China]], the policy of forcing hair to be shaved and forcing to change clothes, racism in the [[Qing Dynasty]], slow modernization, as well as Chinese humiliation by the powers in the [[Western world|West]] and also Japan.{{Cn|date=August 2022}}

{{See also|Sinicization of Tibet|Anti-Tibetan sentiment}}
Anti-Tibetan racism has been displayed by ethnic Han Chinese on some occasions. Ever since its inception, the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP), the [[One-party state|sole legal ruling political party]] of the PRC (including Tibet), has been distributing historical documents which portray Tibetan culture as barbaric in order to justify Chinese control of the territory of Tibet, and is widely endorsed by Han Chinese nationalists. As such, many members of Chinese society have a negative view of Tibet which can be interpreted as racism. The traditional view{{By whom|date=January 2021}} is that [[Serfdom in Tibet controversy|Tibet was historically a feudal society]] which practiced serfdom/slavery and that this only changed due to Chinese influence in the region. {{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

===={{anchor|Tibetan-Muslim sectarian violence}}Tibetan-Muslim violence====
Most Muslims in Tibet are Hui. Although hostility between Tibetans and Muslims stems from the Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]]'s rule in Qinghai (the [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]]), in 1949 the Communists ended violence between Tibetans and Muslims. However, recent Tibetan-Muslim violence occurred.

===Discrimination against Mongols===
{{See also|2020 Inner Mongolia protests}}
The [[Chinese Communist Party|CCP]] has been accused of [[sinicization]] by gradually replacing Mongolian languages with [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Critics call it [[cultural genocide]] for dismantling people's minority languages and eradicating their minority identities. The implementation of the Mandarin language policy began in [[Tongliao]], because 1 million ethnic [[Mongols]] live there making it the most Mongolian-populated area. The 5 million Mongols are less than 20 percent of the population in [[Inner Mongolia]].&lt;ref name="replacing-ethnic-minorities"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/international/509173-china-is-replacing-languages-of-ethnic-minorities-with-mandarin |title=China is replacing languages of ethnic minorities with Mandarin |website=The Hill |author=Jianli Yang and Lianchao Han |date=7 July 2020 |access-date=1 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731101052/https://thehill.com/opinion/international/509173-china-is-replacing-languages-of-ethnic-minorities-with-mandarin |archive-date=31 July 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|reason=Citation is [[WP:RSOPINION]] and should be attributed as such or a better source should be found.|date=May 2021}}

On 20 September 2020, up to 5,000 ethnic Mongolians were arrested in [[Inner Mongolia]] for protesting against enacted policies that outlaw their [[nomadic pastoralism]] lifestyle. The director of the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC), Enghebatu Togochog, called it “cultural genocide” by the CCP.

In October 2020, the Chinese government asked Nantes History Museum in France not to use the words “Genghis Khan” and “Mongolia" in the exhibition project dedicated to the history of Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire. Nantes History Museum engaged the exhibition project in partnership with the Inner Mongolia Museum in Hohhot, China. Nantes History Museum stopped the exhibition project. The director of the Nantes museum, Bertrand Guillet, says: “Tendentious elements of rewriting aimed at completely eliminating Mongolian history and culture in favor of a new national narrative”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Beauvallet |first1=Ève | title= Nantes History Museum resists Chinese regime censorship |url=https://www.archyde.com/nantes-history-museum-resists-chinese-regime-censorship/ |website = Archyde |date=12 October 2020 |access-date=12 October 2020|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201013062044/https://www.archyde.com/nantes-history-museum-resists-chinese-regime-censorship/| archive-date=13 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrimination against Africans and people of African descent===
Reports of racial discrimination against Africans have trended in foreign media since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Chinese government has continually provided aid to China-friendly African countries, which includes funding university education for African students of elite backgrounds. Scholar [[Barry Sautman]] believes that tensions between African students and Chinese students escalated since the 1970s because of a lack of interaction between the two groups, racist remarks made by Chinese media, and an increase of racial assaults and slurs by Chinese students.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Publicized incidents of discrimination against Africans have been the [[Nanjing anti-African protests]] in 1988 and a 1989 student-led protest in Beijing in response to an African dating a Chinese person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Michael J.|date=June 1994|title=The 1988–89 Nanjing Anti-African Protests: Racial Nationalism or National Racism?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0305741000035839/type/journal_article|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=138|issue=138|pages=438–457|doi=10.1017/S0305741000035839|issn=0305-7410|jstor=654952|s2cid=154972703|access-date=2020-12-18|archive-date=2020-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824014008/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/198889-nanjing-antiafrican-protests-racial-nationalism-or-national-racism/AC0B9378E1434D7DD300F011C3FD2877|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=1989-01-05|title=Africans in Beijing Boycott Classes|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/05/world/africans-in-beijing-boycott-classes.html|access-date=2020-09-29|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=2019-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190609001036/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/05/world/africans-in-beijing-boycott-classes.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Anti-Western sentiment in China}}
According to historian [[Frank Dikötter]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;A common historical response to serious threats directed towards a symbolic universe is "nihilation", or the conceptual liquidation of everything inconsistent with official doctrine. Foreigners were labelled "barbarians" or "devils", to be conceptually eliminated. The official rhetoric reduced the Westerner to a devil, a ghost, an evil and unreal goblin hovering on the border of humanity. Many texts of the first half of the nineteenth century referred to the English as "foreign devils" (''yangguizi''), "devil slaves" (''guinu''), "barbarian devils" (''fangui''), "island barbarians" (''daoyi''), "blue-eyed barbarian slaves" (''biyan yinu''), or "red-haired barbarians" (''hongmaofan'').&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank (1992). The Discourse of Race in Modern China. Stanford University Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==={{anchor|Etymology}}Graphic pejoratives about race and ethnicity===
{{Main|Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese}}
[[Chinese orthography]] provides opportunities to write ethnic insults [[logograph]]ically; this is known as "graphic pejoratives". This originated in the fact that [[Chinese characters]] used to [[transcription into Chinese characters|transcribe]] the names of non-Chinese peoples were graphically pejorative [[ethnic slurs]], where the insult was not the Chinese word but the character used to write it. The sinologist [[Endymion Wilkinson]] says,&lt;blockquote&gt;At the same time as finding characters to fit the sounds of a foreign word or name it is also possible to choose ones with a particular meaning, in the case of non-Han peoples and foreigners, usually a pejorative meaning. It was the practice, for example, to choose characters with an animal or reptile signific for southern non-Han peoples, and many northern peoples were given characters for their names with the dog or leather hides signific. In origin this practice may have derived from the animal totems or tribal emblems typical of these peoples. This is not to deny that in later Chinese history such graphic pejoratives fitted neatly with Han convictions of the superiority of their own culture as compared to the uncultivated, hence animal-like, savages and barbarians.&lt;ref name="WilkinsonWilkinson2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilkinson|first=Endymion Porter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC|title=Chinese History: A Manual|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|year=2000|isbn=978-0-674-00249-4|access-date=2021-04-07|archive-date=2021-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417213144/https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
