'''[[Racism]] in [[China]]''' arises from [[History of China|Chinese history]], [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]], [[sinicization]], and other factors. Racism in modern China has been documented in numerous situations. Ethnic tensions have led to numerous [[List of ethnic riots#China|incidents]] in the country such as the [[Xinjiang conflict]], the ongoing [[Xinjiang internment camps|internment]] and [[Uyghur genocide|state persecution of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities]], the [[2010 Tibetan language protest]] (a protest against the [[sinicization of Tibet]]), the [[2020 Inner Mongolia protests]] (a protest against the sinicization of [[Inner Mongolia]]), discrimination against [[Africa]]ns in particular and discrimination against [[Black people]] in general. {{TOC limit}}

==Demographic background==
{{main|Demographics of China}}
{{further|List of ethnic groups in China}}
China is a largely homogeneous society; over 90% of its population has [[History of China|historically]] been [[Han Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/china/|access-date=2007-04-24|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]|archive-date=2021-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213122152/https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/china/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the country's [[List of ethnic groups in China and Taiwan|ethnic groups]] are distinguishable by their physical appearances and their relatively-low [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] rates. Other ethnic groups have married members of the Han Chinese ethnic group and as a result, their physical appearances resemble the physical appearances of Han Chinese people. A growing number of ethnic minorities are fluent in [[Mandarin Chinese]] at a native level. Children sometimes receive ethnic-minority status at birth if one of their parents belongs to an [[ethnic minority]], even if their ancestry is predominantly Han Chinese. Pockets of immigrants and foreign residents exist in some cities.

According to the [[Central Asia-Caucasus Institute]]'s founder [[S. Frederick Starr|S.

=={{anchor|Racism in Modern China}}Modern China==
Racist incidents continue to occur in modern China and have become a contentious topic because Chinese governmental sources deny or downplay its existence.

===Anti-Japanese sentiment===
{{Main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in China|China–Japan relations}}

Anti-Tibetan racism has been practiced by ethnic Han Chinese on some occasions. Ever since its inception, the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP), the [[One-party state|sole legal ruling political party]] of the PRC (including Tibet), has been distributing historical documents which portray Tibetan culture as barbaric in order to justify Chinese control of the territory of Tibet, and is widely endorsed by Han Chinese nationalists. As such, many members of Chinese society have a negative view of Tibet which can be interpreted as racism. The traditional view{{By whom|date=January 2021}} is that [[Serfdom in Tibet controversy|Tibet was historically a feudal society]] which practiced serfdom/slavery and that this only changed due to Chinese influence in the region. {{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Most [[Tibetan Muslims|Muslims in Tibet]] are Hui. Although hostility between Tibetans and Muslims stems from the Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]]'s rule of [[Qinghai]] (the [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]]), in 1949, the Communists ended the violence between Tibetans and Muslims. However, acts of Tibetan-Muslim violence have recently occurred. Riots between Muslims and Tibetans broke out over bones in soups and the price of balloons; Tibetans accused Muslims of being [[Human cannibalism|cannibals who cooked humans]], attacking Muslim restaurants. Fires which were set by Tibetans burned the apartments and shops of Muslims, and Muslims stopped wearing their traditional headwear and they also began to pray in secret.&lt;ref name="Demick"&gt;{{cite news |last=Demick |first=Barbara |date=23 June 2008 |title=Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |url-status=dead |access-date=2010-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622013126/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |archive-date=June 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese-speaking Hui also have problems with the Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan-speaking [[Kache]] Muslim minority).&lt;ref name="Mayaram 2009 75"&gt;{{cite book| first = Shail |last=Mayaram| title = The other global city| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=tOZ1pBTJvp4C}}| access-date = 2010-07-30| year = 2009| publisher = Taylor Francis US| isbn = 978-0-415-99194-0| page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCP has been accused of sinicizing [[Inner Mongolia]] by gradually replacing [[Mongolian language]]s with Mandarin Chinese. Critics have accused the Chinese government of committing cultural genocide because it is [[Linguistic discrimination|dismantling people's minority languages]] and eradicating their minority identities. The implementation of the Mandarin language policy began in [[Tongliao]], because 1 million ethnic [[Mongols]] live there, making it the most Mongolian-populated area of Inner Mongolia.

The [[2020 Inner Mongolia protests]] were caused by a [[curriculum]] reform which was imposed on ethnic schools by [[China]]'s Inner Mongolian Department of Education.

On 20 September 2020, up to 5,000 ethnic Mongolians were arrested in Inner Mongolia for protesting against the enactment of policies that outlawed their [[Nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralist]] lifestyle. The director of the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center (SMHRIC), Enghebatu Togochog, called the CCP's policy a “cultural genocide”.

The Nantes History Museum conducted the exhibition project in partnership with the Inner Mongolia Museum in Hohhot, China. The Nantes History Museum halted the exhibition project.

{{Main|Anti-Western sentiment in China}}
According to historian [[Frank Dikötter]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;A common historical response to serious threats directed towards a symbolic universe is "nihilation", or the conceptual liquidation of everything inconsistent with official doctrine. Foreigners were labelled "barbarians" or "devils", to be conceptually eliminated. The official rhetoric reduced the Westerner to a devil, a ghost, an evil and unreal goblin hovering on the border of humanity. Many texts of the first half of the nineteenth century referred to the English as "foreign devils" (''yangguizi''), "devil slaves" (''guinu''), "barbarian devils" (''fangui''), "island barbarians" (''daoyi''), "blue-eyed barbarian slaves" (''biyan yinu''), or "red-haired barbarians" (''hongmaofan'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dikötter |first=Frank |url=https://archive.org/details/discourseofracei0000diko |title=The Discourse of Race in Modern China |date=2015-08-01 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-023113-2 |pages=36 |language=English |author-link=Frank Dikötter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==={{anchor|Etymology}}Graphic pejoratives about race and ethnicity===
{{Main|Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese}}
[[Chinese orthography]] provides opportunities to write ethnic insults [[logograph]]ically; this is known as "graphic pejoratives". This originated in the fact that [[Chinese characters]] used to [[transcription into Chinese characters|transcribe]] the names of non-Chinese peoples were graphically pejorative [[ethnic slurs]], where the insult was not the Chinese word but the character used to write it. The sinologist [[Endymion Wilkinson]] says,&lt;blockquote&gt;At the same time as finding characters to fit the sounds of a foreign word or name it is also possible to choose ones with a particular meaning, in the case of non-Han peoples and foreigners, usually a pejorative meaning. It was the practice, for example, to choose characters with an animal or reptile signific for southern non-Han peoples, and many northern peoples were given characters for their names with the dog or leather hides signific. In origin this practice may have derived from the animal totems or tribal emblems typical of these peoples. This is not to deny that in later Chinese history such graphic pejoratives fitted neatly with Han convictions of the superiority of their own culture as compared to the uncultivated, hence animal-like, savages and barbarians.&lt;ref name="WilkinsonWilkinson2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilkinson|first=Endymion Porter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC|title=Chinese History: A Manual|publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center|year=2000|isbn=978-0-674-00249-4|access-date=2021-04-07|archive-date=2021-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417213144/https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
