'''Racism in the People's Republic of China''' is a complex issue influenced by [[History of China|Chinese history]], [[Chinese nationalism]], and many other factors.

==Causes==

===History===

*[[Opium Wars]]
*[[Boxer Rebellion]]
*[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]
*[[Nanjing anti-African protests]]

===Racial composition===

China's racial composition is overwhelmingly homogeneous with 91.9% of the population being [[Han Chinese]] and the remaining minorities largely composed of other mainland Asia ethnicities such as [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s, [[Uyghur people|Uygur]]s, [[Mongols]], and [[Koreans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People|title= China|accessdate= 2007-04-24|publisher= [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that very few Chinese will have any significant contact with those of another race during their lifetimes. Those living in rural areas will likely never see a [[White people|White]] or [[Black person|Black]] person. Only a small percentage of Chinese will be able to base their opinions about people of other (non-Han) races on actual contact with such peoples.

==Anti-Japanese sentiment==
{{main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in China}}

Much anti-Japanese sentiment exists in China, most of it stemming from [[Japanese war crimes]] committed in the country during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. [[Japanese history textbook controversies|History textbook revisionism]] in Japan and the denial or whitewashing of events such as the [[Nanking Massacre]] by right-wing Japanese groups has continued to inflame anti-Japanese feelings in China.

==Ethnic slurs==
'''Mandarin'''
*''[[Laowai]]'' ({{zh-tsp|t=老外|s=老外|p=lǎowài}}) "foreigner" or "outsider", usually considered less-polite than ''waiguoren'' ({{zh-tsp|t=外國人|s=外国人|p=wàiguórén}}), a more-proper term with the same meaning
*''Yangguizi'' ({{zh-tsp|t=洋鬼子|s=洋鬼子|p=yángguǐzi}}) "White devil" or "foreign devil", a slur for [[White people]]
*''Riben guizi'' ({{zh-tsp|t=日本鬼子|s=日本鬼子|p=Rǐběn guǐzi}}) "Japanese devil", a slur for [[Japanese people]], popularized during [[World War II]]
'''Cantonese'''
*''[[Gweilo]]'' ({{zh-ts|t=鬼佬|s=鬼佬}}; [[Jyutping]]: gwai2 lou2; [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]] [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|kwɐɪ&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt; ləʊ&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt;}}) "ghost" or "ghost man", a slur for White people

==Government involvement==

The Chinese government has a mixed record of promoting racial tolerance in China. Though racial harmony within China has been promoted under the guise of a "[[Chinese nation]]", the [[2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations]] were tolerated, if not approved by the Chinese government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4429809.stm|title= China's anti-Japan rallies spread|date= 2005-04-10|publisher= [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike other demonstrations or "[[mass incident]]s" critical of the Chinese government itself.

On [[March 29]], [[2007]], [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] quoted Dainzhub Ongboin, the vice director of China's State Ethnic Affairs Commission, as saying "All ethnic groups in China are equal and no racial discrimination exists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/29/content_5914498.htm|title= Official: China has no racial discrimination|date= 2007-03-29|publisher= [[Xinhua]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
