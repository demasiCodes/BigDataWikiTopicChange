'''Ethnic issues in China''' arise from [[History of China|Chinese history]], [[Chinese nationalism|nationalism]], and other factors. They have driven historical movements such as the [[Red Turban Rebellion]] (which targeted the [[Mongol]] leadership of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]) and the [[Xinhai Revolution]], which overthrew the [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]]. Ethnic tensions have led to [[List of ethnic riots#China|incidents]] in the country such as the [[July 2009 Ürümqi riots]].

==Background==
{{main|Demographics of China}}
China is a largely-homogenous society; over 90 percent of its population has historically been [[Han Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People|title= China|accessdate= 2007-04-24|publisher= [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the country's [[List of ethnic groups in China and Taiwan|ethnic groups]] are distinguishable by [[physical appearance]] and relatively-low [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]] rates. Others have married Han Chinese and resemble them. A growing number of ethnic minorities are fluent at a native level in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Children sometimes receive ethnic-minority status at birth if one of their parents belongs to an [[ethnic minority]], even if their ancestry is predominantly Han Chinese. Pockets of immigrants and foreign residents exist in some cities.

A 100-day crackdown on illegal foreigners in Beijing began in May 2012, with Beijing residents wary of foreign nationals due to recent crimes.&lt;ref name=steinfeld&gt;Jemimah Steinfeld, 25 May 2012, [http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/24/world/asia/china-foreigners/index.html?hpt=ias_t2 Mood darkens in Beijing amid crackdown on 'illegal foreigners'], CNN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;15 May 2012, [https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/05/15/beijing-pledges-to-clean-out-illegal-foreigners/ Beijing Pledges to ‘Clean Out’ Illegal Foreigners], China Real Time Report, Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt; [[China Central Television]] host Yang Rui said, controversially, that "foreign trash" should be cleaned out of the capital. &lt;ref name=steinfeld/&gt;

==History==
===Racism in Imperial China===
[[File:1900 killing of foreigners.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=See caption|1861 [[Woodblock printing|woodblock print]] of Westerners (depicted as a pig and a goat) being executed by Chinese officials]]
Racial discrimination by the ruling Han Chinese in [[History of China#Imperial China|imperial China]] has been documented in historical texts such as [[Yan Shigu]]'s commentary on the ''[[Book of Han]]'', in which the [[Wusun]] people were called "barbarians who have green eyes and red hair" and compared to [[macaque]]s.&lt;ref name="yanshigu"&gt;''[[Book of Han]]'', [http://www.guoxue123.com/shibu/0101/01hsyz/111.htm with commentary by Yan Shigu] '''Original text''':　烏孫於西域諸戎其形最異。今之胡人青眼、赤須，狀類彌猴者，本其種也。&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ethnic conflicts resulted in genocides. During the 350 AD [[Wei–Jie war]], the Han Chinese leader [[Ran Min]] massacred non-Chinese [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] in retaliation for abuses of the Chinese population; the [[Jie people]] were particularly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ch04UBWfplQC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=ran+min+non+chinese&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_zNOTInoEIK88gbInd2-Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ran%20min%20non%20chinese&amp;f=false|title=China between empires: the northern and southern dynasties|author=Mark Edward Lewis|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=|isbn=0-674-02605-5|page=76|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebels slaughtered Arab and Persian merchants in the [[Yangzhou massacre (760)]]. According to Arab historian Abu Zayd Hasan of Siraf, the rebel [[Huang Chao]]'s army killed Arab, Jewish, Christian, and [[Parsi]] merchants in the [[Guangzhou massacre]] when he captured Guang Prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Gabriel Ferrand |year=1922 | title=Voyage du marchand arabe Sulaymân en Inde et en Chine, rédigé en 851, suivi de remarques par Abû Zayd Hasan (vers 916)| pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabs and Persians living in [[Quanzhou]] were massacred in the [[Ispah rebellion]].

Widespread violence against the [[Manchu people]] by Han Chinese rebels occurred during the [[Xinhai Revolution]], most notably in Xi'an (where the Manchu quarter's population—20,000—was killed) and [[Wuhan]] (where 10,000 Manchus were killed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manchus and Han: Ethnic Relations and Political Power in Late Qing and Early Republican China, 1861–1928|last=Rhoads|first=Edward J.

According to 20th-century social and cultural critic [[Lu Xun]], "Throughout the ages, Chinese have had only two ways of looking at foreigners, up to them as superior beings or down on them as wild animals."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Leys, ''Chinese Shadows'' (New York: The Viking Press, 1977), 1. Leys has noted that Lu Xun's polemical utterance can be applied to the Maoist bureaucracy at the time Leys wrote his book. However, Leys also pointed out that it would be unfair to apply Lu Xun's statement to the Chinese people in general. As according to Leys, the Chinese people themselves are friendly and hospitable to foreigners.&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Racism and ethnic prejudice among minorities}}Racism by minorities===
The [[Mongols]] divided groups into a four-class [[caste|caste system]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Merchants and non-Mongol overseers were usually immigrants or local ethnic groups: [[Turkestani]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] Muslims and [[Christian]]s. Foreigners from outside the Mongol Empire, such as the [[Marco Polo|Polo family]], were welcomed.

Despite the Muslims' high position, the Yuan Mongols discriminated against them: restricting [[halal]] slaughter and other Islamic practices, such as [[circumcision]] (and [[kosher]] butchering for Jews). Genghis Khan called Muslims "slaves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QyhCTMOnLoL_8AbNt5DADw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=yuan%20dynasty%20halal&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=24|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QyhCTMOnLoL_8AbNt5DADw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=yuan%20dynasty%20halal&amp;f=false|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|author=Johan Elverskog|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=|pages=229, 230|isbn=0-8122-4237-8&lt;!--|nopp=340--&gt;|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim generals eventually joined the Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. [[Ming dynasty]] founder [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang]] had Muslim generals (including [[Lan Yu (general)|Lan Yu]]) who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in battle. [[Semu]]-caste Muslims revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah rebellion, although the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims massacred by Yuan commander Chen Youding. Uyghur leader [[Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki]] said about the Han Chinese and Tungans ([[Hui people|Hui Muslims]]):

{{quote|The Tungans, more than the Han, are the enemy of our people. Today our people are already free from the oppression of the Han, but still continue under Tungan subjugation. We must still fear the Han, but cannot fear the Tungans also. The reason we must be careful to guard against the Tungans, we must intensely oppose, cannot afford to be polite. Since the Tungans have compelled us, we must be this way. Yellow Han people have not the slightest thing to do with Eastern Turkestan. Black Tungans also do not have this connection. Eastern Turkestan belongs to the people of Eastern Turkestan. There is no need for foreigners to come be our fathers and mothers ... From now on we do not need to use foreigners language, or their names, their customs, habits, attitudes, written language, etc. We must also overthrow and drive foreigners from our boundaries forever.

An American telegram reported that Uyghur groups in parts of Xinjiang demanded the expulsion of White Russians and Han Chinese from Xinjiang during the [[Ili Rebellion]]. The Uyghurs reportedly said, "We freed ourselves from the yellow men, now we must destroy the white". According to the telegram, "Serious native attacks on people of other races frequent. White Russians in terror of uprising."&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1947v07/reference/frus.frus1947v07.i0008.pdf UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE POLITICAL PROBLEMS IN SINKIANG; EXTENT OF SOVIET AID AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO REBEL GROUPS IN SINKIANG; BORDER INCIDENT AT PEITASHAN]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions erupted between Muslim sects, ethnic groups, the Tibetans and Han Chinese during the late 19th century near [[Qinghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nietupski|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xGvECiS-uEgC&amp;pg=PA82 82]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to volume eight of the ''[[Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics]]'', the Muslim Dungan and Panthay revolts were ignited by racial antagonism and class warfare.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia_893"/&gt;

===Anti-Japanese sentiment===
{{Main article|Anti-Japanese sentiment in China}}
Anti-Japanese sentiment primarily stems from [[Japanese war crimes]] committed during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. [[Japanese history textbook controversies|History-textbook revisionism]] in Japan and the denial (or [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]]) of events such as the [[Nanking Massacre]] by right-wing Japanese groups has continued to inflame anti-Japanese feeling in China. It has been alleged that anti-Japanese sentiment is also partially the result of political manipulation by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="fragile"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cceia.org/resources/transcripts/5425.html|title= China: Fragile Superpower: How China's Internal Politics Could Derail its Peaceful Rise|accessdate= 2007-07-29|date= 2007-04-05|author= Shirk, Susan|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070707074249/http://www.cceia.org/resources/transcripts/5425.html|archivedate= 2007-07-07|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[BBC]] report, anti-Japanese demonstrations received tacit approval from Chinese authorities (although Chinese ambassador to Japan Wang Yi said that the Chinese government does not condone such protests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4429809.stm|title= China's anti-Japan rallies spread|date= 2005-04-10|publisher= [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Muslims in Tibet are Hui. Although hostility between Tibetans and Muslims stems from the Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]]'s rule in Qinghai (the [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]]), in 1949 the Communists ended violence between Tibetans and Muslims. However, recent Tibetan-Muslim violence occurred. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over a bone in soups and the price of balloons; Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans, attacking Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans burned the apartments and shops of Muslims, and Muslims stopped wearing their traditional headwear and began to pray in secret.&lt;ref name="Demick"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |title=Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China |last=Demick |first=Barbara |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=yes |date=23 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622013126/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |archivedate=June 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese-speaking Hui also have problems with the Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan-speaking [[Kache]] Muslim minority).&lt;ref name="Mayaram 2009 75"&gt;{{cite book| first = Shail |last=Mayaram| title = The other global city| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=tOZ1pBTJvp4C}}| accessdate = 2010-07-30| year = 2009| publisher = Taylor Francis US| isbn = 0-415-99194-3| page = 75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*毛子 (''máo zi'', literally "body hair" – a derogatory term for Caucasians. However, because most white people in contact with China were Russians before the 19th century, 毛子 became a derogatory term for Russians.&lt;ref&gt;2012-05-02, [http://www.focustt.com/2012/0502/12751.shtml 中俄军演刚结束:毛子这举动让北京狼狈不堪!] (China-Russia military exercises conclude, the actions of ''Mao zi'' force Beijing into a dilemma), 环球视线&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2012-08-26, [http://www.cankaoa.com/bbs/201208/thread_52633_1.html 毛子告诉中国：美国佬不敢惹俄罗斯只是因为这] (''Mao zi'' tell China: Yankees won't mess with Russia because of this), 参考啊&lt;/ref&gt;
According to historian [[Frank Dikötter]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;A common historical response to serious threats directed towards a symbolic universe is "nihilation", or the conceptual liquidation of everything inconsistent with official doctrine. Foreigners were labelled "barbarians" or "devils", to be conceptually eliminated. The official rhetoric reduced the Westerner to a devil, a ghost, an evil and unreal goblin hovering on the border of humanity. Many texts of the first half of the nineteenth century referred to the English as "foreign devils" (''yangguizi''), "devil slaves" (''guinu''), "barbarian devils" (''fangui''), "island barbarians" (''daoyi''), "blue-eyed barbarian slaves" (''biyan yinu''), or "red-haired barbarians" (''hongmaofan'').&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank (1992). The Discourse of Race in Modern China. Stanford University Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{main article|Graphic pejoratives in written Chinese}}
[[Chinese orthography]] provides opportunities to write ethnic insults [[logograph]]ically. Some [[Chinese characters]] used to [[transcription into Chinese characters|transcribe]] the names of non-Chinese peoples were graphically-pejorative [[ethnic slurs]], where the insult was not the Chinese word but the character used to write it. For example, the name of the [[Yao people]] was transcribed as [[wikt:猺|猺]], a character which also means "jackal" and is written with the [[Radical 94|dog radical]] 犭. This name for the Yao, developed by 11th-century [[Song dynasty]] authors, has been replaced twice in 20th-century language reforms: with the invented character ''yao'' [[wikt:傜|傜]] (with the [[Radical 9|human radical]] 亻) and with ''yao'' [[wikt:瑤|瑤]] (with the [[Radical 96|jade radical]] 玉), which can also mean "precious jade". Although the characters have the same pronunciation, they have different [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radicals]] (which convey different meanings).
