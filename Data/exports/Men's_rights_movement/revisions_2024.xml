Common topics discussed within the men's rights movement include [[family law]], such as [[child custody]], [[alimony]] and marital property distribution; reproduction; [[suicide]]; [[domestic violence against men]]; [[false accusations of rape]]; [[circumcision]]; education; [[conscription]]; [[social safety net]]s; and health policies. The men's rights movement branched off from the [[men's liberation movement]] in the early 1970s, with both groups comprising a part of the larger [[men's movement]].

==History==
===Forerunners===
The term "men's rights" was used at least as early as February 1856 when it appeared in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]''. The author was responding to the issue of women's rights, calling it a "new movement for social reform, and even for political revolution", which the author proposed to counter with men's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=&lt;!--Staff writer, no byline--&gt; |title=A word for men's rights |journal=[[Putnam's Magazine]] |volume=7 |issue=38 |pages=208–214 |date=February 1856 |url=http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=putn;cc=putn;rgn=full%20text;idno=putn0007-2;didno=putn0007-2;view=image;seq=0214;node=putn0007-2%3A16 |access-date=6 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906043412/http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=putn;cc=putn;rgn=full%20text;idno=putn0007-2;didno=putn0007-2;view=image;seq=0214;node=putn0007-2%3A16 |archive-date=6 September 2017 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest Belfort Bax]] wrote ''The Legal Subjection of Men'' in 1896, deriding the women's rights movement as a farcical effort by women—the "privileged sex"—to prove they were "oppressed."&lt;ref name="Bax 1908"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bax |first=E.

Three loosely connected men's rights organizations formed in [[Austria]] in the [[interwar period]]. The ''League for Men's Rights'' was founded in 1926 with the goal of "combating all excesses of women's emancipation".&lt;ref name="Malleier 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Der 'Bund für Männerrechte'.

They criticized marriage and family laws, especially the requirement to pay spousal and child support to former wives and [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] children, and supported the use of blood tests to determine paternity.&lt;ref name="Malleier 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wrussnig 2009"/&gt; ''Justitia'' and ''Aequitas'' issued their own short-lived journals ''Men's Rightists Newspaper'' and ''Self-Defense'' where they expressed their views that were heavily influenced by the works of [[Heinrich Schurtz]], [[Otto Weininger]], and [[Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels]]. The organizations ceased to exist before 1939.&lt;ref name="Malleier 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wrussnig 2009"/&gt;

Contrary to Bly's claim, it is not a parallel to the women's movement that is merely on a "different timetable." It may be a response to genuine emotional and spiritual needs that are met by bringing men together to drum, chant, and share stories and feelings from their lives. It may help to heal some of the damage patriarchy does to men's lives. But it is not a movement aimed at the system and the gender dynamics that actually cause that damage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He proposes that women be legally required to make every reasonable effort to notify the father of her pregnancy within four to five days.{{sfn|Farrell|Sterba|2008|p=79–80}} In response, [[Philosophy|philosopher]] James P.

===Education===
{{see also|Sex differences in education}}
Men's rights adherents describe the education of boys as being in crisis, with boys having reduced educational achievement and motivation compared to girls.&lt;ref name="Kanani 2011"/&gt; Advocates blame the influence of feminism on education for what they believe is discrimination against and systematic oppression of boys in the education system.&lt;ref name="Mills 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mills |first1=Martin |last2=Francis |first2=Becky |last3=Skelton |first3=Christine |chapter=Gender policies in Australia and the United Kingdom |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouWMouuNuWAC&amp;pg=PA38 |editor-last1=Martino |editor-first1=Wayne |editor-last2=Kehler |editor-first2=Michael |editor-last3=Weaver-Hightower |editor-first3=Marcus B. |title=The problem with boys' education: beyond the backlash |date=8 June 2009 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-1-56023-683-2 |pages=38–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gender Gap in UK Degree Subjects"&gt;{{cite web |author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/05/gender-gap-uk-degree-subjects-doubles-eight-years-ucas-study |title=Gender gap in UK degree subjects doubles in eight years, UCAS study finds |work=The Guardian &amp;#124; Education |date=5 January 2016 |access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They critique what they describe as the "feminization" of education, stating that the predominance of female teachers, a focus on girls' needs, as well as a curricula and assessment methods that supposedly favour girls, have proved repressive and restrictive to men and boys.&lt;ref name="Kanani 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Becky Francis |author2=Christine Skelton |title=Reassessing gender and achievement: questioning contemporary key debates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XkkfekXzkZMC&amp;pg=PA18 |access-date=26 December 2011 |date=27 September 2005 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-33324-5 |pages=18–19, 141 |author1-link=Becky Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men's rights groups call for increased recognition of masculinity, greater numbers of male role models, more competitive sports, and the increased responsibilities for boys in the school setting. They have also advocated clearer school routines, more traditional school structures, including gender-[[Segregated education|segregated]] classrooms, and stricter discipline.&lt;ref name="Francis 2005"/&gt;

One primary characteristic of men's rights groups is the view of boys as a homogeneous group that shares common educational experiences; this means that it fails to account for how responses to educational approaches may differ by age, disability, culture, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, and class.&lt;ref name="Francis 2005"/&gt;

In Australia, men's rights discourse has influenced government policy documents. Compared to Australia, less impact has been noted in the United Kingdom, where feminists have historically had less influence on educational policy.&lt;ref name="Mills 2009"/&gt; However, [[Mary Curnock Cook]], the British [[Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS) chief executive, argued that in Britain "despite the clear evidence and despite the press coverage, there is a deafening policy silence on the issue. Has the women's movement now become so normalised that we cannot conceive of needing to take positive action to secure equal education outcomes for boys?"&lt;ref name="Gender Gap in UK Degree Subjects"/&gt;

===Female privilege===
The men's rights movement rejects the concept that men are privileged relative to women. The movement is divided into two groups: those who consider men and women to be harmed equally by sexism, and those who view society as endorsing the degradation of men and upholding what they term "female privilege".{{sfn|Clatterbaugh|1997|page=11|ps=: "Indeed the premise of all men's rights literature is that men are ''not'' privileged relative to women... Having denied that men are privileged relative to women, this movement divides into those who believe that men and women are equally harmed by [[sexism]] and those who believe that society has become a bastion of female privilege and male degradation.}}

===Governmental structures===
Men's rights groups have called for governmental structures to address issues specific to men and boys including education, health, work and marriage.&lt;ref name="What about tax"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/What-about-tax-and-fathers-custody-rights/articleshow/5244920.cms |title=What about tax, and father's custody rights? |work=The Times of India |date=17 May 2011 |access-date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="For Him Minister"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wetzstein 2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/17/guys-got-it-made-think-again-say-advocates/ |title=Guys got it made?

===Homelessness===

But, many reasons are found outside the homelessness system, like men being over-represented in the criminal justice system and more likely to drop out of school than women. &lt;ref&gt; "Demographic Data Project: Gender and Individual Homelessness" National Alliance to End Homelessness. https://endhomelessness.org/demographic-data-project-gender-and-individual-homelessness/ &lt;/ref&gt;  For information on the homeless population of the United States as a whole, see [[Homelessness in the United States]].

{{Main|Conscription and sexism}}
Men's rights activists argue that the sole military [[conscription]] of men is an example of discrimination against men.{{sfn |Messner |1997 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA41 41–48]}}&lt;ref name="Boyd 1996"&gt;{{cite book |title=Redeeming men: religion and masculinities |editor=Stephen Blake Boyd |editor2=W.

According to [[David Benatar]], "perhaps the most obvious example of male disadvantage is the long history of social and legal pressures on men, but not on women, to enter the military and to fight in war, thereby risking their lives and bodily and psychological health. Where the pressure to join the military has taken the form of conscription, the costs of avoidance have been self-imposed exile, imprisonment, physical assault or, in the most extreme circumstances, execution."&lt;ref name="Benatar 2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Benatar |first=D |author-link=David Benatar |title=The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys |isbn=978-1-118-19230-6 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iGZ0dhvvVN8C&amp;pg=PA35 35] |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 80 countries worldwide still use conscription in various forms, and most of these have a male-only draft.&lt;ref name="Benatar 2012"/&gt; As of 2018, only two countries – [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] – required women to be conscripted under the same formal conditions as men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Persson |first1=Alma |last2=Sundevall |first2=Fia |date=22 March 2019 |title=Conscripting women: gender, soldiering, and military service in Sweden 1965–2018 |journal=Women's History Review |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=1039–1056 |doi=10.1080/09612025.2019.1596542 |issn=0961-2025 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-women-conscription-idUSBRE95D0NB20130614 |title=Norway becomes first NATO country to draft women into military |last1=Koranyi |first1=Balazs |date=14 June 2014 |access-date=31 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128132614/https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/14/us-norway-women-conscription-idUSBRE95D0NB20130614 |archive-date=28 January 2015 |url-status=live |work=[[Reuters]] |last2=Fouche |first2=Gwladys |editor-last=Char |editor-first=Pravin |location=Oslo, Norway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, all males ages 18–25 are required to register for [[Selective Service System|Selective Service]]. Failure to do so can result in fines, imprisonment, and ineligibility for student loans and federal employment. Women are not required to register. In 1971, draft resisters in the United States initiated a class-action suit alleging that male-only conscription violated men's rights to equal protection under the US constitution.&lt;ref name="Binkin 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carelli 1981" /&gt; When the case, ''[[Rostker v.

===Paternity fraud===
{{Main|Non-paternity event|Paternity fraud}}
Men's and fathers' rights groups interest in "paternity fraud" or mistaken paternity falls into two main categories: men who are compelled to provide financial support for a child that has been proven by DNA testing not to be their biological offspring, and men who have been led to believe that the children they are raising are their own, and have subsequently discovered otherwise.&lt;ref name="Cannold 2008"/&gt; They hold biological views of fatherhood, emphasizing the imperative of the genetic foundation of paternity rather than social aspects of fatherhood.&lt;ref name="Cannold 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Majumber 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Majumber, Mary Anderlik |editor=Mark A.

In addition, they say non-biological fathers are denied the resources to have their own biological children in another relationship.&lt;ref name="Cannold 2008"/&gt;

Men's rights activists support the use of one-parent consent [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]] to reassure presumed fathers about the child's paternity;&lt;ref name="Salah 2005"/&gt; men's and fathers' rights groups have also called for compulsory paternity testing of all children.&lt;ref name="Cannold 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/men-flock-online-for-peace-of-mind-paternity-tests/story-e6frfro0-1226385528162 |title=Men flock online for 'peace of mind' paternity tests |first=Tory |last=Shepherd |work=news.com.au |date=6 June 2012 |access-date=27 October 2012 |archive-date=24 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224191046/http://www.news.com.au/technology/men-flock-online-for-peace-of-mind-paternity-tests/story-e6frfro0-1226385528162 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Who's your daddy? |newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News |date=5 October 2005 |quote="I think the best solution is DNA testing at birth," said Glenn Sacks, a syndicated radio talk-show host who focuses on men's issues}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have campaigned vigorously in support of men who have been shown by [[genetic testing]] not to be the biological father, but who are nevertheless required to be financially responsible for them.&lt;ref name="Majumber 2005"/&gt; Prompted by these concerns, legislators in certain jurisdictions have supported this biological view and have passed laws providing relief from child support payments when a man is proved not to be the father.&lt;ref name="Cannold 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cannold |first=Leslie |title=Who's the father?

Estimates of the extent of misattributed paternity vary considerably.

To argue the issue of false accusations of rape, the categories of 'false' and 'unsubstantiated' are often conflated, such as the [[National Coalition for Men]] citing reports such as the 1996 FBI summary that finds a rate of 8% for unsubstantiated forcible rape, which is four times higher than the average for all [[index crimes]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="False Accusations"&gt;{{cite web |date=11 January 2009 |title=False Accusations |url=http://www.ncfm.org/2009/01/issues/false-accusations/ |access-date=6 May 2013 |work=National Coalition For Men}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-source-inline|date=April 2023}} Experts emphasize that ''verified'' false allegations are a distinct category from unsubstantiated allegations, and conflating the two is fallacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lisak |first1=David |last2=Gardinier |first2=Lori |last3=Nicksa |first3=Sarah C. |last4=Cote |first4=Ashley M. |date=December 2010 |title=False allegations of sexual assault: an analysis of ten years of reported cases |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=16 |issue=12 |pages=1318–1334 |doi=10.1177/1077801210387747 |issn=1552-8448 |pmid=21164210 |s2cid=15377916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures are widely debated due to the questionable methodology and small sample sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lisak |first1=David |last2=Gardinier |first2=Lori |last3=Nicksa |first3=Sarah C. |last4=Cote |first4=Ashley M. |date=2010-12-01 |title=False Allegations of Sexual {{sic|Assua|lt |nolink=y}}: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=16 |issue=12 |pages=1318–1334 |doi=10.1177/1077801210387747 |issn=1077-8012 |pmid=21164210 |s2cid=15377916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gross 2009"&gt;Gross, Bruce (Spring 2009).

====Critique of men's rights rape discourse====

Feminist scholars Lise Gotell and Emily Dutton argue that content on the [[manosphere]] reveals anti-feminist arguments, including that sexual violence is a gender-neutral problem, feminists are responsible for erasing men's experiences of victimization, false allegations are widespread, and that [[rape culture]] is a feminist-produced moral panic. They contend it is important to engage [this topic] as there is a real danger that MRA (Men's Rights Activism) claims could come to define the popular conversation about sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gotell |first=Lise |year=2016 |title=Sexual Violence in the 'Manosphere': Antifeminist Men's Rights Discourses on Rape |journal=International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=65–80 |doi=10.5204/ijcjsd.v5i2.310 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproductive rights===
{{See also|Paper abortion}}
Men's rights campaigners assert that while a woman has several legal avenues to opt out of being a mother after conception (abortion, adoption, [[Safe-haven law|safe haven laws]]), a man has no choice in whether he becomes a father and is at the mercy of the mother's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Helen |title=Men on Strike: Why Men Are Boycotting Marriage, Fatherhood, and the American Dream-And Why It Matters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9m6kMQEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |chapter=Chapter 2&lt;!--The Marriage Strike: why men don't marry--&gt; |publisher=Encounter Books |location=New York |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-59403-675-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thoughtcatalog.com/janet-bloomfield/2014/05/heres-why-men-should-have-the-reproductive-rights-that-women-have/ |title=Let's Talk About Reproductive Rights And Why Men Should Have Them Too |work=Thought Catalog |date=31 May 2014 |access-date=16 December 2020 |author=[[Janet Bloomfield]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a man who fathers a child as a result of [[reproductive coercion]] or a sexual assault by a woman can still be compelled to support the child financially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Higdon |first=Michael J. |title=Fatherhood by Conscription: Nonconsensual Insemination and the Duty of Child Support |journal=University of Tennessee Legal Studies |volume=139 |date=14 February 2011 |ssrn=1761333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases in [[Kansas]], [[California]] and [[Arizona]] have established that a male raped as a minor by a woman can be held legally responsible for a child that results from the assault, a situation the director of the National Center for Men described as "off-the-charts ridiculous" that "wouldn't be tolerated" if the genders were reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/male-statutory-rape-victim-nick-olivas-must-pay-child-support-2014-9?r=US&amp;IR=T |title=Arizona Is Requiring A Male Statutory Rape Victim To Pay Child Support |work=Business Insider |date=2 September 2014 |access-date=16 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Warren Farrell, "''Roe v.

In consequence, some advocate for "paper abortion", which would allow the [[biological father]], before the birth of the child, to opt out of any rights, privileges, and responsibilities toward the child, including [[Child support|financial support]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}}

In 2006, the American National Center for Men backed [[Dubay v. Wells]], a lawsuit which concerned whether men should have the opportunity to decline all paternity rights and responsibilities in the event of an unplanned pregnancy. Supporters argued that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Traister |first=R |date=13 March 2006 |url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/03/13/roe_for_men/ |title=Roe for men? |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |access-date=17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case and the appeal were dismissed, with the U.S. Court of Appeals (Sixth Circuit) stating that neither parent has the right to sever their financial responsibilities for a child and that "Dubay's claim that a man's right to disclaim fatherhood would be analogous to a woman's right to abortion rests upon a false analogy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0442p-06.pdf |title=U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, case No. 06-11016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valenti 2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jessica Valenti |title=Why Have Kids?: A New Mom Explores the Truth About Parenting and Happiness |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXnxd2le7XYC&amp;pg=PA103 |access-date=11 May 2013 |year=2012 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-0-547-89261-0 |pages=103–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social security and insurance===
Men's rights groups argue that women are given superior social security and tax benefits than men.{{sfn|Clatterbaugh|2007a}} Warren Farrell states that men in the United States pay more into social security, but in total, women receive more in benefits, and that discrimination against men in insurance and pensions have gone unrecognized.{{sfn|Farrell|1994|p=350}}{{Third-party inline|date=January 2022}}

Professor Ruth M. Mann of the [[University of Windsor]] in Canada suggests that men's rights groups fuel an international rhetoric of hatred and victimization by disseminating misinformation via online forums and websites containing constantly-updated "diatribes against feminism, ex-wives, child support, shelters, and the family law and criminal justice systems."&lt;ref name="Mann 2008" /&gt; According to Mann, these stories reignite their hatred and reinforce their beliefs that the system is biased against men and that feminism is responsible for a large scale and ongoing "cover-up" of men's victimization. Mann says that although existing legislation in Canada acknowledges that men are ''also'' victims of domestic violence, men's rights advocates demand government recognition that men are equally or ''more'' victimized by domestic violence, claims not supported by the data.&lt;ref name="Mann 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.brown.uk.com/domesticviolence/mann.pdf |title=Men's Rights and Feminist Advocacy in Canadian Domestic Violence Policy Arenas. |last=Mann |first=Ruth M. |date=2008 |journal=Feminist Criminology |volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1177/1557085107311067 |pages=44–75 |citeseerx=10.1.1.413.6328 |s2cid=145502648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann also states that in contrast to feminist groups, who have advocated for domestic violence services on behalf of other historically oppressed groups in addition to women, such as individuals impacted by poverty, ethnicity, disability, [[sexual orientation]], etc., men's rights groups have attempted to achieve their goals by actively opposing and attempting to dismantle services and supports put in place to protect abused women and children.&lt;ref name="Mann 2008" /&gt;

Other researchers such as [[Michael Flood]] have accused the men's rights movement, particularly the father's rights groups in [[Australia]], of endangering women, children, and even men who are at greater risk of abuse and violence.&lt;ref name="Dragiewicz 2011a"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/10536 |title=Equality with a Vengeance: Men's Rights Groups, Battered Women, and Antifeminist Backlash |last=Dragiewicz |first=Molly |date=2011 |publisher=Northeastern University Press |isbn=978-1-55553-756-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flood |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Flood |title="Fathers' rights" and the defense of paternal authority in Australia |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=328–347 |doi=10.1177/1077801209360918 |pmid=20133921 |date=March 2010 |s2cid=206667283 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/890044}} [http://www.xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Flood,%20%27Fathers%27%20rights%27%20and%20defence%20of%20paternal%20authority.pdf Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406000050/http://www.xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Flood,%20%27Fathers%27%20rights%27%20and%20defence%20of%20paternal%20authority.pdf |date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flood states that the men's rights/father's rights groups in Australia pursue "equality with a vengeance" or equal policies with negative outcomes and motives in order to re-establish paternal authority over the well-being of children and women as well as positive parenting.&lt;ref name="Flood 2010" /&gt;
