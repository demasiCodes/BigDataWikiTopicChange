The '''men's rights movement''' ('''MRM''') is a part of the larger [[men's movement]]. It branched off from the [[men's liberation movement]] in the early 1970s. The men's rights movement is notably [[anti-feminist]] and made up of a variety of groups and individuals who focus on numerous social issues (including [[family law]], [[parenting]], [[reproduction]], [[domestic violence against men]] and opposition to [[circumcision]]) and government services (including [[education]], [[Conscription|compulsory military service]], [[social safety net]]s, and health policies), which men's rights advocates say discriminate against men.

Scholars have described the men's rights movement or parts of the movement as a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] against [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=backlash/&gt;

Claims and activities associated with the men's rights movement have been criticized and labeled hateful and violent by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Goldwag | first = Arthur|title=Hatewatch: Intelligence report article provokes fury among Men's Rights Activists|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2012/05/15/intelligence-report-article-provokes-fury-among-mens-rights-activists|website=splcenter.org/hatewatch|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]| date = May 15, 2012|accessdate = May 5, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Political Research Associates]].&lt;ref name="politicalresearch.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.politicalresearch.org/2011/03/01/fathers-rights-groups-threaten-womens-gains-and-their-safety/|title=Father’s Rights Groups Threaten Women’s Gains—And Their Safety |website=[[Political Research Associates]] |language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Southern Poverty Law Center categorized some men's rights groups as being part of a hate ideology under the umbrella of [[patriarchy]] and [[Patriarchy|male supremacy]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/male-supremacy|title=Male Supremacy|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement and sectors of the movement have been described as [[Misogyny|misogynistic]],&lt;ref name="Ruzankina"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ruzankina | first = E.A. | title = Men's movements and male subjectivity | journal = Anthropology &amp; Archeology of Eurasia | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 8&amp;ndash;16 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.2753/aae1061-1959490101 | date = 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2753/aae1061-1959490101 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the perceived disadvantage some men feel is argued as often being due to loss of [[entitlement]] and privilege.&lt;ref name="GrauniadSep2016"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hackman | first = Rose | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/straight-while-men-suffering-sex-feminism | title=I didn’t choose to be straight, white and male': are modern men the suffering sex? | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=September 5, 2016 | accessdate=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Forerunners===
The term "men's rights" was used at least as early as February 1856 when it appeared in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff writer | title = A word for men's rights | journal = [[Putnam's Magazine]] | volume = 7 | issue = 38 | pages = 208&amp;ndash;214 | publisher = [[G.

Three loosely connected men's rights organizations formed in [[Austria]] in the [[interwar period]]. The ''League for Men's Rights'' was founded in 1926 with the goal of "combatting all excesses of women's emancipation".&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Der 'Bund für Männerrechte'.

They criticized marriage and family laws, especially the requirement to pay spousal and child support to former wives and [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] children, and supported the use of blood tests to determine paternity.&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter/&gt;&lt;ref name=uofvienna/&gt; ''Justitia'' and ''Aequitas'' issued their own short-lived journals ''Men's Rightists Newspaper'' and ''Self-Defense'' where they expressed their views that were heavily influenced by the works of [[Heinrich Schurtz]], [[Otto Weininger]], and [[Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels]]. The organizations ceased to exist before 1939.&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter/&gt;&lt;ref name=uofvienna/&gt;

==Issues==
Men's rights proponents are concerned with a wide variety of matters, some of which have spawned their own groups or movements, such as the [[fathers' rights movement]], concerned specifically with [[divorce]] and [[child custody]] issues.{{sfn |Messner | 1997 |p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 41–48] }} Some, if not all, men's rights issues stem from [[gender roles]] and, according to sociologist Allan Johnson, [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Gender Knot: Unraveling our Patriarchal Legacy | publisher=Temple University Press | author=Johnson, Allan G. | year=2005 | location=Philadelphia | isbn=978-1592133833 | page=220 | quote= such problems are prominent in many men's lives, but this is no organized male response to the patriarchal system whose dynamics produce much of men's loss, suffering, and grief. Contrary to Bly's claim, it is not a parallel to the women's movement that is merely on a "different timetable." It may be a response to genuine emotional and spiritual needs that are met by bringing men together to drum, chant, and share stories and feelings from their lives. It may help to heal some of the damage patriarchy does to men's lives. But it is not a movement aimed at the system and the gender dynamics that actually cause that damage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He proposes that women be legally required to make every reasonable effort to notify the father of her pregnancy within four to five days.{{sfn|Farrell|2008|p=79–80}} In response, philosopher James P. Sterba agrees that, for moral reasons, a woman should inform the father of the pregnancy and adoption, but this should not be imposed as a legal requirement as it might result in undue pressure, for example, to have an abortion.{{sfn|Farrell|2008|p=193–94}}

===Education===
{{see also|Sex differences in education}}
Men's rights adherents describe the education of boys as being in crisis, with boys having reduced educational achievement and motivation compared to girls.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; Advocates blame the influence of feminism on education for what they believe is discrimination against and systematic oppression of boys in the education system.&lt;ref name="MartinoKehler2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mills| first1 =Martin|last2=Francis| first2 = Becky|last3=Skelton| first3 = Christine|chapter=Gender policies in Australia and the United Kingdom|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouWMouuNuWAC&amp;pg=PA38|editor-last1= Martino | editor-first1 = Wayne|editor-last2= Kehler | editor-first2 = Michael |editor-last3= Weaver-Hightower | editor-first3 = Marcus B. |title=The problem with boys' education: beyond the backlash|date=8 June 2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-56023-683-2|pages=38–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/05/gender-gap-uk-degree-subjects-doubles-eight-years-ucas-study |title=Gender gap in UK degree subjects doubles in eight years, UCAS study finds |work=The Guardian &amp;#124; Education |date=5 January 2016 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They critique what they describe as the "feminization" of education, stating that the predominance of female teachers, a focus on girls' needs, as well as a curricula and assessment methods that supposedly favour girls, have proved repressive and restrictive to men and boys.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Becky Francis]]|author2=Christine Skelton|title=Reassessing gender and achievement: questioning contemporary key debates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XkkfekXzkZMC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=26 December 2011|date=27 September 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33324-5|pages=18–19, 141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study has also found gender differences in academic achievement not being reliably linked to gender policies, and that female academic achievement is greater than boys' in 70% of studied countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = Gijsbert | last2 = Geary | first2 = David C. | title = Sex differences in academic achievement are not related to political, economic, or social equality | journal = [[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]] | volume = 48 | pages = 137&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2014.11.006 | date = January–February 2015 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2014.11.006 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is contradicted in Australia by ACARA's independent NAPLAN findings that "Since their introduction, a subtle but consistent pattern of gender differences in performance on the NAPLAN tests has emerged, with boys regularly outperforming girls in numeracy, and girls consistently outperforming boys in the reading, writing, spelling, and grammar and punctuation components".&lt;ref name="ro.ecu.edu.au"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leder | first1 = Gilah C. | last2 = Forgasz | first2 = Helen J. | last3 = Jackson | first3 = Glenda  | title = Mathematics, English and Gender Issues: Do Teachers Count? | journal = Australian Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | page = 2 | publisher = [[Edith Cowan University]] | doi = 10.14221/ajte.2014v39n9.3 | date = September 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.14221/ajte.2014v39n9.3 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2393&amp;context=ajte Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; To further add to the confusion with other evidence presented, there has been an obvious, unexplained and significant drop in the number of boys at university in most countries. Australia, for example, has seen a drop from 61% to 46% since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Parr|first=Nick |title=Who goes to university? The changing profile of our students |url=http://theconversation.com/who-goes-to-university-the-changing-profile-of-our-students-40373 |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |date=24 May 2015 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar trends have been observed in the UK, which is thought to be influenced primarily by teacher policies and attitudes.&lt;ref name="ro.ecu.edu.au"/&gt;

Men's rights groups call for increased recognition of masculinity, greater numbers of male role models, more competitive sports, and the increased responsibilities for boys in the school setting. They have also advocated clearer school routines, more traditional school structures, including gender-[[Segregated education|segregated]] classrooms, and stricter discipline.&lt;ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"/&gt;

Critics suggest that men's rights groups view boys as a homogeneous group sharing common experiences of schooling and that they fail to account for how responses to educational approaches may differ by age, disability, culture, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, and class.&lt;ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"/&gt;

In Australia, men's rights discourse has influenced government policy documents. Compared to Australia, less impact has been noted in the United Kingdom, where feminists have historically had less influence on educational policy.&lt;ref name="MartinoKehler2009"/&gt; However, [[Mary Curnock Cook]], the UCAs chief executive, argued that in Britain "despite the clear evidence and despite the press coverage, there is a deafening policy silence on the issue. Has the women’s movement now become so normalised that we cannot conceive of needing to take positive action to secure equal education outcomes for boys?”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Female privilege===
{{See also|Discrimination}}
The men's rights movement rejects the concept that men are privileged relative to women.&lt;ref name=clatter&gt;{{cite book|last=Clatterbaugh|first=Kenneth|title=Contemporary perspectives on masculinity: Men, women, and politics in modern society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfG8qCLMP9EC&amp;lpg|date=1996|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=978-0813327013|edition=Reissued 2nd.|page=11|quote=Indeed the premise of all men's rights literature is that men are ''not'' privileged relative to women... Having denied that men are privileged relative to women, this movement divides into those who believe that men and women are equally harmed by [[sexism]] and those who believe that society has become a bastion of female privilege and male degradation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is divided into two groups: those who consider men and women to be harmed equally by sexism, and those who view society as endorsing the degradation of men and upholding what they term "female privilege".&lt;ref name=clatter/&gt;

Scholars have rejected the idea of female privilege, as research since the early 90s on [[ambivalent sexism]] across the world has found that these "privileges" are [[benevolent sexism]], which contributes to women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Connor|first=Rachel|title=Ambivalent sexism in the 21st century|date=2016-01-01|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315637642_Ambivalent_sexism_in_the_21st_century|access-date=2018-09-09|last2=Glick|first2=Peter|last3=Fiske|first3=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that the U.S. government having an Office of Research on Women's Health but no Office of Research on Men's Health, along with the U.S. federal government spending twice as much money on Women's health, shows that society considers men more disposable than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farrell|first1=Warren|title=The Myth of Male Power: Why Men are The Disposable Sex|date=February 10, 2014|publisher= Dr. Warren Farrell|location=Chapter 7|edition=21st anniversary|url=http://warrenfarrell.org|accessdate=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incarceration===
Men's rights activists say differential prison terms for men and women are evidence of discrimination against men.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhys H.

===Military conscription===
Men's rights adherents have argued that sole military [[conscription]] of men is an example of discrimination against men.{{sfn |Messner | 1997 |p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 41–48] }}&lt;ref name="BoydLongwood1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Redeeming men: religion and masculinities|editor=Stephen Blake Boyd |editor2=W.

In 1971, draft resisters in the United States initiated a class-action suit alleging that male-only conscription violated men's rights to equal protection under the US constitution.&lt;ref name="Binkin1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tb/&gt; When the case, ''[[Rostker v.

===Paternity fraud===
{{Main|Non-paternity event|paternity fraud}}
Men's and fathers' rights groups have said that there are high levels of mistaken paternity or "paternity fraud", where men are parenting and/or financially supporting children who are not biologically their own.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt; They hold biological views of fatherhood, emphasizing the imperative of the genetic foundation of paternity rather than social aspects of fatherhood.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt;&lt;ref name="RothsteinMurray2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Majumber, Mary Anderlik |editor=Mark A.

In addition, they say non-biological fathers are denied the resources to have their own biological children in another relationship.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt;

Men's rights activists support the use of nonconsensual [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]] to reassure presumed fathers about the child's paternity;&lt;ref name=salah/&gt; men's and fathers' rights groups have called for compulsory paternity testing of all children.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt;&lt;ref name=shepherd&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.news.com.au/technology/men-flock-online-for-peace-of-mind-paternity-tests/story-e6frfro0-1226385528162 |title=Men flock online for 'peace of mind' paternity tests |first= Tory |last= Shepherd|work=news.com.au |date= 6 June 2012|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's your daddy?|newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News|date=5 October 2005|quote="I think the best solution is DNA testing at birth," said Glenn Sacks, a syndicated radio talk-show host who focuses on men's issues}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have campaigned vigorously in support of men who have been shown by genetic testing not to be the biological father, but who are nevertheless required to be financially responsible for them.&lt;ref name="RothsteinMurray2005"/&gt; Prompted by these concerns, legislators in certain jurisdictions have supported this biological view and have passed laws providing relief from child support payments when a man is proved not to be the father.&lt;ref name=cannold&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Cannold | first = Leslie | title = Who's the father?

To argue the issue of false accusations of rape, the categories of 'false' and 'unsubstantiated' are often conflated, such as the [[National Coalition for Men]] citing reports like the 1996 FBI summary that finds a rate of 8% for unsubstantiated forcible rape, which is four times higher than the average for all [[index crimes]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="ncfmrape" /&gt; Experts emphasize that ''verified'' false allegations are a distinct category from unsubstantiated allegations, and conflating the two is fallacious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lisak|first=David|last2=Gardinier|first2=Lori|last3=Nicksa|first3=Sarah C.|last4=Cote|first4=Ashley M.|date=December 2010|title=False allegations of sexual assault: an analysis of ten years of reported cases|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1318–1334|doi=10.1177/1077801210387747|issn=1552-8448|pmid=21164210}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures are widely debated due to the questionable methodology and small sample sizes - see the [[False accusation of rape]] page for wider survey estimates.

==== Critique of men's rights rape discourse ====

Feminist scholars Lise Gotell and Emily Dutton argue that content on the [[manosphere]] reveals anti-feminist pro-rape arguments, including that sexual violence is a gender-neutral problem, feminists are responsible for erasing men's experiences of victimization, false allegations are widespread, and that [[rape culture]] is a feminist-produced moral panic. They contend it is important to engage [this topic] as there is a real danger that MRA (Men's Rights Activism) claims could come to define the popular conversation about sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gotell|first=Lise|year=2016|title=Sexual Violence in the 'Manosphere': Antifeminist Men's Rights Discourses on Rape|url=|journal=International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy|volume=5|pages=65–80|via=|doi=10.5204/ijcjsd.v5i2.310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproductive rights===
In 2006, the American [[National Center for Men]] backed a lawsuit known as ''[[Dubay v. Wells]]''.

Men's rights groups argue that women are given superior social security and tax benefits than men.{{sfn|Flood|2007| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jh7y6ELc90YC&amp;pg=PA430#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 430–433]}} Warren Farrell states that men in the United States pay more into social security, but in total, women receive more in benefits, and that discrimination against men in insurance and pensions have gone unrecognized.{{sfn|Farrell|1994|p=350}}

===Suicide===
{{Main|Gender differences in suicide}}
Men's rights activists point to higher [[suicide]] rates in men compared to women.&lt;ref name="HaywoodGhaill2003"/&gt;{{sfn|Menzies|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ASc568aunFoC&amp;pg=PA86 86]}} In the United States for example, the male-to-female suicide death ratio varies, approximately, between 3:1 and 10:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Teen Suicide Statistics | publisher=FamilyFirstAid.org | year=2001 | work=Adolescent Teenage Suicide Prevention | url=http://www.familyfirstaid.org/suicide.html | accessdate=2006-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have found an over-representation of women in attempted or incomplete suicides and men in complete suicide.&lt;ref name="jad-journal.com"&gt;{{cite web|title = The gender paradox in suicidal behavior and its impact on the suicidal process - Journal of Affective Disorders|url = http://www.jad-journal.com/article/S0165-0327(11)00149-2/abstract|website = www.jad-journal.com|accessdate = 2015-12-23|subscription=yes|pmid=21529962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon, termed the "gender paradox of suicide", is argued to derive from a tendency for females to use less lethal methods and greater male access and use of lethal methods.&lt;ref name="jad-journal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.people-press.org/2013/03/12/section-3-gun-ownership-trends-and-demographics/ | title=Section 3: Gun Ownership Trends and Demographics | work=www.people-press.org | publisher=Pew Research Center | date=March 12, 2013 | accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Ruth M. Mann of the [[University of Windsor]] in Canada suggests that men's rights groups fuel an international rhetoric of hatred and victimization by disseminating misinformation via online forums and websites containing constantly-updated "diatribes against feminism, ex-wives, child support, shelters, and the family law and criminal justice systems".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Mann, these stories reignite their hatred and reinforce their beliefs that the system is biased against men and that feminism is responsible for a large scale and ongoing "cover-up" of men's victimization. Mann says that although existing legislation in Canada acknowledges that men are ''also'' victims of domestic violence, men's rights advocates demand government recognition that men are equally or ''more'' victimized by domestic violence, claims not supported by the data.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.brown.uk.com/domesticviolence/mann.pdf|title = Men's Rights and Feminist Advocacy in Canadian Domestic Violence Policy Arenas.|last = Mann|first = Ruth M.|date = 2008|journal = Feminist Criminology| volume = 3| issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/1557085107311067|pmid = |access-date =|pages=44–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann also states that in contrast to feminist groups, who have advocated for domestic violence services on behalf of other historically oppressed groups in addition to women, such as individuals impacted by poverty, ethnicity, disability, [[sexual orientation]], etc., men's rights groups have attempted to achieve their goals by actively opposing and attempting to dismantle services and supports put in place to protect abused women and children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Domestic abuse expert Lundy Bancroft has called men's rights "the abuser's crusade" and said that the attitudes of the movement contribute to abuse of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2014/05/06/domestic-violence-expert-lundy-bancroft-mens-rights-philosophies-make-angry-and-controlling-men-even-worse/|title=Domestic violence expert Lundy Bancroft: Men’s Rights philosophies make angry and controlling men even worse.|date=2014-05-06|work=We Hunted The Mammoth|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers such as [[Michael Flood]] have accused the men's rights movement, particularly the father's rights groups in [[Australia]], of endangering women, children, and even men who are at greater risk of abuse and violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Flood | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Flood | title = "Fathers' rights" and the defense of paternal authority in Australia |journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 328–347 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1077801209360918 |date= March 2010 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801209360918 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Flood,%20%27Fathers%27%20rights%27%20and%20defence%20of%20paternal%20authority.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/10536|title=Equality with a Vengeance: Men's Rights Groups, Battered Women, and Antifeminist Backlash|last=Dragiewicz|first=Molly|date=2011|publisher=Northeastern University Press|isbn=9781555537562|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flood states that the men's rights/father's rights groups in Australia pursues "equality with a vengeance" or equal policies with negative outcomes and motives in order to re-establish paternal authority over the well-being of children and women as well as positive parenting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
