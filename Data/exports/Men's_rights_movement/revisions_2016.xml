The '''men's rights movement''' ('''MRM''') is a part of the larger [[men's movement]]. It branched off from the [[men's liberation movement]] in the early 1970s. The men's rights movement is made up of a variety of groups and individuals who focus on numerous social issues (including [[family law]], [[parenting]], [[reproduction]], [[domestic violence]]) and government services (including [[education]], [[Conscription|compulsory military service]], [[social safety net]]s, and health policies), which men's rights advocates say discriminate against men.

Some scholars consider the men's rights movement or parts of the movement to be a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] to [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=backlash/&gt; Men's rights activists contest claims by feminists that men have greater power, privilege or advantage than women and argue that modern feminism has gone too far and has harmed men's rights.

Claims and activities associated with the men's rights movement have been criticized by some scholars, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], and commentators. Some sectors of the movement have been described as [[Misogyny|misogynistic]].&lt;ref name="Ruzankina"/&gt; Others argue that perceived disadvantage is often due to loss of [[entitlement]] and privilege.&lt;ref name="GrauniadSep2016"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/straight-while-men-suffering-sex-feminism | title=I didn’t choose to be straight, white and male': are modern men the suffering sex? | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=September 5, 2016 | accessdate=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Forerunners===
The term "men's rights" was used at least as early as February 1856 when it appeared in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Putnam's Magazine]], [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=putn;cc=putn;view=toc;subview=short;idno=putn0007-2 Volume 7 Issue 38] published February 1856, pages 208–214 "[http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=putn;cc=putn;rgn=full%20text;idno=putn0007-2;didno=putn0007-2;view=image;seq=0214;node=putn0007-2%3A16 A Word for Men's Rights]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Three loosely connected men's rights organizations formed in [[Austria]] in the [[interwar period]]. The ''League for Men's Rights'' was founded in 1926 with the goal of "combatting all excesses of women's emancipation".&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Der 'Bund für Männerrechte'.

They criticized marriage and family laws, especially the requirement to pay spousal and child support to former wives and [[Legitimacy (law)|illegitimate]] children, and supported the use of blood tests to determine paternity.&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter/&gt;&lt;ref name=uofvienna/&gt; ''Justitia'' and ''Aequitas'' issued their own short-lived journals ''Men's Rightists'{{sic|?}} Newspaper'' and ''Self-Defense'' where they expressed their views that were heavily influenced by the works of [[Heinrich Schurtz]], [[Otto Weininger]], and [[Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels]]. The organizations ceased to exist before 1939.&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter/&gt;&lt;ref name=uofvienna/&gt;

Professor Ruth M. Mann of the [[University of Windsor]] in Canada said that men's rights groups fuel an international rhetoric of hatred and victimization by disseminating information via online forums and websites containing constantly-updated "diatribes against feminism, ex-wives, child support, shelters, and the family law and criminal justice systems."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Mann, these stories reignite their hatred and reinforce their beliefs that the system is biased against men and that feminism is responsible for a large scale and ongoing "cover-up" of men's victimization. Mann says that although existing legislation in Canada acknowledges that men are ''also'' victims of domestic violence, men's advocates demand government recognition that men are equally or more victimized by domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.brown.uk.com/domesticviolence/mann.pdf|title = Men's Rights and Feminist Advocacy in Canadian Domestic Violence Policy Arenas.|last = Mann|first = Ruth M.|date = 2008|journal = Feminist Criminology Volume 3 Number 1|doi = 10.1177/1557085107311067|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann also states that in contrast to feminist groups who have advocated for domestic violence services on behalf of other historically oppressed groups in addition to women, such as individuals impacted by poverty, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, etc., men's rights groups have attempted to achieve their goals by actively opposing and attempting to dismantle services and supports put in place to protect abused women and children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other researchers such as [[Michael Flood]] have accused the men's rights movement, particularly the father's rights group in Australia, of endangering women, children, and even men who are at greater risk of abuse and violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Flood | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Flood | title = "Fathers' rights" and the defense of paternal authority in Australia |journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 328–347 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1077801209360918 |date= March 2010 |url= http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1077801209360918 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Flood,%20%27Fathers%27%20rights%27%20and%20defence%20of%20paternal%20authority.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Flood states that the men'rights/father's rights group in Australia pursues "equality with a vengeance" or equal policies with negative outcomes and motives in order to re-establish paternal authority over the well-being of children and women as well as positive parenting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Issues==
The men's rights movement is concerned with a wide variety of issues, some of which have spawned their own groups or movements, such as the [[fathers' rights movement]], concerned specifically with [[divorce]] and [[child custody]] issues.{{sfn |Messner | 1997 |p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 41–48] }} Some if not many men's rights issues stem from [[double standards]], [[gender roles]], and, according to sociologist Allan Johnson, [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Gender Knot: Unraveling our Patriarchal Legacy | publisher=Temple University Press | author=Johnson, Allan G. | year=2005 | location=Philadelphia | isbn=978-1592133833 | page=220 | quote= such problems are prominent in many men's lives, but this is no organized male response to the patriarchal system whose dynamics produce much of men's loss, suffering, and grief. Contrary to Bly's claim, it is not a parallel to the women's movement that is merely on a "different timetable." It may be a response to genuine emotional and spiritual needs that are met by bringing men together to drum, chant, and share stories and feelings from their lives. It may help to heal some of the damage patriarchy does to men's lives. But it is not a movement aimed at the system and the gender dynamics that actually cause that damage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He proposes that women be legally required to make every reasonable effort to notify the father of her pregnancy within four to five days.{{sfn|Farrell|2008|p=79–80}} In response, philosopher James P. Sterba agrees that for moral reasons a woman should inform the father of the pregnancy and adoption, but this should not be imposed as a legal requirement as it might result in undue pressure, for example, to have an abortion.{{sfn|Farrell|2008|p=193–94}}

===Divorce===
Men's rights groups in the United States began organizing in opposition of divorce reform and custody issues around the 1960s. The men involved in the early organization claimed that family and divorce law discriminated against them and favored their wives.{{sfn|Ashe|2007|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nXDbiPA9IuQC&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 57]}} Men's rights leader [[Richard Doyle (rights advocate)|Rich Doyle]] likened divorce courts to slaughter-houses, considering their judgements uncompassionate and unreasonable.{{sfn |Messner | 1997 |p =  [https://books.google.com/books?id=EfyxAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45 45] }}

Men's rights activists assert that men are consciously or unconsciously opting out of marriage and engaging in a "marriage strike" as a result of the lack of benefits in marriage and the emotional and financial consequences of divorce, including alimony and child custody and support.&lt;ref name="SacksThompson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifeminists.com/introduction/editorials/2002/0709a.html|title=Have Anti-Father Family Court Policies Led to a Men's Marriage Strike?|author=Glenn Sacks|authorlink=Glenn Sacks|author2=Dianna Thompson|date=2002-07-09|publisher=ifeminists.com|accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Smith|title=Men on Strike: Why Men Are Boycotting Marriage, Fatherhood, and the American Dream-And Why It Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9m6kMQEACAAJ|chapter=The Marriage Strike: why men don't marry|date=4 June 2013|publisher=ENCOUNTER BOOKS|isbn=978-1-59403-675-0|pages=1–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McElroy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,94415,00.html|title=The Marriage Strike|author=Wendy McElroy|authorlink=Wendy McElroy|date=2003-08-12|publisher=Fox News – Opinion|accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men's rights activists have argued that divorce and custody laws violate men's individual rights to equal protection.

===Education===
Men's rights activists describe the education of boys as being in crisis, with boys having reduced educational achievement and motivation compared to girls.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; Advocates blame the influence of feminism on education for discrimination against and systematic oppression of boys in the education system.&lt;ref name="MartinoKehler2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mills, Martin|author2=Francis, Becky|author3=Skelton, Christine|editor=Wayne Martino |editor2=Michael Kehler |editor3=Marcus B.

Men's rights groups call for increased recognition of masculinity, greater numbers of male role models, more competitive sports and the increased responsibilities for boys in the school setting. They have also advocated clearer school routines, more traditional school structures, including single-sex classes, and stricter discipline.&lt;ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"/&gt;

Critics suggest that men's rights groups view boys as a homogeneous group sharing common experiences of schooling and that they do not take sufficient account in their analysis of how responses to educational approaches may differ by age, culture, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, and class.&lt;ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"/&gt;

In Australia, men's rights discourse has influenced government policy documents. Less impact has been noted in the United Kingdom, where feminists have historically had less influence on educational policy.&lt;ref name="MartinoKehler2009"/&gt;

The men's rights movement disputes the idea that men are privileged relative to women.&lt;ref name=clatter&gt;{{cite book|last=Clatterbaugh|first=Kenneth|title=Contemporary perspectives on masculinity: Men, women, and politics in modern society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfG8qCLMP9EC&amp;lpg|date=1996|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=978-0813327013|edition=Reissued 2nd.|page=11|quote=Indeed the premise of all men's rights literature is that men are ''not'' privileged relative to women...

===Health===
Men's rights activists view the health issues faced by men and their shorter life spans compared to women as evidence of discrimination and oppression.{{sfn |Messner | 1997 |p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 41–48] }}&lt;ref name="HaywoodGhaill2003"/&gt; They state that feminism has led to women's health issues being privileged at the expense of men's.{{sfn|Menzies|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ASc568aunFoC&amp;pg=PA86 86]}} They point to higher [[suicide]] rates in men compared to women,&lt;ref name="HaywoodGhaill2003"/&gt;{{sfn|Menzies|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ASc568aunFoC&amp;pg=PA86 86]}} and highlight the disparity in funding of men's health issues as compared to women's, noting that, for example, prostate cancer research receives less funding than breast-cancer research.&lt;ref name="HaywoodGhaill2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christian Haywood|author2=Máirtín Mac an Ghaill|title=Men and masculinities: theory, research, and social practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-vtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 December 2011|date=1 January 2003|publisher= [[McGraw-Hill|Open University Press]] |pages=134–5|isbn=978-0-335-20892-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-06-21/features/9806210422_1_men-and-masculinity-dads-million-man-march |title=Feminism Has Created Progress, But Man, Oh, Man, Look What Else |first=Kate |last=Zernike |work= [[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1998-06-21 |accessdate=2011-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Benatar]] has suggested that more money should be put into health research on males in order to reduce the disparity between men's and women's [[life expectancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Benatar | first = D | authorlink = David Benatar | title = The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys | isbn = 1118192303 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=iGZ0dhvvVN8C&amp;pg=PA190#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 190] | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military conscription===
Men's rights activists in the US have argued that military [[conscription]] of men is an example of discrimination against men.{{sfn |Messner | 1997 |p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 41–48] }}&lt;ref name="BoydLongwood1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Redeeming men: religion and masculinities|editor=Stephen Blake Boyd |editor2=W.

The movement is made up of a variety of formal and informal groups that differ in their approaches and issues; Men's rights advocates, for example, target sex-specific military conscription and judicial practices that discriminate against men in child custody cases.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, draft resisters in the United States initiated a class-action suit alleging that male-only conscription violated men's rights to equal protection under the US constitution.&lt;ref name="Binkin1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tb/&gt; When the case, ''[[Rostker v.

===Paternity fraud===
{{Main article|Non-paternity event|paternity fraud}}
Men's and fathers' rights groups have stated that there are high levels of misattributed paternity or "paternity fraud", where men are parenting and/or supporting financially children who are not biologically their own.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt; They hold biological views of fatherhood, emphasizing the imperative of the genetic foundation of paternity rather than social aspects of fatherhood.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt;&lt;ref name="RothsteinMurray2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Majumber, Mary Anderlik |editor=Mark A.

===Reproductive rights===
In 2006, the American [[National Center for Men]] backed a lawsuit known as ''[[Dubay v. Wells]]''. The case concerned whether men should have the opportunity to decline all paternity rights and responsibilities in the event of an unplanned pregnancy. Supporters said that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Traister | first = R | date = 2006-03-13 | url = http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/03/13/roe_for_men/ | title = Roe for men? | publisher = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | accessdate = 2007-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case and the appeal were dismissed, with the U.S. Court of Appeals (Sixth Circuit) stating that neither parent has the right to sever their financial responsibilities for a child, and that "Dubay's claim that a man's right to disclaim fatherhood would be analogous to a woman's right to abortion rests upon a false analogy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0442p-06.pdf |format=PDF|title=U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, case No. 06-11016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valenti2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jessica Valenti|title=Why Have Kids?: A New Mom Explores the Truth About Parenting and Happiness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXnxd2le7XYC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=11 May 2013|year=2012|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-89261-0|pages=103–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social security and insurance===
Men's rights groups argue that women are given superior social security and tax benefits than men.{{sfn|Flood|2007| p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jh7y6ELc90YC&amp;pg=PA430#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 430–433]}} Warren Farrell states that men in the United States pay more into social security, but in total women receive more in benefits, and that discrimination against men in insurance and pensions have gone unrecognized.{{sfn|Farrell|1994|p=350}}

===Suicide===
{{Main article|Gender differences in suicide}}
In the United States, the male-to-female suicide death ratio varies between 3:1 to 10:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Teen Suicide Statistics | publisher=FamilyFirstAid.org | year=2001 | work=Adolescent Teenage Suicide Prevention | url=http://www.familyfirstaid.org/suicide.html | accessdate=2006-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have found an over-representation of women in attempted or incomplete suicides and men in complete suicide.&lt;ref name="jad-journal.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The gender paradox in suicidal behavior and its impact on the suicidal process - Journal of Affective Disorders|url = http://www.jad-journal.com/article/S0165-0327(11)00149-2/abstract|website = www.jad-journal.com|accessdate = 2015-12-23|subscription=yes|pmid=21529962}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon termed the "gender paradox of suicide" usually derive from greater tendency for females to use less lethal methods and greater male access and use of lethal methods (such as firearms).&lt;ref name="jad-journal.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.people-press.org/2013/03/12/section-3-gun-ownership-trends-and-demographics/ | title=Section 3: Gun Ownership Trends and Demographics | work=www.people-press.org | publisher=Pew Research Center | date=March 12, 2013 | accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
