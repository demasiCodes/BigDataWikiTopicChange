{{Rights |By claimant}}

The '''men's rights movement''' (MRM) is a [[social movement]] and part of the larger [[men's movement]]. It branched off from the men's liberation movement in the early 1970s. The men's rights movement contests claims that men have greater power, privilege or advantage than women and focuses on what it considers to be issues of male disadvantage, [[discrimination]] and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HgzFZ4o0qnMC&amp;pg=PA11 |page=11 |last=Gavanas |first=Anna |title=Fatherhood Politics in the United States: Masculinity, Sexuality, Race, and Marriage |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=2004 |isbn=0252028848 |quote=All these cases of perceived discrimination make up the men's rights view that men are considered, by government and society, to be more expendable than women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BoydLongwood1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Redeeming men: religion and masculinities|editors=Stephen Blake Boyd, W.

==History==

===Forerunners===
The term "men's rights" appeared in 1856 in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]'', used to frame a critical response to the advances made in women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Putnam's Magazine]], [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=putn;cc=putn;view=toc;subview=short;idno=putn0007-2 Volume 7 Issue 38] published February 1856, pages 208-214 "[http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=putn;cc=putn;rgn=full%20text;idno=putn0007-2;didno=putn0007-2;view=image;seq=0214;node=putn0007-2%3A16 A Word for Men's Rights]"&lt;/ref&gt; Three loosely connected men's rights organizations formed in [[Austria]] in the [[interwar period]]. The ''League for Men's Rights'' was founded in 1926 with the goal of "combatting all excesses of women's emancipation".&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Der 'Bund für Männerrechte'.

They criticized the marriage and family law, especially the requirement to pay spousal and child support to former wives and [[Legitimacy (law)|illegitimate]] children, and supported the use of blood tests to determine paternity.&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter/&gt;&lt;ref name=uofvienna/&gt; ''Justitia'' and ''Aequitas'' issued their own short-lived journals ''Men's Rightists' Newspaper'' and ''Self-Defense'' where they expressed their views which were heavily influenced by the works of [[Heinrich Schurtz]], [[Otto Weininger]], and [[Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels]]. The organizations ceased to exist before 1939.&lt;ref name=geschichtsblaetter/&gt;&lt;ref name=uofvienna/&gt;

===Movement===
The modern men's rights movement emerged from the [[men's liberation]] movement which appeared in the first half of the 1970s when some thinkers began to study feminist ideas and politics.&lt;ref name="Messner 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Messner |first= Michael A. |authorlink= Michael Messner |year= 1998 |title= The Limits of the "Male Sex Role": An Analysis of the Men's Liberation and Men's Rights Movement's Discourse |journal= [[Gender &amp; Society]] |volume= 12 |issue= 3 |pages= 255&amp;ndash;276 |publisher= |doi= 10.1177/0891243298012003002 |pmid= |pmc= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2004|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=bXZkmNTSQUAC&amp;pg=PA190 190&amp;ndash;200]}} The men's liberation movement acknowledged men's institutional power while critically examining the costs of traditional masculinity.&lt;ref name="Messner 1"/&gt; In the late 1970s, the men's liberation movement split into two separate strands with opposing views: the [[Pro-feminism|pro-feminist men's movement]] and the [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] men's rights movement.&lt;ref name="Messner 1"/&gt; Men's rights activists have rejected feminist principles and focused on areas in which they believe men are disadvantaged or oppressed.&lt;ref name="Messner 1"/&gt;{{sfn|Newton|2004|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=bXZkmNTSQUAC&amp;pg=PA190 190-200]}} In the 1980s and 90s, men's rights activists opposed societal changes sought by feminists and defended the traditional gender order in the family, schools and the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lingard |first1= Bob |last2= Mills |first2= Martin |last3= Weaver-Hightower |first3= Marcus B| year= 2012 |title= Interrogating recuperative masculinity politics in schooling |journal= International Journal of Inclusive Education |volume= 16 |issue= 4 |pages= 407&amp;ndash;421 |publisher= |doi= 10.1080/13603116.2011.555095 |url= |accessdate= |quote= The concept of recuperative masculinity politics was developed by Lingard and Douglas (1999) to refer to both mythopoetic (Biddulph 1995, 2010; Bly 1990) and men’s rights politics (Farrell 1993). Both of these rejected the move to a more equal gender order and more equal gender regimes in all of the major institutions of society (e.g. the family, schools, universities, workplaces) sought by feminists and most evident in the political and policy impacts in the 1980s and 1990s from second-wave feminism of the 1970s. 'Recuperative' was used to specifically indicate the ways in which these politics reinforced, defended and wished to recoup the patriarchal gender order and institutional gender regimes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first major men's rights organizations was the Coalition of American Divorce Reform Elements, founded by [[Richard Doyle (rights advocate)|Richard Doyle]] in 1971, from which the Men's Rights Association spun off in 1973.{{sfn|Newton|2004|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=bXZkmNTSQUAC&amp;pg=PA190 190-200]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lee |first1= Calinda N. |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Bret E. |editor1-last= Carroll |editor1-link= |others= |title= American Masculinities: A Historical Encyclopedia |url= |volume= One |year= 2003 |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn= 978-0-7619-2540-8 |page= 167 |chapter= Fathers' Rights |chapterurl= http://books.google.com/books?id=E0R9lLtv8i8C&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free Men Inc. was founded in 1977 in [[Columbia, Maryland]], spawning several chapters over the following years, which eventually merged to form the National Coalition of Free Men{{sfn|Ashe|2007|p = [http://books.google.com/books?id=nXDbiPA9IuQC&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 63]}} (now known as the [[National Coalition for Men]]).

Critics argue that empirical research does not support the notion of judicial bias against men&lt;ref name=melvillehunter/&gt; and that men's rights advocates interpret statistics in a way that ignores the fact that the majority of men do not contest custody and do not seem to want it.&lt;ref name=crean/&gt; Academics critique the rhetorical [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] of custody decisions, stating that men's rights advocates appeal for "equal rights" without specifying the constitutional rights that they believe have been violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Williams |first1= Gwyneth I. |last2= Williams |first2= Rhys H. |editor1-first= Donileen R. |editor1-last= Loseke |editor2-first= Joel |editor2-last= Best |title= Social problems: constructionist readings |year= 2003 |location= New York |publisher= de Gruyter |chapterurl= http://books.google.com/books?id=ee0MiJ0Mw_8C&amp;pg=PA96 |chapter= Framing in the fathers' rights movement |page= 96 |isbn= 978-0-202-30703-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics assert that the men's rights rhetoric of children's "needs" that accompanies their plea for equal rights helps deflect criticism that it is motivated by self-interest and masks men's rights advocates' own claims.&lt;ref name="RH Williams"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Ryrstedt |first= Eva |year= 2003 |title= Joint decisions – a prerequisite or a drawback in joint parental responsibility? |journal= Australian Journal of Family Law |volume= 17 |issue= 2 |pages= 155&amp;ndash;206 |quote= Research has highlighted that it is usually disaffected fathers and men's rights groups, who have masked their own claims behind the rhetoric of the rights of the child to know and be cared for by both parents.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deborah Rhode]] argues that contrary to the claims of some men's rights activists, research shows that joint legal custody does not increase the likelihood that fathers will pay child support or remain involved parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Rhode |first= DL |title= Speaking of sex: the denial of gender inequality |year= 1997 |location= Cambridge, Mass. |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |page= 194 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=ilR5D4vnuv4C&amp;pg=PA194 |isbn= 978-0-674-83177-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce===
Men's rights groups in the United States began organizing in opposition of divorce reform and custody issues around the 1960s. The men involved in the early organization claimed that family and divorce law discriminated against them and favored their wives.{{sfn|Ashe|2007|p = [http://books.google.com/books?id=nXDbiPA9IuQC&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 57]}} [[Richard Doyle (rights advocate)|Richard Doyle]] wrote of the view of the men's rights movement concerning the court handling of divorces and child custody processes: &lt;blockquote&gt;Divorce courts are frequently like slaughter-houses, with about as much compassion and talent. They function as collection agencies for lawyer fees, however outrageous, stealing children and extorting money from men in ways blatantly unconstitutional... Men are regarded as mere guests in their own homes, evictable any time at the whims of wives and judges. Men are driven from home and children against their wills; then when unable to stretch paychecks far enough to support two households are termed "runaway fathers." Contrary to all principles of justice, men are thrown into prison for inability to pay alimony and support, however unreasonable or unfair the "obligation."{{sfn |Messner | 1997 |p = [http://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 41&amp;ndash;48] }}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Men's rights activists have argued that divorce and custody laws violate men's individual rights to equal protection. Legal scholar Gwendolyn Leachman writes that this sort of framing "downplays the systemic biases that women face that justify protective divorce and custody laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Leachman |first= G |title= Legal Framing |year= 2013 |journal= Studies in Law, Politics, and Society |volume= 61 |issue= |pages= 25&amp;ndash;59 |doi= 10.1108/S1059-4337(2013)0000061005 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=ZNunVhZjK0cC&amp;pg=PA25 |accessdate= November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Men's rights activists describe the education of boys as being in crisis, with boys having reduced educational achievement and motivation as compared to girls.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; Advocates blame the influence of feminism on education for discrimination against and systematic oppression of boys in the education system.&lt;ref name="MartinoKehler2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mills, Martin|author2=Francis, Becky|author3=Skelton, Christine|editor=Wayne Martino, Michael Kehler, and Marcus B.

Men's rights groups call for increased recognition of masculinity, greater numbers of male role models, more competitive sports, and the increased responsibilities for boys in the school setting. They have also advocated clearer school routines, more traditional school structures, including single-sex classes, and stricter discipline.&lt;ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"/&gt;

Critics suggest that men's rights groups view boys as a homogeneous group sharing common experiences of schooling and that they do not take sufficient account in their analysis of how responses to educational approaches may differ by age, culture, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, and class.&lt;ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"/&gt;

In Australia, men's rights discourse has influenced government policy documents; less impact has been noted in the United Kingdom, where feminists have historically had less influence on educational policy.&lt;ref name="MartinoKehler2009"/&gt;

Some have critiqued these claims,&lt;ref name="Flood2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HaywoodGhaill2003"/&gt;{{sfn|Messner|1997|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 6-7]}} stating, as [[Michael Messner]] puts it, that the poorer health outcomes are the heavy costs paid by men "for conformity with the narrow definitions of masculinity that promise to bring them status and privilege"{{sfn|Messner|1997|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 6-7]}} and that these costs fall disproportionately on men who are marginalized socially and economically.{{sfn|Messner|1997|p = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 6-7]}} In this view, and according to [[Michael Flood]], men's health would best be improved by "tackling destructive notions of manhood, an economic system which values profit and productivity over workers’ health, and the ignorance of service providers" instead of blaming a feminist health movement.&lt;ref name="Flood2004"/&gt;

===Marriage strike===
Men's rights activists note American statistics showing that fewer couples are marrying,&lt;ref name="SacksThompson"/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; and that fewer men see marriage as an important life goal.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; They assert that men are consciously or unconsciously opting out of marriage and engaging in a "marriage strike" as a result of the lack of benefits in marriage and the emotional and financial consequences of divorce, including alimony and child custody and support.&lt;ref name="SacksThompson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifeminists.com/introduction/editorials/2002/0709a.html|title=Have Anti-Father Family Court Policies Led to a Men's Marriage Strike?|author=Glenn Sacks|authorlink=Glenn Sacks|coauthors=Dianna Thompson|date=2002-07-09|publisher=ifeminists.com|accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Smith|title=Men on Strike: Why Men Are Boycotting Marriage, Fatherhood, and the American Dream-And Why It Matters|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9m6kMQEACAAJ|chapter=The Marriage Strike: why men don't marry|date=4 June 2013|publisher=ENCOUNTER BOOKS|isbn=978-1-59403-675-0|pages=1–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McElroy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,94415,00.html|title=The Marriage Strike|author=Wendy McElroy|authorlink=Wendy McElroy|date=2003-08-12|publisher=Fox News - Opinion|accessdate=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20040407112100/http://www.lonefathers.com.au/augnov02/page24.html |title=MEN'S 'MARRIAGE STRIKE' SET TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY UNTIL FAMILY LAW IS REFORMED.|author=Joint Parenting Association|work=web.archive.org |date=8 August 2002 |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military conscription===
Men's rights activists have argued that military [[conscription]] of men is an example of discrimination against men.{{sfn |Messner | 1997 |p = [http://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 41-48] }}&lt;ref name="BoydLongwood1996"/&gt;

In 1971, draft resisters in the United States initiated a class-action suit alleging that male-only conscription violated men's rights to equal protection under the US constitution.&lt;ref name="Binkin1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tb/&gt; When the case, ''[[Rostker v. Goldberg]]'', reached the Supreme Court in 1981, they were supported by a men's rights group and multiple women's groups, including the [[National Organization for Women]].&lt;ref name=tb&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UDFPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nwIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6777,7767318&amp;dq=men%27s-rights+conscription&amp;hl=en |title=Supreme Court to begin hearing male-only military draft case |first= Richard |last= Carelli|work=Toledo Blade|date= March 23, 1981|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Supreme Court upheld the Military Selective Service Act, stating that "the argument for registering women was based on considerations of equity, but Congress was entitled, in the exercise of its constitutional powers, to focus on the question of military need, rather than equity.&lt;ref name="Binkin1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Binkin|title=Who will fight the next war?: the changing face of the American military|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AOHD6sbzNysC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=12 November 2011|year=1993|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=978-0-8157-0955-8|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0453_0057_ZS.html Rostker v. Goldberg]'' at Cornell University Law School.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parental abduction===
Men's rights activists state that children of men of Indian descent have indicated that international child abduction has taken place in Canada, the United States and Europe into India where the national courts do not recognize foreign child custody orders. The country is not a party to the [[Child Abduction Convention|Hague Convention]] and men accused of dowry harassment may be arrested at Indian airports.&lt;ref name="Kumar"/&gt;

===Paternity fraud===
{{Main|Misattributed paternity|paternity fraud}}
Men's and fathers' rights groups have stated that there are high levels of misattributed paternity or "paternity fraud", where men are parenting and/or supporting financially children who are not biologically their own.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt; They hold biological views of fatherhood, emphasizing the imperative of the genetic foundation of paternity rather than social aspects of fatherhood.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt;&lt;ref name="RothsteinMurray2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Majumber, Mary Anderlik |editor=Mark A.

In addition, non-biological fathers are denied the resources to have their own biological children in another relationship.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt; Men's rights activists support the use of [[paternity testing]] to reassure presumed fathers about the child's paternity;&lt;ref name=salah/&gt; men's and fathers' rights groups have called for compulsory paternity testing of all children.&lt;ref name=cannold/&gt;&lt;ref name=shepherd&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.news.com.au/technology/men-flock-online-for-peace-of-mind-paternity-tests/story-e6frfro0-1226385528162 |title=Men flock online for 'peace of mind' paternity tests |first= Tory |last= Shepherd|work=news.com.au |date= 6 June 2012|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who's your daddy?|newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News|date=5 October 2005|quote="I think the best solution is DNA testing at birth," said Glenn Sacks, a syndicated radio talk-show host who focuses on men's issues}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have campaigned vigorously in support of men who have been shown by genetic testing not to be the biological father, but who are nevertheless required to be financially responsible for them.&lt;ref name="RothsteinMurray2005"/&gt; Prompted by these concerns, legislators in certain jurisdictions have supported this biological view and have passed laws providing relief from child support payments when a man is proved not to be the father.&lt;ref name=cannold&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannold|first=Leslie|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|title= Who's the father?

===Prison===
Men's rights activists point to differential prison terms for men and women as evidence of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Williams2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhys H. Williams|title=Promise Keepers and the New Masculinity: Private Lives and Public Morality|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CsHmN5K29iAC&amp;pg=PA107|accessdate=10 June 2013|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-0231-2|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Menzies|2007|p= [http://books.google.com/books?id=ASc568aunFoC&amp;pg=PA73 73]}}&lt;ref name="FarrellSterba200849-56"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Warren Farrell|author2=James P.

He critiques society's belief in women as more innocent and credible, as well as [[Battered woman defense|battered woman]] and [[infanticide]] defenses.&lt;ref name="FarrellSterba200849-56"/&gt; He criticizes conditions in men's prisons and the lack of attention to [[Prison rape in the United States|prison male-to-male rape]] by authorities.&lt;ref name="FarrellSterba200849-56"/&gt;

===Reproductive rights===
In 2006, the American [[National Center for Men]] backed a lawsuit known as ''[[Dubay v. Wells]]''. The case concerned whether men should have the opportunity to decline all paternity rights and responsibilities in the event of an unplanned pregnancy. Supporters said that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Traister | first = R | date = 2006-03-13 | url = http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/03/13/roe_for_men/ | title = Roe for men? | publisher = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | accessdate = 2007-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case and the appeal were dismissed, the U.S. Court of Appeals (Sixth Circuit) stating that neither parent has the right to sever their financial responsibilities for a child, and that "Dubay's claim that a man's right to disclaim fatherhood would be analogous to a woman’s right to abortion rests upon a false analogy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0442p-06.pdf |format=PDF|title=U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, case No. 06-11016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valenti2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jessica Valenti|title=Why Have Kids?: A New Mom Explores the Truth About Parenting and Happiness|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OXnxd2le7XYC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=11 May 2013|year=2012|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-89261-0|pages=103–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elle.com/life-love/society-career/the-parent-trap-paternal-rights-abortion-445117 |title=Paternal Rights and Abortion |first= Stephanie |last=Fairyington|date= 17 May 2010 |work=ELLE[last update] |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social security and insurance===
Men's rights groups argue that women are given superior social security and tax benefits than men.{{sfn|Flood|2007| p = [http://books.google.com/books?id=jh7y6ELc90YC&amp;pg=PA430#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 430-433]}}&lt;ref name="Honderich2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferrell Christensen|editor=Ted Honderich|title=The Oxford companion to philosophy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F9oAomj2IIwC&amp;pg=PA563|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=26 May 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-926479-7|pages=562–63|chapter=Masculism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren Farrell states that men in the United States pay more into social security, but in total women receive more in benefits, and that discrimination against men in insurance and pensions have gone unrecognized.{{sfn|Farrell|1994|p=350}}
