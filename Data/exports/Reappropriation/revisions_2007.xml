For example, since the early 1970s, much terminology referring to [[homosexuality]]—such as ''[[gay]]'', ''[[queer]]'' and (to a lesser extent) ''[[faggot (epithet)|faggot]]''—has been reappropriated. Another example of reappropriation would be an [[African American]] collecting [[lawn jockey]]s or other artifacts of [[Blackface#Blackface and darky iconography|darky iconography]]. The term ''reappropriation'' can also extend to  counter-[[hegemony|hegemonic]] re-purposing, such as [[citizenship|citizens]] with no formal [[authority#Sociology and philosophy|authority]] seizing unused [[public land|public]] or [[private property|private]] land for community use.

The term ''reappropriation'' is an extension of the term ''appropriation'' or ''[[cultural appropriation]]'' used in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and  [[cultural studies]] to describe the hegemonic action of reabsorbing [[subculture|subcultural]] styles and forms, or those from other cultures, into mass culture through a process of commodification: the mass-marketing of alternate lifestyles, practices, and artifacts. 

==Linguistic reappropriation==
There are many recent English-language examples of linguistic reappropriation in the areas of [[human sexuality]], [[gender role]]s, [[sexual orientation]], etc. Among these are:

* ''[[bitch]]''
* ''[[Butch and femme|butch]]'', in a [[Lesbian]] context
* ''[[cunt]]''. The earliest citable example of reappropriation of this word is remarkably early: the Wife of Bath in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]: "For certeyn, olde dotard, by youre leve, / Ye shul have queynte right y-nough at eve" (''queynte'' being a [[Middle English]] spelling of ''cunt'').
* ''[[dyke (lesbian)|dyke]]'', and such variants as ''bulldyke'', ''diesel dyke'', ''baby dyke'', or ''femme dyke''
* ''[[faggot (slang)|faggot]]'' or ''fag''
* ''[[queer]]''
* ''[[slut]]'' and, to a lesser extent, ''[[slag (slang)|slag]]''

In some cases, this reappropriation is so successful as to turn a previously disparaging word into the preferred term: for example, ''[[gay]]'', previously an insult, is now strongly preferred to ''[[homosexual]]'', both as an adjective and a noun.

To a lesser extent, and more controversially among the groups referred to, the same has happened with many racial and ethnic terms:

* ''[[heeb]]'' and (to a lesser extent) ''[[kike]]'' as terms for [[Jew]]s
* ''[[nigger]]'' as a term for [[African American]]s
* ''[[redneck]]'' as a term for rural people (and, to some extent, others) from the [[Southern United States]] 
* ''[[Flip (slang)|flip]]'' as a term used by [[Filipino American]]s

Artist [[Kara Walker]] has attempted to reappropriate the word [[Negro|Negress]].

Similarly, physically [[handicapped]] people have reappropriated ''crip'', ''cripple'' and ''gimp''.

==Recontextualization of material objects==
A closely related phenomenon is the recontextualization of material objects, as for example when the [[racism|anti-racist]] [[Jim Crow Museum]] [http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/] at [[Ferris State University]] displays such [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] Era artifacts as [[golliwog]] marbles or [[Sambo]] masks. Another such example would be the display of an [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] poster in a [[Holocaust]] museum.

==Reappropriation of land, etc.==
While the previous examples are largely symbolic, another type of reappropriation is far more material, while still also involving an important symbolic dimension. The many battles over [[People's Park, Berkeley|People's Park]] in [[Berkeley, California]] have centered on community activists' intent to reappropriate as public space a piece of land that the [[University of California, Berkeley]] originally wanted to turn into a parking lot. The space has been a site of contention since 1969.
