In [[sociology]] and  [[cultural studies]], '''reappropriation''' or '''reclamation''' is the [[culture|cultural]] process by which a group reclaims terms or artifacts that were previously used in a way disparaging of that group.&lt;ref name="Slurs"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.langsci.2010.11.005 | last1 = Croom | first1 = A.M. | year = 2011 | title = Slurs | url = | journal = Language Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 343–358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The term ''reappropriation'' is an extension of the term ''appropriation'' or ''[[cultural appropriation]]'' used in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and  [[cultural studies]] to describe the reabsorbing of [[subculture|subcultural]] styles and forms, or those from other cultures, into mass culture through a process of commodification: the mass-marketing of alternate lifestyles, practices, and artifacts.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

{{Anchor|Linguistic reappropriation or reclaiming}} &lt;!-- old name; please keep to avoid breaking old in-links --&gt;

A '''reclaimed''' or '''reappropriated''' word is a word that was at one time [[pejorative]] but has been brought back into acceptable usage—usually starting within the communities that experienced [[oppression]] under that word, but sometimes also among the general populace as well.&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt; (The term "reclaimed word" more often implies usage by a member of the group referred to.)

This can have wider implications in the fields of [[discourse]], and has been described in terms of personal or sociopolitical empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Godrej|first=Farah|title=Spaces for Counter-Narratives: The Phenomenology of Reclamation|url=http://mpsa.indiana.edu/conf2003papers/1032831537.pdf|work=Paper prepared for the Midwest Political Science Association Meeting|publisher=University of Indiana|accessdate=July 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025220344/http://mpsa.indiana.edu/conf2003papers/1032831537.pdf|archivedate=2005-10-25|format=PDF|date=April 3, 2003}} Citing Patricia Hill Collins, ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment''  (New York: Routledge, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaiming or reappropriating a word involves re-evaluating a term that in the dominant culture is, or at one time was, used by a majority to oppress various [[minority group|minorities]] of that same culture{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}, such as "[[queer]]", once seen as pejorative but now reclaimed and used as a self-reference by some.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Reclaimed words differ from general reclamation outside of language because of their deliberately provocative nature. In addition to neutral or acceptable connotations, reclaimed words often acquire positive meaning within the circles of the informed.&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt; Outside the community, such transitions are rare.  As such, the use of these terms by outside parties is usually viewed as strongly derogatory. For some terms, even "reclaimed" usage by members of the community concerned is a subject of controversy—for example, there is considerable debate within the transgender community over attempts to reclaim the term "tranny", usually applied offensively to [[trans women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Tranny" and Subversivism: Re-reclaiming "Tranny" (or not) part 1 |url=http://takesupspace.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/tranny-and-subversivism-re-reclaiming-tranny-or-not-part-1/ |last=Cedar |date=November 10, 2008 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Tranny" and Subversivism: Re-reclaiming "Tranny" (or not) part 2 |url=http://takesupspace.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/tranny-cis-women-re-reclaiming-tranny-or-not-part-2/ |last=Cedar |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tranny |publisher=Queer Today |url=http://queertoday.com/profiles/blogs/tranny-1 |first=Mark Daniel |last=Snyder |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault]] discusses the idea of reclaimed words as a "reverse discourse" in his ''[[History of Sexuality]]: Volume I.'' The New York performance artist [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]] sold what turned out to be her most popular show on the basis of the title,{{OR|reason=who says it was the most popular because of the title?|date=November 2015}} ''Bitch! Dyke! Faghag! Whore!'', words she was reclaiming.{{OR|reason=Says who? Just because she used slurs doesn't automatically mean they are being 'reclaimed'|date=November 2015}}

== Examples ==
{{Anchor|Words that could be considered reclaimed}} &lt;!-- old name, please keep to avoid breaking in-links --&gt;

===Sex and sexuality===
There are many recent English-language examples of some linguistic reappropriation in the areas of [[human sexuality]], [[gender role]]s, [[sexual orientation]], etc. Among these are:

*"[[Dyke (lesbian)|Dyke]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=press_pr_dykesonbikes_071405 |title=Trademark Office says no to Dykes on Bikes|publisher=National Center for Lesbian Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* variants such as "bulldyke", "diesel dyke", "baby dyke", "femme dyke", etc., "[[Butch and femme|butch]]" {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
*"[[poof]]", "[[queer]]", "[[homosexuality|homo]]"{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Politics===
However, the phenomenon is much older, especially in politics and religion.

In England, for example, [[Cavalier]] was a derogatory nickname reappropriated as self-identification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|no-prescript=1 |author=Anonymous |wstitle=Cavalier |volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Roundhead]], a Royalists derisory term for the supporters of the Parliamentary cause, is not (it was a punishable offence in the [[New Model Army]] to call a fellow soldier a roundhead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Worden |first=Blair |year=2009 |title=The English Civil Wars 1640–1660|location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |page=2 |isbn=0-14-100694-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tory]] (orig. from Middle Irish word for "pursued man" ''[[Tóraidhe]]'' ), [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] (from "whiggamore" (See the [[Whiggamore Raid]])) and "[[Suffragette]]" are other British examples.

In the American colonies, British officers used [[Yankee]], from a term used by the British to refer to Dutch pirates, as a derogatory term against colonists. British soldiers created the early versions of the song "[[Yankee Doodle]]," as a criticism of the uncultured colonists, but during the Revolution, as the colonists began to reappropriate the label "yankee" as a point of pride, they likewise reappropriated the song, altering verses, and turning it into a patriotic anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/11/05/dude_etymology_of_the_word_is_traced_to_doodle_as_in_yankee_doodle_dandy.html|title = Mystery Solved: The Etymology of Dude|date = 5 Nov 2013|accessdate = 10 Aug 2015|website = Slate|publisher = The Slate Group,|last = Okrent|first = Arika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language]]s actually have a separate word for such a term, "[[:nl:Geuzennaam|geuzennaam]]" (Dutch, commonly used) and "[[:de:Geusenwort|Geusenwort]]" (German, used among linguists). These words derive from the [[geuzen]], i.e., Dutch opponents to [[Spanish Netherlands|Spanish rule]] in the 16th century, who eventually created the [[Netherlands]] under [[William the Silent|William of Orange]]. Being derisively called "beggars" ("gueux" in French of the era) by their opponents, they appropriated a Dutchified form of the word as their own "battle name". In [[French language|French]] during the [[French Revolution]] the word "[[Sans-culottes]]" (literally "without [[knee-breeches]]") gained a similar meaning.

More recent political examples include:

*"[[Environmentalism|Tree hugger]]" by [[environmentalism|environmentalists]]
* [[Liberal Conspiracy]], a term sometimes used by conservatives to describe purported liberal domination of modern life, adopted as the moniker of [[Sunny Hundal|Sunny Hundal']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s political blog.
*"[[Vast Right Wing Conspiracy]]" originally used as a pejorative term by [[Hillary Clinton]], but now routinely used as a positive self-identity by [[Rush Limbaugh]] and other conservatives
*"[[Redneck (stereotype)|Redneck]]" by political movements from the [[American South]], especially conservative movements.
*"[[Obamacare]]" Originally a conservative term for the [[Affordable Care Act]], the left embraced the term and it is now considered the act's shorthand name.

===Religion===

One of the older examples of successful reclaiming is the term "Jesuit" to refer to members of the [[Society of Jesus]]. This was originally a derogatory term referring to people who too readily invoked the name of [[Jesus]] in their politics,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} but which members of the Society adopted over time for themselves, so that the word came to refer exclusively to them, and generally in a positive or neutral sense,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} even though the term "Jesuitical" is derived from the Society of Jesus and is used to mean things like: manipulative, conspiring, treacherous, capable of intellectually justifying anything by convoluted reasoning.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Another example can be found in the origins of [[Methodism]]; early members were originally mocked for their "methodical" and rule-driven religious devotion, founder [[John Wesley]] embraced the term for his movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Atkins |first=Marilyn |url=http://www.methodist.org.uk/static/deepeningdiscipleship/discipleshipandmethodistsmatkins.pdf |title=Discipleship... and the people called Methodists |publisher= The Methodist Church in Britain  |quote=...to be a ‘Methodist’ was originally a term of ridicule because of the zeal and rigour with which they pursued a life of holiness and sought to be the best disciples of 
Christ they could.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and ethnicity===
To a lesser extent, and more controversially among the groups referred to, many racial, ethnic, and class terms have been reappropriated:

*"[[Nigga]]" by [[African Americans]]&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, the band [[N.W.A.]], or the titles of several of [[Richard Pryor]]'s recordings. Or listen to a wide range of 90's-2000's [[hip hop music]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[List of ethnic slurs|Paddy]]" by [[Irish Americans]]&lt;ref&gt;For 18th century example of effort at such reappropriation in Ireland, see [http://books.google.ie/books?id=qZ6W1LiIyYYC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22He+was+a+paddy+and+no+more%3B+he+desired+no+other+title+than+this.%E2%80%9D&amp;output=html_text&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1 this example here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability===
* "Aspie" by people with [[Asperger syndrome]], an affectionate non-medical term believed to be coined by [[Liane Holliday Willey]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=Baglieri&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkaC2eYg-eUC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=aspie+reappropriation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R0zgP9ER_W&amp;sig=ka99emcWlAXOtlL_ArQLd5A-Dpk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l-GcUor2Ca7lsASo4oKgBA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=aspie%20reappropriation&amp;f=false |title=Disability Studies and the Inclusive Classroom: Critical Practices for Creating the Least Restrictive Attitudes p 48-50 By Susan Baglieri and Arthur Shapiro |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AspiesAuties&gt;[http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/aspies-and-auties/?_r=0 Aspies and Auties New York Times October 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* "Autie" or "autist" by [[autism spectrum|autistic]] people.&lt;ref name=AspiesAuties/&gt;
* "cripple", "crip", "gimp" by people with disabilities.&lt;ref name= Baglieri/&gt;

===Other examples===

More generally, any kind of community can reappropriate words referring to them:
* "[[Fat]]" by the [[Fat acceptance movement|size-acceptance movement]]
* "[[Smoggie]]", used for people from the north east England town of [[Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref name="Sarah McKeown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/smoggy |title=Ich bin ein Smoggy: reclaiming regional pride |first=Sarah |last=McKeown |publisher=Macmillan Dictionary Blog |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichola Ridley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2296819/Frustrated-Teesside-mother-pens-Smoggie-dictionary-help-friends-family-understand-her.html |title=Janoaworramean?

*"[[Impressionists]]" In 1874 during their first independent art show, critic [[Louis Leroy]] penned a hostile review of the show in ''[[Le Charivari]]'' newspaper under the title "The Exhibition of the Impression-ists". In particular he used the painting ''[[Impression, Sunrise|Impression, soleil levant]]'' by [[Claude Monet]] to ridicule the painters for their lack of seriousness preferring to paint "fleeting impressions of the moment" rather than allegorical or ultra-realist themes.
*"[[Fauvists]]" at their first group exposition at the ''Salon d'automne'' of 1905, the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]], shocked by the wild colors and bold brushstrokes of their paintings disparaged the artists as a band of "fauves" (wild beasts)
* "[[Decadent movement|Decadent]]" by a late generation of [[Romanticism (art)|Romantics]], such as [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]], who used the word proudly, to represent their rejection of what they considered banal "progress"

==Recontextualization of material objects==
A closely related phenomenon is the recontextualization of material objects.

An example is the use of the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] by African Americans.{{Dubious |Recontextualization of material objects slashed |reason=that would indeed be a reappropriation if true, but it isn't happening |date=November 2015}}.  Another example of reappropriation would be an [[African American]] collecting [[lawn jockey]]s or other artifacts of [[darky iconography]].{{Dubious |Recontextualization of material objects slashed |reason=that *would be* a reappropriation if true, but it's unsourced, original research |date=November 2015}}
