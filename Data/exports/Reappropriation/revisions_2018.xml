In [[sociology]] and  [[cultural studies]], '''reappropriation''' or '''reclamation''' is the [[culture|cultural]] process by which a group reclaims terms or artifacts that were previously used in a way disparaging of that group.&lt;ref name="Slurs"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.langsci.2010.11.005 | last1 = Croom | first1 = A.M. | year = 2011 | title = Slurs | url = | journal = Language Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages =343–358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

The term ''reappropriation'' is an extension of the term ''appropriation'' or ''[[cultural appropriation]]'' used in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and  [[cultural studies]] to describe the reabsorbing of [[subculture|subcultural]] styles and forms, or those from other cultures, into mass culture through a process of commodification: the mass-marketing of alternate lifestyles, practices, and artifacts.{{citation needed |date=November 2015}}

== Definition ==
{{Anchor|Linguistic reappropriation or reclaiming}} &lt;!-- old name; please keep to avoid breaking old in-links --&gt;

A ''reclaimed'' or ''reappropriated'' word is a word that was at one time [[pejorative]] but has been brought back into acceptable usage, usually starting within the communities that experienced [[oppression]] under that word but sometimes also among the general populace as well.&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt;{{verification failed|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--the source doesn't discuss terms reclaimed or reappropriated at all!!--&gt; (The term "reclaimed word" more often implies usage by a member of the group that is referred.)

That can have wider implications in the fields of [[discourse]] and has been described in terms of personal or sociopolitical empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Godrej|first=Farah|title=Spaces for Counter-Narratives: The Phenomenology of Reclamation|url=http://mpsa.indiana.edu/conf2003papers/1032831537.pdf|work=Paper prepared for the Midwest Political Science Association Meeting|publisher=University of Indiana|accessdate=July 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025220344/http://mpsa.indiana.edu/conf2003papers/1032831537.pdf|archivedate=2005-10-25|format=PDF|date=April 3, 2003}} Citing Patricia Hill Collins, ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment''  (New York: Routledge, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaiming or reappropriating a word involves re-evaluating a term that is or was, in the dominant culture, used to by a majority to oppress various [[minority group|minorities]] of the same culture,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} such as "[[queer]]", once seen as pejorative but now reclaimed and used as a self-reference by some.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2014 |title=queer |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.qrd.org/qrd/misc/text/queers.read.this|title=Queers Read This |author=Queer Nation |date=June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaimed words differ from general reclamation outside of language because of their deliberately provocative nature. In addition to neutral or acceptable connotations, reclaimed words often acquire positive meaning within the circles of the informed.&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt; Outside the community, such transitions are rare. As such, the use of these terms by outside parties is usually viewed as strongly derogatory. For some terms, even "reclaimed" usage by members of the community concerned is a subject of controversy; for example, there is considerable debate within the transgender community over attempts to reclaim the term "tranny", usually applied offensively to [[trans women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Tranny" and Subversivism: Re-reclaiming "Tranny" (or not) part 1 |url=http://takesupspace.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/tranny-and-subversivism-re-reclaiming-tranny-or-not-part-1/ |last=Cedar |date=November 10, 2008 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Tranny" and Subversivism: Re-reclaiming "Tranny" (or not) part 2 |url=http://takesupspace.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/tranny-cis-women-re-reclaiming-tranny-or-not-part-2/ |last=Cedar |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tranny |publisher=Queer Today |url=http://queertoday.com/profiles/blogs/tranny-1 |first=Mark Daniel |last=Snyder |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715135223/http://queertoday.com/profiles/blogs/tranny-1 |archivedate=July 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Sex and sexuality===
There are many recent English-language examples of some linguistic reappropriation in the areas of [[human sexuality]], [[gender role]]s, [[sexual orientation]], etc. Among these are:

* ''[[Dyke (lesbian)|Dyke]]''{{thin space}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=press_pr_dykesonbikes_071405|title=Trademark Office says no to Dykes on Bikes|publisher=National Center for Lesbian Rights|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718090612/http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=press_pr_dykesonbikes_071405|archivedate=2011-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{Refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
However, the phenomenon is much older, especially in politics and religion.

In England, for example, [[Cavalier]] was a derogatory nickname reappropriated as self-identification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|short=1 |author=Anonymous |wstitle=Cavalier |volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Roundhead]], a Royalists derisory term for the supporters of the Parliamentary cause, is not (it was a punishable offence in the [[New Model Army]] to call a fellow soldier a roundhead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Worden |first=Blair |year=2009 |title=The English Civil Wars 1640–1660|location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |page=2 |isbn=0-14-100694-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Tory]]'' (orig. from Middle Irish word for "pursued man" ''[[Tóraidhe]]'' ), ''[[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]'' (from "whiggamore" (See the [[Whiggamore Raid]])) and ''[[Suffragette]]'' are other British examples.

In the American colonies, British officers used [[Yankee]], from a term used by the British to refer to Dutch pirates, as a derogatory term against colonists. British soldiers created the early versions of the song ''[[Yankee Doodle]]'', as a criticism of the uncultured colonists, but during the Revolution, as the colonists began to reappropriate the label ''yankee'' as a point of pride, they likewise reappropriated the song, altering verses, and turning it into a patriotic anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2013/11/05/dude_etymology_of_the_word_is_traced_to_doodle_as_in_yankee_doodle_dandy.html|title = Mystery Solved: The Etymology of Dude|date = 5 Nov 2013|accessdate = 10 Aug 2015|website = Slate|publisher = The Slate Group,|last = Okrent|first = Arika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1850s in the United States, a secretive political party was derisively dubbed the [[Know Nothing]] party, based on their penchant for saying "I know nothing" when asked for details by outsiders; this became the common name for the party. It eventually became a popular name, sufficiently so that consumer products like tea, candy, and even a freighter were branded with the name.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Gienapp. "Salmon P. Chase, Nativism, and the Formation of the Republican Party in Ohio", pp. 22, 24. ''Ohio History'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
One of the older examples of successful reclaiming is the term ''Jesuit'' to refer to members of the [[Society of Jesus]]. This was originally a derogatory term referring to people who too readily invoked the name of [[Jesus]] in their politics,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} but which members of the Society adopted over time for themselves, so that the word came to refer exclusively to them, and generally in a positive or neutral sense,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pollen |first=John Hungerford |author-link=John Hungerford Pollen (Jesuit) |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=The Society of Jesus |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_%281913%29/Society_of_Jesus |access-date=30 November 2016 |year=1913 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |volume=14 |location=New York, NY |isbn= |oclc= |pages= }}&lt;!--{{cite wikisource |class= |last1=Pollen |first1=John Hungerford |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= |trans_title= |plaintitle= |wslink= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1913 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |location=New York, NY |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages= |at= |wspage= |chapter= |plainchapter= |quote= }}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; even though the term "Jesuitical" is derived from the Society of Jesus and is used to mean things like: manipulative, conspiring, treacherous, capable of intellectually justifying anything by convoluted reasoning.&lt;ref name="Peschier2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peschier|first=D.|title=Nineteenth-Century Anti-Catholic Discourses: The Case of Charlotte Brontë|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iV2CDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;vq=Jesuitical&amp;dq=Jesuitical&amp;pg=PA49#q=Jesuitical|date=21 June 2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-230-50502-5|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevenson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevenson|first=Angus|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA940&amp;dq=Jesuitical&amp;pg=PA940#q=Jesuitical|date=19 August 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|page=940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aikio"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aikio|first1=Annukka|last2=Vornanen|first2=Rauni|title=Uusi sivistyssanakirja|date=1982|publisher=Otava|ref=Aikio|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="March1906"&gt;{{cite book|last=March|first=Francis Andrew|title=A Thesaurus Dictionary of the English Language Designed to Suggest Immediately Any Desired Word Needed to Express Exactly a Given Idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7QUxAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Jesuitical%22&amp;pg=PA1089#q=%22Jesuitical%22|year=1906|publisher=Historical Publishing Company|location=Philadelphia, PA|page=1089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example can be found in the origins of [[Methodism]]; early members were originally mocked for their "methodical" and rule-driven religious devotion, founder [[John Wesley]] embraced the term for his movement.&lt;ref name="Atkins-2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Atkins |first=Martyn |url=http://www.methodist.org.uk/static/deepeningdiscipleship/discipleshipandmethodistsmatkins.pdf |title=Discipleship... and the people called Methodists |publisher=The Methodist Church in Britain |date=2010 |page=9 |format=pdf |asin=B006OA0XRU |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315234625/http://methodist.org.uk/static/deepeningdiscipleship/discipleshipandmethodistsmatkins.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-15 |quote=...to be a ‘Methodist’ was originally a term of ridicule because of the zeal and rigour with which they pursued a life of holiness and sought to be the best disciples of Christ they could.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] were termed ''Quakers'' as an epithet, but took up the term themselves.

===Race, ethnicity, and nationality===
To a lesser extent, and more controversially among the groups referred to, many racial, ethnic, and class terms have been reappropriated:

* ''[[Nigga]]'' or ''[[nigger]]'' by [[African Americans]]&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy-2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Randall  |title=Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VgVzXgUxFB4C&amp;pg=PR17 |accessdate=16 January 2018 |date=18 December 2008 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-307-53891-8 |page=xvii |oclc=838223786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[List of ethnic slurs#P|Paddy]]'' by [[Irish Americans]]&lt;ref&gt;For 18th century example of effort at such reappropriation in Ireland, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=qZ6W1LiIyYYC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22He+was+a+paddy+and+no+more%3B+he+desired+no+other+title+than+this.%E2%80%9D&amp;output=html_text&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1 this example here]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=source does not say either that it's a slur, or that it was reappropriated|date=January 2018}}{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Disability===


* ''cripple'', ''crip'', ''gimp'' by people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Baglieri-2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baglieri |first1=Susan  |last2=Shapiro |first2=Arthur  |title=Disability Studies and the Inclusive Classroom: Critical Practices for Creating Least Restrictive Attitudes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkaC2eYg-eUC&amp;pg=PA49 |accessdate=16 January 2018 |volume=New York |year=2012 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-99372-2 |page=49 |oclc=768335668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art movements===
* ''[[Impressionists]]'' In 1874 during their first independent art show, critic [[Louis Leroy]] penned a hostile review of the show in ''[[Le Charivari]]'' newspaper under the title "The Exhibition of the Impression-ists". In particular he used the painting ''[[Impression, Sunrise|Impression, soleil levant]]'' by [[Claude Monet]] to ridicule the painters for their lack of seriousness preferring to paint "fleeting impressions of the moment" rather than allegorical or ultra-realist themes.&lt;ref name="Ciganiero-2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cigainero |first=Jake |date=October 29, 2014 |title=Dating a Seminal Painting Paris Exhibition Traces Origins of Monet's 'Impression, Sunrise' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/arts/international/paris-exhibition-traces-origins-of-monets-impression-sunrise.html |work=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115085344/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/arts/international/paris-exhibition-traces-origins-of-monets-impression-sunrise.html |archivedate=2014-11-15 |accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Stuckism]]'' is an international [[art movement]] founded in 1999; its members produce [[figurative art]]. [[Tracey Emin]], one of the [[Young British Artists]] known for their [[conceptual art]], accused her then-boyfriend of lack of imagination or reach, of being "stuck". He took on the term.

===Other examples===

More generally, any kind of community can reappropriate words referring to them:
* ''[[Smoggie]]'', originally a derogatory term for people from the [[North East England]] town of [[Middlesbrough]], in reference to the town's notorious [[industrial pollution]], now commonly used in self-identification.&lt;ref name="Sarah McKeown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/smoggy |title=Ich bin ein Smoggy: reclaiming regional pride |first=Sarah |last=McKeown |publisher=Macmillan Dictionary Blog |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichola Ridley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2296819/Frustrated-Teesside-mother-pens-Smoggie-dictionary-help-friends-family-understand-her.html |title=Janoaworramean?
