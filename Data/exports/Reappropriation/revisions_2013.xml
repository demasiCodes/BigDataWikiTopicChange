'''Reappropriation''' is the [[culture|cultural]] process by which a group reclaims—re-[[appropriation (sociology)|appropriates]]—terms or artifacts that were previously used in a way disparaging of that group.&lt;ref name="Slurs"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.langsci.2010.11.005 | last1 = Croom | first1 = A.M. | year = 2011 | title = Slurs | url = | journal = Language Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 343–358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, since the early 1970s, much terminology referring to [[homosexuality]]—such as ''[[gay]]'' and (to a lesser extent) ''[[queer]]'' and ''[[poof]]''—has been reappropriated. Another example of reappropriation would be an [[African American]] collecting [[lawn jockey]]s or other artifacts of [[Blackface#"Darky" iconography|darky iconography]]. The term ''reappropriation'' can also extend to counter-[[hegemony|hegemonic]] re-purposing, such as [[citizenship|citizens]] with no formal [[authority#Sociology and philosophy|authority]] seizing unused [[public land|public]] or [[private property|private]] land for community use.

The term ''reappropriation'' is an extension of the term ''appropriation'' or ''[[cultural appropriation]]'' used in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and  [[cultural studies]] to describe the reabsorbing of [[subculture|subcultural]] styles and forms, or those from other cultures, into mass culture through a process of commodification: the mass-marketing of alternate lifestyles, practices, and artifacts.

==Linguistic reappropriation or reclaiming==

A '''reclaimed''' or '''reappropriated''' word is a word that was at one time a [[pejorative]] but has been brought back into acceptable usage—usually starting within the communities that experienced [[oppression]] under that word, but sometimes also among the general populace as well.&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt;(The term 'reclaimed word' more often implies usage by a member of the group referred to.)

This can have wider implications in the fields of [[discourse]], and has been described in terms of personal or sociopolitical empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Godrej|first=Farah|title=Spaces for Counter-Narratives: The Phenomenology of Reclamation|url=http://mpsa.indiana.edu/conf2003papers/1032831537.pdf|work=Paper prepared for the Midwest Political Science Association Meeting|publisher=University of Indiana|accessdate=July 25, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051025220344/http://mpsa.indiana.edu/conf2003papers/1032831537.pdf|archivedate=2005-10-25|format=PDF|date=April 3, 2003}} Citing Patricia Hill Collins, ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment''  (New York: Routledge, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaiming or reappropriating a word involves re-evaluating a term that in the dominant culture is, or at one time was, used by a majority to oppress various [[minority group|minorities]] of that same culture.

In some cases, this reappropriation is so successful as to turn a previously disparaging word into the preferred term: for example, ''[[gay]]'', previously an insult, is now strongly preferred to '[[homosexual]]', both as an adjective and a noun.

One of the older examples of successful reclaiming is the term 'Jesuit' to refer to members of the [[Society of Jesus]]. This was originally a derogatory term referring to people who too readily invoked the name of [[Jesus]] in their politics, but which members of the Society adopted over time for themselves, so that the word came to refer exclusively to them, and generally in a positive or neutral sense, even though the term "Jesuitical" is derived from the Society of Jesus and is used to mean things like: manipulative, conspiring, treacherous, capable of intellectually justifying anything by convoluted reasoning.

Reclaimed words differ from general reclamation outside of language because of their deliberately provocative nature. In addition to neutral or acceptable connotations, reclaimed words often acquire positive meaning within the circles of the informed.&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt; Outside the community, such transitions are rare.  As such, the use of these terms by outside parties is usually viewed as strongly derogatory. For some terms, even "reclaimed" usage by members of the community concerned is a subject of controversy—for example, there is considerable debate within the transgender community over attempts to reclaim the term 'tranny', usually applied offensively to [[trans women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Tranny" and Subversivism: Re-reclaiming "Tranny" (or not) part 1 |url=http://takesupspace.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/tranny-and-subversivism-re-reclaiming-tranny-or-not-part-1/ |last=Cedar |date=November 10, 2008 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Tranny" and Subversivism: Re-reclaiming "Tranny" (or not) part 2 |url=http://takesupspace.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/tranny-cis-women-re-reclaiming-tranny-or-not-part-2/ |last=Cedar |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tranny |publisher=Queer Today |url=http://queertoday.com/profiles/blogs/tranny-1 |first=Mark Daniel |last=Snyder |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault]] discusses the idea of reclaimed words as a 'reverse discourse' in his ''[[History of Sexuality]]: Volume I.'' The New York performance artist [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]] sold what turned out to be her most popular show on the basis of the title, ''Bitch! Dyke! Faghag! Whore!'', words she was reclaiming.

===Words that could be considered reclaimed===

There are many recent English-language examples of some linguistic reappropriation in the areas of [[human sexuality]], [[gender role]]s, [[sexual orientation]], etc. Among these are:

====Sex and sexuality====
*'[[Dyke (lesbian)|Dyke]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=press_pr_dykesonbikes_071405 |title=Trademark Office says no to Dykes on Bikes|publisher=National Center for Lesbian Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and variants such as 'bulldyke', 'diesel dyke', 'baby dyke', 'femme dyke', etc.), '[[Butch and femme|butch]]',
*'[[poof]]', '[[queer]]', '[[homosexuality|homo]]',

====Politics====
However, the phenomenon is much older, especially in politics and religion. [[Cavalier]] is example of a derogatory nickname reappropriated as self-identification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|no-prescript=1 |author=Anonymous |wstitle=Cavalier |volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Roundhead]], a Royalists derisory term for the supporters of the Parliamentary cause, is not (it was a punishable offence in the [[New Model Army]] to call a fellow soldier a roundhead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Worden |first=Blair |year=2009 |title=The English Civil Wars 1640–1660|location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |page=2 |isbn=0-14-100694-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tory]] (orig. from Middle Irish word for 'pursued man' ''[[Tóraidhe]]'' ), [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] (from 'whiggamore' (See the [[Whiggamore Raid]])) and '[[Suffragette]]' are other British examples. [[Yankee]] was originally used as an insult to America, but was reclaimed in the song "[[Yankee Doodle]]".{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language]]s actually have a separate word for such a term, "[http://nl.wikipedia.com/wiki/Geuzennaam geuzennaam]" (Dutch, commonly used) and "[[:de:Geusenwort|Geusenwort]]" (German, used among linguists). These words derive from the [[geuzen]], i.e., Dutch opponents to [[Spanish Netherlands|Spanish rule]] in the 16th century, who eventually created the [[Netherlands]] under [[William the Silent|William of Orange]]. Being derisively called 'beggars' ('gueux' in French of the era) by their opponents, they appropriated a Dutchified form of the word as their own "battle name". In [[French language|French]] during the [[French Revolution]] the word "[[Sans-culottes]]" (literally "without [[knee-breeches]]") gained a similar meaning.

More recent political examples include:

*'[[Environmentalism|Tree hugger]]' by [[environmentalism|environmentalists]]
* [[Liberal Conspiracy]], a term sometimes used by right-wingers to describe purported liberal domination of modern life, adopted as the moniker of [[Sunny Hundal]]'s political blog.
*'[[Vast Right Wing Conspiracy]]' originally used as a pejorative term by [[Hillary Clinton]], but now routinely used as a positive self-identity by [[Rush Limbaugh]] and other conservatives
*'[[Redneck (stereotype)|Redneck]]' by political movements from the [[American South]], especially conservative movements.
*'[[Obamacare]]' Originally a right-wing term for the [[Affordable Care Act]], the left embraced the term and it is now considered the act's shorthand name.

====Religion====
{{refimprove|date=November 2011}}
'Jesuit' as a term for members of the [[Society of Jesus]] was mentioned above; other examples among religious (or non-religious) groups include:

*'[[Christian]]' by [[Early Christianity]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 11:26 implies that the word 'Christian' was first used in [[Antioch]], possibly by its opponents.
*'[[Jesus freak]]' by Christians, and especially Christian teens
*'[[Methodist]], originally a slur directed at [[John Wesley]], who founded that denomination
*'[[Moonie]]' by members of the [[Unification Church]], especially the [[Unification Church second generation]]
*'[[Mormon]]', by members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church)
*'[[Mormon fundamentalist]]', by those who broke away from the LDS Church to continue practicing polygamy
*'[[Papist]]' by Roman Catholics
*'[[Quaker]]' by the [[Religious Society of Friends]]
*'[[Kike]]' or '[[Yid]],' by people of [[Judaism|Jewish]] descent and/or faith
*'[[Witch]],' '[[Paganism|pagan]],' and 'heathen,' by the [[wicca]]n and [[neopagan]] communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Driver|first=Tressy|title=The language of the summer solstice|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/06/summer-solstice/|date=21 June 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'Godless,' and 'heathen' (with a different meaning than in the [[neopagan]] sense), by [[irreligious]] people. See also the [[Atheism#Etymology|etymology of the word 'atheist']].

====Art and culture====
Many style in art, music and popular culture got their names from [[pejorative]] remarks made by critics at their first appearances. In recent history, the word [[Punk (disambiguation)|punk]] comes to mind: First it was a cuss-word directed at the musicians and their followers. Quickly afterwards the fans reappropriated the word as a mane for their community. Now it is a music style.

Other examples include:
*'[[Impressionists]]'In 1874[2] during their first independent art show, critic [[Louis Leroy]],  penned a hostile review of the show in Le Charivari newspaper under the title "The Exhibition of the Impression-ists". In particular he used the painting [[impression, sunrise|impression, soleil levant]] by [[Claude Monet]] to ridicule the painters for their lack of seriousness perfering to paint 'fleeting impressions of the moment' rather than allegorical or ultra-realist themes.
*'[[Fauvists]]' At their first group exposition at the Salon d'Automne of 1905, the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]], shocked by the wild colors and bold brushstrokes of their paintings disparaged the artists as a band of "fauves" (wild beasts)
* [[Decadent movement|Decadent]] by a late generation of [[Romanticism (art)|Romantics]], such as [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]], who used the word proudly, to represent their rejection of what they considered banal "progress"
* '[[Nerd]]' and [[geek]] by intellectuals, hobbyists, and people with a deep interest in science fiction, video games, and other obscure hobbies and interests
** [[Otaku]] has a similar meaning, but often suggest that the person is a Japanophile (e.g. anime).
* '[[Dork (disambiguation)|Dork]]' by quirky people

====Race and ethnicity====
To a lesser extent, and more controversially among the groups referred to, many racial, ethnic, and class terms have been reappropriated:

*'[[Flip (slang)|Flip]]' by [[Filipino American]] youth
*'[[Nigga, Niggah, Nigguh]]' by [[African Americans]]&lt;ref name="Slurs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, the band [[N.W.A.]], or the titles of several of [[Richard Pryor]]'s recordings. Or listen to a wide range of 90's-2000's [[hip hop music]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'[[Mutt (dog)|Mutt]]' by people of [[mixed race]]
*'[[Guido (slang)|Guido]]' by [[Italian Americans]], also 'guidette' for women
*'[[Wog]]' by Australians of Southern European descent
*'[[Gaijin]]' by [[western world|westerners]] living in [[Japan]]
*'[[Farang]]' by westerners living in [[Thailand]]
*'[[Bule]]' by westerners living in [[Indonesia]]
*'[[Michael#.22Mick.22|Mic]]' by [[Irish Americans]]
*'[[List of ethnic slurs|Paddy]]' by [[Irish Americans]]&lt;ref&gt;For 18th century example of effort at such reappropriation in Ireland, see http://books.google.ie/books?id=qZ6W1LiIyYYC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=%22He+was+a+paddy+and+no+more;+he+desired+no+other+title+than+this.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fy1rrMxn_w&amp;sig=lmnfpxpmIFXwqKL6Q1SZAf3yTVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nss9Uv7WAqOS7QaR1IHYBA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22He%20was%20a%20paddy%20and%20no%20more%3B%20he%20desired%20no%20other%20title%20than%20this.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;
*'[[wikt:Tim|Tim]]' by [[Glaswegians]] of Irish Descent
*'[[List of ethnic slurs#Paki|Paki]]' by Pakistani-American and Pakistani-British youth
*'[[Heeb]]' by [[Jew]]s (in a cultural rather than primarily religious sense)
*'[[Chink]]' as a term used by [[Chinese American]]s and other [[Asian American]]s
*'[[Fenian]],' used in Scotland and Northern Ireland for a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] or an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]]; or, especially in Scotland, someone of [[Irish people|Irish descent]]
* artist [[Kara Walker]] has attempted to reappropriate the word '[[Negro|negress]]'
*'[[Redneck (stereotype)|Redneck]]' -- besides its usage for political conservatives, this term is alternately embraced and shunned by Southerners with rural backgrounds stereotypically considered to be unsophisticated. Example: the country music song "[[Redneck Woman]]".
*'[[White Trash]]' by lower-class caucasians; traits of this group often overlap with 'Redneck'.
*'[[Coon Ass]]' by individuals originating from the vicinity of the state of Louisiana in the United States.
*'[[Tar Heel]]' by natives of the state of North Carolina, USA.&lt;ref name=AlumniArticle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.unc.edu/article.asp?SID=3516|title=Article on history of term from UNC Alumni webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'[[Yid]]' by supporters of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur Football Club]] after being called this by racists, in an attempt to dilute the effect.

====Other====
More generally, any kind of community can reappropriate words referring to them:
* 'Pirate' by the [[peer-to-peer filesharing]] community and [[warez scene]]
* '[[Legitimacy (law)|Bastard]]', by adopted people&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Bastard Nation website: http://bastards.org/bb/0.WhatisBN.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* '[[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|Brat]]' (as in 'military brat') by [[military brat (U.S. subculture)|children of U.S. military personnel]]
*'[[wikt:crip|Crip]]', '[[cripple (disambiguation)|cripple]]' or '[[wikt:gimp|gimp]]' by [[people with disabilities]], particularly in the [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion movement]]
* '[[Fat]]' by the [[Fat acceptance movement|size-acceptance movement]]
* '[[Pimp]]', used as an adjective or verb to describe something that is decorated or gussied up, or in a similar context as [[badass (disambiguation)|badass]] (e.g. a pimped-out car)
* '[[Smoggie]]', used for people from the north east England town of [[Middlesbrough]].&lt;ref name="Sarah McKeown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/smoggy |title=Ich bin ein Smoggy: reclaiming regional pride |first=Sarah |last=McKeown |publisher=Macmillan Dictionary Blog |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichola Ridley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2296819/Frustrated-Teesside-mother-pens-Smoggie-dictionary-help-friends-family-understand-her.html |title=Janoaworramean?

* [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] by non-white South African rugby players and fans.
* [[Tranny (slang)]] by transgender people

==Recontextualization of material objects==
A closely related phenomenon is the recontextualization of material objects, as for example when the Jim Crow Museum&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Ferris State University]] displays such [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] Era artifacts as [[golliwog]] marbles or [[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]] masks.

Other such examples are the display of an [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] poster in a [[Holocaust]] museum, or the removal of the Coat Of Arms, featuring animals sacred to [[Australian Aborigines]], from the Australian Federal Parliament building by Aboriginal elder [[Kevin Buzzacott]].

You see similar recontextualization in Black African cinemas. [[Boulou Ebanda de B'béri]] use the term "rappropriation" a Belgian euphemism to explain the process of claiming back and cleaning out the image of Africans on Western screen.

==See also==
*[[Euphemism treadmill|Dysphemism treadmill]], the process by which offensive terms can become acceptable without deliberate intervention
