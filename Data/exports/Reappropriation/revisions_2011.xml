'''Reappropriation''' is the [[culture|cultural]] process by which a group reclaims—re-[[appropriation (sociology)|appropriates]]—terms or artifacts that were previously used in a way disparaging of that group. For example, since the early 1970s, much terminology referring to [[homosexuality]]—such as ''[[gay]]'', ''[[queer]]'', and (to a lesser extent) ''[[faggot (epithet)|faggot]]''—has been reappropriated. Another example of reappropriation would be an [[African American]] collecting [[lawn jockey]]s or other artifacts of [[Blackface#Blackface and darky iconography|darky iconography]]. The term ''reappropriation'' can also extend to  counter-[[hegemony|hegemonic]] re-purposing, such as [[citizenship|citizens]] with no formal [[authority#Sociology and philosophy|authority]] seizing unused [[public land|public]] or [[private property|private]] land for community use.

The term ''reappropriation'' is an extension of the term ''appropriation'' or ''[[cultural appropriation]]'' used in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and  [[cultural studies]] to describe the hegemonic action of reabsorbing [[subculture|subcultural]] styles and forms, or those from other cultures, into mass culture through a process of commodification: the mass-marketing of alternate lifestyles, practices, and artifacts.

==Linguistic reappropriation or reclaiming==

A '''reclaimed''' or '''reappropriated''' word, is a word that was at one time a [[pejorative]] but has been brought back into acceptable usage—usually starting within the communities that experienced [[oppression]] under that word, but sometimes also among the general populace as well. (The term 'reclaimed word' more often implies usage by a member of the group referred to.)

This can have wider implications in the fields of [[discourse]], and has been described in terms of personal or sociopolitical empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Godrej|first=Farah|title=Spaces for Counter-Narratives: The Phenomenology of Reclamation|url=http://mpsa.indiana.edu/conf2003papers/1032831537.pdf|work=Paper prepared for the Midwest Political Science Association Meeting|publisher=University of Indiana|accessdate=July 25, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051025220344/http://mpsa.indiana.edu/conf2003papers/1032831537.pdf|archivedate=2005-10-25|format=PDF|date=April 3, 2003}} Citing Patricia Hill Collins, ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment''  (New York: Routledge, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Reclaiming or reappropriating a word involves re-evaluating a term that in the dominant culture is, or at one time was, used by a majority to oppress various [[minority group|minorities]] of that same culture.

In some cases, this reappropriation is so successful as to turn a previously disparaging word into the preferred term: for example, ''[[gay]]'', previously an insult, is now strongly preferred to '[[homosexual]]', both as an adjective and a noun.

One of the older examples of successful reclaiming is the term 'Jesuit' to refer to members of the [[Society of Jesus]]. This was originally a derogatory term referring to people who too readily invoked the name of [[Jesus]] in their politics, but which members of the Society adopted over time for themselves, so that the word came to refer exclusively to them, and only in a positive or neutral sense.

Reclaimed words differ from general reclamation outside of language because of their deliberately provocative nature. In addition to neutral or acceptable connotations, reclaimed words often acquire positive meaning within the circles of the informed. Outside the community, such transitions are rare.  As such, the use of these terms by outside parties is usually viewed as strongly derogatory. For some terms, even "reclaimed" usage by members of the community concerned is a subject of controversy—for example, there is considerable debate within the transgender community over attempts to reclaim the term 'tranny', usually applied offensively to [[transwomen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Tranny" and Subversivism: Re-reclaiming "Tranny" (or not) part 1 |url=http://takesupspace.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/tranny-and-subversivism-re-reclaiming-tranny-or-not-part-1/ |last=Cedar |date=November 10, 2008 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Tranny" and Subversivism: Re-reclaiming "Tranny" (or not) part 2 |url=http://takesupspace.wordpress.com/2009/01/08/tranny-cis-women-re-reclaiming-tranny-or-not-part-2/ |last=Cedar |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tranny |publisher=Queer Today |url=http://queertoday.com/profiles/blogs/tranny-1 |first=Mark Daniel |last=Snyder |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault]] discusses the idea of reclaimed words as a 'reverse discourse' in his ''[[History of Sexuality]]: Volume I.'' The New York performance artist [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]] sold what turned out to be her most popular show on the basis of the title, ''Bitch! Dyke! Faghag! Whore!'', words she was reclaiming.

===Words that could be considered reclaimed===

There are many recent English-language examples of linguistic reappropriation in the areas of [[human sexuality]], [[gender role]]s, [[sexual orientation]], etc. Among these are:

====Sex and sexuality====
*'[[Bitch (insult)|Bitch]]' and '[[cunt]]'&lt;ref&gt;The earliest citable example of reappropriation of the word 'cunt' is remarkably early -- the Wife of Bath in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'': "For certeyn, olde dotard, by youre leve, / Ye shul have queynte right y-nough at eve" -- 'queynte' being a [[Middle English]] spelling of 'cunt'.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[feminist]] movement.
*'[[Dyke (lesbian)|Dyke]]' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=press_pr_dykesonbikes_071405 |title=Trademark Office says no to Dykes on Bikes|publisher=National Center for Lesbian Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and variants such as 'bulldyke', 'diesel dyke', 'baby dyke', 'femme dyke', etc.), '[[Butch and femme|butch]]', '[[faggot (slang)|faggot]]' or 'fag',&lt;ref name=hey&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=340 Savage Love: Farewell, Faggot], ''The Stranger'', February 25, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; '[[poof]]', '[[queer]]', '[[homosexuality|homo]]' and '[[wikt:tranny|tranny]]' by the [[LGBT]] movements&lt;ref&gt;See [[Queer Nation]] for several relevant examples&lt;/ref&gt;
*'[[Slut]],' and, to a lesser extent, '[[Slag (slang)|slag]],' by [[promiscuous]], [[sexual liberation]], [[polygamous]] and [[polyamorous]] affiliates
*'[[Pervert]]' by members of the [[BDSM]] and [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] communities.

====Politics====
However, the phenomenon is much older, especially in politics and religion. [[Cavalier]] is example of a derogatory nickname reappropriated as self-identification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|no-prescript=1 |author=Anonymous |wstitle=Cavalier |volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Roundhead]], a Royalists derisory term for the supporters of the Parliamentary cause is not (it was a punishable offence in the [[New Model Army]] to call a fellow soldier a roundhead).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Worden |first=Blair |year=2009 |title=The English Civil Wars 1640–1660|location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |page=2 |isbn=0-14-100694-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tory]] (orig. from Middle Irish word for 'pursued man' ''[[Tóraidhe]]'' ), [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] (from 'whiggamore' (See the [[Whiggamore Raid]])) and '[[Suffragette]]' are other British examples, while  [[Yankee]] is an American example.

The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language]]s actually have a separate word for such a term, "[http://nl.wikipedia.com/wiki/Geuzennaam geuzennaam]" (Dutch, commonly used) and "[[:de:Geusenwort|Geusenwort]]" (German, used among linguists). These words derive from the [[geuzen]], i.e., Dutch opponents to [[Spanish Netherlands|Spanish rule]] in the 16th century, who eventually created the [[Netherlands]] under [[William the Silent|William of Orange]]. Being derisively called 'beggars' ('gueux' in French of the era) by their opponents, they appropriated a Dutchified form of the word as their own "battle name". In [[French language|French]] during the [[French Revolution]] the word "[[Sans-culottes]]" (literally "without [[knee-breeches]]") gained a similar meaning.

More recent political examples include:

*'[[Environmentalism|Tree hugger]]' by [[environmentalism|environmentalists]]
*'[[Vast Right Wing Conspiracy]]' originally used as a pejorative term by [[Hillary Clinton]], but now routinely used as a positive self-identity by [[Rush Limbaugh]] and other conservatives
*'[[Redneck (stereotype)|Redneck]]' by political movements from the [[American South]], especially conservative movements.

====Religion====
{{unref|date=November 2011}}
'Jesuit' as a term for members of the [[Society of Jesus]] was mentioned above; other examples among religious (or non-religious) groups include:

*'[[Christian]]' by [[Early Christianity]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 11:26 implies that the word 'Christian' was first used in [[Antioch]], possibly by its opponents.
*'[[Jesus freak]]' by Christians, and especially Christian teens
*'[[Methodist]], originally a slur directed at [[John Wesley]], who founded that denomination
*'[[Moonie]]' by members of the [[Unification Church]], especially the [[Unification Church second generation]]
*'[[Mormon]]', by members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church)
*'[[Mormon fundamentalist]]', by those who broke away from the LDS Church to continue practicing polygamy
*'[[Papist]]' by Roman Catholics
*'[[Quaker]]' by the [[Religious Society of Friends]]
*'[[Kike]]' or '[[Yid]],' by people of [[Judaism|Jewish]] descent and/or faith
*'[[Witch]],' '[[Paganism|pagan]],' and 'heathen,' by the [[wicca]]n and [[neopagan]] communities
*'Godless,' and 'heathen' (with a different meaning than in the [[neopagan]] sense), by [[irreligious]] people. See also the [[Atheism#Etymology|etymology of the word 'atheist']].

====Race and ethnicity====
To a lesser extent, and more controversially among the groups referred to, many racial, ethnic, and class terms have been reappropriated:

*'[[Flip (slang)|Flip]]' by [[Filipino American]] youth
*'[[Nigga]]' by the [[Black]] movement&lt;ref&gt;For example, the band [[N.W.A.]], or the titles of several of [[Richard Pryor]]'s recordings. Or listen to a wide range of 90's-2000's [[hip hop music]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'[[Mutt (dog)|Mutt]]' by people of [[mixed race]]
*'[[Guido (slang)|Guido]]' by [[Italian Americans]],Also: "guidette" for women.
*'[[Wog]]' by Australians of Southern European descent
*'[[Gaijin]]' by [[western world|westerners]] living in [[Japan]]
*'[[Farang]]' by westerners living in [[Thailand]]
*'[[Bule]]' by westerners living in [[Indonesia]]
*'[[Michael#.22Mick.22|Mic]]' by [[Irish Americans]]
*'Paddy' by [[Irish Americans]]
*'[[wikt:Tim|Tim]]' by [[Glaswegians]] of Irish Descent
*'[[List of ethnic slurs#Paki|Paki]]' by Pakistani-American youth
*'[[Heeb]]' by [[Jew]]s (in a cultural rather than primarily religious sense)
*'[[Chink]]' as a term used by [[Chinese American]]s and other [[Asian American]]s
*'[[Fenian]],' used in Scotland and Northern Ireland for a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] or an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]]; or, especially in Scotland, someone of [[Irish people|Irish descent]]
* artist [[Kara Walker]] has attempted to reappropriate the word '[[Negro|negress]]'
*'[[Redneck (stereotype)|Redneck]]' -- besides its usage for political conservatives, this term is alternately embraced and shunned by Southerners with rural backgrounds stereotypically considered to be unsophisticated. Example: the country music song "[[Redneck Woman]]".
*'[[White Trash]]' by lower-class caucasians; traits of this group often overlap with 'Redneck'.
*'[[Yid]]' by supporters of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur Football Club]] after being called this by racists, in an attempt to dilute the effect.

====Other====
More generally, any kind of community can reappropriate words referring to them:

*'[[Geek]]' by individuals heavily involved with a hobby, science, or trade
*'[[Nerd]]' by technophiles and people with a deep interest in science fiction, video games, and other obscure hobbies and interests
**[[Otaku]] also is being used in Japan. Otaku translated as geek and nerd, but more accurately as [[anorak (slang)|anorak]] due to the more obsessive meaning and the fact that it can be used as an insult.
*'Pirate' by the [[peer-to-peer filesharing]] community and [[warez scene]]
*'[[Legitimacy (law)|Bastard]]', by adopted people&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Bastard Nation website: http://bastards.org/bb/0.WhatisBN.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*'[[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|Brat]]' (as in 'military brat') by [[military brat (U.S. subculture)|children of U.S. military personnel]]
*'[[wikt:crip|Crip]]', '[[cripple (disambiguation)|cripple]]' or '[[wikt:gimp|gimp]]' by [[people with disabilities]], particularly in the [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion movement]]
*'[[Fat]]' by the [[Fat acceptance movement|size-acceptance movement]]

==Recontextualization of material objects==
A closely related phenomenon is the recontextualization of material objects, as for example when the [[racism|anti-racist]] [[Jim Crow Museum]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Ferris State University]] displays such [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] Era artifacts as [[golliwog]] marbles or [[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]] masks.

Other such examples are the display of an [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] poster in a [[Holocaust]] museum, or the removal of the Coat Of Arms, featuring animals sacred to [[Australian Aborigines]], from the Australian Federal Parliament building by Aboriginal elder [[Kevin Buzzacott]].

==Reappropriation of land, etc.==
While the previous examples are largely symbolic, another type of reappropriation is far more material, while still also involving an important symbolic dimension. The many battles over [[People's Park, Berkeley|People's Park]] in [[Berkeley, California]] have centered on community activists' intent to reappropriate as public space a piece of land that the [[University of California, Berkeley]] originally wanted to turn into a parking lot. The space has been a site of contention since 1969.
