'''Discrimination against the homeless''' is the act of treating the [[homeless]], or those perceived to be homeless, unfavorably. As with most types of [[discrimination]] it can manifest in numerous forms.

==Discriminatory legislation regarding homelessness==
{{Main|Criminalization of homelessness}}
Use of the law to discriminate against the homeless takes on disparate forms: restricting the [[General public|public]] areas in which sitting or sleeping are allowed, ordinances restricting [[aggressive panhandling]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nlchp.org/documents/Criminalizing_Crisis&lt;/ref&gt; actions intended to divert the homeless from particular areas, penalizing loitering or anti-social behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Britain: Where have all the homeless gone?; The homeless;|journal=The Economist|volume=372|issue=8388|pages=21–49|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or enforcing laws on the homeless and not on those who are not homeless.&lt;ref name=Cunningham&gt;{{cite book |title= Out of Sight--Out of Mind? |last= Cunningham |first= Kelly |year= 1999 |publisher= DIANE Publishing |location= |isbn= 0-7881-8276-5 |pages= 90 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French literature|French]] [[novelist]] [[Anatole France]] noted this phenomenon as long ago as 1894, famously observing that "the law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges".&lt;ref name="Anatole France"&gt;{{cite book |title=Le lys rouge |last=France |first=Anatole |authorlink=Anatole France |year=1894 |publisher= |location= |language=French|isbn= |pages= |chapter=VII |chapterurl=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Lys_rouge_-_VII |quote=Ils y doivent travailler devant la majestueuse égalité des lois, qui interdit au riche comme au pauvre de coucher sous les ponts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminalization of homelessness in the United States===
{{main|Criminalization of homelessness in the United States}}
There is a growing trend in the United States towards criminalizing the state of being homeless.&lt;ref name="dream"&gt;National Coalition for the Homeless: [http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/crimreport/report.pdf A Dream Denied].&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this approach believe that punitive measures will deter people from a homeless lifestyle.

To this end, cities across the country increasingly outlaw life-sustaining activities—such as sleeping, eating, sitting, and begging—in public spaces, and selectively enforce more neutral laws—such as those prohibiting open containers or [[loitering]]—against homeless populations.&lt;ref name="dream"/&gt;

Violators of such laws typically incur criminal penalties, which result in fines or incarceration or both.
Homeless people with new "criminal charges" have very restrictive housing and employment options, if either, for years.

In April 2006 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that "making it a crime to be homeless by charging them with a crime is in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|8th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] Amendments."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/8138B5E4723C6FE988257150005B327E/$file/0455324.pdf?openelement&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal victimization==

Precise factors associated with victimization and injury to the homeless are not clearly understood. Nearly one-half of homeless are victims of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meinbresse|coauthors=Brinkley-Rubinstein, Grassette,  Benson, Hall, Hamilton, Malott, Jenkins|title=Exploring the Experiences of Violence Among Individuals Who Are Homeless Using a Consumer-Led Approach.|journal=Violence &amp; Victims|date=2014|volume=29|issue=1|pages=122–136|accessdate=5/1/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{see also|Homelessness in the United States#Crimes against homeless people}}
There have been many violent crimes committed against the homeless due to their being homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Fantz, Ashley, [http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/19/homeless.attacks/index.html?iref=newssearch "Teen 'sport killings' of homeless on the rise"], [[CNN]], February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2007 found that this number is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;Lewan, Todd, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-08-homelessattacks_N.htm "Unprovoked Beatings of Homeless Soaring"], [[Associated Press]], April 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[National Coalition for the Homeless]], [http://www.nationalhomeless.org/getinvolved/projects/hatecrimes/pressrelease.html Hate, "Violence, and Death on Main Street USA: A report on Hate Crimes and Violence Against People Experiencing Homelessness, 2006"], February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy and awareness ==

=== National Alliance to End Homelessness ===
[http://www.endhomelessness.org/ The National Alliance to End Homelessness] offers an organized spread of homeless issues and solutions while providing means of donation and support. President Nan Roman expresses that in her opinion, "People will always have problems and crises. But in a nation as wealthy as ours, where human life is valued, widespread homelessness need not—and SHOULD not—exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Message from the President|url = http://www.endhomelessness.org/pages/message_from_the_president|website = www.endhomelessness.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Alliance to  End Homelessness contains three main groups: the [http://www.endhomelessness.org/pages/homelessness-research-institute Homelessness Research Institute], the [http://www.endhomelessness.org/pages/research-council Research Council], and the [http://www.endhomelessness.org/pages/capacity_building Center for Capacity Building]. 

=== National Hunger and Awareness Week ===
The National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week is held every year the week before Thanksgiving to raise awareness of issues relating to hunger and homelessness in communities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Hunger &amp; Homelessness Awareness Week - National Coalition for the Homeless|url = http://nationalhomeless.org/about-us/projects/awareness-week/|website = National Coalition for the Homeless|accessdate = 2015-10-26|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://nationalhomeless.org/ The National Coalition for the Homeless] offers guidelines and educational tools that encourage the public to get involved. The NCH's goal is to attack the prominent hunger and homelessness issues of today. Participants are encouraged to share thanks and help fellow community members in times of need. The H&amp;H week is ultimately set up to be a national movement and each year the week is focused on specific goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
