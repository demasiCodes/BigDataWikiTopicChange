{{Women in society sidebar |society}}
'''Women in government''' in the modern era are generally [[underrepresented group|underrepresented]] in most countries worldwide. In many of these countries, women have had inadequate opportunities in social participation, especially in striving for political rights and power in the government and different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Namibia|first=Sister|last2=Windhoek|date=1989|title=Women in government|journal=1(3)|volume=3|pages=|id={{ProQuest|194900864}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; This historical tendency still persists, although women are increasingly being [[List of elected and appointed female heads of state|politically elected to be heads of state and government]].&lt;ref name="Carmichael"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Carmichael | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Dilli | first2 = Selin | last3 = Rijpma | first3 = Auke | contribution = Women in the global economic history | editor-last = Baten | editor-first = Jörg | title = A history of the global economy: from 1500 to the present | pages = 244, 245 [Figure 17.4] | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781107507180 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chesser |first1=Susan G. |title=Women in National Governments Around the Globe: Fact Sheet |date=January 31, 2019 |publisher=Congressional Research Service |location=Washington, DC |url=https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo117807 |accessdate=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2018, the global participation rate of women in national-level parliaments is 24.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women in National Parliaments | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, women accounted for 8% of all national leaders and 2% of all presidential posts.

However more and more women are pursuing leadership positions in the present day.

Women, as the conventional primary caretakers of children, often have a more prominent role than men in advocating for children, resulting in a "double dividend" in terms of the benefits of women's representation.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Female representatives not only advance women's rights, but also advance the rights of children. In national legislatures, there is a notable trend of women advancing gender and family-friendly legislation. This advocacy has been seen in countries ranging from [[France]], [[Sweden]] and the [[Netherlands]], to [[South Africa]], [[Rwanda]], and [[Egypt]]. Furthermore, a number of studies from both industrialized and developed countries indicate that women in local government tend to advance social issues.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; In India, for instance, greater women's representation has corresponded with a more equitable distribution of community resources, including more gender-sensitive spending on programs related to health, nutrition, and education.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 1954, the [[United Nations]] ''[[Convention on the Political Rights of Women]]'' went into force, enshrining women's equal rights to vote, hold office, and access public services as provided for male citizens within national laws.

At the executive levels of government, women become prime ministers more often than they become presidents. Part of the differences in these roads to power are that prime ministers are elected by political party members themselves while presidents are elected by the public. In 2013, women accounted for 8 percent of all national leaders and 2 percent of all presidential posts. Furthermore, 75 percent of all female prime ministers and presidents have taken office in the past two decades.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt; Since 1960 to 2015, 108 women have become national leaders in 70 countries, with more being prime ministers than presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jalaza |first1=Farida |title=Shattered, Cracked, or Family Intact?: Women and the Executive Glass Ceiling Worldwide |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780190602093 |page=32|chapter=Introduction|date=2016-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual female executives usually come from the most elite backgrounds, as is evidenced by their high levels of education and close relationships with politically prominent or upper class families. The general status of women in a country does not predict if a woman will reach an executive position since, paradoxically, female executives have routinely ascended in power in countries where women's social standing lags behind men's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jalaza |first1=Farida |title=Shattered, Cracked, or Family Intact?: Women and the Executive Glass Ceiling Worldwide |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780190602093 |page=3 |chapter=Introduction|date=2016-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have long struggled in more developed countries to become president or prime minister. Israel elected its first female prime minister in 1969, but has never done so again. The United States, on the other hand, has had no female presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hype.news/don-juravin/we-need-women-governing-in-america-sj1bwqgi|title=Hype.News|website=hype.news|access-date=2019-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in national parliaments===
As of April 1, 2019, the global average of women in national assemblies is 24.3 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women in Parliaments: World and Regional Averages | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] |accessdate=August 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, large differences exist between countries, e.g. Sri Lanka has quite low female participation rates in parliament compared with Rwanda, Cuba, and Bolivia, where female representation rates are the highest.&lt;ref name="Inter-Parliamentary Union" /&gt; Three of the top ten countries in 2019 were in [[Latin America]] (Bolivia, Cuba, and Mexico), and the Americas have seen the greatest aggregate change over the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://apolitical.co/solution_article/which-countries-have-most-women-in-parliament/ | title = Mapped: which countries have the most women in parliament | work = Apolitical | accessdate = 2018-04-20 | language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New figures are available for up to February 2014 from International IDEA, Stockholm University and Inter-Parliamentary Union. (2014) at http://www.quotaproject.org/quotas.cfm

Although 86% of countries have reached at least 10% women in their national legislature, far fewer have crossed the 20% and 30% barriers. By July 2019, only 23% of sovereign nations had more than 30% women in [[parliament]]. The major English-speaking democracies are placed mostly in the top 40% of the ranked countries. New Zealand ranks at position 16 with women comprising 40.8% of its parliament. The United Kingdom (32.0% in the lower house, 26.4% in the upper house) ranks at position 39, while Australia (30.5% in the lower house, 48.7% in the upper house) ranks at position 47 out of 189 countries. Canada is ranked at 60 (27.0% lower house, 46.7% upper house), while the United States ranks 78 (23.6% in the lower house, 25.0% in the upper house).&lt;ref name="Inter-Parliamentary Union" /&gt; Not all of these lower and/or upper houses in national parliaments are democratically elected; for example, in Canada members of the upper house (the Senate) are appointed.

Pamela Paxton describes three factors that are reasons why national-level representation has become much larger over the past several decades.&lt;ref name="Paxton"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paxton | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Melanie M. | last3 = Kunovich | first3 = Sheri L. | title = Gender in politics | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 263–284 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131651 | date = August 2007 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the changing structural and economic conditions of nations, which says that educational advancements along with an increase in women's participation in the labor force encourages representation.&lt;ref name="Kunovich"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paxton | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Kunovich | first2 = Sheri L. | title = Pathways to power: the role of political parties in women's national political representation | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 111 | issue = 2 | pages = 505–552 | doi = 10.1086/444445 | jstor = 10.1086/ajs.2005.111.issue-2 | date = September 2005 | ref = harv | url = https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=hum_sci_sociology_research }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second is the political factor; representation of women in office being based on a proportionality system. Some voting systems are built so that a party that gains 25% of the votes gains 25% of the seats. In these processes, a political party feels obligated to balance the representation within their votes between genders, increasing women's activity in political standing. A [[Plurality voting system|plurality-majority system]], such as the one the United States, United Kingdom, and India has, only allows single candidate elections, and thus allows political parties to entirely dictate regions' representatives even if they only control a small majority of the vote. Last, there is the ideological disposition of a country; the concept that the cultural aspects of women's roles or positions in the places they live dictate where they stand in that society, ultimately either helping or handicapping those women from entering political positions.&lt;ref name="Kunovich" /&gt;

==Pathways to political involvement==

Globally, there have been 4 general pathways that have led women into political office:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Henderson |first1=Sarah L. |last2=Jeydel |first2=Alana S. |title=Women and Politics in a Global World |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0199899661 |pages=20–21 |chapter=1. Women and International Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Political family - women in this path come from families that have a long history of in involvement in electoral politics.
* Surrogate - women in this path have assumed office, often temporarily, as a surrogate for a father, husband, or brother who has recently died.
* Party or political insider – women in this path start at the bottom of a party or political ladder and work their way up over time filling in necessary roles to show loyalty to the party.
* Political outsider – women in this path usually lack political experience but they run on a platform emphasizing new political changes and serve as an alternative to the status quo.

==Challenges faced by women==
Women face numerous obstacles in achieving representation in governance.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

=== Societal challenges ===
Gender inequality within families, inequitable [[division of labor]] within households, and cultural attitudes about [[gender roles]] further subjugate women and serve to limit their representation in public life.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;  Societies that are highly [[patriarchal]] often have local power structures that make it difficult for women to combat.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"&gt;{{citation | last = UNRISD | author-link = United Nations Research Institute for Social Development | contribution = Overview | editor-last = UNRISD | editor-link = United Nations Research Institute for Social Development | title = Gender equality: striving for justice in an unequal world | page = xxi | publisher = [[United Nations Research Institute for Social Development]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9789290850731 | url = http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/search/1FF4AC64C1894EAAC1256FA3005E7201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, their interests are often not represented or under-represented.

=== Systematic challenges ===
There have been many arguments saying the plurality-majority voting system is a disadvantage to the chance that women get into office. [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] brings forth one of these arguments by stating: "Plurality-majority single-member-district systems, whether of the Anglo-American [[first-past-the-post]] (FPTP) variety, the Australian preference ballot [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] (AV), or the French [[two-round system]] (TRS), are deemed to be particularly unfavorable to women's chances of being elected to office".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt; [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew]] believes that the best systems are [[List proportional representation|list-proportional systems]]. "In these systems of high proportionality between seats won and votes cast, small parties are able to gain representation and parties have an incentive to broaden their overall electoral appeal by making their candidate lists as diverse as possible".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

Even once elected, women tend to hold lesser valued cabinet ministries or similar positions.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003" /&gt; These are sometimes described as "soft industries" and include health, education, and welfare.  Far less often do women hold executive decision-making authority in more powerful domains or those that are associated with traditional notions of masculinity (such as finance and the military).  Typically, the more powerful the institution, the less likely it is that women's interests will be represented.  Additionally, in more autocratic nations, women are less likely to have their interests represented.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005" /&gt; Many women attain political standing due to kinship ties, as they have male family members who are involved in politics.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003" /&gt; These women tend to be from higher income, higher status families and thus may not be as focused on the issues faced by lower income families. In The United States, the lower end of the professional ladder contains a higher proportion of women while the upper level contains a higher proportion of men. Research shows that women are underrepresented in head positions in state agencies making up only 18% of congress and 15% of corporate board positions. When women do gain any level of representation it is in the fields of health, welfare, and labor. They are seen to be addressing issues labeled as feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Amy E.|last2=Monaghan|first2=Karen R.|date=2013-01-01|title=Some Ceilings Have More Cracks: Representative Bureaucracy in Federal Regulatory Agencies|journal=The American Review of Public Administration|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=50–71|doi=10.1177/0275074011420997|issn=0275-0740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges of personal life and choices ===
Additionally, women running for public office typically gain additional, unnecessary scrutiny on their private lives.  For instance, fashion choices of politically active women are often picked apart by the media. In these "analyses" women rarely gain approval from those in the media, who usually say they either they show too much skin or too little, or perhaps that they either look too feminine or too masculine.  Sylvia Bashevkin also notes that their romantic lives are often subject of much interest to the general population, perhaps more so than their political agenda or stances on issues.&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 86–89"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Vexatious Vixens | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, Power, Politics: The Hidden Story of Canada's Unfinished Democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|pages=86–89 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She points out that those who "appear to be sexually active outside a monogamous heterosexual marriage run into particular difficulties, since they tend to be portrayed as vexatious vixens"&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 88"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Vexatious Vixens | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, Power, Politics: The Hidden Story of Canada's Unfinished Democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|page=88 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are more interested in their private romantic lives than in their public responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 86–89"/&gt;  If they are in a monogamous, married relationship but have children, then their fitness for office becomes a question of how they manage being a politician while taking care of their children, something that a male politician would rarely, if ever, be asked about.

Family duties and family forming cause significant delays in aspiring women's political careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jalaza |first1=Farida |title=Shattered, Cracked, or Family Intact?: Women and the Executive Glass Ceiling Worldwide |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780190602093 |page=17|chapter=Introduction|date=2016-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that female Republican candidates fare worse in elections than Republican men and Democratic women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bucchianeri|first=Peter|date=2017-05-22|title=Is Running Enough? Reconsidering the Conventional Wisdom about Women Candidates|journal=Political Behavior|volume=40|issue=2|language=en|pages=435–466|doi=10.1007/s11109-017-9407-7|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges within political parties===
In Canada, there is evidence that female politicians face gender stigma from male members of the political parties to which they belong which can undermine the ability of women to reach or maintain leadership roles. [[Pauline Marois]], leader of the [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ) and the official opposition of the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], was the subject of a claim by Claude Pinard, a PQ "[[backbencher]]", that many Quebecers do not support a female politician: "I believe that one of her serious handicaps is the fact she's a woman [...] I sincerely believe that a good segment of the population won't support her because she's a woman".&lt;ref name="Banerjee"&gt;{{cite news|last=Banerjee|first=Sidhartha|title=PQ woes prompt debate in Quebec about whether women get a fair deal in politics|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/pq-woes-prompt-debate-in-quebec-about-whether-women-get-a-fair-deal-in-politics-1.720302|accessdate=November 2, 2011|work=[[The Canadian Press]]|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2000 study that analyzed 1993 election results in Canada found that among "similarly situated women and men candidates", women actually had a small vote advantage. The study showed that neither voter turnout nor urban/rural constituencies were factors that help or hurt a female candidate, but "office-holding experience in non-political organizations made a modest contribution to women's electoral advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Black | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Erickson | first2 = Lynda | title = Women candidates and voter bias: do women politicians need to be better? | journal = [[Electoral Studies]] | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–100 | doi = 10.1016/S0261-3794(01)00028-2 | date = March 2003 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce M. Hicks, an electoral studies researcher at Université de Montréal, states that evidence shows that female candidates begin with a head start in voters' eyes of as much as 10 per cent, and that female candidates are often more favorably associated by voters with issues like health care and education.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"/&gt; The electorate's perception that female candidates have more proficiency with traditional women's spheres such as education and health care presents a possibility that gender stereotypes can work in a female candidate's favor, at least among the electorate. In politics, however, Hicks points out that sexism is nothing new:
{{blockquote|(Marois' issue) does reflect what has been going on for some time now: women in positions of authority have problems in terms of the way they manage authority [...] The problem isn't them, it's the men under them who resent taking direction from strong women. And the backroom dirty dialogue can come into the public eye.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"/&gt;}}

Within Quebec itself, Don McPherson pointed out that Pinard himself has enjoyed greater electoral success with Pauline Marois as party leader than under a previous male party leader, when Pinard failed to be elected in his riding. Demographically, Pinard's electoral riding is rural, with "relatively older, less-well educated voters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McPherson|first=Don|title=Pauline Marois's troubles aren't because of sexism| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120107020557/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Pauline+Marois+troubles+aren+because+sexism/5648719/story.html | archive-date = January 7, 2012|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/Pauline+Marois+troubles+aren+because+sexism/5648719/story.html|accessdate=November 13, 2011|work=[[Montreal Gazette]] | location = Canada|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's suffrage movement==
[[File:Suffragette parade. Grand Marshall, Mrs. Richard Burleson; Herald, Miss Inez Milholland.jpg|thumb|left|Suffragette demonstration, 1913, Washington, D.C.]]
{{Main|Women's suffrage movement}}
[[Women's suffrage]] is the right of women to vote in elections. Most countries enacted women's suffrage in the first half of the 20th century. New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote. On the 19th of September in 1893, New Zealand became the first country that allowed women the right to participate in elections. The change in the law was a result of a petition headed by Kate Shepherd on behalf of the Women's Temperance Union. The petition was signed by 32000 women, almost one in four of New Zealand women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/voting-rights/page-4|title=4. – Voting rights – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the last countries to enact it were [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]]. In Switzerland, women gained the [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland|right to vote]] in federal [[Elections in Switzerland|elections]] in 1971;&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |website=history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch | publisher = History of Switzerland |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title= Experts in women's anti-discrimination committee raise questions concerning reports of Switzerland on compliance with convention | date = 14 January 2003 |website=un.org | publisher = [[United Nations]] |accessdate=September 2, 2011}} Press release: Meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).&lt;/ref&gt; In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the [[1984 Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]].

==Mirror representation==

Women's participation in formal politics is lower than men's throughout the world.&lt;ref name=NandW1&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = The women's movement in Canada | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 88 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The argument put forth by scholars Jacquetta Newman and Linda White is that women's participation in the realm of high politics is crucial if the goal is to affect the quality of public policy. As such, the concept of ''mirror representation'' aims to achieve gender parity in public office. In other words, mirror representation says that the proportion of women in leadership should match the proportion of women in the population that they govern. Mirror representation is premised on the assumption that elected officials of a particular gender would likely support policies that seek to benefit constituents of the same gender.

=== Effects of mirror representation on public policy ===
A key critique is that mirror representation assumes that all members of a particular sex operate under the rubric of a shared identity, without taking into consideration other factors such as age, education, culture, or socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name="Pitkin 1967 61"&gt;{{Citation | last = Pitkin | first = Hannah F. | contribution = Formalistic views of representation | editor-last = Pitkin | editor-first = Hannah F. | title=The concept of representation |year=1967|publisher= University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|page=61 | isbn = 9780520021563 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of mirror representation argue that women have a different relationship with government institutions and public policy than that of men, and therefore merit equal representation on this facet alone. This feature is based on the historical reality that women, regardless of background, have largely been excluded from influential legislative and leadership positions. As Sylvia Bashevkin notes, "representative democracy seems impaired, partial, and unjust when women, as a majority of citizens, fail to see themselves reflected in the leadership of their polity."&lt;ref name="Bashevkin 2009 15"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bashevkin | first = Sylvia | contribution = Introduction | editor-last = Bashevkin | editor-first = Sylvia | title=Women, power, politics: the hidden story of Canada's unfinished democracy |year=2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|page=15 | isbn = 9780195431704 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the issue of participation of Women in politics is of such importance that the United Nations has identified gender equality in representation (i.e. mirror representation) as a goal in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]] and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Platform for Action]].&lt;ref name="NandW2"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = The women's movement in Canada | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 89 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides seeking equality, the goal of mirror representation is also to recognize the significance of women's involvement in politics, which subsequently legitimizes said involvement.

There have been differing results between studies that looked at the significance of women's representation on actual policy outcomes. Though women in the United States are more likely to identify as feminists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/feminism-project/poll/|title=What Americans think about feminism today|last=Cai|first=Weiyi|date=January 27, 2016|access-date=November 11, 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 2014 study looking in the United States finds "no effect of gender of the mayor on policy outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferreira | first1 = Fernando | last2 = Gyourko | first2 = Joseph | title = Does gender matter for political leadership?

===Social and cultural barriers to mirror representation===
Mirror representation stems from the barriers female political candidates often face, these include: sex stereotyping, political socialization, lack of preparation for political activity, and balancing work and family. In the media, women are often asked how they would balance the responsibilities of elected office with those to their families, something men are never asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Beaudoux García | first = Virginia | title = Five ways the media hurts female politicians — and how journalists everywhere can do better | url = https://theconversation.com/five-ways-the-media-hurts-female-politicians-and-how-journalists-everywhere-can-do-better-70771 | work = [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] | location = Melbourne, Australia | date = January 18, 2017 | access-date = January 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sex stereotyping'''. Sex stereotyping assumes that masculine and feminine traits are intertwined with leadership. Hence, the bias leveled against women stems from the perception that femininity inherently produces weak leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kittilson | first1 = Miki C. | last2 = Fridkin | first2 = Kim | title = Gender, candidate portrayals and election campaigns: a comparative perspective | journal = [[Politics and Gender]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | page = 373 | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X08000330 | date = September 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the aggressive and competitive nature of politics, many insist that participation in elected office requires masculine traits.&lt;ref name="MacIvor 1996 240"&gt;{{Citation | last = MacIvor | first = Heather | contribution = Women's participation in politics | editor-last = MacIvor | editor-first = Heather | title=Women and politics in Canada: an introductory text |year=1996|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Peterborough, Ontario|page=242 | isbn = 9781551110363 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sex stereotyping is far from being a historical narrative. The pressure is on female candidates (and not male ones) to enhance their masculine traits in order to garner support from voters who identify with socially constructed gender roles.{{citation needed|reason=the claim that women in politics are pressured to conform to masculine roles is one that should be supported with research|date=February 2016}}

'''Political socialization'''. Political socialization is the idea that, during childhood, people are indoctrinated into socially constructed norms of politics. In the case of women's representation in government, it says that sex stereotyping begins at an early age and affects the public's disposition on which genders are fit for public office. Socialization agents can include family, school, higher education, mass media, and religion.&lt;ref name="NandW3"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = Women's participation in formal politics | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 99 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these agents plays a pivotal role in either fostering a desire to enter politics, or dissuading one to do so.

Generally, girls tend to see politics as a "male domain".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gidengil | first1 = Elisabeth | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = Brenda | last3 = Young | first3 = Lisa | title = Her mother's daughter? The influence of childhood socialization on women's political engagement | journal = [[Journal of Women, Politics &amp; Policy]] | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | page = 334 | doi = 10.1080/1554477X.2010.533590 | date = 2010 | url = http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2008/Gidengil-O'Neill-Young.pdf | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman and White suggest that women who run for political office have been "socialized toward an interest in and life in politics" and that "many female politicians report being born into political families with weak gender-role norms."&lt;ref name="NandW4"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = Women's participation in formal politics | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 101 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women running for U.S senate are often underrepresented in news coverage. The way male and females are depicted in media has an effect of how female's candidates gets elected in to public office. Female candidates get treated differently in the media then their male counterparts in the U.S senate elections, Women receive less news coverage also the coverage they do receive concentrates more on their viability and less on their issue positions, causes female candidates to be overlooked and underrated during elections, which is an obstacle for women running for U.S senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahn|first=Kim Fridkin|last2=Goldenberg|first2=Edie N.|date=1991-01-01|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|language=en|volume=55|issue=2|pages=180–199|doi=10.1086/269251|issn=0033-362X|title=Women Candidates in the News: An Examination of Gender Differences in U.S. Senate Campaign Coverage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lack of preparation for political activity'''. An aftereffect of political socialization is that it determines how inclined women are to pursue careers that may be compatible with formal politics. Careers in law, business, education, and government, professions in which women happen to be minorities, are common occupations for those that later decide to enter public office.&lt;ref name=NandW4 /&gt;

'''Balancing work and family'''. The work life balance is invariably more difficult for women, because they are generally expected by society to act as the primary caregivers for children and maintainers of the home. Due to these demands, it is assumed that women would choose to delay political aspirations until their children are older. Also, a women's desire for a career in politics along with the extent that the respondent feels her family duties might inhibit her ability to be an elected official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elder|first1=Laurel|title=Why Women Don't Run|journal=Women &amp; Politics|date=21 September 2004|volume=26|issue=2|pages=27–56|doi=10.1300/J014v26n02_02|issn=0195-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that new female politicians in Canada and the U.S. are older than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=NandW5&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Jacquetta | last2 = White | first2 = Linda A. | contribution = Women's participation in formal politics | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Jacquetta | editor-last2 = White | editor-first2 = Linda A. | title = Women, politics, and public policy: the political struggles of Canadian women | page = 102 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780195432497 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a woman may be pushed to remain childless in order to seek political office.

Institutional barriers may also pose as a hindrance for balancing a political career and family. For instance, in Canada, Members of Parliament do not contribute to Employment Insurance; therefore, they are not entitled to paternity benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parliament of Canada|title=40th Parliament, 3rd Session|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4694765#TOC-TS-1150|work=October 18, 2010|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Such lack of parental leave would undoubtedly be a reason for women to delay seeking electoral office. Furthermore, mobility plays a crucial role in the work-family dynamic. Elected officials are usually required to commute long distances to and from their respective capital cities, which can be a deterrent for women seeking political office.

==Policies to increase women's participation==
The United Nations has identified six avenues by which female participation in politics and government may be strengthened. These avenues are: equalization of educational opportunities, quotas for female participation in governing bodies, legislative reform to increase focus on issues concerning women and children, financing gender-responsive budgets to equally take into account the needs of men and women, increasing the presence of sex-disaggregated statistics in national research/data, and furthering the presence and agency of grassroots women's [[empowerment]] movements.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

===Education===
Women with formal education (at any level) are more likely to delay marriage and subsequent childbirth, be better informed about infant and child nutrition, and ensure childhood immunization. Children of mothers with formal education are better nourished and have higher survival rates.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt; Education is a vital tool for any person in society to better themselves in their career path, and equalization of educational opportunities for boys and girls may take the form of several initiatives:

* abolishment of educational fees which would require parents to consider financial issues when deciding which of their children to educate. Poor children in rural areas are particularly affected by inequality resulting from educational fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = United Nations Children's Fund | last2 = World Bank | title = Building on what we know and defining sustained support | url = https://www.unicef.org/media/files/NAIROBI_AGENDA.pdf }} School Fee Abolition Initiative Workshop, organized by UNICEF and the World Bank, Nairobi, 5–7 April 2006, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* encouragement of parents and communities to institute gender-equal educational agendas. Perceived [[opportunity cost]] of educating girls may be addressed through a [[conditional cash transfer]] program which financially reward families who educate their daughters (thus removing the financial barrier that results from girls substituting school attendance for work in the family labor force).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bellamy | first = Carol | title = The state of the world's children, 2004: Girls' education And development | publisher = UNICEF | location = New York | year = 2003 | url = https://www.unicef.org/publications/index_18108.html | isbn = 9780756740214 }} [https://www.unicef.org/sowc04/files/SOWC_O4_eng.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*creation of "girl-friendly" schools to minimize bias and create a safe school environment for girls and young women. Currently, a barrier to female school attendance is the risk of [[sexual violence]] en route to school.&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"&gt;United Nations Children's Fund, The State of the World's Children 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A "safe school environment" is one in which the school is located to minimize such violence, in addition to providing girls with educational opportunities (as opposed to using female students to perform janitorial work or other menial labor).&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt;

Mark P. Jones, in reference to [[Pippa Norris|Norris's]] ''Legislative Recruitment'', states that: "Unlike other factors that have been identified as influencing the level of women's legislative representation, such as a country's political culture and level of economic development, institutional rules are relatively easy to change".&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = Mark P. | title = Gender quotas, electoral laws, and the election of women: lessons from the Argentine provinces | journal = [[Comparative Political Studies]] | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–21 | doi = 10.1177/0010414098031001001 | date = February 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article about the exclusion of Women from politics in southern Africa, Amanda Gouws said "The biggest hurdles to overcome for women are still on the local level where both men and women are often recruited from the communities and have limited political skills".&lt;ref name="Amanda"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gouws | first = Amanda | title = Changing women's exclusion from politics: examples from Southern Africa | journal = [[African and Asian Studies]] | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 537–563 | doi = 10.1163/156921008X359650 | date = 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of education in these local governments or, for that matter, the people in those positions of power, are substandard.

One example of the hurdles women face in receiving good education comes from Beijing. "Most women who attended the [[NGO]] Forums accompanying the [[UN]] conferences, which are for government delegations (though increasingly many governments include activists and [[NGO]] members among their official delegates), were middle-class educated women from [[INGO|INGOS]], donors, academics, and activists".&lt;ref name="Manisha"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Desai | first = Manisha | title = Transnationalism: the face of feminist politics post-Beijing | journal = International Social Science Journal | volume = 57 | issue = 184 | pages = 319–330 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2451.2005.553.x | date = June 2005 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lydia Kompe, a well-known South African activist, was one of these rural women. She noted that she felt overwhelmed and completely disempowered. In the beginning, she did not think she could finish her term of office because of her lack of education.&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt; Manisha Desai explains that: "There is an inequality simply around the fact that the [[UN]] system and its locations say a lot about the current focus of those systems, such positions being in the US and Western Europe allow easier access to those women in the area.&lt;ref name="Manisha" /&gt; It is also important to note that institutions affect the cultural propensity to elect women candidates in different ways in different parts of the world."&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

The study of the history of women's representation has been a major contribution in helping scholars view such concepts. [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] states: "historical experience often leads to gender advancement, and political liberalization enables women to mobilize within the public sphere".&lt;ref name="Andrew"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Reynolds | first = Andrew | author-link = Andrew Reynolds (political scientist) | title = Women in the legislatures and executives of the world: knocking at the highest glass ceiling | journal = [[World Politics]] | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 547–572 | doi = 10.1017/S0043887100009254 | date = July 1999 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that we will see a larger number of women in higher office positions in established democracy than in democracies that are developing, and "the more illiberal a state is, the fewer women will be in positions of power".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;  As countries open education systems to women, and more women participate in historically male dominated fields, it is possible to see a shift in political views regarding women in government.

===Quotas===
{{further2|[[All-women shortlists]], a UK policy for electoral gender-parity}}

[[File:TRS ballot papers.svg|thumb|Example of a TRS ballot papers]]
Quotas are explicit requirements on the number of women in political positions.&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt; "Gender quotas for the election of legislators have been used since the late 1970s by a few political parties (via the party charter) in a small number of advanced industrial democracies; such examples would be like [[Germany]] and [[Norway]]".&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; [[Andrew Reynolds (political scientist)|Andrew Reynolds]] says there is "an increasing practice in legislatures for the state, or the parties themselves, to utilize formal or informal quota mechanisms to promote women as candidates and [[Member of Parliament|MPs]]".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;  The statistics surrounding quota systems have been examined thoroughly by academia.

Types of quotas include:&lt;ref name="Fund 2004" /&gt;
* Sex quota systems: institute a "critical value" below which is deemed an imbalanced government. Examples of such critical values include 20% of legislators, 50%{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} of politicians, etc.
* Legal quota systems regulate the governance of political parties and bodies. Such quotas may be mandated by electoral law (as the [[Argentine quota law]], for example) or may be constitutionally required (as in Nepal).
* Voluntary party quota systems may be used by [[political parties]] at will, yet are not mandated by electoral law or by a country's constitution. If a country's leading or majority political party engages in a voluntary party quota system, the effect may "trickle down" to minority political parties in the country (as in the case of the African National Congress in South Africa).
Quotas may be utilized during different stages of the political nomination/selection process to address different junctures at which women may be inherently disadvantaged:&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt;
* Potential candidacy: sex quota systems can mandate that from the pool of aspirants, a certain percentage of them must be female.
* Nomination: legal or voluntary quotas are enforced upon this stage, during which a certain portion of nominated candidates on the party's ballot must be female.
* Election: "reserved seats" may be filled only by women.
Quota usage can have marked effects on female representation in governance. In 1995, Rwanda ranked 24th in terms of female representation, and jumped to 1st in 2003 after quotas were introduced. Similar effects can be seen in Argentina, Iraq, Burundi, Mozambique, and South Africa, for example.&lt;ref name="Fund 2004"/&gt; Of the top-ranked 20 countries in terms of female representation in government, 17 of these countries utilize some sort of quota system to ensure female inclusion. Though such inclusion is mainly instituted at the national level, there have been efforts in India to addresses female inclusion at the subnational level, through quotas for parliamentary positions.&lt;ref name="IPU_class"&gt;''See'':

With quotas drastically changing the number of female representatives in political power, a bigger picture unravels. Though countries are entitled to regulate their own laws, the quota system helps explain social and cultural institutions and their understandings and overall view of women in general. "At first glance, these shifts seem to coincide with the adoption of candidate gender quotas around the globe as quotas have appeared in countries in all major world regions with a broad range of institutional, social, economic and cultural characteristics".&lt;ref name="6Krook"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krook | first = Mona Lena | title = Reforming representation: the diffusion of candidate gender quotas worldwide | journal = [[Politics &amp; Gender]] | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–327 | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X06060107 | date = September 2006 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quotas have been quite useful in allowing women to gain support and opportunities when attempting to achieve seats of power, but some see this as a wrongdoing. [[Drude Dahlerup]] and Lenita Freidenvall argue this in their article "Quotas as a 'Fast Track' to Equal Representation for Women" by stating: "From a liberal perspective, quotas as a specific group right conflict with the principle of equal opportunity for all. Explicitly favoring certain groups of citizens, i.e. women, means that not all citizens (men) are given an equal chance to attain a political career".&lt;ref name=5Dahlerup&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dahlerup | first1 = Drude | last2 = Freidenvall | first2 = Lenita | title = Quotas as a "fast track" to equal political representation for women: why Scandinavia is no longer the model | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–48 | doi = 10.1080/1461674042000324673 | date = 2005 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahlerup and Freidenvall claim that even though quotas create theoretical imbalance in opportunity for men and that they necessarily break the concept of "classical liberal notion of equality",&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt; quotas are almost required to bring the relation of women in politics to a higher state, whether that is through equal opportunity or just equal results.&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt; "According to this understanding of women's under-representation, mandated quotas for the recruitment and election of female candidates, possibly also including time-limit provisions, are needed".&lt;ref name="5Dahlerup" /&gt;

The introduction of gender quotas in the electoral process has spurred controversy from male politicians, resulting in resistance to the acceptance of quotas in the political realm.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Politics, Groups, and Identities|last=Krook|first=Mona|title=Contesting gender quotas: dynamics of resistance|volume=4|issue=2|pages=268–283|date=2016|doi=10.1080/21565503.2016.1151797}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mobilization of women in politics has been hindered by means of preserving male political survival, and to avoid political interference with male power and domination.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Moreover, the implementation of gender quotas has caused the male candidate population to decrease in order for their female counterparts to participate, and this is commonly referred to as the “negative sum,” and this can result in a more qualified male being rejected to allow a female politician to participate.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt; Furthermore, in the case of Argentina, which is currently mandated for a 30% female party at each level of government, saw the introduction of the 'quota women'; females that were less experienced, and only elected due to the legal requirement of quotas.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"&gt;Franceschet, Susan, and Jennifer M. Piscopo. “Gender Quotas and Women's Substantive Representation: Lessons from Argentina.” Politics &amp;Amp; Gender, vol. 4, no. 3, 2008, pp. 393–425., doi:10.1017/S1743923X08000342.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the 'quota women' has triggered what political scientists refer to as a 'mandate effect,' where quota women feel obligated to represent solely the interests of the female public.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Moreover, in order to preserve male political survival, “domination techniques” have been utilized to both exclude and delegitimize female representation in politics, and this can be depicted in the case of Argentina, where it took several elections to gain 35% of female representatives.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; With the increase of female representation in Argentina, issues that were rarely discussed before became paramount in debates, such as “penal laws, sexual assault laws, and laws on maternity leave and pregnancy… sexual education, [and] emergency contraceptive.”

Substantive representation contains two distinct parts: both the process and outcome of having female politicians.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Substantive representation based on the process is concerned with the gendered perspective, themes that female representatives discuss in political debates, and the impact they have on the creation of bills.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Likewise, this process also includes the networking between women in government and female organizations.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Substantive representation by outcome relates to the success of passing legislation that enables gender equality to both public and private issues.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Moreover, substantive representation as process does not always result in substantive representation by outcome; the implementation of gender quotas and female representation does not directly instigate an influx in legislation.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt;

Critical mass theory has correlations with both substantive representation as process and substantive representation as outcome. Critical mass theory suggests that once a certain percentage of women representatives has been reached, that female legislators will be able to create and enable transformative policies, and this has the potential to place pressure on quota women to act on behalf of all women.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; One paramount criticism of critical mass theory is its attention to numbers, and the understanding that quota women are to represent women collectively.&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt; Furthermore, the representation of women as a collective group remains controversial, as “[if] she is a white straight, middle-class mother, she cannot speak for African-American women, or poor women, or lesbian women on the basis of her own experience anymore than men can speak for women merely on the basis of theirs.”&lt;ref name="Franceschet, Susan 2008, pp. 393"/&gt;

A 2018 study in ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'' found that the implementation of electoral gender quotas which substantially increased women's representation in parliament led to increased government expenditures toward public health and relative decreases in military spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clayton|first=Amanda|last2=Zetterberg|first2=Pär|date=2018-05-10|title=Quota Shocks: Electoral Gender Quotas and Government Spending Priorities Worldwide|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=80|issue=3|language=en|pages=916–932|doi=10.1086/697251|issn=0022-3816|url=http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1246248/FULLTEXT01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
There have been numerous occasions where equal legislation has benefited the overall progression of women equality on a global scale. Though women have entered legislation, the overall representation within higher ranks of government is not being established. "Looking at ministerial positions broken down by portfolio allocation, one sees a worldwide tendency to place women in the softer [[sociocultural]] ministerial positions rather than in the harder and politically more prestigious positions of economic planning, national security, and foreign affairs, which are often seen as stepping-stones to national leader ship".&lt;ref name="Andrew" /&gt;

Legislative agendas, some pushed by female political figures, may focus on several key issues to address ongoing gender disparities:
* Reducing domestic and gender-based violence. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, published by the United Nations in 1989, addressed home violence and its effects on children. The Convention stipulates that children are holders of human rights, and authorizes the State to 1) prevent all forms of violence, and 2) respond to past violence effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = United Nations | title = Report of the independent expert for the United Nations study on violence against children – UN A/61/150 and Corr. 1 (provisional version) | url = https://disarmament-library.un.org/UNODA/Library.nsf/f860ad0cf3d61a518525711f006bb390/bba1dc9d335cbb1d852571b5005188c7/$FILE/agenda61.150.pdf | publisher = United Nations | location = New York | date = 23 August 2005 }}

It calls for "all parties of armed conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = United Nations | title =  Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000), para. 10, adopted by the Security Council at its 4213th meeting | url = https://www.un.org/press/en/2000/20001031.sc6942.doc.html | publisher = United Nations | location = New York | date = 31 October 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reducing in-home discrimination through equalizing [[property]] and [[inheritance]]  rights. National legislation can supersede traditionally male-dominated inheritance models. Such legislation has been proven effective in countries like Colombia, where 60% of land is held in joint titles between men and women (compared to 18% before the passage of joint titling legislation in 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mason | first1 = Andrew D. | last2 = King | first2 = Elizabeth M. | contribution = Social norms, laws, and economic institutions: rights and laws (land rights) | editor-last1 = Mason | editor-first1 = Andrew D. | editor-last2 = King | editor-first2 = Elizabeth M. | title = Engendering development through gender equality in rights, resources, and voice: A World Bank policy research report | url = https://archive.org/details/engenderingdevel0000worl | page = 120 | publisher = World Bank and Oxford University Press | location = Washington DC | date = January 2001 | isbn = 9780195215960 | contribution-url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PGLP/Resources/Engendering_Development.pdf | url-access = registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===
Sex-responsive budgets address the needs and interests of different individuals and social groups, maintaining awareness of sexual equality issues within the formation of policies and budgets. Such budgets are not necessarily a 50–50 male-female split, but accurately reflect the needs of each sex (such as increased allocation for women's reproductive health.&lt;ref name="United Nations Development Programme 2005"&gt;{{cite web | last =United Nations | title = Gender-responsive budgeting: manual for trainers | url = http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction/focus_areas/focus_gender_and_poverty/gender-responsiveplanningandbudgeting.html | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = Bratislava | year = 2005 }} [https://www.ndi.org/sites/default/files/Gender%20Responsive%20Budgeting%20Trainers%20Manual.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits of gender-responsive budgets include:
* Improved budget efficiency by ensuring that funds are allocated where they are needed most
* Strengthened government position by advocating for needs of all, including the poor and the underrepresented rights
* Increased information flow surrounding needs of those who are usually discriminated against
A sex-responsive budget may also work to address issues of unpaid care work and caring labor gaps.&lt;ref name="United Nations Development Programme 2005"/&gt;

===Research/data improvements===
Current research which uses sex-aggregated statistics may underplay or minimize the quantitative presentation of issues such as maternal mortality, violence against women, and girls' school attendance.&lt;ref name="unicef.org" /&gt; Sex-disaggregated statistics are lacking in the assessment of maternal mortality rates, for example. Prior to [[UNICEF]] and [[UNIFEM]] efforts to gather more accurate and comprehensive data, 62 countries had no recent national data available regarding maternal mortality rates.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006"&gt;{{citation | last = United Nations | contribution = Chapter 2: Health | editor-last = United Nations | title = The world's women 2005: progress in statistics | page = 26 | publisher = [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] | location = New York | year = 2006 | url = https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/indwm/wwpub.htm | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/indwm/ww2005_pub/English/WW2005_chpt_2_Health_BW.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Only 38 countries have sex-disaggregated statistics available to report frequency of violence against women.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006" /&gt; 41 countries collect sex-disaggregated data on school attendance, while 52 countries assess sex-disaggregated wage statistics.&lt;ref name="United Nations 2006"/&gt;

Though the representation has become a much larger picture, it is important to notice the inclination of political activity emphasizing women over the years in different countries. "Although women's representation in [[Latin America]], [[Africa]], and [[Western culture|the West]] progressed slowly until 1995, in the most recent decade, these regions show substantial growth, doubling their previous percentage".&lt;ref name="Paxton" /&gt;

Researching politics on a global scale does not just reinvent ideas of politics, especially towards women, but brings about numerous concepts. Sheri Kunovich and Pamela Paxton research method, for example, took a different path by studying "cross-national" implications to politics, taking numerous countries into consideration. This approach helps identify research beforehand that could be helpful in figuring out commodities within countries and bringing about those important factors when considering the overall representation of women. "At the same time, we include information about the inclusion of women in the political parties of each country".&lt;ref name="Kunovich" /&gt; Research within gender and politics has taken a major step towards a better understanding of what needs to be better studied. Dr. Mona L. Krook states: These kinds of studies help establish that generalizing countries together is far too limiting to the overall case that we see across countries and that we can take the information we gain from these studies that look at countries separately and pose new theories as to why countries have the concepts they do; this helps open new reasons and thus confirms that studies need to be performed over a much larger group of factors.&lt;ref name=7Krook&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Krook | first = Mona Lena | title = Candidate gender quotas: a framework for analysis | journal = [[European Journal of Political Research]] | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 367–394 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6765.2007.00704.x | date = May 2007 | url = http://www.mlkrook.org/pdf/ejpr_07.pdf | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors and researchers such as Mala Htun and Laurel Weldon also state that single comparisons of established and developed countries is simply not enough but is also surprisingly hurtful to the progress of this research, they argue that focusing on a specific country "tends to duplicate rather than interrogate" the overall accusations and concepts we understand when comparing political fields.&lt;ref name=Htun&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Htun | first1 = Mala | last2 = Weldon | first2 = S. Laurel | title = When do governments promote women's rights?

* Modified version also [http://thedemocracypapers.ssrc.org/the-politics-of-policies-to-promote-gender-justice/ available online].&lt;/ref&gt; They continue by explaining that comparative politics has not established sex equality as a major topic of discussion among countries.&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; This research challenges the current standings as to what needs to be the major focus in order to understand gender in politics.

A 2018 study in the ''American Economic Journal: Economic Policy'' found that for German local elections "female council candidates advance more from their initial list rank when the mayor is female. This effect spreads to neighboring municipalities and leads to a rising share of female council members."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baskaran|first=Thushyanthan|last2=Hessami|first2=Zohal|date=August 2018|title=Does the Election of a Female Leader Clear the Way for More Women in Politics?|journal=American Economic Journal: Economic Policy|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=95–121|doi=10.1257/pol.20170045|issn=1945-7731|url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/wiwi/workingpaperseries/WP_09_Baskaran_Hessami_2017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grassroots women's empowerment movements===
[[File:The lady in the case.jpg|thumb|The lady in the case, an example of how some have interpreted women's involvement in government]]
Women's informal collectives are crucial to improving the standard of living for women worldwide. Collectives can address such issues as nutrition, education, shelter, food distribution, and generally improved standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = McNulty | first = Stephanie | title = Women's organizations during and after war: from service delivery to policy advocacy | page = 3 | publisher = Center for Development Information and Evaluation, [[United States Agency for International Development|US Agency for International Aid]] | location = Washington, DC | date = 2 October 1998 | url = http://genderandsecurity.org/projects-resources/research/womens-organizations-during-and-after-war-service-delivery-policy| citeseerx= 10.1.1.511.2415 | ref = harv }} Document ref: PN-ACD-336. [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.511.2415&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Empowering such collectives can increase their reach to the women most in need of support and empowerment. Though women's movements have a very successful outcome with the emphasis on gaining equality towards women, other movements are taking different approaches to the issue. Women in certain countries, instead of approaching the demands as representation of women as "a particular interest group", have approached the issue on the basis of the "[[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] of sex differences and the relation to the nation".&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; Htun and Weldon also bring up the point of democracy and its effects on the level of equality it brings. In their article, they explain that a democratic country is more likely to listen to "[[autonomous]] organizing" within the government. Women's movements would benefit from this the most or has had great influence and impact because of [[democracy]], though it can become a very complex system.&lt;ref name="Htun" /&gt; When it comes to local government issues, political standings for women are not necessarily looked upon as a major issue. "Even civil society organizations left women's issues off the agenda. At this level, traditional leaders also have a vested interest that generally opposes women's interests".&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt; Theorists believe that having a setback in government policies would be seen as catastrophic to the overall progress of women in government. Amanda Gouws says that "The instability of democratic or nominally democratic [[regimes]] makes women's political gains very vulnerable because these gains can be easily rolled back when regimes change. The failure to make the private sphere part of political contestation diminishes the power of formal democratic rights and limits solutions to gender inequality".&lt;ref name="Amanda" /&gt;

In 1902, [[Australia]] became the first country to give some women the vote and allow them to stand for Parliament. This did not apply to [[Aboriginal Australians]], including women, until the amendment of the [[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918|Electoral Act]] in 1962. It wasn't until 1983 that Indigenous people had voting rights entirely equal to white Australians when another amendment made enrollment to vote compulsory, rather than voluntary.&lt;ref name="No. 3 - Women in the Senate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief03|title=No. 3 – Women in the Senate|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 years after the [[Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902|Commonwealth Franchise Act]] was passed, [[Edith Cowan]] was elected to Legislative Assembly and became the first woman ever elected in any Australian Parliament.

As of May 2018, women comprise approximately 38% of senators and occupy 44 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives. In the current [[45th Parliament of Australia|45th Parliament]], the ALP exceeds their 40% quota and is made up of 44% women and the LNP 21%.&lt;ref name="No. 3 - Women in the Senate"/&gt; At January 1, 2017, Australia was ranked 52 out of 175 countries in terms of women in ministerial positions and 50th out of 190 countries in terms of women in the lower house of Parliament. The report issued by [[UN Women]] found 24.1% of, or 7 out of the 29 Australian ministers were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/-/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2017/femmesenpolitique_2017_english_web.pdf?la=en&amp;vs=1123|title=Women in Politics: 2017|website=UN Women}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2007 was a notable year for women in Australian Parliament. [[Anna Bligh]] became Queensland's first female premier, a position she occupies for five years, and [[Julia Gillard]] MP becomes Deputy Prime Minister. Three years later, Gillard is elected as Australia's first female prime minister. [[Quentin Bryce|Dame Quentin Bryce]] became the first and only woman appointed to [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], a position that is representative of the Monarch, in 2008 and served until 2014.

Indigenous people, women in particular, are grossly underrepresented in Australian Parliament. Since [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, there have been 40 Indigenous Australians involved in any Parliament (sixteen women) and eight in the Federal Parliament (four women).

In [[History of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], placing women in government has progressed better than in other [[Islamic countries]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Universal suffrage was introduced in [[Azerbaijan]] in 1918 by the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], thus making Azerbaijan the first [[Muslim-majority countries]] and Turk-majority countries ever to enfranchise women. Now, 28 women are members in the [[Azerbaijan Parliament]] ([[Milli Məclis]]). As of 2015, there were 21 women in the 125-seat parliament. The percentage of female members of parliament increased from 11 to 17 percent between 2005 and 2015. Traditional social norms and lagging economic development in the country's rural regions continued to restrict the role of women in the economy, and there were reports that women had difficulty exercising their legal rights due to gender discrimination. As of May 2009, women held the positions of Deputy Chairman of the Constitutional Court, Deputy Chairman of the Nakhchivan AR Cabinet of Ministers, four Deputy Ministers, an Ambassador, and Ombudsmen of [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] AR. Women constituted 4 of the 16 members of the Central Election Commission and chaired of 3 of the 125 district election commissions. Some famous female managers in historical [[Azerbaijan]] territories mentioned below:
* [[Tomyris]] – antic women leader of [[Scythians]], was born in near of [[Araks River]]
* [[Amytis of Media]] –  the daughter [[Median]] king [[Cyaxares]], and the wife of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]].
* [[Sparama]] – most important person of [[Caucasian Albania]] (for 9th century)

===Brazil===
A 1995 Brazilian gender quota was extended first to city councilor positions in 1996, then extended to candidates of all political legislative positions by 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sacchet | first = Teresa | title = Beyond numbers: the impact of gender quotas in Latin America | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 369–386 | doi = 10.1080/14616740802185700 | date = 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998, 30% of political candidates had to be women, with varied results in terms of the gender balance of the officials ultimately elected. Though the percentage of national legislature seats occupied by women dropped in the initial years following the passage of the quota law, the percentage has since risen (from 6.2% pre-quota, to 5.7% in 1998, to 8.9% in 2006). However, Brazil has struggled with the quota law in several respects:
* Though the quota law mandates a certain percentage of candidate spots be reserved for women, it is not compulsory that those spots be filled by women.
* The quota law also allowed political parties to increase the number of candidates, further increasing electoral competition and having a negligible impact on the actual number of women elected.

=== China ===
China's stipulation for gender equality in the political sphere started on as early as recorded in its 1954 Constitution, in which the PRC government stated that men and women enjoy equal rights in the aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family dimensions, especially highlighting legitimate voting right and the right to be elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Xiajuan|date=January 2008|title=The rise of affirmative action|url=https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/iaps/documents/cpi/briefings/briefing-34-women-political-participation.pdf|journal=Women's Political Participation in China|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another State document – Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Woman – also outlined an official requirement of 'appropriate number of women deputies', combined with the State's obligations to 'gradually increase the proportion of the women deputies' and 'actively trains and selects female cadres' in fundamental national institutions and political organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/government/207405.htm|title=Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=www.china.org.cn|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; For decades that follow, China has been making revision to its constitutional laws and State announcements to give recognition to women's role in the domain of governance. An example of which is the proclamation issued on the 5th meeting session of the 10th National People's Congress (NPC) necessitating that 'the proportion of women delegates to be elected to the 11th People's Congress should be no less than 20%'.

[[File:港府執意推進《逃犯條例》修法民陣謹慎動員民眾抗爭1 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Carrie Lam]], [[Chief executive of Hong Kong]]]]
However, regardless of the proper representation of women's political eligibility across multiple government declarations, the political system in China remains overwhelmingly male-dominated which in turns drives the low engagement rate of women delegates. Despite the new 13th NPC lineup with a composition of 742 women out of 2,980 representatives, which amounts to 24.9% penetration with 1.5 points increase as opposed to the former term,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-02/24/c_136997333.htm|title=More women, fewer officials on China's top legislature – Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn|website=www.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is mere presence of women in the central power structure in major government organs and their political influences are vastly diminished as they climb up the political ladder. Justifications of the above statement include the fact that only 33 women (9%) are recorded to have a seat at the table of Central Committee for the election of members into the Politburo, a key cornerstone for the approval all national affairs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41652487|title=Reality Check: Are women welcome in Chinese politics?|date=2017-10-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, except for the two consecutive office in 1973 and 1977, the Central Committee has never witnessed over 10% of women engagement in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZQMtDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=-+With+the+exception+of+the+10th+Party+Congress+in+1973+and+the+11th+Party+Congress+in+1977,+women+have+never+made+up+more+than+10+percent+of+the+total+membership+of+the+Central+Committee.#v=onepage&amp;q=-%20With%20the%20exception%20of%20the%2010th%20Party%20Congress%20in%201973%20and%20the%2011th%20Party%20Congress%20in%201977,%20women%20have%20never%20made%20up%20more%20than%2010%20percent%20of%20the%20total%20membership%20of%20the%20Central%20Committee.&amp;f=false|title=Young China: How the Restless Generation Will Change Their Country and the World|last=Dychtwald|first=Zak|date=2018-02-13|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9781466891333|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the above figure is the decline in the 25-member Politburo from two women down to one. In addition, the recent reappointment of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, has sparked controversy on the unbroken record of no-women Politburo Standing Committee and absence of female top leaders in any legislature in China's political history, apart from the exceptions of Vice Premier, Liu Yandong and Vice Foreign Minister, Fu Ying. The public has been compelled to draw parallel with Hong Kong and Taiwan where female presidents – Carrie Lam and Tsai Ing-wen – took office in 2018 and 2016 respectively.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/22/asia/china-female-leaders/index.html|title=Why China has so few female leaders|last=CNN|first=Yazhou Sun|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The male-heavy politics amidst the favorable women's right protection in China can be examined from the following underlying causes:

''(1) Deprivation of upward mobility''

While the implied prerequisite of national appointment is years of experience serving at middle-to-top management, women in the PRC government often struggle to obtain promotion to high-ranked positions, such as party secretary or principal governor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The reason contributing to the captioned phenomenon is gender division of labor across all levels of political structures. Contrary to Mao Zedong's saying that 'Women hold up half of the sky', Confucians principles' deeply ingrained advocacy “nan zhu wai, nu zhu nei” (men working on the outside, women's place remains on the inside) has shaped gender division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feng|first=Xianghong|date=2013-07-01|title=Women's Work, Men's Work: Gender and Tourism among the Miao in Rural China|journal=Anthropology of Work Review|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=2–14|doi=10.1111/awr.12002|issn=1548-1417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being assigned highly gender-biased responsibilities within the spectrum of 'women affairs', such as family planning that are reproduction-oriented or with connection to social construction, women's public role and scope of duty are framed under constraints. Women are, at the same time, missing the opportunities to keep a foothold in strategic national affairs, including but not limited to economic development, military planning and diplomatic involvement. The mentioned dilemma is reflected by an actual example in Ning Xiang County, Hunan Province. Women commonly maintain highest authority as Head in women-related bodies, administering concerns on women's unfair treatments and suggesting for children's health development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=Jude|date=January 2008|title=The representation of women in rural politics|url=|journal=Women's Political Participation in China: In Whose Interests Elections?|volume=|pages=|via=Journal of Contemporary China}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, the gendered portfolio gives rise to empowerment of male in the political hierarchal. Consequently, with the lack of exposure to the exemplary official posts and the exclusive offering of key national assignments for men, women's upward mobility is aggravated, resulting in the substantially dwindling likelihood of taking residence in key leading positions.

''(2) Biased retirement precondition prejudicing against women''

In China, there is an apparent discrepancy in the mandatory retirement age between men and women, in which men are entitled to enjoy 10 more years of work. This policy was established on the ground that women are primary and central support for domestic subjects and their early retirement (at the age of 50–55) would be beneficial to their overall family functioning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This discriminatory policy mirrors the cause in the previous part, in which the working capacity of women is restricted by the society's stereotype on their gender role and corresponding gender responsibilities. In addition, the average age of Chinese chief in Central Committee is 56.1 years old; Top leaders in Politburo were appointed at an average age of 61.1 years old; Whereas Standing Committee of Politburo has the highest average age of 63.4 for its office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jinghan|first=Zeng|year=2014|title=Institutionalization of the authoritarian leadership in China: a power succession system with Chinese characteristics?|journal=[[Contemporary Politics]]|volume=20|issue=3|pages=294–314|doi=10.1080/13569775.2014.911502|via=[[ResearchGate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; All figures being examined, the aggregated average age of appointed leaders exceeds the legal retirement age of women in the nation, meaning that women are least likely to become the center of power before their career come to an end.

(3) ''Anti-feminism''

While in foreign countries, women's socio-economic status is uplifted and gender division of labor is largely wiped out by feminist movements to open up the availability and variety of work for women, the conservative and politically-sensitive Chinese government's censorship on feminism within the country has spread fear among feminism advocates. An illustrative case of which is the backlash of 'Feminist Five' in China. The activists suffered from interrogation, detention and month-long imprisonment due to the distribution of stickers on Beijing subways for drawing the wider community's awareness to sexual harassment against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/08/feminist-stickers-china-backash-women-activists|title=I went to jail for handing out feminist stickers in China {{!}} Li Maizi|last=Maizi|first=Li|date=2017-03-08|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followed by the forced suspension of Weibo account 'Feminist Voices' due to the government's tightened censorship, feminist encountered escalated obstacles in promoting gender equality. Feminist movements are yet to achieve their goals.

===Finland===
The Finnish national quota law, introduced in 1995, mandates that among all indirectly elected public bodies (at both a national and a local level), neither sex in the governing body can be under 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Holli | first1 = Anne Maria | last2 = Luhtakallio | first2 = Eeva | last3 = Raevaara | first3 = Eeva | title = Quota trouble: talking about gender quotas in Finnish local politics | journal = [[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–193 | doi = 10.1080/14616740600612822 | date = June 2006 | url = http://blogs.helsinki.fi/holli/files/2013/05/RFJP1612641.pdf  | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 laws was a reformed version of a similar 1986 law. Unlike other countries' quota laws, which affect party structure or electoral candidate lists, the Finnish law addresses indirectly elected bodies (nominated by official authorities)—the law does not address popularly elected bodies. The Finnish law heavily emphasizes local municipal boards and other subnational institutions. From 1993 (pre-quota law) to 1997 (post-quota law), the proportion of women on municipal executive boards increased from 25% to 45%. The quota law also affected gender segregation in local governance: before the passage of the law, there had been a gender imbalance in terms of female overrepresentation in "soft-sector" boards (those concerned with health, education, etc.) and female "underrepresentation" in "hard-sector" boards (those concerned with economics and technology). In 1997, the boards were balanced horizontally. However, areas not subject to quota laws continue to be imbalanced. In 2003, it was determined that only 16% of the chairs of municipal executive boards are female—chair positions in this area are not quota-regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pikkala | first = Sari | title = Representations of women in Finnish local government: effects of the 1995 gender quota legislation | year = 2000 }} Paper presented at the European Consortium on Political Research Joint Sessions of Workshops, Copenhagen, 14–19 April.
&lt;/ref&gt; Presidential elections were held in Finland on 16 January 2000, with a second round on 6 February;&lt;ref name=DN&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Nohlen | editor-first1 = Dieter | editor-last2 = Stöver | editor-first2 = Philip | editor-link1 = Dieter Nohlen | title = Elections in Europe: a data handbook | page = 606 | publisher = Nomos | location = Baden-Baden, Germany | year = 2010 | isbn = 9783832956097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the result was a victory for [[Tarja Halonen]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]], who became the country's first female President.

===Germany===
	The gender quotas implemented across parties in Germany in the 1990s serve as a natural experiment for the effect of sub-national party political gender quotas on women participation. Davidson-Schmich (2006) notes, "the German case provides the variance needed to explain the successful (or failed) implementation of these political party quotas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Davidson-Schmich | first = Louise K. | title = Implementation of political party gender quotas: evidence from the German Länder 1990–2000 | journal = [[Party Politics]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 211–232 | doi = 10.1177/1354068806061338 | date = March 2006 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.564.1797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's sixteen state legislatures, the Länder, feature a variety of party systems and varied numbers of potential female candidates. Germany is rated highly in its gender gap, but is an example of a developed country with a low percentage of female leadership in politics.
	Davidson-Schmich's study shows that there are many factors that influence how effective a political quota for women will be. Because Germany's quotas cover culturally diverse areas, Davidson-Schmich was able to see which cities best responded to the increase in women running for office. In her bivariate study, the quota was more successful when the city had a PR electoral system, when more women held inner-party and local political offices, and when there were more women in state-level executive offices. The quota was less successful in rural areas, areas with a large number of Catholic voters, electoral systems with a preferential system, in extremely competitive party systems, and with greater rates of legislative turnover. In her multivariate study of these regions, however, Davidson-Schmich narrowed these factors down even further to the most significant variables of: Catholicism and agricultural economics (Davidson-Schmich, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;228). This is very intriguing, and as she explains, "the success of voluntary gender quotas in the German states hinged not on the political structure of these Lander, but rather the willingness of within the system to act on the opportunities inherent in these structures" (Davidson-Schmich, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;228). Social factors and inherent gender discrimination are more important in the success of a female political quota than the structure of the quota itself.

In an effort to increase women's participation in politics in India, a 1993 constitutional amendment mandated that a randomly selected third of leadership positions at every level of local government be reserved for women.&lt;ref name="Raising Female Leaders"&gt;{{cite book | last = J-PAL | author-link = Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab | title = Raising female leaders | publisher = [[Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab|J-PAL Policy Briefcase]] | date = April 2012 | url = http://www.povertyactionlab.org/publication/raising-female-leaders }}&lt;/ref&gt; These political reservation quotas randomly choose one third of cities to implement a women-only election.&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bhavnani | first = Rikhil R. | title = Do electoral quotas work after they are withdrawn?

Due to the randomized selection of cities who must enforce the reservation for women each election year, some cities have implemented the quota multiple times, once or never. This addresses the political discrimination of women at various levels: parties are forced to give women the opportunity to run, the women candidates are not disadvantaged by a male incumbent or general biases for male over female leadership, and the pool of women candidates is increased because of the guaranteed opportunity for female participation.&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009" /&gt;  The effects of the quota system in India have been studied by various researchers.  In Mumbai, it was found that the probability of a women winning office conditional on the constituency being reserved for women in the previous election is approximately five times the probability of a women winning office if the constituency had not been reserved for women".&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009"/&gt;  Furthermore, that even when the mandates are withdrawn, women were still able to keep their positions of leadership. Given the opportunity to get a party ticket, create a platform and obtain the experience to run for a political position, women are much more likely to be able to overcome these hurdles in the future, even without the quota system in place.&lt;ref name="Bhavnani, Rikhil 2009"/&gt; The quota system has also affected policy choices. Research in West Bengal and Rajasthan has indicated that reservation affected policy choices in ways that seem to better reflect women's preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chattopadhyay | first1 = Raghabendra | last2 = Duflo | first2 = Esther | title = Women as policy makers: evidence from a randomized policy experiment in India | journal = [[Econometrica]] | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 1409–1443 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00539.x | jstor = 3598894 | date = September 2004 | url = http://economics.mit.edu/files/792 | ref = harv | hdl = 1721.1/39126 }}

However, while reservation did not make male villagers more sympathetic to the idea of female leaders, it caused them to recognize that women could lead. Moreover, the reservation policy significantly improved women's prospects in elections open to both sexes, but only after two rounds of reservation within the same village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beaman | first1 = Lori | last2 = Chattopadhyay | first2 = Raghabendra | last3 = Duflo | first3 = Esther | last4 = Pande | first4 = Rohini | last5 = Topalova | first5 = Petia | title = Powerful women: does exposure reduce bias? | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 124 | issue = 4 | pages = 1497–1540 | doi = 10.1162/qjec.2009.124.4.1497 | date = November 2009  | url = http://economics.mit.edu/files/3122 | ref = harv | hdl = 1721.1/64150 }}

Japan ranks 127 in the world for the number of women in national parliamentary worldwide as of March 2014, which is lower than that of 2013 in which Japan ranked at 122.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kyodo | author-link = Kyodo News | title = Japan falls to 127th global ranking of female lawmakers | url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/03/12/national/japan-falls-to-127th-global-ranking-of-female-lawmakers/ |work = [[The Japan Times]] | date = March 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 28, 2013, there are a total of 39 women in the House of Representatives out of 479 incumbents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Strength of political groups in the House of Representatives | url = http://www.shugiin.go.jp/internet/itdb_english.nsf/html/statics/english/strength.htm | website = shugiin.go.jp | publisher = The House of Representatives | location = Japan }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the enactment of the modern [[Constitution of Japan|Japanese Constitution]] in 1947, Japanese women have been given the right to vote, and the new version of the constitution also allows for a more democratic form of government that guarantees women equality under the law. 
The first female cabinet member, [[Masa Nakayama]], was appointed as the Minister of Health and Welfare in Japan in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwdc.org/resources/timeline.htm|title=International Women's Democracy Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Until 1996, the electoral system for the House of Representatives was based on a single non-transferable vote in multi-member districts. That system was not conducive to women's advancement in public office because it promoted contestation between competing parties and rival candidates within the same party,{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} but overall, the new electoral system was introduced to reduce the excessive role of money and corruption in elections, which ultimately helped women who were running for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Iwanaga | first= Kazuki | title = Women's political representation and electoral system in Japan }} 1st International Conference Women and Politics in Asia. Conference Paper. Halmstad: Halmstad University, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Japanese politics, the [[Koenkai|kōenkai]] is a major factor for a successful outcome of an election. The kōenkai, or "local support groups", serve as pipelines through which funds and other support are conveyed to legislators and through which the legislators can distribute favors to constituents in return. Because gaining support from these groups is usually based on personal connections, women's historically disadvantaged position in networking circles hurts their ability to run for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Krauss | first1 = Ellis S. | last2 = Pekkanen | first2 = Robert J. | contribution = The kōenkai: origin and development of a vote-mobilization machine | editor-last1 = Krauss | editor-first1 = Ellis S. | editor-last2 = Pekkanen | editor-first2 = Robert J. | title = The rise and fall of Japan's LDP : political party organizations as historical institutions | pages = 32–33 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780801476822 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1996, Japan adopted another new electoral system for the House of Representatives that combines single-seat districts with proportional representation. Out of 480 seats, 300 are contested in single seat constituencies. The other 180 members are elected through allocations to an electoral list submitted by each party. Candidates who lack a strong support system are listed on a party's proportional representation section. In the 2009 election, only two of eight female [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] members were elected from a single-seat district, which indicates that few female candidates have enough political support to win a single-seat election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Nakano | first =Yūko | title = Japan chair platform: among equals?

As for the future of women in politics in Japan, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced in his speech at the Japan National Press Club on April 19, 2013, that a major goal of his national growth strategy is "having no less than 30 per cent of leadership positions in all areas of society filled by women by 2020."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Speech on growth strategy by Prime Minister Shinzō Abe at the Japan National Press Club | url = http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/96_abe/statement/201304/19speech_e.html | website = .kantei.go.jp | publisher = Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet | date = April 19, 2013 }} (Speeches and Statements by Prime Minister.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanese women are considered to have more rights and freedom compared to other women in the Gulf and Middle East.{{By whom|date=June 2017}} Lebanese women enjoy almost equal civil rights as men. However, due to the large number of officially recognized religions in Lebanon, Lebanese family matters are governed by at least 15 personal statute codes. Lebanese women have legal protection that varies depending on their religion.

Local and regional NGOs have helped to increase awareness of violence against women in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnf.org.lb/windex/introduction.html|title=Women's Rights Monitor|date=|publisher=Lnf.org.lb|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2012/Mar-25/167921-over-30-ngos-demonstrate-for-womens-rights.ashx#axzz1rcyhFq4K|title=Over 30 NGOs demonstrate for women's rights|date=|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government policies regarding this are poor however, and attempts to improve this area have been met with resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/95033/LEBANON-Tussle-over-gender-violence-law|title=IRIN Middle East &amp;#124; Lebanon: Tussle over gender violence law &amp;#124; Lebanon &amp;#124; Early Warning &amp;#124; Gender Issues &amp;#124; Governance &amp;#124; Human Rights &amp;#124; Security|date=2012-03-08|publisher=Irinnews.org|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanon's laws do not recognize the concept of spousal rape,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderindex.org/country/lebanon|title=Gender Equality in Lebanon &amp;#124; Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)|date=|publisher=Genderindex.org|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attempts to add this to law have been attacked by Lebanese clerics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabnews.com/middleeast/article462177.ece|title=Lebanon's clerics attack domestic violence law|last=Miller|first=David E.|accessdate=February 4, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630135532/http://arabnews.com/middleeast/article462177.ece|archivedate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Myanmar ===
[[File:Aung San Suu Kyi (December 2011).jpg|thumb|right|216x216px|[[Aung San Suu Kyi]], [[State Counsellor of Myanmar]] since 2016]]

[[Aung Sang Suu Kyi]] is a Burmese politician, diplomat, author, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate (1991). She is the ''[[de facto]]'' [[head of the government]] of Myanmar since 2016. She remained under house arrest for almost 15 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent political prisoners.

Although she was prohibited from becoming the [[President of Myanmar|President]] due to a clause in the constitution – her late husband and children are foreign citizens – she assumed the newly created role of [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]], a role akin to a Prime Minister or a head of government. Incumbent president [[Win Myint (politician, born 1951)|Win Myint]] is seen as an important ally and placeholder for Aung San Suu Kyi.

=== Netherlands ===
In 2016, the Dutch government achieved their goal for women in top jobs within the government. A 30% female share was achieved two years earlier than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/politiek/rijksoverheid-haalt-streefcijfer-vrouwen-in-topfuncties~a4302524/|title=Rijksoverheid haalt streefcijfer vrouwen in topfuncties – Politiek – Voor nieuws, achtergronden en columns|last=Giebels|first=Robert|website=De Volkskrant|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, the number of women in top jobs is behind in the political sector. In 2013, the listed companies inserted a 'one in three' rule, which meant that of every three top jobs, one must be exerted by a woman. Not long after, it turned out companies did not put much effort in to achieving this goal, as in practice even less than one in every ten top jobs was occupied by women. The goal for women in top jobs was postponed to 2023. Government and the business sector agreed that if every one in five top jobs is not exerted by women, after 2018 the 30% rule will become mandatory.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bakker, F. S., &amp; Kartner, F. (2013). Excuustruus of echte topvrouw? Over de wenselijkheid van vrouwenquota in het bedrijfsleven. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, women's quota received a fair share of criticism. It has been argued that women should be employed based on their own qualities, not because of their gender.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Romania===
No political gender quotas exist in Romania, however the Equality Act of 2002 provides that public authorities and institutions, political parties, employers' organizations and trade unions must provide an equitable and balanced representation of men and women at all decisional levels.&lt;ref&gt;Current legal framework: {{cite web | url=http://www.impowr.org/research/romania/Participation%20in%20policy%20formation%20and%20implementation | title=Participation in policy formation and implementation in Romania | website = impowr.org | publisher = International Models Project on Women's Rights (IMPOWR) | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[2016 Romanian legislative election|2016 elections]], women gained only 20.7% of seats in the Lower House ([[Chamber of Deputies (Romania)|Romanian Chamber of Deputies]]) and 14.7% in the Upper House ([[Senate of Romania]]).&lt;ref name="IPU_class" /&gt; These figures are up from the 4.9% of women in the Romanian Parliament in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.roaep.ro/prezentare/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/women_Parliament.pdf | title=The evolution of woman representation in Romanian Parliament | website = roaep.ro | publisher= Romania Autoritatea Electorala Permanenta [Permanent Electoral Authority] | date = February 2013 | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, women are well represented in the central public administration, including the [[Government of Romania|Government]], with more than half of decision-making positions held by women, according to a 2011 study commissioned by the [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Ministry of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Role of traditions: {{cite web | url=http://www.impowr.org/research/romania/Participation%20in%20policy%20formation%20and%20implementation | title=Participation in policy formation and implementation in Romania | website = impowr.org | publisher = International Models Project on Women's Rights (IMPOWR) | accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Viorica Dăncilă]] is the [[Prime Minister of Romania]] since 29 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Citation error.

===Rwanda===
	Since the election of 2008, Rwanda is the first country to have a majority of women in legislature.&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Haerpfer | first2 = Christian | last3 = Wallace | first3 = Claire | author-link1 = Pamela Abbott | title = Women in Rwandan politics and society | journal = [[International Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 111–125 | doi = 10.2753/IJS0020-7659380406 | date = Winter 2008  | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news | last = Friedman | first = Andrea | title = Looking to Rwanda for lessons on gender equality | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrea-friedman/looking-to-rwanda-for-les_b_147833.html | work = [[Nicolas Berggruen|The WorldPost]] | date =  | access-date = September 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rwanda is an example of a developing country that does not have spectacular gender equality in other aspects of society,{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} but radically increased its female leadership because of national conflict. After the genocide that killed 800,000 Tutsis in 100 days, women in legislature went from 18% women before the conflict to 56% in 2008. Two pieces of legislature enabled and supported women into leadership positions: the Security Council Resolution of 1325 urged women to take part in the post-conflict reconstruction and the 2003 Rwandan Constitution included a mandated quota of 30% reserved seats for all women in legislature. Of the 24 women who gained seats directly after the quota implementation in 2003, many joined political parties and chose to run again. Though it took almost 10 years, after implementing the gender quotas, Rwanda reached levels of female representation which are amongst the highest in the world.&lt;ref name="Carmichael" /&gt; Once again we can see the quota working as an "incubator" for driving women's participation in leadership.

It is argued that the increase of female leadership in Rwanda also led to an increase in gender equality. World Focus (2009) writes, "Rwandan voters have elected women in numbers well beyond the mandates dictated by the post-genocide constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The top ten innovative global solutions of the decade (blog) | url = http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/12/30/the-top-10-innovative-global-solutions-of-the-decade/8991/ | website = worldfocus.org | publisher = Worldfocus | date = December 30, 2009 | access-date = September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; And though women in Rwanda still face discrimination, female legislators have influenced major reforms in banking and property laws." A parliamentary women's caucus in Rwanda (FFRP) has also "led a successful effort to pass ground-breaking legislation on gender-based violence in part by involving and garnering support from their male colleagues".&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

While some researchers see reform, others see dominant party tactics. Hassim (2009) writes, "It could be argued that in both countries [Uganda and Rwanda] women's representation provided a kind of alibi for the progressive, 'democratic' nature of new governments that at their core nevertheless remained authoritarian, and increasingly so".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hassim | first = Shireen | contribution = Perverse consequences?

===Spain===
In 2007, Spain passed the Equality Law, requiring a "principle of balanced presence" by mandating political parties to include 40–60% of each sex among electoral candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Verge | first = Tània | title = Gendering representation in Spain: opportunities and limits of gender quotas | journal = [[Journal of Women, Politics &amp; Policy]] | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 166–190 | doi = 10.1080/15544771003697247 | date = 2010 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This law is unique in that surpasses the 40% parity figure established by the European Commission in 1998; a figure which (according to the EC) indicates "parity democracy." Though there is anecdotal evidence of increasing female representation on a local and national level, there has not yet been national-level data to quantitatively bolster this assertion.

On June 6, 2018, Pedro Sánchez, the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party, presented his cabinet which included eleven women and six men, making it the cabinet with the highest proportion of women in the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20180606/gobierno-mujeres-europeista-experiencia-gestion-independientes-fotografia-del-nuevo-gabinete/1746182.shtml|title=Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez: El Gobierno de las mujeres|date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|head of state of the United Kingdom]] is Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. In 2015, she became the longest-reigning female head of state in world history. In 2016, she became the [[List of current state leaders by date of assumption of office|longest currently serving head of state]] (male or female). The [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] repealed the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], replacing male-preference primogeniture with absolute primogeniture for those born in the line of succession after 28 October 2011, which meant the eldest child, regardless of sex, would precede his or her brothers and sisters.

[[File:Women in Congress 1977-2006.png|thumbnail|350px|The number of women in the U.S. Congress (both the House and Senate) from 1977–2006.]]
In the United States no political gender quotas exist, mandatory or voluntary. The proportion of women in leadership roles in the Senate, House of Representatives, and Presidential positions reflect this. Although the proportion has grown since the first female elected into the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lieber|first1=Constance |last2=Sillitos |first2=John |title= Martha Hughes Cannon |url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/people/marthahughescannon.html|website=Utah History To Go|publisher=Utah State Historical Society|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current position of women representation in the U.S. is precarious. In the elections of 2012, the greatest number of female incumbents ever were up for re-election in the Senate. Ten female Democrats, six of them incumbents, were nominated, with one Republican nominated for Senate ran for office.&lt;ref name="Steinhauer, Jennifer 2011"&gt;{{cite news | last = Steinhauer | first = Jennifer | author-link = Jennifer Steinhauer | title = More women in Senate, but seats are at risk | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/us/politics/women-could-have-banner-year-in-2012-election.html | work = [[The New York Times|New York Times Journal]] | date = October 20, 2011 | location = New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinhauer notes that in Congress, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives, women historically and currently lack representation.

From 1917, when Representative Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman to serve in Congress, to the 115th congress, a total of 329 women have served as U.S. Representatives, Delegates, or Senators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.house.gov/wic/|title=Women in Congress {{!}} US House of Representatives: History, Art &amp; Archives|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1917 to 2018, the United States has had 277 women serve in the House of Representatives.

From 1922, when Senator Rebecca Latimer Felton became the first woman to serve in the Senate, to 2018 52 women have served in the United States Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/women_senators.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Women in the Senate|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 115th Congress, 107 (78D, 29R) women hold seats in the United States Congress, comprising 20.0% of the 535 members; 23 women (23%) serve in the U.S. Senate, and 84 women (19.3%) serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/women-us-congress-2018|title=Women in the U.S. Congress 2018|date=2015-06-12|work=CAWP|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States is one of the shrinking number of industrialized democracies to not have yet had a woman as its leader. Worldwide, female prime ministers include Sri Lanka's [[Sirimavo Bandarnaike]], India's [[Indira Gandhi]], Canada's [[Kim Campbell]], the UK's [[Margaret Thatcher]], Australia's [[Julia Gillard]], Israel's [[Golda Meir]], and France's [[Édith Cresson]]. Other female national leaders include Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] of Germany, President [[Dilma Rousseff]] of Brazil, and President [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]] of Argentina. Even Pakistan and Turkey, countries often viewed as particularly male-dominated have had female prime ministers. Therefore, the United States, a country which promotes the rights of women and girls around the world, is conspicuous for having only male presidents.

In popular media in the United States, female politicians see some focus on their appearance; more so than their male counterparts. A 2011 feminist journal by [[Diana Carlin|Carlin]] and Winfrey focuses on the portrayal of female politicians in the media. According to the journal, the way media perceives women and men is very distinct in the language they chose to use. The language chosen to talk or describe other people can either hurt or help them in a political campaign. As a result of
women being talked about in sexist terms in can greatly affect her reputation and credibility.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carlin | first1 = Diana B. |authorlink1=Diana Carlin | last2 = Winfrey | first2 = Kelly L. | title = Have you come a long way, baby?

The journal claims the media uses terms that indicative of women not being valued as individuals.  "This is especially true when women are described using metaphors that draw on animals, children, or food. Animal terms focus on the appearance and sexuality of young women (foxy), and as women grow older, or are seen as too aggressive, they may be called barracuda, old bat, shrew, or cow."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Females tend to have less issue coverage than males (due to fewer female politicians), but tend to have more coverage on things such as their appearance than male politicians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Men candidates don't get coverage on what kind of suite they are wearing or who designed it. This is due to innate purpose of the media to appeal to demands of their audiences for sales – in this case the popular female focus on fashion that dominates the media. Studies done on women candidates have shown that women receive more attention in the media for factors such as appearance, clothes, size, and emotional state&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;".
In 2015 Rachel Silbermann conducted a study that time spent traveling to and from work is particularly burdensome for those who spend time caring for children, and as women do a majority of the child care and housework, commuting is particularly burdensome to them. Silbermann also found that female students weigh proximity to home twice as heavily as male students do in a hypothetical decision of whether to run for higher office. She suggests that to achieve equal representation of women in government men and women will need to share household responsibilities more equally.&lt;ref name="Silberman, R. 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Silbermann | first = Rachel | title = Gender roles, work-life balance, and running for office | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Political Science]] | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–153 | doi = 10.1561/100.00014087 | date = June 2015 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study found no evidence that the low share of women in the U.S. House of Representative was due to gender discrimination by voters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Anastasopoulos |first=Lefteris | title = Estimating the gender penalty in House of Representative elections using a regression discontinuity design | journal = [[Electoral Studies]] | volume = 43 | issue =  | pages = 150–157 | doi = 10.1016/j.electstud.2016.04.008 | date = September 2016 | ref = harv |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/4vm6w73t }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the author of the study, "these results suggest that the deficit of female representation in the House is more likely the result of barriers to entering politics as opposed to overt gender discrimination by voters and campaign donors."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2017 study found that over the last decade, public opposition to electing a woman as president declined from approximately 26% to 13%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burden|first=Barry C.|last2=Ono|first2=Yoshikuni|last3=Yamada|first3=Masahiro|date=2017-05-04|title=Reassessing Public Support for a Female President|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=79|issue=3|pages=1073–1078|doi=10.1086/691799|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

A 2018 study in the ''American Political Science Review'' did not find evidence that American voters were outright hostile to women in politics or that they held double standards. The study did however find that American voters preferred candidates who were married and had children. Since the burdens of child-rearing disproportionately fall on women in households, the bias in favor of married candidates with children may explain women's underrepresentation in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teele|first=Dawn Langan|last2=Kalla|first2=Joshua|last3=Rosenbluth|first3=Frances|date=2018|title=The Ties That Double Bind: Social Roles and Women's Underrepresentation in Politics|journal=American Political Science Review|language=en|volume=112|issue=3|pages=525–541|doi=10.1017/S0003055418000217|issn=0003-0554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the year 2018 saw the largest increase in female representation in state governments following a decade of stagnation: 1,834 women won office at the state and federal level during the mid-term elections, 2,112 women got seats in state legislative offices, and six women have launched campaigns for the highest office in the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49569390|title=Are voters biased against women candidates?|last=|first=|date=September 11, 2019|website=BBC News|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Case Studies =====

====== Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton ======
In 2008, campaigns for both Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton were taken in great interest by fashion articles read mostly by women. The journal claims that Clinton was perceived as masculine and Palin was seen as feminine. "Palin's attractiveness resulted in frequent and varied references to her ''sexiness''; whereas, Clinton was viewed as not feminine enough in pantsuits that covered her ''cankles'' (thick ankles).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Various newspapers covered on how Palin was part of beauty pageants and this really affected the seriousness of her campaign. They took Palin as a joke and various individuals began to state that this was a political campaign and not
another beauty pageant. On the other hand Clinton was perceived as a "nut cracker" and "where boners go to die". Clinton's physical appearance and her choice of clothing, pantsuits over skirts and dresses, were the source of considerable ridicule.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Carlin and Winfrey believe that Clinton was not perceived as a sex symbol because she chose to wear pants over
skirts, and also because she was older than Palin. Due to the smaller proportion of women who pursue political careers, there is greater pressure on female politicians to succeed. The importance of criticisms about "cankles" and the like on public popularity in a presidential election is disputed. Many think these criticisms are negligible, but Carlin and Winfrey believe this criticisms have a large effect. This analysis done on both Senator Clinton's and Governor Palin's campaign concluded that media coverage had a vast responsibility on how both women were viewed due to their gender
stereotypes and language used to "influence the public",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; though others argue that the style of media coverage is entirely the result of existing demand by the audience. There was national sample done that concluded that 51% of respondents ''believed'' that Americans were not ready for a women to be elected into high office.&lt;ref name="Lawless, J. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lawless | first = Jennifer L. | author-link = Jennifer L. Lawless | title = Sexism and gender bias in Election 2008: a more complex path for women in politics | journal = [[Politics &amp; Gender]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–80 | doi = 10.1017/S1743923X09000051 | date = March 2009 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; 40% of those same individuals ''believed'' that women were still discriminated in all areas in societies including politics.&lt;ref name="Lawless, J. 2009" /&gt;

====== Nikki Haley ======
The ''New York Journal'' explains how many in the general public of South Carolina were ignorant of the fact that Haley was Indian-American. According to one of her co-workers in the state legislature, voters saw Haley as a “nice conservative woman with a tan.”&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{Cite web|title=For Nikki Haley, Dealing with Foreign Tyrants is the Easy Part of the Job.|last=Rice|first=Andrew|date=11 December 2017|id = {{ProQuest|1985149982}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; While running the first time, for House of Representatives, in a semi-rural district, some of the voters pledged against Haley and said they would not vote for any candidate whose father was an immigrant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Throughout Haley's 2010 campaign for Governor, opponents attacked her gender. These sexist comments did not sway Haley, who was self-confident in her own skin. She was called a “rag-head,” and “Mark Sandford in a skirt.”&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt; Haley responded in a positive way, she was not upset and seemed very level-headed. Then, one person who worked with Haley previously as a political consultant accused her of an affair. Haley rejected this very serious allegation and went forward to win the 2010 election for Governor of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=For Nikki Haley, Dealing With Foreign Tyrants Is the Easy Part of the Job.|last=Rice|first=Andrew|date=11 December 2017|id = {{ProQuest|1985149982}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in government office==

{{See also|List of elected and appointed female heads of state and government}}

Women in government have historically been fewer in numbers in [[Western world|Western societies]] compared to men.  Some women, however, have served as heads of state and government. Although the number of women in government in the US has grown, they still hold less than 25% of government positions nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genderwatch2018.org/getting-to-congress-women/|title=The hardest part of being a woman in Congress? Getting there.|last=Dittmar|first=Kelly|date=September 21, 2018|website=Center for American Women and Politics|access-date=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a survey administered to 1,039 U.S. citizens, the number of women who hold a position in government office could be due to a baseline preference of one sex over another. The results show that 60% of respondents have a baseline gender preference for a male candidate, while 40% prefer a woman candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Kathleen|date=2009-05-22|title=The Impact of Gender Stereotyped Evaluations on Support for Women Candidates|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=69–88|doi=10.1007/s11109-009-9090-4|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest challenges a woman in government can face occur during the pursuit of her position in government office, as opposed to when she is upholding said position. Studies show that one of the big challenges is financing a campaign. While women are more than capable of matching their male opponents in fundraising totals, studies show that they have to work harder in order to achieve the same result because men tend to receive more ready support from party leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genderwatch2018.org/getting-to-congress-women/|title=The hardest part of being a woman in Congress? Getting there.|last=Dittmar|first=Kelly|date=2018-09-21|website=Gender Watch 2018|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey conducted on a sample of 3,640 elected municipal officeholders, women face adversities with things such as financing a campaign because they are not as heavily recruited as men by party leaders. There are two factors that contribute to this trend. Firstly, party leaders tend to recruit candidates who are similar to them. Since most party leaders are men, they usually see men as prime candidates because they share more similarities than most woman do. The same concept applies when discussing the second factor. Recruitment works through networks such as lower level office holders or affiliated businesses. Since women are underrepresented in these networks, according to statistics, they are less likely to be recruited than men. Due to these challenges, women have to spend time and conscious effort building a financial support system, unlike men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=SAGE Journals: Your gateway to world-class journal research|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=69|issue=4|pages=842–851|language=en|doi=10.1177/1065912916668412|year = 2016|last1 = Butler|first1 = Daniel M.|last2=Preece|first2=Jessica Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparing women's integration into branches of government==

===Executive branch===
Women have been notably in fewer numbers in the executive branch of government.  The gender gap has been closing, however, albeit slowly&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"/&gt; The first women other than monarchs to hold head of state positions were in socialist countries. The first was [[Khertek Anchimaa-Toka]] of the [[Tuvan People's Republic]] from 1940–1944, followed by [[Sükhbaataryn Yanjmaa]] of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] 1953–1954 and [[Soong Ching-ling]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] from 1968–1972 and 1981.

The Nordic countries have been forerunners in including women in the executive branch. The [[second cabinet Brundtland]] (1986–1989) was historical in that 8 out of 18 cabinet members were women, and in 2007 the [[second cabinet Stoltenberg]] (2005–2013) was more than 50% women.

In 2003, Finland had a historical moment when all top leaders of the country were women and also represented different political parties: [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social democrat]] [[Tarja Halonen]] was President, [[Riitta Uosukainen]] from [[National Coalition Party]] was [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|Speaker of the Parliament]] and after the [[2003 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary elections of 2003]] [[Anneli Jäätteenmäki]] from [[Centre Party (Finland)|Center party]] was on her way to become the first female [[Prime Minister of Finland]]. By June 22, 2010 [[Mari Kiviniemi]] of the Centre Party was appointed the second female [[Prime Minister of Finland]].

Between 2007 and 2011 the Finnish cabinet was 60% female, with a female Prime Minister from 2010 to 2011. Between 2014 and 2015 the Finnish cabinet was 59% female.

The present Danish government is a coalition between the Social Democrats, the Social-Liberal Party and the Socialist People's Party. All three parties have female leaders. [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] is Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Preisler | first = Marie | title = Denmark's gender equality policies: no quotas and a focus on men | journal = [[Nordic Labour Journal]] | date = March 8, 2013 | url = http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2013/equality-reaching-critical-mass/article.2013-03-08.2356410784 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first elected [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female president]] was [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]] of [[Iceland]], whose term lasted from 1980 to 1996.

In 2005, [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] of [[Liberia]] became Africa's first elected female head of state.

===Legislative branch===
{{Over-coverage|section|region=New Hampshire|date=March 2019}}
It was not until World War I and the first socialist revolutions that the first few women became members of governments. [[Alexandra Kollontai]] became the first female to hold a minister position, as the People's Commissar for Social Welfare in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = First female ministers | url = http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/First-female-ministers.htm | website = guide2womenleaders.com | publisher = Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nina Bang]], Danish Minister of Education from 1924–26, was the world's second full female cabinet minister.

The first female head of government was [[Evgenia Bosh]], the [[Bolshevik]] military leader who held the People's Secretary of Internal Affairs position in the Ukraine People's Republic of the Soviets of Workers and Peasants from 1917–1918, which was responsible for executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Woman Prime Ministers | url = http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/Premier_Ministers.htm | website = guide2womenleaders.com | publisher = Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ukraine | url = http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Ukraine.html | website = worldstatesmen.org | publisher = World Statesmen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Yevgenia Bosch (1879–1925) | url = http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art_id=1261011&amp;cat_id=661258 | website = kmu.gov.ua | publisher = Government of Ukraine | language = uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, development was slow and it was not until the end of the 20th century that female ministers stopped being unusual.{{opinion|date=March 2019}}

The first government organization formed with the goal of women's equality was the [[Zhenotdel]], in Soviet Russia.

According to a 2006 report by the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], 16% of all parliament members in the world are female. In 1995, the [[United Nations]] set a goal of 30% female representation.&lt;ref name="2006report"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Women politicians 'making gains' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4758036.stm |work=BBC News |date=28 February 2006 |accessdate=18 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current annual growth rate of women in national parliaments is about 0.5% worldwide. At this rate, gender parity in national legislatures will not be achieved until 2068.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

The top ten countries in terms of number of female parliamentary members are [[Rwanda]] with 56.3%, [[Sweden]] (47.0%), [[Cuba]] (43.2%), [[Finland]] (41.5%), the [[Netherlands]] (41.3%), [[Argentina]] (40.0%), [[Denmark]] (38.0%), [[Angola]] (37.3%), [[Costa Rica]] (36.8%), [[Spain]] (36.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women in national parliaments | url = http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/arc/classif301108.htm | website = ipu.org | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{As of|2008|08|30}} Cuba has the highest percentage for countries without a quota. In South Asia, Nepal is highest in the rank of women participation in politics with (33%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209123905/http://sapint.org/ | archive-date = December 9, 2007 | url = http://www.sapint.org/ | website = sapint.or | publisher = South Asian Partnership }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[East Asian]] countries, [[Taiwan]] has the highest percentage of women in Parliament (38.0%). In the United States in 2008, the [[New Hampshire State Senate]] became the first state legislature upper house to possess an elected female majority.

The United Kingdom and United States are roughly in line with the world average. The [[House of Lords]] has 139 women (19.7%), while there are [[Women in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom|125 women]] (19.4%) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].

On November 6, 2012, New Hampshire made US History by having all-female congressional delegation to Congress with [[Annie Kuster]] being elected to [[New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district|represent New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district]] in the House of Representatives, [[Carol Shea-Porter]] regained her House seat to represent [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district]] in the House of Representatives, and with [[Jeanne Shaheen]] and [[Kelly Ayotte]] both represented New Hampshire in the United States senate.&lt;ref&gt;New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2016, New Hampshire again made US History by having an all-female, all-[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] delegation to the US Congress. Incumbent Republican senator, Kelly Ayotte, was defeated by then-New Hampshire Governor, [[Maggie Hassan]], a Democrat, in the [[United States Senate election in New Hampshire, 2016|senate election]] to serve alongside Democratic senator, Jeanne Shaheen. Representative Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat, defeated incumbent representative, [[Frank Guinta]], a Republican, again in New Hampshire's 1st congressional district to serve alongside Ann Kuster, who represents New Hampshire 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives to achieve another historic "women's first".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-sending-first-all-woman-all-democratic-delegation-to-dc/8369972|title=New Hampshire Sending First All-Woman, All-Democratic Delegation to DC|first=Cam|last=Tranchemontagne|date=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local representation===
There has been an increasing focus on women's representation at a local level.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/&gt;  Most of this research is focused on developing countries.  Governmental decentralization often results in local government structures that are more open to the participation of women, both as elected local councilors and as the clients of local government services.&lt;ref name="Social Development 2005"/&gt;
A 2003 survey conducted by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), a global network supporting inclusive local governments, found that the average proportion of women in local council was 15%.  In leadership positions, the proportion of women was lower: for instance, 5% of mayors of Latin American municipalities are women.

According to a comparative study of women in local governments in East Asia and the Pacific, women have been more successful in reaching decision-making position in local governments than at the national level.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;  Local governments tend to be more accessible and have more available positions.  Also, women's role in local governments may be more accepted because they are seen as an extension of their involvement in the community.

====Indian panchayats====
The local panchayat system in India provides an example of women's representation at the local governmental level.&lt;ref name="Basu, Amriyta 2003"/&gt; The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments in 1992 mandated panchayat elections throughout the country.  The reforms reserved 33% of the seats for women and for castes and tribes proportional to their population.  Over 700,000 women were elected after the reforms were implemented in April 1993.
