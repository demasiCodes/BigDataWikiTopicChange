'''Women in politics''' have historically been underrepresented in [[Western world|Western socities]] compared to men.  Many women, however, have been politically elected to be heads of state and government.  Most prominent may be the female leaders of [[world power]]s such as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Golda Meir]], [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]], [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Kim Campbell]], [[Prime Minister of France]] [[Edith Cresson]], [[President of the People's Republic of China]] [[Soong Ching-ling|Soong Ching-ling (AKA Rosamond Soong)]], and [[Cultural Revolution|Director of the Cultural Revolution]], dictator [[Jiang Qing]].

==Executive branch of government==
The Nordic countries have been forerunners in including women in the executive branch. The [[second cabinet Brundtland]] (1986-1989) were historical in that 8 out of 18 cabinet members were women, and in 2007 the [[second cabinet Stoltenberg]] (2005-present) was more than 50% women. Some current female politicians that have reached top positions in the Nordic countries are the President of [[Finland]], [[Tarja Halonen]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden]], [[Maud Olofsson]].

The world's first elected [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female president]] was [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]] of [[Iceland]], whose term lasted from 1980 to 1996.

In 2005, [[Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf]] of [[Liberia]] became Africa's first elected female head of state.

==Legislative branch of government==
It was not until after World War I that the first few women became members of governments. [[Nina Bang]], Danish Minister of Education from 1924-26, was the world's first full female cabinet minister. Nevertheless, development was slow and it was not until the end of the 20th century that female ministers stopped being unusual. 

According to a 2006 report by the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], 16% of all parliament members in the world are female. In 1995, the [[United Nations]] set a goal of 30%.&lt;ref name="2006report"&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Women politicians 'making gains' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4758036.stm |work=BBC News |date=28 February 2006 |accessdate=2007-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top ten countries are [[Rwanda]] with 48.8%, [[Sweden]] (45.3%), [[Norway]] (37.9%), [[Finland]] (37.5%), [[Denmark]] (36.9%), [[the Netherlands]] (36.7%), [[Spain]] (36%), [[Cuba]] (36%), [[Costa Rica]] (35.1%), [[Argentina]] (35%), and [[Mozambique]] (34.8%).&lt;ref name="2006report"&gt;b&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the same report, nine countries have no women parliament members.

The US House of Representatives contains 77 women, and the US Senate contains 16. Eight states have female governors. See also: [[Women in the United States House of Representatives]], [[Women in the United States Senate]], and [[List of female state governors in the United States]].

==International organizations==
