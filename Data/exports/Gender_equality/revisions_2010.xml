'''Gender equality''' (also known as '''gender equity''', '''gender egalitarianism''', or '''sexual equality''') is the goal of the [[social equality|equality]] of the [[gender]]s or the [[sexes]],&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. Report of the Economic and Social Council for 1997. A/52/3.18 September 1997, at 28: "Mainstreaming a gender perspective is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve gender equality."&lt;/ref&gt; stemming from a belief in the injustice of myriad forms of [[gender inequality]]. 

World bodies have defined gender equality as related to [[human rights]], especially [[women's rights]], and economic development.&lt;ref name="Smart"&gt;{{cite journal |author=World Bank |title=Gender Equality as Smart Economics: A World Bank Group Gender Action Plan (Fiscal years 2007–10) |year=September, 2006 |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/GAPNov2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MDG3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endpoverty2015.org/goals/gender-equity |title=Goal #3 Gender Equity |accessdate=2008-06-01 |publisher=United Nations Millennium Campaign |year=2008 |author=United Nations Millennium Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]] defines gender equality as "levelling the playing field for girls and women by ensuring that all children have equal opportunity to develop their talents."&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/ |title=Gender equality |accessdate=2008-06-01 |publisher=UNICEF |date=May 12, 2008 |author=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[United Nations Population Fund]] declared gender equality "first and foremost, a human right."&lt;ref name="UNFPA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender/ |title=Gender Equality: An End in Itself and a Cornerstone of Development |accessdate=2008-06-01 |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |year=February 2006 |author=UNFPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Gender equity" is one of the goals of the [[United Nations Millennium Project]], to end world [[poverty]] by 2015; the project claims, "Every single Goal is directly related to women's rights, and societies where women are not afforded equal rights as men can never achieve development in a sustainable manner."&lt;ref name="MDG3" /&gt;

Thus, promoting gender equality is seen as an encouragement to greater economic prosperity.&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt; For example, nations of the [[Arab world]] that deny equality of opportunity to women were warned in a 2008 [[United Nations]]-sponsored report that this disempowerment is a critical factor crippling these nations' return to the first rank of global leaders in commerce, learning and culture.&lt;ref name="ejoussour"&gt;[http://www.e-joussour.net/en/node/1511 Gender equality in Arab world critical for progress and prosperity, UN report warns], E-joussour (21 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study of gender equality in Sweden that "[n]egative effects" to health in both sexes are suggested due to increased stress of the opportunities of the workplace, observed that "one-sided expansion by women into traditionally male roles, spheres and activities will not lead to positive health effects unless men also significantly alter their behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;Backhans, Mona C., Michael Lundberga and Anna Månsdottera, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VBF-4N6G028-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2007&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1329560544&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=5fbacb0ad588794036026ef02df3d35d Does increased gender equality lead to a convergence of health outcomes for men and women?
