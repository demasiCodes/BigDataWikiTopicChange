Report of the Economic and Social Council for 1997. A/52/3.18 September 1997, at 28: "Mainstreaming a gender perspective is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve gender equality."&lt;/ref&gt; stemming from a belief in the injustice of myriad forms of [[gender inequality]]. 

World bodies have defined gender equality as related to [[human rights]], especially [[women's rights]], and economic development.&lt;ref name="Smart"&gt;{{cite journal |author=World Bank |title=Gender Equality as Smart Economics: A World Bank Group Gender Action Plan (Fiscal years 2007–10) |year=September, 2006 |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/GAPNov2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MDG3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endpoverty2015.org/goals/gender-equity |title=Goal #3 Gender Equity |accessdate=2008-06-01 |publisher=United Nations Millennium Campaign |year=2008 |author=United Nations Millennium Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]] defines gender equality as "levelling the playing field for girls and women by ensuring that all children have equal opportunity to develop their talents."&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/ |title=Gender equality |accessdate=2008-06-01 |publisher=UNICEF |year=May 12, 2008 |author=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Population Fund]] declared gender equality "first and foremost, a human right."&lt;ref name="UNFPA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/gender/ |title=Gender Equality: An End in Itself and a Cornerstone of Development |accessdate=2008-06-01 |publisher=United Nations Population Fund |year=February 2006 |author=UNFPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Gender equity" is one of the goals of the [[United Nations Millennium Project]], to end world [[poverty]] by 2015; the project claims, "Every single Goal is directly related to women's rights, and societies where women are not afforded equal rights as men can never achieve development in a sustainable manner."&lt;ref name="MDG3" /&gt;

Many followers of this philosophy would like to see this term come to replace “[[feminism]]” or “[[masculism]],” when used to describe a belief in basic equal rights and opportunities for members of both sexes within legal, social, or corporate establishments.  They strive for ultimate fairness, and seek cooperative solutions so as to make things better for both males, females and everything in between.  While they may share a number of critiques and analyses with self-described man haters and/or masculists, they feel that “[[egalitarianism]]” is a better word for a belief in [[equality]] than any word that focuses on one of the genders.
