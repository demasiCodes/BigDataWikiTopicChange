{{Discrimination sidebar|Related}}
'''The talk''' is a colloquial expression for a conversation [[Black people|Black]] parents in the [[United States]] feel compelled to have with their children and teenagers about the dangers they face due to [[Racism in the United States|racism]] or unjust treatment from authority figures, [[Law enforcement in the United States|law enforcement]] or other parties, and how to de-escalate them. The practice dates back generations and is often viewed as a [[rite of passage]] for Black children.

== History ==
Black youth in the United States have historically been instructed by their parents or other caregivers on the dangers they face due to racism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title=George Floyd.

The talk has evolved. In the 1940s the talk might have covered avoiding certain neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2021-03-10 |title=For Black parents, 'the talk' binds generations, reflects changes in America |url=https://news.usc.edu/183102/the-talk-usc-black-parents-children-racism-america/ |access-date=2022-02-15 |website=USC News |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s it might have covered "how to dress, walk and act and to be mindful of how others could perceive them".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the 2010s it typically focused on interactions with the police.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

''[[Utne Reader]]'' called the talk "a rite of passage" for Black children.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Judy Belk, writing in the ''Los Angeles Times'', called the talk "an unfair but necessary burden we carry in the black community, one we reluctantly pass down" and "a painful ritual."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

In 2020, during and after the [[George Floyd protests]], some Black commentators called for [[White people|White]] parents to have a similar talk with their children on how to behave when they witness racist behavior and how to be [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=McDonald |first=Autumn |date=2020-06-15 |title=Black Parents Know "the Talk" Too Well.

The "talk" has been described as an example of ''preparation for bias'' in [[racial-ethnic socialization]]&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Unnever |first1=James D. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHd0DwAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22preparation+for+bias%22+the+talk&amp;pg=PT90 |title=Building a Black Criminology, Volume 24: Race, Theory, and Crime |last2=Gabbidon |first2=Shaun L. |last3=Chouhy |first3=Cecilia |date=October 26, 2018 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-429-75744-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and typically addresses specific advice in dealing with interactions with law enforcement. Brooks et al. (2016) described the type of advice for those confronted by law enforcement while driving:

* Pulling over your vehicle right away
* Keeping hands visible on the steering wheel and not making sudden moves
* Not reaching for items in your wallet or glove compartment, without informing the law enforcement officer first
* Being as polite as possible, using "Yes sir, officer"
* Not arguing, even if you are right

The perception of a need for these behaviors has been described as racialized [[legal cynicism]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  

According to [[PBS]], the talks usually include instructions such as:

{{Quote|text=If you are stopped by the police: Always answer 'yes sir, no sir'; never talk back; don’t make any sudden movements; don’t put your hands in your pockets; obey all commands; if you think you are falsely accused, save it for the police station. I would rather pick you up at the station than the morgue…"|author=|title=|source=''The Talk: Race in America''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Talk Archives|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/the-talk/tag/the-talk/|website=The Talk {{!}} Race in America|language=en-US|access-date=May 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to ''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'', for Black people in the United States, "a typical police stop turning into a violent encounter is a very real, terrifying possibility."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some Black parents focus on not only safety but also dignity and pride.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Approaches ==
There are five common general approaches parents take:

* Focusing primarily on pride in one’s culture
* Discussing societal issues of injustice and inequality
* Focusing on the value of hard work and deemphasizing the importance of race
* Teaching messages of mistrust 
* Avoidance of the discussion

Parents often combine multiple approaches. Research indicates the avoidance of discussion and teaching messages of mistrust are the least effective.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Focusing on pride and societal issues is typically more effective.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

A 2018 book for 4-to-8-year-olds, ''Something Happened in Our Town'', recommends having the first talk prior to preschool and another when children start venturing independently into public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Having 'The Talk': Expert Guidance On Preparing Kids For Police Interactions|url=https://www.npr.org/local/309/2019/08/27/754459083/having-the-talk-expert-guidance-on-preparing-kids-for-police-interactions|access-date=2020-09-14|publisher=NPR |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Celano|first1=Marianne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YacKtAEACAAJ|title=Something Happened in Our Town: A Child's Story about Racial Injustice|last2=Collins|first2=Marietta|last3=Hazzard|first3=Ann|date=2018|publisher=Magination Press|isbn=978-1-4338-2854-6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, PBS station [[WFYI (TV)|WFYI]], the SALT Project, Trinity United Church of Christ and Christian Theological Seminary partnered to develop a short video for young Black men called "Get Home Safely: 10 Rules of Survival".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=10 Rules of Survival if Stopped by the Police {{!}} Talk Back |publisher=PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/black-culture/connect/talk-back/10_rules_of_survival_if_stopped_by_police/ |access-date=May 30, 2020 |archive-date=May 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200518220624/http://www.pbs.org/black-culture/connect/talk-back/10_rules_of_survival_if_stopped_by_police/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, 2020, British TV channel [[Channel 4]] aired a documentary featuring the experiences of Black Britons in having this conversation with their parents.

In 2022, the educational animation video, ''[http://www.theblackandbluecode.com The Black and Blue Code]'', was produced as a guide to dealing with police for "Black and Brown" youth, teens, and people with disabilities.

In his [[2023 State of the Union Address]], President [[Joe Biden]] mentioned the talk:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I've never had to have the talk with my children – Beau, Hunter, and Ashley – that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children.
