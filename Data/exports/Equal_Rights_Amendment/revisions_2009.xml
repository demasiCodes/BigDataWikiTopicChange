The ERA, originally written by [[Alice Paul]] and introduced in every Congress since 1923, [[Unsuccessful attempts to amend the U.S. Constitution|failed to gain ratification]] before its June 30, 1982 deadline.

On July 21, 2009, Representative [[Carolyn B. Maloney]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[New York]], introduced the ERA in the House of Representatives.

==History==
===In the Congress===
Although the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] had prohibited the denial of the [[Suffrage|right to vote]] [[Women's suffrage|because of a person's sex]], [[Alice Paul]], a [[suffragette]] leader, argued that this right alone would not end remaining vestiges of legal [[discrimination]] based upon sex. In 1923, Paul drafted the Equal Rights Amendment and presented it as the "[[Lucretia Mott]] Amendment" at the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the 1848 Seneca Falls [[Declaration of Sentiments]].

{{cquote|Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.
Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.}}

The [[National Woman's Party]] took the ERA to Congress in the 1920s, where Senator [[Charles Curtis]] and Representative [[Daniel Read Anthony, Jr.|Daniel R. Anthony, Jr.]]—both of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and both from [[Kansas]]—introduced it for the first time as Senate Joint Resolution No. 21 on December 10, 1923, and as House Joint Resolution No. 75 on December 13, 1923, respectively. Though the ERA was introduced in every Congressional session between 1923 and 1970, it almost never reached the floor of either the [[United States Senate|Senate]] or the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] for a vote—instead, it was usually "bottled up" in [[United States congressional committee|committee]]. Exceptions occurred in 1946, when it was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 38 to 35, and in 1950, when it was passed by the Senate in a modified form unacceptable to its supporters.

The Republican Party included support of the ERA in its platform beginning in [[1944 Republican National Convention|1944]], renewing the plank every four years until [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]].&lt;ref name="'70s 245"&gt;{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last=Frum|first=David|authorlink=David Frum|year=2000|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|location=New York, New York|isbn=0465041957|pages=245–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ERA was strongly opposed by the [[American Federation of Labor]] and other labor unions, who did not want to compete with women,&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt; as well as by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and most [[New Deal]]ers, who contended that women needed government protection that men did not. The Act was opposed by most northern Democrats, who aligned themselves with the anti-ERA labor unions and supported by southern Democrats.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt; Beginning in [[1972 Democratic National Convention|1972]], the Democrats included support of the ERA in their platform.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt;
====1972 approval by Congress====
Representative [[Martha W. Griffiths]] of [[Michigan]],  achieved success on Capitol Hill with her House Joint Resolution No. 208, which was adopted by the House on October 12, 1971, with a vote of 354 yeas, 24 nays and 51 not voting.&lt;ref&gt;117 ''Congressional Record'' 35815&lt;/ref&gt; Griffiths' joint resolution was then adopted by the Senate on March 22, 1972, with a vote of 84 yeas, 8 nays and 7 not voting.&lt;ref&gt;118 ''Congressional Record'' 9598&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate version passed after an amendment proposed by Senator [[Sam Ervin]] of [[North Carolina]] that would exempt women from the [[conscription|draft]] failed.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt;

With that, the ERA was finally presented by the 92nd Congress to the state legislatures for ratification as Article V of the Constitution prescribes, with a seven-year deadline for ratification by the required three-quarters of the legislatures (38 legislatures). President [[Richard Nixon]] immediately endorsed the ERA's approval.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt;
====Recent congressional introductions====
The amendment has been reintroduced every year since 1982. Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] (D-MA) championed it in the Senate during the 99th through the 110th Congress. Representative [[Carolyn B. Maloney]] (D-NY) has sponsored it since the 105th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About the ERA|url=http://maloney.house.gov/documents/women/era/AUGUST%2012%20Facts%20About%20the%20ERA%20in%20the%20111th%20Congress.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=United States House of Representatives|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2007=====
On March 27, 2007, new resolutions were introduced in the House of Representatives and Senate by Senator Kennedy, Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] (D-CA), Representative Maloney, Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] (D-NY) and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Senators Kennedy &amp; Boxer, Reps.

The Congressional sponsors referred to the new resolutions as the "Women's Equality Amendment," but this title does not appear in the resolutions and some groups backing the proposals continue to refer to them as the [[gender-neutral language|gender neutral]] "Equal Rights Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eilperin|first=Juliet|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/27/AR2007032702357.html|title=New Drive Afoot to Pass Equal Rights Amendment|date=March 28, 2007|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.J.RES.40: Women's Equality Amendment resolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====2009=====
On July 21, 2009, Representative Maloney introduced the ERA in the House of Representatives as House Joint Resolution 61 ({{USBill|111|H.J.R.|61}}). H.J.Res. 61 is identical to the ERA which was submitted to the states for ratification in 1972, except that H.J.Res. 61 does not contain a ratification time limit. At a press conference that day outside the U.S. Capitol, [[Terry O'Neill (feminist)|Terry O'Neill]], the president of the [[National Organization for Women]], called for a floor vote on the resolution during the [[111th United States Congress|current Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://maloney.house.gov/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1899&amp;Itemid=61|title=Reps. Maloney, Biggert reintroduce Equal Rights Amendment|date=July 21, 2009|publisher=United States House of Representatives|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Right to Life Committee]] (NRLC), in a letter to House members,&lt;ref name=NRLC-letter&gt;{{cite press release|title=Re: the &amp;quot;Equal Rights Amendment&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;Women's Equality Amendment&amp;quot;) and abortion|url=http://www.nrlc.org/federal/era/ERAabortionNRLCtoHouse2009.html|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=2009-08-12|publisher=National Right to Life Committee (NRLC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that H.J.Res. 61 implicitly rejects the premises of the [[Equal_Rights_Amendment#Three-state_strategy|three-state strategy]]:{{quote|It would not make much sense for Congress to begin the entire constitutional amendment process over again from square one, if the identical language really was still pending and available for ratification before the state legislatures.}} The letter also says that NRLC opposes H.J.Res. 61, unless it is amended to be neutral toward [[Abortion debate|abortion]], and that NRLC "will include the roll call on passage in its scorecard of key pro-life roll calls of the 111th Congress."&lt;ref name=NRLC-letter/&gt;

===In the state legislatures and the courts===
The initial pace of [[State legislature (United States)|state legislative]] ratifications was rapid during 1972 and 1973. The rate of ratification then slowed considerably with only three ratifications during 1974, just one in 1975, none at all in 1976 and only one in 1977. The [[92nd United States Congress|92nd Congress]], in proposing the ERA, had set a seven-year time limit for its ratification and, by the end of that deadline on March 22, 1979, a total of 35 of the required 38 states had ratified it.

In 1978, the Congress passed a controversial bill by [[majority|simple majority]] (not a two-thirds [[supermajority]]) that extended the ratification deadline by 39 months. During this disputed extension, no new states ratified or rescinded. In ''Idaho v. Freeman'' (1981), a federal district court ruled the extension to be [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].

The [[National Organization for Women]] appealed the district court's holding in ''Idaho v. Freeman''. In ''NOW v. Idaho'', 459 U.S. 809 (1982), the U.S. Supreme Court declared the entire matter [[Mootness|moot]] on the grounds that the 1972 ERA was dead with or without either the rescissions or the purported deadline extension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eagleforum.org/era/now-v-idaho.html Text of NOW v. Idaho]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{legend|#80b3ff|Not ratified}}]]

Five states [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Rescinding a ratification|rescinded]] their ratifications before the deadline arrived.&lt;ref&gt;Technically, in South Dakota, one of the five, the legislature passed a measure that said its assent would last only until March 22, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are details of the five rescissions:&lt;ref&gt;Information derived from "The Equal Rights Amendment: myths and realities" authored by Orrin G. Hatch, published 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Idaho]], which ratified the ERA on March 24, 1972, by approving Senate Joint Resolution No. 133, adopted House Concurrent Resolution No. 10 on February 8, 1977, to rescind that ratification.
#[[Kentucky]], which ratified the ERA on June 26, 1972, by approving House (Joint) Resolution No. 2, adopted House (Joint) Resolution No. 20 on March 17, 1978, to rescind that ratification; the [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky]], [[Thelma Stovall]], who was acting as Governor in the Governor's absence, issued a [[Veto#United States|veto]] of the rescinding resolution, but the U.S. Constitution provides no role for a governor (nor for the [[President of the United States]]) in the constitutional amendment process.
#[[Nebraska]], which ratified the ERA on March 29, 1972, by approving the erroneously worded Legislative Resolution No. 83 and then approving the correctly worded Legislative Resolution No. 86, adopted Legislative Resolution No. 9 on March 15, 1973, to rescind only the aforementioned Legislative Resolution No. 83. This ''could'' mean that Nebraska remains officially in the "ratified" column, but appears to have been understood at the time as a full rescission of ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AsAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MWADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7123,2017809&amp;dq=equal+rights+amendment+nebraska|title=Retraction Issue Crucial to Equal Rights Bill|publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''|date=March 23, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Tennessee]] which ratified the ERA on April 4, 1972, by approving House Joint Resolution No. 371, adopted Senate Joint Resolution No. 29 on April 23, 1974, to rescind that ratification.
#[[South Dakota]], where lawmakers ratified the ERA on February 5, 1973, by approving Senate Joint Resolution No. 1, adopted Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 on March 1, 1979, stipulating that the ERA's opportunity for ratification—by ''any'' state of the Union—would expire on March 22, 1979; furthermore, Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 made clear that South Dakota's own ratification of the ERA would only be valid up until March 22, 1979, and that any activities transpiring after that date would be considered by South Dakota to be null and void.

In ''Idaho v. Freeman'', the U.S. District Court for Idaho held that the rescissions — all of which occurred before the original 1979 ratification deadline — were valid. According to research by Professor Jules B. Gerard, professor of law at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], of the 35 legislatures that passed ratification resolutions, 24 explicitly referred to the 1979 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to House Judiciary Committee, June 14, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times, in eight of the 15 non-ratifying states, at least one chamber of the legislature approved the ERA, those eight states being:
#[[Florida]], whose House of Representatives voted to ratify the ERA on March 24, 1972, with a tally of 91 to 4; a second time on April 10, 1975, with a tally of 62 to 58; a third time on May 17, 1979, with a tally of 66 to 53; and a fourth time on June 21, 1982, with a tally of 60 to 58.
#[[Illinois]], whose Senate voted to ratify the ERA in May 1972, with a tally of 30 to 21; and whose House of Representatives voted to ratify the ERA on May 1, 1975, with a tally of 113 to 62, and again on May 21, 2003, with a tally of 76 to 41. At various times, votes were conducted in both chambers of the [[Illinois General Assembly]] on the question of ratifying the ERA, and while most members voted in favor of ratification, the results were often less than the three-fifths supermajority vote required by the [[Illinois Constitution]].
#[[Louisiana]], whose Senate voted to ratify the ERA on June 7, 1972, with a tally of 25 to 13.
#[[Missouri]], whose House of Representatives voted to ratify the ERA on February 7, 1975, with a tally of 82 to 75.
#[[Nevada]], whose Assembly voted to ratify the ERA on February 17, 1975, with a tally of 27 to 13; and whose Senate voted to ratify the ERA on February 8, 1977, with a tally of 11 to 10.
#[[North Carolina]], whose House of Representatives voted to ratify the ERA on February 9, 1977, with a tally of 61 to 55.
#[[Oklahoma]], whose Senate voted to ratify the ERA on March 23, 1972, by a [[voice vote]].
#[[South Carolina]], whose House of Representatives voted to ratify the ERA on March 22, 1972, with a tally of 83 to 0.

Since 1995, ratification resolutions were introduced, but failed to win approval in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Will, George F.|url=http://www.nrlc.org/Federal/era/GeorgeWillERALivingDead.pdf|format=PDF|title=Night of the Living Dead Amendment|publisher=Washington Post via National Right to Life Committee|date=February 13, 1994|accessdate=2009-08-14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Francis, Roberta W.|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extension of ratification deadline===
In 1978—as the 1979 deadline approached—the [[Ninety-fifth United States Congress|95th Congress]] adopted House Joint Resolution No. 638 (H. J. Res. 638), by Representative [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] of [[New York]], which purported to extend the ERA's ratification deadline to June 30, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 92, ''United States Statutes At Large,'' page 3799&lt;/ref&gt; H. J. Res. 638 received less than two-thirds of the vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; for that reason, it was deemed necessary by ERA supporters that H. J. Res. 638 be transmitted to then President [[Jimmy Carter]] for signature as a safety precaution. Carter signed the joint resolution, though he questioned on procedural grounds the propriety of his doing so.

No additional states ratified the ERA during that extra period of slightly more than three years. On June 18, 1980, a resolution in the Illinois House of Representatives resulted in a vote of 102-71 in favor, but Illinois required a 3/5 majority on constitutional amendments and so the measure failed by five votes. In fact, the only occurrence favorable to the ERA between the original deadline of March 22, 1979 and the revised June 30, 1982, expiration date was—as noted earlier—its approval by the Florida House of Representatives on June 21, 1982. In the final week before the deadline, that ratifying resolution was ''defeated'' in the Florida Senate by a vote of 16 yeas and 22 nays. Even if Florida had ratified the ERA, the amendment would still have been two states short of the required 38 (or seven states short, if the rescissions are valid).

On December 23, 1981, a United States District Court ruled that the ERA's deadline extension was unconstitutional and, further, that a state legislature may indeed rescind a prior ratification of a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/Federal/era/IdahovFreeman.pdf ''Idaho v. Freeman''], U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, Civ. No. 79-1097, 529 F. Supp. 1107, December 23, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The case was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The [[United States Solicitor General]] claimed that the required number of states (38) had not ratified the amendment even if the deadline extension and the rescissions were valid, and that "the Amendment has failed of adoption no matter what the resolution of the legal issues presented here."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/Federal/era/ERASupremeCourtDeclaresDead1982sg.pdf Memorandum of Lawrence G. Wallace, Acting Solicitor General], Department of Justice, July 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court agreed and ordered the case dismissed as moot on October 4, 1982,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/Federal/era/ERASupremeCourtDeclaresDead1982sg.pdf Order from Office of the Clerk, Supreme Court of the United States], October 3, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby recognizing that the 1972 ERA had failed to win ratification, but did not issue a ruling on the merits of the either the deadline extension issue or the rescission issue in this case.

===Shift in political attitudes===
The political momentum changed during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. At the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] in Detroit, Michigan, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] platform was amended to qualify its support for the ERA. One of the most prominent opponents of the ERA was [[Phyllis Schlafly]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republican.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt; According to her, the ERA would have granted more [[Political power|power]] to the Congress and to the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagleforum.org/psr/1986/sept86/psrsep86.html|title=The Phyllis Schlafly Report|last=Schlafly|first=Phyllis|date=September 1986|publisher=[[Eagle Forum]]|accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State constitutions===
Twenty-one states have a version of the ERA in their state constitutions. Sixteen of those states ratified the federal amendment, while five did not.&lt;ref&gt;"Ratification Status in the States and State ERAs" League of Women Voters, Fairfax Area, via Internet Archive, March 2004 [&lt;!-- http://www.lwv-fairfax.org/pdf_folder/era_ratifications.pdf--&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.lwv-fairfax.org/pdf_folder/era_ratifications.pdf]; the 21: AK, CA, CO, CT, HI, IA, MD, MA, MT, NH, NJ, NM, PA, TX, WA and WY; the 5: FL, IL, LA, UT and VA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three-state strategy==
The ''three-state strategy'' is an argument made by some ERA supporters that the earlier 35 state ratifications are still valid and therefore only three more are needed in order to add the ERA to the Constitution, without Congress resubmitting it to state lawmakers. Since 1994, proponents of the three-state strategy have promoted ratification resolutions in the legislatures of most of the 15 states that never ratified the ERA approved by Congress in 1972. These attempts have met stiff resistance -- some opponents characterize the measures as "resurrection resolutions" -- and no legislature has approved one.

The ''three-state strategy'' was publicly unveiled at a press conference held in Washington, D.C., in December, 1993. According to an Associated Press report, "a coalition of women's groups," operating under the name "ERA Summit," planned "to ask Congress to nullify 1982 deadline for ratification."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/Federal/era/ERAnewthreestatestrategyAP1993.pdf "New strategy adopted to revive ERA]," by Kim I. Mills, Associated Press, as it appeared in the ''Sacramento'' (Ca.) ''Bee'', December 12, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Early the following year, Representative [[Rob Andrews|Robert E. Andrews]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[New Jersey]], introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives to require that "when the legislatures of an additional three states ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, the House of Representatives shall take any legislative action necessary to verify the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment as a part of the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/Federal/era/ERAthreestateAndrewsResolution1994.pdf Text of H. Res. 432], 103rd Congress, 2nd Session, May 23, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; No action was taken on the resolution.

An article by three law students, published in the ''William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law'' in 1997&lt;ref&gt;Allison Held, Sheryl L. Herndon, and Danielle M. Stager; The Equal Rights Amendment: Why the ERA Remains Legally Viable and Properly Before the States, William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law (Vol. 3, Issue 1, Spring 1997), 113-136. [http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/viability.htm Article and Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; explained a legal rationale for the "three-state strategy." It argued that:
#The 35 ratifications from state legislatures during the 1970s remain valid;
#Rescissions of prior ratifications are ''not'' constitutional;
#The 1978 extension of the ERA's deadline demonstrates that Congress can amend previously established deadlines; and
#The [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty seventh Amendment's]] more than 202 year ratification period set a standard of "sufficiently contemporaneous"—a term used during the U.S. Supreme Court's 1921 ruling in ''[[Dillon v. Gloss]]''—giving Congress the power to set time limits on constitutional amendments. ''Dillon v. Gloss'' was later modified by ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'', which is also a basis for the ''three state strategy''.

The article further reasoned that because [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Proposal|Article V of the Constitution]] gives the Congress the power to propose amendments to the Constitution—and including changing aspects of the ratification process itself— that if and when three additional states ratify the ERA, the Congress has the power to deem the ERA properly ratified and duly added to the Constitution.

In 1996, the [[Library of Congress]]' [[Congressional Research Service]] issued a report that said, "There is no precedent for Congress promulgating an amendment based on state ratifications adopted after a ratification deadline has expired. However, proponents of this course cite as possible precedent the ratification activity of the states regarding the 27th Amendment... proponents of the ERA might wish to adopt a strategy of urging its ratification by state legislatures because their actions might prompt this or a future Congress to proclaim the amendment had been ratified." CRS stressed that it "takes no position on any of the issues."&lt;ref&gt;"Memorandum: Equal Rights Amendment: Ratification Issues", by David C. Huckabee. Specialist in American National Government, Government Division, The Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service. March 18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a resolution failed in Arkansas after 20 legislators withdrew their co-sponsorships of the resolution. [[Pro-life movement|Pro-life groups]] claimed the withdrawals were due in part to their intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/Federal/era/ArkansasERADefeated.html "Effort to revive federal E.R.A. suffers stunning setback, as Arkansas House committee votes down ratification resolution,"] National Right to Life Committee, February 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2009, [[National Organization for Women|NOW]] resolved to support both the three-state strategy and any strategy to submit a new ERA to the states for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 National NOW Conference Resolutions: Equal Rights Amendment|url=http://www.now.org/organization/conference/resolutions/2009.html|date=June 21, 2009|publisher=National Organization for Women|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2009, at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol to announce the reintroduction of the ERA in Congress, activists supporting the three-state strategy distributed a flyer (hosted by the NRLC) opposing reintroduction, saying "this is not the time to start over and ignore the work ERA advocates have already done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3 State Flyer Against Maloney|url=http://www.nrlc.org/Federal/ERA/3StateFlyerAgainstMaloneyERA0709.pdf|format=PDF|date=July 2009|publisher=National Right to Life Committee|accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the three-state strategy point out that the 1789 resolution proposing what is known today as the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]] ("Madison Amendment"), dealing with congressional pay raises, did not contain a deadline for ratification. This amendment was ratified in 1992, 203 years after its passage by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.eraflorida.org/era/faq.cfm|publisher=ERA Florida (Mediawise

==Criticism of the ERA==
One criticism of the ERA was that it would have been superfluous, claiming it would not have provided women with any more rights than they already have under the Constitution. According to a 1986 report of the [[Eagle Forum]], "the ERA advocates were unable to show any way that ERA would benefit women or end any discrimination against them" arguing "that women already enjoy every constitutional right that men enjoy and have enjoyed equal employment opportunity since 1964."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eagleforum.org/psr/1986/sept86/psrsep86.html The Phyllis Schlafly Report - A Short History of E.R.A.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of the ERA was that its passage would have had far-reaching implications, obliterating traditional distinctions between the sexes.  According to this criticism, women would be required to register for the [[Selective Service System|draft]] and would have to serve in [[combat]], just as men must. Also according to this criticism, the ERA would have also removed [[law]]s that specially protect women, such as [[Labour law|labor laws]] in heavy industry. Some women in the 1970s feared that passage of the ERA would prevent them from being favored for [[alimony]] and custody in [[divorce]] cases.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt;

===Opposition from women union members===
Pre-1960s proponents of the ERA consisted of a small group of women interested in “the formal legal and property rights most relevant for women of their standing.”&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Linda. Between Feminism and Labor: The Significance of the Comparable Worth Movement. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991.pg 36&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the law and medical professions, as well as members of the National Federation of [[Business and Professional Women]], collaborated with the [[National Woman's Party]] in support of the ERA. These highly educated women did not share the same interests as the [[working class]] women who opposed the ERA. They were interested in prohibiting discrimination in the elite male professions in which they were employed.&lt;ref&gt;Blum 1991, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the ERA, employed in the industrial sector, feared the passage of the amendment would nullify protective labor laws for women. Members of the [[Women's Trade Union League]] put immense effort into fighting the ERA in an effort to preserve their hard-fought-for legal protections.

===Abortion-related laws===
Especially since the early 1980s, the potential impact of the ERA on [[abortion]]-related laws has become a major factor in the ERA debate. On November 15, 1983, the majority (Democratic) leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives attempted to again pass the ERA (to begin the entire ratification process over again), under a procedure that did not allow consideration of any amendments. The ERA fell short of the required two-thirds vote (278-147) when 14 co-sponsors voted against it, many of them insisting on the need for an "abortion-neutral" amendment proposed by Representative [[Jim Sensenbrenner]], which read, "Nothing in this Article shall be construed to grant, secure, or deny any right relating to abortion or the funding thereof." Neither House of the Congress has voted on any ERA since that day.

The ERA-abortion issue was further fueled by the use of ERAs in state constitutions in lawsuits attacking [[pro-life]] policies in some states. ERA-based efforts to invalidate restrictions on tax-funded abortions succeeded in [[Connecticut]] and, especially, in [[New Mexico]]. On November 25, 1998, the [[New Mexico Supreme Court]] ruled 5-0 that the state ERA — very similar to the proposed federal ERA — prohibited the state from restricting abortion differently from "medically necessary procedures" sought by men, and the court ordered the state to pay for abortions under the state's [[Medicaid]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=New Mexico Right to Choose/NARAL v. Johnson|opinion=1999-NMSC-005|court=Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico|date=1998-11-25|url=http://www.supremecourt.nm.org./pastopinion/VIEW/99sc-005.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its ruling, the court adopted the construction of the ERA urged in the case by the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]], [[Planned Parenthood]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy (currently the Center for Reproductive Rights), and the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. The doctrine that the ERA language invalidates limitations on tax-funded abortion was also supported in briefs filed by the state Women's Bar Association, Public Health Association, and [[League of Women Voters]]. This ruling is now often cited by pro-life groups in debates over ERAs in Congress and various legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/Federal/era/ERAabortionNRLCtoHouse2009.pdf Letter from National Right to Life to members of Congress], opposing ERA without "abortion-neutral amendment," July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
