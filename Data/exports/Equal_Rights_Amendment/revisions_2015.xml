The '''Equal Rights Amendment''' ('''ERA''') was a [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Proposing amendments|proposed amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] designed to guarantee [[Gender equality|equal rights for women]]. The ERA was originally written by [[Alice Paul]] and [[Crystal Eastman]]. In 1923, it was introduced in the Congress for the first time. The ERA has always been highly controversial regarding the meaning of equality for women. It was "feminist against feminist," says historian Judith Sealander; the result was the eventual defeat of the ERA.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Sealander, "Feminist Against Feminist: The First Phase of the Equal Rights Amendment Debate, 1923-1963," ''South Atlantic Quarterly'' (1982) 81#2 pp 147-161&lt;/ref&gt; Middle-class women generally were supportive. Those speaking for the working class were strongly opposed, arguing that employed women needed special protections regarding working conditions and hours. In 1972, it passed both houses of Congress and was submitted to the state legislatures for ratification. It seemed headed for quick approval until [[Phyllis Schlafly]] mobilized conservative women in opposition, arguing that the ERA would disadvantage housewives.

Congress had set a ratification deadline of March 22, 1979. Through 1977, the amendment received 35 of the necessary 38 state [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification of amendments|ratifications]]. Five states later rescinded their ratifications before the 1979 deadline. In 1978, a joint resolution of Congress extended the ratification deadline to June 30, 1982, but no further states ratified the amendment and it died. Several organizations continue to work for the adoption of the ERA.

==Background==
Following the 1920 ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]], which granted [[Women's suffrage|women]] throughout the United States the unabridged [[Suffrage|right to vote]], [[Alice Paul]], a [[suffragist]] leader, argued that this right alone would not end [[discrimination]] based upon sex. Paul drafted the Equal Rights Amendment and, in 1923, presented it as the "[[Lucretia Mott]] Amendment" at the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the 1848 [[Seneca Falls Convention]] and the [[Declaration of Sentiments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alicepaul.org/alicep3.htm Alice Paul bio 3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.

===Feminists split===
Since the 1920s the Equal Rights Amendment has caused  a sharp split among feminists about the meaning of women's equality.  [[Alice Paul]] and her [[National Woman's Party]] was the leading proponent, arguing that women should be on equal terms with men in all regards, even if that means sacrificing certain benefits given to women through protective legislation, such as shorter work hours and no night work or heavy lifting.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Cott, "Feminist Politics in the 1920s: The National Woman's Party," ''Journal of American History'' (1984( 71#1 pp: 43-68. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1899833 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Feminist opponents of the amendment, such as the [[Women's Joint Congressional Committee]], believed that these gender-based benefits protected women and that the loss of such protection would not be worth the supposed gain in equality. In general, middle-class elements supported the ERA, and working-class elements (and the labor movement) opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Cott, "Historical Perspectives: The Equal Rights Amendment Conflict in the 1920s." in Marianne Hirsch and Evelyn Fox Keller eds., ''Conflicts in Feminism,'' (Routledge, 1990) ch 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, ''The Forum'' hosted a debate between [[Doris Stevens]] and [[Alice Hamilton]] concerning these two perspectives on the proposed amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Ware, ed., "New Dilemmas for Modern Women," ''Modern American Women: A Documentary History'' (McGraw-Hill Higher Education, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Their debate reflected the wider tension in the developing feminist movement of the early 20th century between two approaches towards the equality of gender. One approach emphasized shared similarities between the sexes and demanded rights based on women's humanity. The other approach emphasized women's unique experiences and how they were different from men to obtain recognition for their specific needs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy Cott]], ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism'' (Yale University Press, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Woman's Party]] already had tested its approach in Wisconsin, where it won the first state ERA in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Genevieve G. McBride, "'Forward' Women: Winning the Wisconsin Campaign for the Country's First ERA, 1921," in Peter G. Watson Boone, ed., ''The Quest for Social Justice III: The Morris Fromkin Memorial Lectures, 1992–2002'' (Milwaukee: University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Keetley|editor1-first=Dawn|editor2-last=Pettegrew|editor2-first=John|title=Public Women, Public Words: A Documentary History of American Feminism, Volume II: 1900 to 1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3H087kqzlUC&amp;pg=PA284|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|pages=284–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then took the proposed federal ERA to Congress in the 1920s, where Senator [[Charles Curtis]], a future Vice President, and Representative [[Daniel Read Anthony, Jr.|Daniel R. Anthony, Jr.]]—[[Susan B. Anthony]]'s nephew, both Kansas Republicans, introduced it for the first time as Senate Joint Resolution No. 21 on December 10, 1923, and as House Joint Resolution No. 75 on December 13, 1923, respectively. Though the ERA was introduced in every Congressional session between 1923 and 1970, it almost never reached the floor of either the Senate or the House for a vote—instead, it was usually "bottled up" in committee; except in 1946, when it was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 38 to 35.

===Hayden rider and protective labor legislation===
In 1950 and 1953, ERA was passed by the Senate with the Hayden rider, making it unacceptable to ERA supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt6f59n89c&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text|title=Conversations with Alice Paul: Woman Suffrage and the Equal Rights Amendment.|website=cdlib.org|publisher=Suffragists Oral History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/eraname.htm|title=What's in a Name? Does it matter how the Equal Rights Amendment is worded?|work=jofreeman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Women's Bureau wanted to keep special protections for women and so it drafted the Hayden rider, which added a new section to the ERA stating: "The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions now or hereafter conferred by law upon persons of the female sex." That is, women could keep their existing and future special protections that men did not have. Supporters of an unaltered ERA rejected the Hayden rider, believing an ERA containing the rider did not provide for equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cynthia Ellen Harrison|title=On Account of Sex: The Politics of Women's Issues, 1945-1968|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AXlSB6-WpKUC&amp;pg=PA31|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] asked a [[joint session of Congress]] to pass the Equal Rights Amendment, the first President to show such a level of support for the amendment. However, whenever the ERA was proposed the Hayden rider was added; this would make the amendment unacceptable to the National Woman's Party, which would then ask that the ERA be withdrawn.

The Republican Party included support of the ERA in its platform beginning in [[1940 Republican National Convention|1940]], renewing the plank every four years until [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]].&lt;ref name="'70s 245"&gt;{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last=Frum|first=David|authorlink=David Frum|year=2000|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-465-04195-7|pages=245–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ERA was strongly opposed by the [[American Federation of Labor]] and other labor unions, who feared the amendment would invalidate protective labor legislation for women. The Equal Rights Amendment was also opposed by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and most [[New Deal]]ers. They felt that ERA was designed for middle class women but that working class women needed government protection. They feared that ERA would undercut the male-dominated labor unions that were a core component of the [[New Deal coalition]]. Most northern Democrats, who aligned themselves with the anti-ERA labor unions, opposed the amendment.&lt;ref name="'70s 245" /&gt; The ERA was supported by southern Democrats and almost all Republicans.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt;

At the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]], the Democrats made the divisive step of including the ERA in their platform, but the Democratic Party did not become united in favor of the amendment until Congressional passage in 1972.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt; The main support base for the ERA until the late 1960s was among middle class Republican women. The [[League of Women Voters]], formerly the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], opposed the Equal Rights Amendment until 1972, fearing the loss of protective labor legislation.

===1960s===
[[File:Esther Peterson 1962.jpg|thumb|125px|Esther Peterson, a Kennedy appointee, opposed the ERA and preferred adoption of "specific bills for specific ills."]]
At the Democratic National Convention in 1960, a proposal to endorse the ERA was rejected after it met explicit opposition from liberal groups including labor unions, AFL-CIO, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), American Federation of Teachers, American Nurses Association, the Women's Division of the Methodist Church, and the National Councils of Jewish, Catholic, and Negro Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jo Freeman|title=A Room at a Time: How Women Entered Party Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LF8ov6Vc4YQC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9805-9|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The losing side then demanded that presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] announce his support the ERA; he did so in an October 21, 1960, letter to the chairman of the National Woman's Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=74146|author=Kennedy, John F|date=October 21, 1960|title=Letter to Mrs. Emma Guffey Miller, Chairman of the National Woman's Party|website=ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was elected and made [[Esther Peterson]] the highest-ranking woman in his administration. Peterson publicly opposed the Equal Rights Amendment based on her belief that it would weaken protective labor legislation.&lt;ref name="fofweb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=awhm0502&amp;DataType=Women&amp;WinType=Free|title=Peterson, Esther Eggertsen|work=Facts on File History Database|publisher=Infobase Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson referred to the National Woman's Party members, most of them veteran suffragists and preferred the "specific bills for specific ills" approach to equal rights.&lt;ref name="fofweb.com"/&gt; Ultimately, Kennedy's ties to labor unions meant he and his administration did not support the ERA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph M. Siracusa|title=Encyclopedia of the Kennedys: The People and Events That Shaped America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEojQDou7MIC&amp;pg=PA864|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a concession to feminists, Kennedy appointed a [[Blue-ribbon panel|blue-ribbon commission]] on women, the [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women|President's Commission on the Status of Women]], to investigate the problem of sex discrimination in the United States. The Commission was chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt who opposed the ERA but no longer spoke against it. In the early 1960s, Roosevelt announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA was no longer a threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that they could have the amendment if they wanted it. However she never endorsed the ERA. The Commission she chaired reported (after her death) that no ERA was needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurine Hoffman Beasley|title=Eleanor Roosevelt and the Media: A Public Quest for Self-fulfillment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55XG0oS3XyYC&amp;pg=PA184|year=1987|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commission helped win passage of the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] which banned sex discrimination in pay in a number of professions (it would later be amended in the early 1970s to include the professions it initially excluded) and secured an Executive Order from Kennedy eliminating sex discrimination in the [[civil service]]. The commission, made largely of anti-ERA feminists with ties to labor, proposed remedies to the widespread sex discrimination it unearthed and in its 1963 final report held that on the issue of equality "a constitutional amendment need not now be sought".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Keetley|editor1-first=Dawn|editor2-last=Pettegrew|editor2-first=John|title=Public Women, Public Words: A Documentary History of American Feminism, Volume III: 1960 to the Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDd2aNCoGlYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission established state and local commissions on the status of women and arranged for follow-up conferences in the years to come. The following year, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] banned workplace discrimination not only on the basis of race, religion, and national origin, but also on the basis of sex, thanks to the lobbying of [[Alice Paul]] and [[Coretta Scott King]] and the skillful politicking of Representative [[Martha W. Griffiths]] of [[Michigan]].

A new women's movement gained ground in the later 1960s as a result of a variety of factors: [[Betty Friedan]]'s bestseller ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''; the network of women's rights commissions formed by Kennedy's national commission; the frustration over women's social and economic status; and anger over the lack of government and [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] enforcement of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII the Civil Rights Act. In June 1966, at the Third National Conference on the Status of Women in [[Washington, D.C.]], Betty Friedan and a group of activists frustrated with the lack of government action in enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act formed the [[National Organization for Women]] to act as an "[[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] for women", demanding full equality for American women. In 1967, at the urging of Alice Paul, NOW endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment. The decision caused some union Democrats and social conservatives to leave the organization and form the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (within a few years WEAL also endorsed the ERA), but the move to support the amendment benefited NOW, bolstering its membership. By the late 1960s NOW had made significant political and legislative victories and was gaining enough power to become a major lobbying force. In 1969, newly elected Representative [[Shirley Chisholm]] of [[New York]] gave her famous speech "Equal Rights for Women" on the floor of Congress.

==Congressional passage==
[[File:Martha Griffiths.jpg|thumb|125px|U.S. Representative [[Martha Griffiths]] championed the ERA]]
In February 1970, NOW picketed the United States Senate, a subcommittee of which was holding hearings on a Constitutional amendment to lower the voting age to eighteen. NOW disrupted the hearings and demanded a hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment and won a meeting with Senators to discuss the ERA. That August, over 20,000 American women held a nationwide [[Women's Strike for Equality]] protest to demand full social, economic, and political equality.&lt;ref name=wommarch&gt;[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902696,00.html/ Nation, Women on ] ''Time'' (New York), September 7, 1970 {{wayback|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902696,00.html/ |date=20150406112028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Said Friedan of the strike, "All kinds of women's groups all over the country will be using this week on August 26 particularly, to point out those areas in women's life which are still not addressed. For example, a question of equality before the law; we are interested in the Equal Rights Amendment." Despite being centered in New York City—which was regarded as one of the biggest strongholds for NOW and other groups sympathetic to the [[women's liberation movement]] such as [[Redstockings]]&lt;ref name=femis209&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rk966-N_rh0C&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=women's+strike+for+equality+nation+second+wave+feminism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uHtNGnwy0U&amp;sig=0-Wy0f2zpE9LZtR9lsDA1WGYHqQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GYsgU4GEL5SfqAGN2oDABg&amp;ved=0CHAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=women's%20strike%20for%20equality%20nation%20second%20wave%20feminism&amp;f=false|title=Becoming The Feminist Subject.

In Washington, D.C., protesters presented a sympathetic Senate leadership with a petition for the Equal Rights Amendment at the U.S. Capitol. Influential news sources such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' also supported the cause of the protestors.&lt;ref name=wommarch /&gt; Soon after the strike took place, activists distributed literature across the country as well.&lt;ref name=femis209 /&gt; In 1970, Congressional hearings began on the ERA.

Representative Martha Griffiths of Michigan achieved success on Capitol Hill with her House Joint Resolution No. 208, which was adopted by the House on October 12, 1971, with a vote of 354 yeas, 24 nays and 51 not voting.&lt;ref&gt;117 ''Congressional Record'' 35815&lt;/ref&gt; Griffiths's joint resolution was then adopted by the Senate on March 22, 1972, with a vote of 84 yeas, 8 nays and 7 not voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/congressionalrec118funit#page/n93/mode/2up|title=Congressional record|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate version, drafted by Senator [[Birch Bayh]] of Indiana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cruikshank|first=Kate|title=The Art of Leadership: A Companion to an Exhibition from the Senatorial Papers of Birch Bayh, United States Senator from Indiana, 1963–1980|url=http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=8621|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed after an amendment proposed by Senator [[Sam Ervin]] of North Carolina that would exempt women from the [[Conscription|draft]] was defeated.&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt; President [[Richard Nixon]] immediately endorsed the ERA's approval upon its passage by the [[92nd United States Congress|92nd Congress]].&lt;ref name="'70s 245"/&gt;

===Ratifications 1972–1977===
The initial pace of ratifications was rapid; 30 states had done so by the end of 1973. The rate of ratification then slowed considerably. Only 5 more states ratified the ERA over the course of the ensuing 4 years, with none coming after 1977. The ERA was three states shy of the necessary 38 ratifications as the March 22, 1979, ratification deadline approached.

As of that original deadline the ERA had been ratified by the following states:&lt;ref&gt;Gladstone, Leslie W. ''CRS Report 85-154 GOV: The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment''. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ratifications rescinded 1973–1979===
Legislators in the following states voted to rescind their earlier ratification of the ERA:&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, Orrin G. (1983). "The Equal Rights Amendment: Myths and Realities".&lt;/ref&gt;
# Nebraska (March 15, 1973 – Legislative Resolution No. 9)&lt;br&gt;In 1972, the Nebraska Legislature adopted the improperly-worded Legislative Resolution No. 83 followed by correctly-worded Legislative Resolution No. 86, to ratify ERA. In 1973, the Nebraska Legislature then adopted Legislative Resolution No. 9 to rescind ''only'' the aforementioned improperly-worded LR No. 83. This may mean that Nebraska—technically—did not rescind its 1972 ERA ratification.&lt;ref name="St. Petersburg Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AsAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MWADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7123,2017809&amp;dq=equal+rights+amendment+nebraska|title=Retraction Issue Crucial to Equal Rights Bill|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=March 23, 1973}}{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Kentucky (March 17, 1978 – House (Joint) Resolution No. 2 and House (Joint) Resolution No. 20)&lt;br&gt;The [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky]], [[Thelma Stovall]], who was acting as governor in the Governor's absence, [[Veto#United States|vetoed]] the rescinding resolution.
# South Dakota (March 1, 1979 – Senate Joint Resolution No. 1 and Senate Joint Resolution No. 2)&lt;br&gt;Senate Joint Resolution No. 2, while not going quite so far as to rescind its prior ratification of ERA, stipulated that the ERA's opportunity for ratification—by ''any'' state of the Union—would expire on March 22, 1979; furthermore, Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 made clear that South Dakota's own ratification of the ERA would only be valid up until March 22, 1979, and that any ratification activities transpiring after that date ''anywhere else'' would be considered by South Dakota to be null and void.

The Constitution is silent regarding whether the governor of a state has any authority regarding whether that state ratifies an amendment to the Constitution. The Constitution is likewise silent regarding a state's authority to rescind its ratification of a proposed, but not yet adopted, constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-5/02-proposing-a-constitutional-amendment.html|title=Authentication and Proclamation: Proposing a Constitutional Amendment|publisher=Justia|accessdate=July 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejecting states with one-house approval===
At various times, in 9 of the 15 non-ratifying states, at least one house of the legislature approved the ERA. It failed in those states, because both houses have to approve during the same session.
# Florida – House of Representatives voted to ratify the ERA on March 24, 1972, with a tally of 91 to 4; a second time on April 10, 1975, with a tally of 62 to 58; a third time on May 17, 1979, with a tally of 66 to 53; and a fourth time on June 21, 1982, with a tally of 60 to 58.&lt;ref&gt;Joan S. Carver, "The Equal Rights Amendment and the Florida Legislature," ''Florida Historical Quarterly'' (1982) 60#4 pp 455-481. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congressional extension of ratification deadline==
In 1978—as the 1979 deadline approached—the [[95th United States Congress|95th Congress]] adopted House Joint Resolution No. 638 (H. J. Res. 638), by Representative [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] of [[New York]], which purported to extend the ERA's ratification deadline to June 30, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 92, ''United States Statutes At Large,'' page 3799&lt;/ref&gt; H. J. Res. 638 received less than two-thirds of the vote (a [[majority|simple majority]], not a [[supermajority]]) in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; for that reason, ERA supporters deemed it necessary that H. J. Res. 638 be transmitted to then President [[Jimmy Carter]] for signature as a safety precaution. Carter signed the joint resolution, though he questioned&amp;mdash;on procedural grounds&amp;mdash;the propriety of his doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Equal_Rights_Amendment_-_Extension_of_ratification_deadline/id/1367020 Equal Rights Amendment - Extension of ratification deadline]&lt;/ref&gt; During this disputed extension, no additional states ratified or [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Rescinding a ratification|rescinded]].
[[File:Photograph of Jimmy Carter Signing Extension of Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) Ratification, 10-20-1978.jpg|thumb|275px|left|President Carter signing the extension]]
No additional states ratified the ERA during that extra period of slightly more than three years. On June 18, 1980, a resolution in the Illinois House of Representatives resulted in a vote of 102-71 in favor, but Illinois required a three-fifths majority on constitutional amendments and so the measure failed by five votes. In 1982, seven female ERA supporters went on a hunger strike and seventeen chained themselves to the door of the Illinois senate chamber; none of this resulted in any state ratifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=O'Dea, Suzanne |title=From Suffrage to the Senate: An Encyclopedia of American Women in Politics, Volume 1 |date=1999 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=244 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Si6ZVqdOqIgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closest the ERA came to gaining an additional ratification between the original deadline of March 22, 1979 and the revised June 30, 1982, expiration date was when it was approved by the [[Florida House of Representatives]] on June 21, 1982. In the final week before the deadline, that ratifying resolution was defeated in the [[Florida Senate]] by a vote of 16 yeas and 22 nays. Even if Florida had ratified the ERA, the proposed amendment would still have been two states short of the required 38 (seven states short if the rescissions were valid).

According to research by Professor Jules B. Gerard, professor of law at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], of the 35 legislatures that passed ratification resolutions, 24 explicitly referred to the 1979 deadline.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to House Judiciary Committee, June 14, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the courts ==
On December 23, 1981, in ''Idaho v. Freeman'', the [[United States District Court for the District of Idaho]] ruled that the rescissions—all of which occurred before the original 1979 ratification deadline—were valid and that the ERA's deadline extension was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/Federal/era/IdahovFreeman.pdf ''Idaho v. Freeman''], U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, Civ. No. 79-1097, 529 F. Supp. 1107, December 23, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Organization for Women]] appealed both rulings. The [[General Services Administration|Administrator of General Services]] noted that the ERA had not received the required number of ratifications (38), so that "the Amendment has failed of adoption no matter what the resolution of the legal issues presented here."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eagleforum.org/era/now-v-idaho-memo.html Memorandum of Gerald P. Carmen, Administrator of General Services], July 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, 1982, in ''NOW v. Idaho'', 459 U.S. 809 (1982), the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the ruling in ''Idaho v. Freeman'' and declared the entire matter [[Mootness|moot]] on the grounds that the ERA was dead for the reason given by the Administrator of General Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eagleforum.org/era/now-v-idaho.html|title=Now v. Idaho|work=eagleforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the ERA==
Opponents of the ERA focused on traditional gender roles, such as how men do the fighting in wartime. They pointed out that the amendment would eliminate the men-only draft requirement and guarantee the possibility that women would be subject to [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] and be required to have military combat roles in future wars if it were passed. Defense of traditional [[gender role]]s proved to be a useful tactic. In Illinois, supporters of [[Phyllis Schlafly]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Republican activist from Illinois, used traditional symbols of the American housewife. They took homemade bread, jams, and apple pies to the state legislators, with the slogans, "Preserve us from a congressional jam; Vote against the ERA sham" and "I am for Mom and apple pie."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg225&gt;{{cite book |author=Rosenberg, Rosalind |title=Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century |date=2008 |publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |page=225 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-GMcnUaLhEC&amp;pg=PA225}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appealed to married women by stressing that the amendment would repeal protective laws such as alimony and eliminate the tendency for mothers to obtain custody over their children in divorce cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rhode, Deborah L. |title=Justice and Gender: Sex Discrimination and the Law |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1qosJPdqPkC&amp;pg=PA66 |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that single-sex bathrooms would be eliminated if the amendment were passed as well. Traditional women started to oppose the ERA.&lt;ref name=kllap&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/57c.asp |title=The Equal Rights Amendment |website=ushistory.org |publisher=Independence Hall Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlafly said the ERA was designed for the benefit of young career women and warned that if men and women had to be treated identically it would threaten the security of middle-aged housewives with no job skills. They could no longer count on alimony. Women's colleges would have to admit men. Her argument that protective laws would be lost resonated with working-class women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosenberg, Rosalind |title=Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-GMcnUaLhEC&amp;pg=PA225|date=2008|pages=225–26|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1980 Republican National Convention]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] platform was amended to end its support for the ERA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perlez|first=Jane|title=Plan to omit rights amendment from platform brings objections|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/17/us/plan-to-omit-rights-amendment-from-platform-brings-objections.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=July 24, 2013|date=May 17, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent opponent of the ERA was Schlafly. Leading the Stop ERA campaign, Schlafly defended traditional gender roles and would often bait feminists by opening her speeches with lines like, "I'd like to thank my husband for letting me be here tonight-- I always like to say that, because it makes the libs so mad."&lt;ref&gt;Critchlow, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; When Schlafly began her campaign in 1972, public polls showed support for the amendment was widely popular and thirty states had ratified the amendment by 1973. After 1973, the number of ratifying states slowed to a trickle. Support in the states that had not ratified fell below 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Jane J. Mansbridge, ''Why we lost the ERA'' (University of Chicago Press, 1986) p 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Critchlow and Stachecki argue that public opinion in key states shifted against the ERA as opponents, operating on the local and state levels, won over the public. The state legislators in battleground states followed public opinion in rejecting the ERA.

[[File:Phyllis Schlafly by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|120px|right|[[Phyllis Schlafly]], a conservative activist, organized opposition to the ERA and argued that it "would lead to women being drafted by the military and to public unisex bathrooms."&lt;ref name=eilperin&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/27/AR2007032702357_pf.html|work=The Washington Post|title=New Drive Afoot to Pass Equal Rights Amendment|first=Juliet|last=Eilperin|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Experts agree that Phyllis Schlafly was a key player in the defeat. Political scientist Jane J. Mansbridge in her history of the ERA argues that the draft issue was the single most powerful argument used by Schlafly and the other opponents to defeat ERA.&lt;ref&gt;Jane  Mansbridge, "Who's in Charge Here? Decision by Accretion and Gatekeeping in the Struggle for the ERA," ''Politics &amp; Society'' (1984) 13#4 pp 343-382.&lt;/ref&gt; She concludes: 
:Many people who followed the struggle over the ERA believed—rightly in my view—that the Amendment would have been ratified by 1975 or 1976 had it not been for Phyllis Schlafly's early and effective effort to organize potential opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Mansbridge, ''Why we lost the ERA'' (1986) p 110.&lt;/ref&gt;
Joan Williams argues, "ERA was defeated when Schlafly turned it into a war among women over gender roles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Joan|title=Unbending Gender: Why Family and Work Conflict and What To Do About It|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxtNubyWAEMC&amp;pg=PA147|year=1999|publisher=Oxford UP|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Judith Glazer-Raymo argues:
:As moderates, we thought we represented the forces of reason and goodwill but failed to take seriously the power of the family values argument and the single-mindedness of Schlafly and her followers. The ERA's defeat seriously damaged the women's movement, destroying its momentum and its potential to foment social change....Eventually, this resulted in feminist dissatisfaction with the Republican Party, giving the Democrats a new source of strength that when combined with overwhelming minority support, helped elect Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992 and again in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glazer-Raymo|first=Judith|title=Shattering the Myths: Women in Academe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTWzBcW07RwC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins UP|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:STOP ERA.gif|100px|thumb|Symbol used for signs and buttons by opponents]]

Many ERA supporters blamed their defeat on [[Advocacy group|special interest]] forces, especially the insurance industry and conservative organizations, suggesting they funded an opposition that subverted the democratic process and the will of the pro-ERA majority.&lt;ref&gt;Critchlow and Stachecki (2008). ''The Equal Rights Amendment Reconsidered''. pp. 157-8&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that while the public face of the anti-ERA movement was Phyllis Schlafly and her STOP ERA organization, there were other important groups in the opposition as well, such as the powerful National Council of Catholic Women, [[Social feminism|labor feminists]], and (until 1973) the [[AFL–CIO]]. Opposition to the amendment was particularly high among religious conservatives, who argued that the amendment would guarantee universal abortion rights and the right for homosexual couples to marry.&lt;ref name="Francis ERA History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/history.htm |author=Francis, Roberta W. |title=The History Behind the Equal Rights Amendment |website=equalrightsamendment.org |publisher=Alice Paul Institute |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David W. Brady and Kent L. Tedin, "Ladies in Pink: Religion and Political Ideology in the Anti-ERA Movement,". ''Social Science Quarterly'' (1976) 56#4 pp 564-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Critchlow and Stachecki say the anti-ERA movement was based on strong support among Southern whites, Evangelical Christians, Mormons, Orthodox Jews, and Roman Catholics, including both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Critchlow and Stachecki (2008). ''The Equal Rights Amendment Reconsidered''. p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three-state strategy==

Beginning in the mid 1990s, a few proponents of the ERA launched a ''three-state strategy'' to win ratification of the ERA by the legislatures of states that did not ratify it in 1972&amp;ndash;1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three-State Strategy|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/strategy.htm|publisher=Alice Paul Institute in collaboration with the ERA Task Force of the National Council of Women's Organizations|accessdate=April 25, 2014|author=Francis, Roberta W.|website=equalrightsamendment.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the three-state strategy have promoted ratification resolutions in the legislatures of most of the 15 states that never ratified the ERA approved by Congress in 1972. Ratification resolutions have been introduced in several state legislatures, but not one state has given it approval.&lt;ref&gt;"Memorandum: Equal Rights Amendment: Ratification Issues", by David C. Huckabee. Specialist in American National Government, Government Division, The Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service. March 18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2009, the [[National Organization for Women]] resolved to support both the three-state strategy and any strategy to submit a new ERA to the states for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 National NOW Conference Resolutions: Equal Rights Amendment|url=http://www.now.org/organization/conference/resolutions/2009.html|date=June 21, 2009|publisher=National Organization for Women|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[Congressional Research Service]] issued a report that said, "ERA proponents claim that the Supreme Court’s decision in ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]'' gives Congress wide discretion in setting conditions for the ratification process." It also states that "Revivification opponents caution ERA supporters against an overly broad interpretation of ''Coleman v. Miller'', which, they argue, may have been be a politically influenced decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42979.pdf|format=PDF|author=Neale, Thomas H.|date=9 May 2013|title=The Proposed Equal Rights Amendment: Contemporary Ratification Issues|publisher=Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent congressional action==

The amendment has been reintroduced in every session of Congress since 1982. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] (D-MA) championed it in the Senate during the [[99th United States Congress|99th Congress]] through the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]]. Senator [[Robert Menendez]] (D-NJ) introduced the amendment symbolically at the end of the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] and has supported it in the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]]. In the House of Representatives, [[Carolyn B. Maloney]] (D-NY) has sponsored it since the [[105th United States Congress|105th Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Equal Rights Amendment: 111th Congress|url=http://maloney.house.gov/sites/maloney.house.gov/files/documents/women/era/AUGUST%2012%20Facts%20About%20the%20ERA%20in%20the%20111th%20Congress.pdf|format=PDF|date=July 13, 2009|website=maloney.house.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; most recently in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:h.j.res.56:|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status  113th Congress (2013 - 2014) H.J.RES.56 |website=loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the ERA passed through House committees with the same text as in 1972; however, it failed by six votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote on the House floor. That was the last time that the ERA received a floor vote in the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RD3wqORd9jMC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;lpg=PA308&amp;dq=1983+%22equal+rights+amendment%22+%22six+votes%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lz_WK1Sgkj&amp;sig=NPMx_gOnHO4VAM84GnBZ3dKtrb8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wahJTcuCKIWclge_7Lj6Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=1983%20%22equal%20rights%20amendment%22%20%22six%20votes%22&amp;f=false|author=Randall, Vicky|title=Women and Politics: An International Perspective|page=308|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 112th Congress on January 6, 2011, Senator Menendez, along with Representatives Maloney, [[Jerrold Nadler]] and [[Gwen Moore]], held a press conference advocating for the Equal Rights Amendment's adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://maloney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/constitution-read-aloud-maloney-menendez-nadler-moore-cite-need-equal-rights-amendment|title=As Constitution is read aloud, Maloney, Menendez, Nadler, Moore cite need for Equal Rights Amendment|date=January 6, 2011|website=maloney.house.gov|accessdate=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[113th United States Congress|113th Congress]] had a record number of women. On March 5, 2013, the ERA was reintroduced as S. J.

===Proposed removal of ratification deadline===

On March 8, 2011, the 100th Anniversary of International Women's Day, Representative [[Tammy Baldwin]] (D-WI) introduced legislation (H.J.Res. 47) to remove the Congressionally imposed deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=229427|title=U.S. Rep.

On March 22, 2012, the 40th anniversary of ERA's congressional approval, Senator [[Benjamin L. Cardin]] (D-MD) introduced (S.J. Res. 39)--which is worded with slight differences from Representative Baldwin's (H.J. Res. 47). Senator Cardin was joined by ten other Senators who added their names to the Senate Joint Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/39/all-info|title=All Bill Information (Except Text) for S.J.Res.39 - A joint resolution removing the deadline for the ratification of the equal rights amendment|website=congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 2013, the [[New Mexico House of Representatives]] adopted House Memorial 7 asking, also, that the Congressionally imposed deadline for ERA ratification be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/13%20Regular/memorials/house/HM007.pdf|format=PDF|title=House Memorial 7|author=51st Legislature, State of New Mexico, First Session, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsun-news.com/las_cruces-news/ci_22568975/roundhouse-roundup-feb-11-2013|title=Roundhouse roundup, Feb. 11, 2013|work=Las Cruces Sun-News}}&lt;/ref&gt; House Memorial 7 was officially received by the U.S. House of Representatives on April 25, 2013, and was referred to the House's Committee on the Judiciary, as noted in the ''[[Congressional Record]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.congress.gov/crec/2013/04/25/CREC-2013-04-25-pt1-PgH2352.pdf|format=PDF|author=113th Congress, 1st Session

==State Equal Rights Amendments==
{{See also|State Equal Rights Amendments}}

Eleven states have adopted constitutions or constitutional amendments providing that equal rights under the law shall not be denied because of sex. Most of these provisions mirror the broad language of the ERA, while the wording in others resembles the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs7397/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20217_2004Aug23.pdf|title=Equal Rights Amendment: State Provisions|last=Gladstone|first=Leslie|date=August 23, 2004|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, the state actions do not change the federal draft laws that proved one of the stumbling blocks to passage of the national ERA. The 1879 [[Constitution of California]] contains the earliest state equal rights provision on record. Narrowly written, it limits the equal rights conferred to "entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment." Near the end of the 19th century two more states, Wyoming (1890) and Utah (1896), included equal rights provisions in their constitutions. These provisions were broadly written to insure political and civil equality to women.&lt;ref name="CRSReport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Equal Rights Amendments: State Provisions|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs7397/m1/1/high_res_d/RS20217_2004Aug23.pdf|work=CRS Report for Congress|publisher=Congressional Research Service - The Library of Congress|author=Leslie W. Gladstone|archivedate=May 15, 2015|date=August 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several states crafted and adopted their own equal rights amendments during the 1970s and 1980s, while the ERA was before the states or afterward.
