'''Housing discrimination''' is [[discrimination]] based on [[protected class]] status, variously including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Ageing|age]], [[national origin]], [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], [[marital status]], or [[veteran]] status, in the realm of [[House|housing]] and [[real estate]].

Four types of housing discrimination are [[rental]] discrimination, [[sales]] discrimination, [[lending]] and [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] discrimination and [[Home insurance|homeowners insurance]]. 

The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] is charged with enforcing fair housing laws, including the [[Fair Housing Act]] of 1968.
