'''Housing discrimination''' is [[discrimination]] based on [[protected class]] status, variously including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Ageing|age]], [[national origin]], [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], [[marital status]], or [[veteran]] status, in the realm of [[House|housing]] and [[real estate]].

Four types of housing discrimination are [[rental]] discrimination, [[sales]] discrimination, [[lending]] and [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] discrimination and [[Home insurance|homeowners insurance]]. 

The [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] is charged with enforcing fair housing laws, including the [[Fair Housing Act]] of 1968.  Any person who feels that they have faced housing discrimination because of their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or familial status can file a discrimination complaint [http://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/online-complaint.cfm online] or by calling 1-800-669-9777 (voice) or 1-800-972-9275 (TTY).

For more information on housing discrimination in the U.S., see [[Housing discrimination (United States)]].
