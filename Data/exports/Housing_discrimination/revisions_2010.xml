'''Housing discrimination''' is [[discrimination]] based on [[protected class]] status, variously including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[gender]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Ageing|age]], [[national origin]], [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]], [[marital status]], or [[veteran]] status, in the realm of [[House|housing]] and [[real estate]].

Four types of housing discrimination are [[rental]] discrimination, [[sales]] discrimination, [[lending]] and [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] discrimination and [[Home insurance|homeowners insurance]]. 

In the [[United States]], the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]] prohibited housing discrimination.
