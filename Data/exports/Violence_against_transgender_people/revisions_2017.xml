'''Trans bashing''' is the act of [[victimizing]] a person emotionally, physically, sexually, or verbally because they are [[transgender]] or [[Transsexualism|transsexual]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20774504-5005961,00.html Guilty plea over transsexual bashing] By Mariza O'Keefe in ''Herald Sun''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[gay bashing]], it is committed because of the target's actual or perceived [[gender identity]], not [[sexual orientation]]. However, a trans person may be gay bashed if the person perceives them as gay rather than transgender. The term has also been applied to [[hate speech]] directed at transgender people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2007/4-27/view/columns/10484.cfm|title=Page not found - Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights|website=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at depictions of transgender people in the media that reinforce negative stereotypes about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary|last=McNamara|title=Transgender Artists, Work Gaining Acceptance|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2001-02-08|accessdate=2007-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination, including physical or sexual violence against trans people due to [[transphobia]] or [[homophobia]], is a common occurrence for trans people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040612144850/http://www.opha.on.ca/ppres/2003-06_pp.pdf|title=2003-06_pp.pdf|website=docs.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, D.B.

One of the most infamous incidents was the December 1993 rape and murder of [[Brandon Teena]], a young [[trans man]], by two male friends after they found out that he had been assigned female at birth.&lt;ref name="trutv5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/not_guilty/brandon/5.html|title=Teena Brandon|last=Ramsland|first=Katherine|publisher=[[TruTV]]|pages=5|accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events became internationally known when told in the feature film ''[[Boys Don't Cry (film)|Boys Don't Cry]]'', which earned [[Hilary Swank]] an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

== Differentiating trans bashing from gay bashing ==

At least since the [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969, people from the greater trans communities have often been politically aligned with the lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kay Dayus, Transgenders Protest HRC Exec's Visit to Houston, Hous. Voice, Sept. 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  However, researchers and some activists from the greater trans communities argue trans bashing should be categorized separately from violence committed on the basis of sexual orientation ("gay-bashing").&lt;ref name="cider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discrimination and Hate Crimes Against Gender Variant People, It's Time Illinois . . . Political Action for the Gender Variant Community (May 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-trans bias crimes have been conceptually and characteristically distinguished from homophobic crimes in the scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Transgender Hate Crimes: The Challenge for Law Enforcement, at http://jointheimpactma.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Victimization-Study-Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One argument is that conflating violence against trans peoples with violence against gay people erases the identities of people in the greater trans communities and the truth of what happens to them.  However, campaigns against gay bashing and trans bashing are often seen as a common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/ww/1998/bashing1008.php|title=Workers World Oct. 8, 1998: Zero tolerance for gay-trans bashing|website=www.workers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case, perpetrators accused of hate crimes against trans people have tried to use a [[trans panic]] defense, an extension of [[gay panic defense]].&lt;ref name="TRTH"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SiaNoJ3puyQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22gwen+araujo%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA47,M1 ''Transpeople: Repudiation, Trauma, Healing''] by Christopher A. Shelley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TMCIAC"&gt;[http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=153 "Two murder convictions in Araujo case"], Zak Szymanski; ''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'' 15 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The jury deadlocked, but there is evidence they rejected the trans-panic defense.  One law journal provided an analysis of the trans-panic defense, arguing in part that the emotional premise of a trans panic defense (shock at discovering unexpected genitals) is different from the emotional premise of a gay panic defense (shock at being propositioned by a member of the same sex, perhaps because of one's repressed homosexuality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steinberg|first=Victoria L.|date=Spring 2005|title=A Heat of Passion Offense: Emotions and Bias in "Trans Panic" Mitigation Claims: Hiding From Humanity|journal=Boston College Third World Law Journal|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laws covering gender identity ==

===International===
The United Nations adopted their [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 as the first global declaration of human rights.&lt;ref name=UDHR&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr|website=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of articles in the declaration that have been suggested to specifically pertain to transgender people and violence (including, but not limited to, physical, psychological, legal, systemic, emotional, and political violence), although LGBT rights are not explicitly outlined in the document.

* Article 2 entitles individuals to all of the rights and freedoms set forth in the declaration "without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status". 
* Article 5 states that "[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."
* Article 7 states that "[a]ll are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination". 
* Article 9 bans "arbitrary arrest, detention or exile" (which, according to Article 2, is protected from distinction based on identity or belief).
* Article 20 states that "[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref name="AI Human Rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LGBT Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/lgbt-rights/about-lgbt-human-rights|website=amnestyusa.org|publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===

====United States====
[[File:Map of LGBT-related hate crime law in the United States.svg|thumb|right|Current U.S. LGBT [[hate crimes laws in the United States|hate crimes laws]] by state. A national hate crimes law encompasses both sexual orientation and gender identity.
{{legend|#800080|Sexual orientation and gender identity recognized in state hate crimes law}}

{{legend|#00ffff|Sexual orientation recognized for data collection about hate crimes}}
{{legend|#cccccc|State hate crimes law uninclusive of sexual orientation or gender identity}}]]

In the United States, currently seventeen states plus the District of Columbia have hate crime laws protecting people victimized on the basis of their gender identity (they are [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Nevada]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/hate_crime_laws|title=Hate Crime Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 2000s in [[Seattle]]'s [[gay village]] of [[Capitol Hill, Seattle, Washington|Capitol Hill]], there was evidence of an increase in incidents of trans bashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.seattleu.edu/news/story.aspx?ID=14050|title=Gentrification ousting local gay community|last=Holt|first=Emily|publisher=The Spectator|accessdate=2 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502105800/http://spectator.seattleu.edu/news/story.aspx?ID=14050|archivedate=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Matthew Shepard Act]] expanded the federal hate crime laws to include gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. In order to qualify as a federal hate crime in the United States, the crime must include successful or attempted bodily injury due to the use of firearm, explosives, weapons, fire, or incendiary devices.&lt;ref name="18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – “Hate Crime Acts”"&gt;{{cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – "Hate Crime Acts"|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap13-sec249.pdf|website=Government Publishing Office|publisher=Government Publishing Office|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hate crimes are covered by state, rather than federal laws unless the victim or defendant travel across state lines or national borders; using an interstate commuting route; the weapon has been brought across state lines; or if the conduct interferes with or otherwise affects commerce across state lines.&lt;ref name="18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – “Hate Crime Acts”" /&gt; This means that, unless hate crimes under the federal definition occur in a way that does not just affect one state, states have the freedom to implement their own hate crime laws. The protections of these laws range widely. Pennsylvania, for example, has not included gender identity in their hate crime protections since it was rescinded from the law in 2008.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Hate Crime Laws"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giampolo|first1=Angela|title=Changing the State of Hate Crime-Laws in Philadelphia|url=http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202671537351/Changing-the-State-of-HateCrime-Laws-in-Pennsylvania?slreturn=20140923231944|accessdate=28 April 2015|agency=The Legal Intelligencer|publisher=The Legal Intelligencer|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Bathroom bills=====

{{Main article|Bathroom bill}}

Bathroom bills are bills proposed with relation to bathroom access and gender identity.&lt;ref name="Bathroom bills definition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sprigg|first1=Peter|title="Gender Identity" Protections  ("Bathroom Bills")|url=http://www.frc.org/onepagers/gender-identity-protections-bathroom-bills|website=Family Research Council|publisher=Family Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey done by Jody L. Herman at the Williams Institute at UCLA Law School, 70% of the transgender respondents had faced some sort of the following types of discrimination when attempting to use a restroom of their gender identity: “denial of access to facilities, verbal harassment, and physical assault.” &lt;ref name="Williams Institute Study Bathroom access"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herman|first1=Jody|title=Williams Institute|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Herman-Gendered-Restrooms-and-Minority-Stress-June-2013.pdf|publisher=Williams Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been a number of bills proposed in the United States intended to limit access to restrooms for those who do not identify with the sex on their birth certificate.

The Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network has found that singling trans students out by offering them alternative facility options may actually increase their chances of disengaging from school or dropping out entirely.&lt;ref name="Advocate Texas Bill 1748" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GLSEN Study trans in school"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harsh Realities: The Experiences of Transgender Youth in Our Nation|url=http://glsen.org/sites/default/files/Harsh%20Realities.pdf|website=Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network|publisher=GLSEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Arizona======
Some of these bills were justified with the rationale that they are written to protect cisgender people using their identified public facilities from violent acts committed by cisgender people of another gender entering their facilities claiming to identify as transgender. There has been no evidence thus far of any incidences of this.&lt;ref name="Florida lawmaker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bixby|first1=Scott|title=This Lawmaker Wants to Make It Illegal for Transgender People to Use Bathrooms|url=http://mic.com/articles/110314/this-lawmaker-wants-to-make-it-illegal-for-trans-people-to-use-bathrooms|publisher=Mic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debunking myth about bathroom bills"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maza|first1=Carlos|title=Debunking The Big Myth About Transgender-Inclusive Bathrooms|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/20/debunking-the-big-myth-about-transgender-inclus/198530|agency=Media Matters for America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Effects of bathroom bills"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brinker|first1=Luke|title=One Month Later: How California's Transgender Student Law Is Affecting Public Schools|url=http://equalitymatters.org/blog/201401310002|agency=Equality Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2013 proposed amendment to Arizona bill S.B.1432 would have allowed police to demand identification from anyone suspected of using the 'wrong' public bathrooms or showers, meaning the facilities assigned to the sex not matching the sex on their birth certificate. If found guilty, a person would have been subject to up to 6 months in jail and a $2500 fine under a disorderly conduct charge.&lt;ref name="Arizona S.B. 1432"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kavanagh|first1=John|title=PROPOSED   HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AMENDMENTS TO S.B. 1432|url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/51leg/1r/proposed/h.1432-se-kavanagh.doc.htm|website=Arizona Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mic Arizona Bill"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strupp|first1=Julie|title=Arizona Transgender Bathroom Bill: Let Us Pee Without Showing ID|url=http://mic.com/articles/30882/arizona-transgender-bathroom-bill-let-us-pee-without-showing-id|publisher=Mic.com|date=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Kentucky======
A bill in Kentucky was proposed in 2015 that would allow students to sue their school if they encountered transgender students using their gender identifying bathroom.&lt;ref name="Kentucky bathroom bill news"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wynn|first1=Mike|title=Transgender Bathroom Bill Passes Ky Senate|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2015/02/27/transgender-bathroom-bill-passes-kentucky-senate/24130083/|date=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kentucky bathroom bill senate voting record"&gt;{{cite web|title=SB 76: 2015 Regular Session.

======Texas======
A bill introduced to the Texas House of Representatives in March 2015 proposes to award any student in a school who can prove that another student who does not identify with their "biological sex" was using a public facility at the same time damage reparations in the form of $2000 for any "mental anguish" that may have been caused them. The school itself would also be liable for any knowledge of a transgender student using their gender identified restroom and for failing to take action against said use.&lt;ref name="Texas transphobic legislature proposal news"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brydumm|first1=Sunnivie|title=Texas Doubles Down on Transphobic Legislation, Adding $2,000 Fine for 'Wrong' Bathroom Use|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2015/03/10/texas-doubles-down-transphobic-legislation-adding-2000-fine-wrong-ba|publisher=Advocate|date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.B.

Another bill, introduced to the Texas House in February 2015, suggests that anyone over the age of 13 years found to be in a public restroom of a gender not their own should be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, spend up to a year in jail, and face a $4000 fine.&lt;ref name="Advocate Texas Bill 1748"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kellaway|first1=Mitch|title=Texas Bill Would Jail Those Whose Chromosomes Don't Match the Restroom They're Using|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2015/02/24/texas-bill-would-jail-those-whose-chromosomes-dont-match-restroom-th|publisher=Advocate|date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this proposed bill, building managers who repeatedly and knowingly allow transgender individuals to use the facility of their gender identity would also face a fine of up to $10,000.&lt;ref name="H.B. 1748 Texas"&gt;{{cite web|title=H.B 1748|url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/billtext/html/HB01748I.htm|publisher=Texas Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Colorado======
In Colorado, in February 2015, a bill died in committee that proposed banning transgender people from using changing rooms of their gender identity.&lt;ref name="Colorado bathroom bill"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcus|first1=Peter|title=Transgender bill shot down|url=http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20150204/NEWS01/150209830/Transgender-bill-shot-down-|agency=Durango Herald|publisher=Durango Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill would have prevented discrimination lawsuits against facility managers who chose to deny entry into facilities to transgender people.

======Florida======
A proposed bill in Florida would make it illegal for transgender people to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity in restaurants, workplaces, or schools. The consequences would be up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. The representative pushing H.B. 583, Rep. Frank Artiles, says that, under laws protecting transgender use of restrooms, "A man such as myself can walk into the bathroom at LA Fitness while women are taking showers, changing, and simply walk in there," and claims that this bill will protect against cases such as that.&lt;ref name="Florida lawmaker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HB 583 Florida"&gt;{{cite web|title=HB 583|url=http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=53629|website=Florida House of Representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Florida lawmaker criminalize public restroom "safety"'&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ford|first1=Zack|title=Florida Lawmaker Wants To Criminalize Transgender Bathroom Use For ‘Public Safety’|url=http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2015/02/09/3620887/florida-transgender-bathroom-discrimination/|publisher=Think Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====Malta====

Malta passed the 'Gender Identity, Gender Expression, and Sex Characteristics Act in 2015. This bill states that all citizens of Malta have the right to
# The recognition of their gender identity;
# The free development of their person according to their gender identity;
# Be treated according to their gender identity and, particularly, to be identified in that way in the documents providing their identity therein; and
# Bodily integrity and physical autonomy.&lt;ref name="Malta Transgender Bill" /&gt;

This act protects the gender identity of a person at all times. It also states that "person shall not be required to provide proof of a surgical procedure for total or partial genital reassignment, hormonal therapies or any other psychiatric, psychological or medical treatment to make use of the right to gender identity." The act allows parents to postpone listing gender on a child's birth certificate and prohibits “non-medically necessary treatments on the sex characteristics of a person.”&lt;ref name="Malta Transgender Bill"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act (Malta, 2015)|url=http://tgeu.org/gender-identity-gender-expression-sex-characteristics-act-malta-2015/|website=Transgender Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Explanation of Malta Gender Identity Law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Identity, Gender Expression And Sex Characteristics Act|url=http://socialdialogue.gov.mt/en/Public_Consultations/MSDC/Pages/Consultations/GIGESC.aspx|publisher=Social Dialogue Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==

Media can contribute to trans bashing through misinformation and scare tactics. Transgender individuals are oftentimes misrepresented negatively in media, or not represented in media at all.Transgender individuals may be portrayed in the media as curiosities or oddities, as mentally unstable persons, and/ or as predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=108759276&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSeqLE4v%2BbwOLCmr06ep7ZSsqa4Ta6WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGut1C3rLZNuePfgeyx44Hy7fEA|title="DON’T TALK TO ME ABOUT DECEPTION": THE NECESSARY EROSION OF THE TRANS* PANIC DEFENSE|last=Panfil|first=Vanessa|date=June 11, 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public example of this is the attention paid to the transition of [[Chelsea Manning]], a transgender U.S. Army soldier imprisoned for releasing classified documents to [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tate|first1=Julie|title=Bradley Manning sentenced to 35 years in WikiLeaks case|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/judge-to-sentence-bradley-manning-today/2013/08/20/85bee184-09d0-11e3-b87c-476db8ac34cd_story.html|agency=Washington Post|publisher=Washington Post|date=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fox News]] story on Manning's transition was introduced with the [[Aerosmith]] song "[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]]", while host [[Gretchen Carlson]] referred to Chelsea by her birth name, Bradley, mocking ''The New York Times'' for "helping him" by using Manning's preferred gender pronoun.&lt;ref name="Chelsea Manning Fox coverage"&gt;{{cite news|title='Fox &amp; Friends' Chelsea Manning Segment Introduced With Aerosmith's 'Dude (Looks Like A Lady)' (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/27/fox-and-friends-chelsea-manning-aerosmith-dude-looks-like-a-lady_n_3823650.html|website=Huffington Post | date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army refused to let her grow her hair as long as female prisoners, and continued referring to her as Bradley "to avoid confusion" until a court mandated her preferred gender pronouns.&lt;ref name="Army stop calling Chelsea Manning male"&gt;{{cite news|title=huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/05/chelsea-manning_n_6811352.html|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/05/chelsea-manning_n_6811352.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trans health==
According to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care (NTDSR), which surveyed 6,450 transgender and gender non-conforming people, people who do not identify with their birth sex face obstacles to getting healthcare and have a greater likelihood of facing health issues related to their gender identity.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Jack|title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|website=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|publisher=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;
