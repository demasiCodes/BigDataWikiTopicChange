== Differentiation from gay bashing ==

Unlike [[gay bashing]], anti-trans violence is committed because of the target's actual or perceived [[gender identity]] or [[gender expression]], not [[sexual orientation]].

At least since the [[Stonewall riots]] in 1969, people from the greater trans communities have often been politically aligned with the lesbian, gay, and bisexual communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kay Dayus, Transgenders Protest HRC Exec's Visit to Houston, Hous. Voice, 29 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  However, researchers and some activists from the greater trans communities argue trans bashing should be categorized separately from violence committed on the basis of sexual orientation ("gay-bashing").&lt;ref name="cider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discrimination and Hate Crimes Against Gender Variant People, It's Time Illinois . . . Political Action for the Gender Variant Community (May 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-trans bias crimes have been conceptually and characteristically distinguished from homophobic crimes in the scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anti-Transgender Hate Crimes: The Challenge for Law Enforcement |url=http://jointheimpactma.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Victimization-Study-Report.pdf |date=2011 |last=Gorton |first=Donald |access-date=22 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819025320/http://jointheimpactma.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Victimization-Study-Report.pdf |archive-date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One argument is that conflating violence against trans peoples with violence against gay people erases the identities of people in the greater trans communities and the truth of what happens to them.  However, campaigns against gay bashing and trans bashing are often seen as having a common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workers.org/ww/1998/bashing1008.php|title=Workers World Oct. 8, 1998: Zero tolerance for gay-trans bashing|website=www.workers.org|access-date=28 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502153653/http://www.workers.org/ww/1998/bashing1008.php|archive-date=2 May 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the murder case of [[Murder of Gwen Araujo|Gwen Araujo]], the perpetrators accused of hate crimes against her tried to use a trans panic defense, an extension of the [[gay panic defense]].&lt;ref name="TRTH"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SiaNoJ3puyQC&amp;q=%22gwen+araujo%22&amp;pg=PA47 |title=Transpeople: Repudiation, Trauma, Healing |last=Shelley |first=Christopher A |date=January 2008 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802095398 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926110512/https://books.google.com/books?id=SiaNoJ3puyQC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=%22gwen+araujo%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA47,M1 |archive-date=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TMCIAC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=153 |title=Two murder convictions in Araujo case |last=Szymanski |first=Zak |website=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |date=15 September 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201000001/http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=153 |archive-date=1 February 2009 |access-date=22 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury deadlocked, but there is evidence they rejected the trans panic defense. One law journal provided an analysis of the trans-panic defense, arguing in part that the emotional premise of a trans panic defense (shock at discovering unexpected genitals) is different from the emotional premise of a gay panic defense (shock at being propositioned by a member of the same sex, perhaps because of one's repressed homosexuality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steinberg|first=Victoria L.|date=Spring 2005|title=A Heat of Passion Offense: Emotions and Bias in "Trans Panic" Mitigation Claims: Hiding From Humanity|journal=Boston College Third World Law Journal|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
The United Nations adopted their [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 as the first global declaration of human rights.&lt;ref name=UDHR&gt;{{cite news|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr|newspaper=United Nations|access-date=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317061858/http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/|archive-date=17 March 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of articles in the declaration that have been suggested to specifically pertain to transgender people and violence (including, but not limited to, physical, psychological, legal, systemic, emotional, and political violence), although LGBT rights are not explicitly outlined in the document.

* Article 2 entitles individuals to all of the rights and freedoms set forth in the declaration "without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status". 
* Article 5 states that "[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment]] or punishment."
* Article 7 states that "[a]ll are [[equality before the law|equal before the law]] and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination". 
* Article 9 bans "[[arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]], detention or exile" (which, according to Article 2, is protected from distinction based on identity or belief).
* Article 20 states that "[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."&lt;ref name="AI Human Rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=About LGBT Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/lgbt-rights/about-lgbt-human-rights|website=amnestyusa.org|publisher=Amnesty International|access-date=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310153212/http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/lgbt-rights/about-lgbt-human-rights|archive-date=10 March 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, currently seventeen states plus the District of Columbia have hate crime laws protecting people victimized on the basis of their gender identity (they are [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Nevada]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Tennessee]], [[Vermont]], [[Virginia]], [[Utah]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/hate_crime_laws|title=Hate Crime Laws|access-date=2 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032344/http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/hate_crime_laws|archive-date=17 November 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Matthew Shepard Act]] expanded the federal hate crime laws to include gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. In order to qualify as a federal hate crime in the United States, the crime must include successful or attempted bodily injury due to the use of firearm, explosives, weapons, fire, or incendiary devices.&lt;ref name="18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a)"&gt;{{cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a) – "Hate Crime Acts"|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap13-sec249.pdf|website=Government Publishing Office|access-date=28 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307144216/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/pdf/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap13-sec249.pdf|archive-date=7 March 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hate crimes are covered by state, rather than federal laws unless the victim or defendant travel across state lines or national borders; using an interstate commuting route; the weapon has been brought across state lines; or if the conduct interferes with or otherwise affects commerce across state lines.&lt;ref name="18 U.S. Code § 249 (a)(2) (a)" /&gt; This means that, unless hate crimes under the federal definition occur in a way that does not just affect one state, states have the freedom to implement their own hate crime laws. The protections of these laws range widely. Pennsylvania, for example, has not included gender identity in their hate crime protections since it was rescinded from the law in 2008.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Hate Crime Laws"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giampolo|first1=Angela|title=Changing the State of Hate Crime-Laws in Philadelphia|url=http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202671537351/Changing-the-State-of-HateCrime-Laws-in-Pennsylvania?slreturn=20140923231944|access-date=28 April 2015|agency=The Legal Intelligencer|publisher=The Legal Intelligencer|date=29 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629171430/http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202671537351/Changing-the-State-of-HateCrime-Laws-in-Pennsylvania?slreturn=20140923231944|archive-date=29 June 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some transgender people are content, and may even prefer, using [[Unisex public toilet|gender-neutral bathrooms]], but others expect the right to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. The [[Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network]] found that singling out trans students by offering them alternative facility options may backfire by increasing their chances of disengaging from school or dropping out entirely.&lt;ref name="GLSEN Study trans in school"&gt;{{cite book |id={{ERIC|ED505687}} |last1=Greytak |first1=Emily A. |last2=Kosciw |first2=Joseph G. |last3=Diaz |first3=Elizabeth M. |title=Harsh Realities: The Experiences of Transgender Youth in Our Nation's |date=2009 |publisher=Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network |isbn=978-1-934092-06-4 }}{{pn|date=April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using bathrooms that are incongruent with the gender one presents as breaks social norms while following laws, and one study found that cisgender people report discomfort at the incongruous appearance between someone's gender presentation and the bathroom they're in even when the bathroom matches their assigned sex. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Platt |first1=Lisa F. |last2=Milam |first2=Sarah R.

=====Harassment of transgender people in bathrooms=====

Transgender people are more likely to be harassed in bathrooms by cisgender people than vice versa. In one survey, 70 percent of the transgender respondents had faced discrimination when attempting to use a restroom of their gender identity, including "denial of access to facilities, verbal harassment, and physical assault."&lt;ref name=Herman2013&gt;{{cite journal |id={{ProQuest|1439085659}} |last1=Herman |first1=Jody L |title=Gendered Restrooms and Minority Stress: The Public Regulation of Gender and its Impact on Transgender People's Lives |journal=Journal of Public Management &amp; Social Policy |volume=19 |issue=1 |date=Spring 2013 |pages=65–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such harassment occurred in 2018, when [[United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2018#District 44|California Republican Congressional candidate Jazmina Saavedra]] said she heard the "voice of a man" from a locked stall in the women's restroom of a fast-food restaurant in Los Angeles and filmed herself chasing the person out of the restaurant with assistance from the restaurant manager. In the video, Saavedra said she was prepared to use pepper spray and a stungun against the transgender woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Broverman|first1=Neal|title=Trump Supporter Broadcasts Live as She Chases Trans Woman Out of Bathroom|url=https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2018/5/17/trump-supporter-broadcasts-live-she-chases-trans-woman-out-bathroom|access-date=18 May 2018|publisher=The Advocate|date=17 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518074838/https://www.advocate.com/transgender/2018/5/17/trump-supporter-broadcasts-live-she-chases-trans-woman-out-bathroom|archive-date=18 May 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of tactic can result in public [[outing]] of a transgender person's current or former gender identity.

One survey of transgender populations conducted in [[Washington, DC]], by the group ''DC Trans Coalition'', "found that 70 percent of survey respondents report experiencing verbal harassment, assault, and being denied access to public toilets."&lt;ref name=Herman2013/&gt;  It also found that "54 percent of all respondents reported having some sort of physical problem from trying to avoid using public toilets, such as dehydration, kidney infections, and urinary tract infections" making access to safe restrooms a public health issue.&lt;ref name=Herman2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Penner, Barbara.

On 23 February 2020, a restaurant patron in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico made a police report that a transgender woman had entered the women's bathroom. Police arrived at the restaurant and spoke to the transgender woman. Someone filmed the police interaction and posted the video to social media.

==In the media==

Media can contribute to trans bashing through misinformation and scare tactics. Transgender individuals are oftentimes misrepresented negatively in media, or not represented in media at all. Transgender individuals may be portrayed in the media as curiosities or oddities, as mentally unstable persons, as predators or as thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wodda |first1=Aimee |last2=Panfil |first2=Vanessa R. |title='Don't talk to me about deception': the necessary erosion of the trans-panic defense |journal=Albany Law Review |date=22 March 2015 |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=927–972 |id={{Gale|A425237960}} |url=http://www.albanylawreview.org/Articles/Vol78_3/78.3.0927%20Wodda%20and%20Panfil.PDF |access-date=24 April 2021 |archive-date=22 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210622014316/http://www.albanylawreview.org/Articles/Vol78_3/78.3.0927%20Wodda%20and%20Panfil.PDF |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; A public example of this is the attention paid to the transition of [[Chelsea Manning]], a transgender U.S. Army soldier imprisoned for releasing classified documents to [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tate|first1=Julie|title=Bradley Manning sentenced to 35 years in WikiLeaks case|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/judge-to-sentence-bradley-manning-today/2013/08/20/85bee184-09d0-11e3-b87c-476db8ac34cd_story.html|agency=Washington Post|newspaper=Washington Post|date=21 August 2013|access-date=17 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213181526/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/judge-to-sentence-bradley-manning-today/2013/08/20/85bee184-09d0-11e3-b87c-476db8ac34cd_story.html|archive-date=13 December 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Fox News]] story on Manning's transition was introduced with the [[Aerosmith]] song "[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]]", while host [[Gretchen Carlson]] referred to Chelsea by her [[Deadnaming|deadname]], mocking ''The New York Times'' for "helping him" by using Manning's [[preferred gender pronoun]].&lt;ref name="Chelsea Manning Fox coverage"&gt;{{cite news|title='Fox &amp; Friends' Chelsea Manning Segment Introduced With Aerosmith's 'Dude (Looks Like A Lady)' (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/27/fox-and-friends-chelsea-manning-aerosmith-dude-looks-like-a-lady_n_3823650.html|website=Huffington Post|date=27 August 2013|access-date=18 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173843/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/27/fox-and-friends-chelsea-manning-aerosmith-dude-looks-like-a-lady_n_3823650.html|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army refused to let her grow her hair as long as female prisoners, and continued referring to her using her deadname so as "to avoid confusion" until a court mandated her correct gender pronouns.&lt;ref name="Army stop calling Chelsea Manning male"&gt;{{cite news |title=Court Orders Army To Stop Referring To Chelsea Manning As A Man |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/05/chelsea-manning_n_6811352.html |last1=Grim |first1=Ryan |last2=Sledge |first2=Matt |website=Huffington Post |date=5 March 2015 |access-date=22 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trans health==
According to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care (NTDSR), which surveyed 6,450 transgender and gender non-conforming people, people who do not identify with their birth sex face obstacles to getting healthcare and have a greater likelihood of facing health issues related to their gender identity.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Jack|title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|website=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|access-date=28 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506162958/http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|archive-date=6 May 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===

Transgender people experience greater mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Avila |first1=Jonathan T. |last2=Golden |first2=Neville H. |last3=Aye |first3=Tandy |title=Eating Disorder Screening in Transgender Youth |journal=Journal of Adolescent Health |date=December 2019 |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=815–817 |doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2019.06.011|pmid=31500946 |s2cid=202406516 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as physical [[health disparities]] (e.g., cardiovascular disease&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knight |first1=Elizabeth P. |title=Gender and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Beyond the Binary |journal=The Journal for Nurse Practitioners |date=July 2021 |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=823–827 |doi=10.1016/j.nurpra.2021.02.013|s2cid=233711037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). From The 2015 National Transgender Survey Report out of 27,715 respondents "forty-eight percent (48%) have seriously thought about killing themselves in the past year, compared to 4% of the U.S. population, and 82% have had serious thoughts about killing themselves at some point in their life."&lt;ref name="2015 U.S. Transgender Survey Report"&gt;{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Sandy |last2=Herman |first2=Jody |last3=Rankin |first3=Susan |last4=Keisling |first4=Mara |last5=Mottet |first5=Lisa |last6=Anafi |first6=Ma'ayan |title=2015 U.S. Transgender Survey Report |url=https://www.ustranssurvey.org/reports/#2015report |website=ustranssurvey.org |publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality |access-date=31 March 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trans people also have a higher rate of suicide attempts than the population as a whole.&lt;ref name="Youth Suicide Prevention Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics about Youth Suicide|url=http://www.yspp.org/about_suicide/statistics.htm|website=Youth Suicide Prevention Program|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429124702/http://www.yspp.org/about_suicide/statistics.htm|archive-date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, 2.2% of U.S. adults had attempted suicide&lt;ref name="Suicide Attempt Rates US"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicidal Thoughts and Suicide Attempts|url=http://www.sprc.org/basics/scope/attempts|website=Suicide Prevention Resource Center|access-date=28 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426220800/http://www.sprc.org/basics/scope/attempts|archive-date=26 April 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 41% of trans people had attempted suicide at some point in their life in 2011.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt; The rate of attempted suicide in transgender individuals increased to 51% for those bullied or harassed in school, 55% for those who recently lost a job due to bias, and 61% and 64% for those who were victims of physical and sexual assault, respectively.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;

===Access to healthcare===
{{Main|Transgender health care}}

In the 2010 and 2011 NTDSRs, 19% of the people surveyed reported having been refused medical care due to their gender identity and 50% reported lack of provider knowledge of transgender health needs.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2010 NTDS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grant|first1=Jaime|title=National Transgender Discrimination Survey Report on Health and Health Care|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_report_on_health.pdf|website=National Gay and Lesbian Task Force|access-date=28 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507160510/http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_report_on_health.pdf|archive-date=7 May 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the Affordable Care Act, it is illegal for any health program receiving federal funding to discriminate based on gender identity. Discrimination includes refusal to admit, treat or provide any services that are available for other patients; subjection of patients to intrusive examination; harass or refuse to respond to harassment by other staff or patients; refusal to provide support services; obligation to participate in [[conversion therapy]]; and any sort of interference in the pursuit of health care rights.&lt;ref name="ACA Accommodations"&gt;{{cite web|title=Know Your Rights Health Care|url=http://transequality.org/know-your-rights/healthcare|website=Trans Equality|access-date=28 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423153629/http://transequality.org/know-your-rights/healthcare|archive-date=23 April 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial disparities===

Race has been shown to [[Intersectionality|compound manifestations]] of existing discrimination on the basis of gender identity.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2010 NTDS" /&gt;
Black trans women have the highest suicide rate of any other group in the United States, at almost half attempting in their lives, while cisgender black women attempt suicide at a rate of 1.7% on average.&lt;ref name="AFSP Facts and Figures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts and Figures|url=https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures|website=American Foundation for Suicide Prevention|access-date=28 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423173454/http://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures|archive-date=23 April 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Trans students of color face higher rates of harassment and violence in schools.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt; American Indian transgender students face the highest rates of sexual assault in school at 24%, followed by multiracial (18%), Asian (17%), and black (15%) students. White transgender students face a 9% rate of sexual assault in K–12.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;
Black trans women have a higher rate of HIV infection than other groups, with a 30.8–56.3% rate, versus 27.7% of MTF transgender people on average.&lt;ref name="Herbst et al. 2008" /&gt;

====Police and incarceration====

In the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 22% of respondents who had interacted with the police reported harassment due to bias. 20% reported denial of equal services. 48% reported being uncomfortable asking for police assistance. Respondents who had served time in jail reported a higher rate of harassment by officers than by others in jail. For all respondents, 7% reported being held in a jail cell solely due to gender identity expression, while this number was 41% for black and 21% for Latino trans respondents.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt; 
Transgender people have reported being refused medical care, particularly hormone therapy, in prison, with black trans people and American Indian trans people with the highest reporting rates.&lt;ref name="2011 NTDS" /&gt;
