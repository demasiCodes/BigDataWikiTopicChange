Unlike [[gay bashing]], it is bashing someone based on their [[gender identity]] rather than because of their choice of sexual partners or sexual activities. There are those who believe that accusing transsexuals and [[transgender]]s of being victims of "gay-bashing" erases their identities and the truth of what happens to them.
