==Women's connection with the environment==

===Women, environment, and development (WED) debate===

Different discourses have shaped the way that sustainable development is approached, and as time goes on women have become more integrated into shaping these ideas. The definition of sustainable development is highly debated itself, but is defined by Harcourt as a way to "establish equity between generations" and to take into account "social, economic, and environmental needs to conserve non-renewable resources" and decrease the amount of waste produced by industrialization.&lt;ref name=harcourt&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harcourt|first1=Wendy|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sustainable Development.|date=1994|publisher=International Society for Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first discourse that emerged in relation to women was Women in Development (WID), the perspective that advocated for women's status to be improved in developing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development and Globalization: Economics as if all people mattered|last=Beneria|first=Lourdes|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0415537490|location=New York|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then transformed into Women, Environment, and Development (WED). Critiques for WID included its place in a larger western mindset, perpetuating a colonial and liberal discourse that was not compatible with supporting the global population of women. WID placed women as central actors in household, rural and market economies and looked to the hierarchical institution of western development to fix the issues that arise because of this.&lt;ref name=harcourt /&gt;

The next shift in discourse took place in the early 1970s, where people began to critique the roots of development and start to look at alternative ways to go about interacting with the global community and developing countries, with women and the environment as central actors. This was defined as Women, Environment, Development (WED).&lt;ref name=braid&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braidotti|first1=Rosi|author-link=Rosi Braidotti |title=Women, the Environment, and Sustainable Development|date=1994|publisher=Zed Books in association with INSTRAW}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schultz et al., "The women, environment and development debate (WED-debate) is anchored in a critical view of development policies where the link between modernization/industrialization and technology on the one hand and environmental deterioration on the other is focused".&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schultz|display-authors=etal|first1=Irmgard|title=Research on Gender, the Environment and Sustainable Development|journal=Institut für Sozial-ökologische|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; WED discourse is centralized around the synthesis of different ideologies, one of which being [[ecofeminism]].&lt;ref name=leach&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leach|first1=Melissa|title=. Earth Mother Myths and Other Ecofeminist Fables: How a Strategic Notion Rose and Fell.|journal=Development and Change|date=January 31, 2007|volume=38|issue=1|pages=67–85|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7660.2007.00403.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecofeminism may be seen as a root ideology for WED, whereas women are viewed with a biological connection to nature that enables them to have a deeper connection and stewardship of it. This ideology was transformed into the political sphere where it took a new shape as women having a socially constructed connection to nature through our global systems.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt;

Programs started in the 1990s based on the WED discourse and were instituted by the United Nations International Research Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW). These programs were in response to the relation between gender and environmental violences such as waste disposal, pesticide use nuclear testing, and other detrimental environmental practices.&lt;ref name=braid /&gt;

The outcome of many of these programs did not produce the desired impacts on women.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt; The WED discourse placed emphasis on women as solution holders to environmental issues but policies were not directed at empowering women, rather the sectors that women are involved in, such as agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missing Women in Agriculture Reforms|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=February 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leach argues that the overall impact of politicizing the role of women and the environment through the WED discourse appropriated women's labor without providing proper resources or capacity to succeed.&lt;ref name=leach /&gt;

=== Farming and agriculture ===
{{See also|Feminization of agriculture}}

In the majority of the world, women are responsible for farm work and related domestic food production.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|date=Spring 1992|title=The gender and environment debate: lessons from India|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=18|issue=1|pages=119–158|jstor=3178217|doi=10.2307/3178217|s2cid=140376507 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243764296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=1998|title=Disinherited peasants, disadvantaged workers: a gender perspective on land and livelihood|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=33|pages=A2–A14|number=13 (Mar. 26 – Apr. 3, 1998)|jstor=4406578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jiggins&gt;{{cite book|author=Jiggins, J. |year=2004|title=Changing the boundaries: Women-centered perspectives on population &amp; the environment|location= Covelo, Ca|publisher=Island Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lastarria-Cornhiel&gt;{{cite book|author=Lastarria-Cornhiel, S.|year=2006|title=Feminization of Agriculture: Trends and Driving Forces|location=Santiago|publisher= RIMISP}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of women are taking over and expanding their involvement in [[agricultural]] tasks, but this has not changed the gender division of labor with regard to reproductive work.&lt;ref name=Lastarria-Cornhiel /&gt;  [[Ester Boserup|Esther Boserup]] looked into the farming systems of men and women in [[Africa]] and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Boserup&gt;Boserup, E. (1970). Woman's Role in Economic Development.  Male and female farming systems  (15–65).&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz ''et al.'' (2001), found that "90% of women in the developing world, where most of the planet's biological wealth is found, depend on their land for survival. Women head 30% of the households in developing countries, 80% of food production in sub-Saharan Africa is done by women, 60% in [[Asia]] and 50% in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; Even though women are largely responsible for the actual agricultural work performed, men generally own the land, therefore controlling women's labor upon the land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;

====Africa====
[[Ester Boserup|Esther Boserup]] examined the farming systems of men and women in [[Africa]] and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; In Botswana, men typically have greater access to advanced technologies and plowing abilities.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Zambia also has a high percentage of women farmers yet they are not explicitly recognize and often neglected entirely.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Consistent lack of access to credit, mobility, technological advancements, and land ownership further complicate women's agricultural roles. A group of women in [[Kenya]] began farming trees way before [[climate change]] was prioritized because they had seen what happens to lands that are depleted of its [[nutrient]]s and the adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steady|first=Filomina Chioma|author-link=Filomina Clarice Steady|date=2014|title=Women, Climate Change, and Liberation in Africa|journal=Race, Gender &amp; Class|volume=21|pages=312–333|id={{ProQuest|1690372156}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latin American and Caribbean====
In [[Peru]], women often participate in food production and family farming yet they do not generally benefit directly from their labor.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Their work is not considered as valuable as men's. Women in the [[Caribbean]] have always been associated with agriculture and do have access to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; However, women still do not have the same access to [[technology]] as men and generally have smaller plots of land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;

The dependence on [[nature]] and the environment for survival is common among women living in areas commonly designated as the [[Third World]] .&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; It has been argued by environmental feminists&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; that this dependence creates a deeply rooted connection between women and their surroundings.  The dependency women have on [[natural resources]], based on their responsibilities, creates a specific interest that may be different from the interests of men.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Jiggins et al. suggests that the views women have on nature are unique in that they connect the land to immediate survival and concern for future generations rather than simply looking at the land as a resource with monetary value.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; With the development of newer technologies since the 1940s, there has been a shift to more non-farm activities, however, men more than women are the ones participating in the shift, leaving women behind.&lt;ref name=Boserup /&gt; It has been projected that the continuation of men shifting to urban livelihoods, more and more women will be depended on to maintain the household by farming.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; Especially during the [[neoliberal]] policy regime in Latin America, with the increasing use of exports, women were ideal for their ‘gendered skills,’ they were paid less for their farming labor and not likely to organize, coining the term ‘feminization of responsibility.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, Development and Globalization: Economics as if All People Mattered|last='Beneria'; 'Berik'; 'Floro'|first='Lourdes'; 'Gunseli'; 'Maria'|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2016|location=New York|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues such as climate change could have a greater impact on women because the land they farm will be negatively affected.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

====Asia and Pacific Islands====
In the Asian and Pacific Island regions, 58% of women involved in the economy are found in the agriculture sector. This involves work in own-account farms, labor in small enterprises for processing fruits, vegetables and fish, paid and unpaid work on other peoples land, and collecting forest products.&lt;ref name=ESCAP&gt;{{cite book|last1=United Nations, Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|title=Gender, the Environment and Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific|date=2017|publisher=United Nations ESCAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Out of all the women working in this sector, 10–20% have been found to have tenure to the land they work on.  Reasons for this number include economic and legal barriers. For example, in terms of loans women are found to get fewer and less loans to acquire land than men.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

One other factor that plays into women's land rights for agriculture is the cultural norms of the area.  In the Asian and the Pacific women's societal roles have been defined by patriarchal norms of the larger global society, where men are viewed as breadwinners and women are viewed as caretakers. This can be expressed through the number of hours women spend doing unpaid care work per day. In developing countries in total, women spend 4 hours and 30 minutes of care work a day versus the 1 hour and 2 minutes that men spend.&lt;ref name=ESCAP /&gt;

As the main economic sector of [[Southeast Asia]], agriculture includes over one quarter of [[ASEAN|Association of Southeast Asian States]]'s (ASEAN) working women- this is a significant difference from [[OECD]]'s 3.5% average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=OECD |url=https://asean.org/book/strengthening-womens-entrepreneurship-in-agriculture-in-asean-countries/ |title=Strengthening Women's Entrepreneurship in Agriculture in ASEAN Countries |last2=ASEAN Secretariat |publisher=OECD Publishing |year=2021 |location=Jakarta |pages=14 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of ASEAN have cited increased threats to the sector from more frequent natural disasters due to climate change with significant gendered impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=ASEAN |last2=UN Women |date=2021 |title=ASEAN Gender Outlook |url=https://data.unwomen.org/publications/asean-gender-outlook |access-date=2022-03-09 |website=UN Women Data Hub |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events have different effects for each country and each region of Southeast Asia, but harms upon both gender equality and economic production through agriculture are common across the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Paris |first1=Thelma R. |url=https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/100189 |title=Gender dimension of climate change research in agriculture: Case studies in Southeast Asia |last2=Rola-Rubzen |first2=Maria Fay |date=2018-12-01 |publisher=CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security |editor-last=Paris |editor-first=Thelma R. |location=Wageningen, the Netherlands |pages=1–10 |language=en |chapter=Gender Dimension of Climate Change Research for Agriculture in Southeast Asia: An Introduction |editor-last2=Rola-Rubzen |editor-first2=Maria Fay}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dawei Port Project|Dawei Special Economic Zone]] (SEZ) and deep seaport, located in a border region of Myanmar and Thailand, is an industrial development project with alleviated environmental regulations, among other relaxed rules, marketed for business investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Maung |first1=Pyae Phyo |url=https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1355/9789814818551/html |title=Myanmar Transformed?: People, Places and Politics |last2=Wells |first2=Tamas |date=2018-09-20 |publisher=ISEAS Publishing |isbn=978-981-4818-55-1 |editor-last=Chambers |editor-first=Justine |location=Singapore |pages=161–179 |language=en |chapter=ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS AND SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES IN MYANMAR |doi=10.1355/9789814818551 |s2cid=240211041 |editor-last2=McCarthy |editor-first2=Gerard |editor-last3=Farrelly |editor-first3=Nicholas |editor-last4=Win |editor-first4=Chit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of Myanmar, as for residents who are displaced from homes and their agriculture work due to the Dawei SEZ's development, new higher paying jobs, and usually land rights, are granted to men.

=== Fishing industry ===

==== Mexico ====

===== San Evaristo =====
In San Evaristo near Baja California Sur, Mexico Hunting, fishing and land ownership is the main source of income. Women are excluded from these activities even though they might have a land claim or are fishing for fun. The fishers are mostly men that work fourteen hours together in a boat so close together. They have their own ways of communication to build trust.

Men tell harmless lies or brag about their daily earnings, which leads to building intimacy and avoiding further conflict that might happen. It became an important social skill even more than before when MPA( Marine protection Atlas) limited their access to fishing sites by announcing some of them as protected water. Men needed to bond their relationship when they became rivals for resources. They build trust by teasing their masculinity and feminizing it by subjugating women and bragging about their sexual power. For example, they encourage a researcher to go to a strip club; they pretend to betray their wives and do it every time. Eventually, they confessed that they were lying about it to prove themselves sexually powerful.

Women find these men's behaviors normal because they don't have access to the gender-based group to socialize and are limited to doing household work. When men build their own world distant from women and don't let any women in it, it is difficult for female conservationists to interact with them. Also, the male conservationist role in interacting with this male-dominant social capita is problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Siegelman|first1=Ben|last2=Haenn|first2=Nora|last3=Basurto|first3=Xavier|date=November 2019|title="Lies build trust": Social capital, masculinity, and community-based resource management in a Mexican fishery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.05.031|journal=World Development|volume=123|pages=104601|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.05.031|s2cid=198667036|issn=0305-750X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land ownership and property management===

In many parts of the world, specifically developing countries, there is a great deal of inequality when it comes to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; Traditional practices and bureaucratic factors often prevent women's access to natural resource development and management.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Frequently, women do not have the right to own land and/or property, but they often are the ones who tend to the land. [[Bina Agarwal]], has written a great deal about gender and land rights in Third World countries and according to her, "Hence, insofar as there is a gender and class-based division of labor and distribution of property and power, gender and class structure people's interactions with nature and so structure the effects of environmental change on people and their responses to it."&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Women's access to control of natural resources, land ownership and property management is a developing issue and is the subject of continuous debate in both the environmental realm and women's rights movement.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

===Women's property status and the likelihood of violence===
"World wide, physical violence by husbands against wives is estimated to range between 10% and 50% (p824)".&lt;ref name=P&amp;A&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Panda, P.|author2=Agarwal, B.|name-list-style=amp|year=2005|title= Marital violence, human development and women's property status in India|journal=World Development|volume=33|issue=5|pages=823–850|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to pinpoint the causes of marital violence but economic dependence is widely acknowledged as one of the main sources. Land or property ownership provides women who may be experiencing marital violence with a credible exit option.  Land ownership creates a means of production of both income and power.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry&gt;{{cite web|author=Chowdhry, P.|year=2011|title= Reduction of Violence Against Women: Property Ownership &amp; Economic Independence in Rural Haryana|publisher=UN Women|url=http://www.unwomensouthasia.org/assets/Violence-Property-Rights2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study performed in Kerala, India examined the effects of property status and the likelihood of violence against women.  Close to 500 women were surveyed about a number of happenings in the household such as the amount of longterm and current violence that occurred, women's ownership of the land or house, and other sociodemographic characteristics.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The violence that occurs can be physical, such as hitting or kicking or psychological, such as threats or belittlement. Long-term violence, or violence that had been occurring throughout the entirety of the marriage, was experienced by 41% of women in rural households, while 27% of urban household women reported violence in various forms. Current violence, or violence occurring within 12 months of the time of survey was experienced by 29% in a physical capacity and 49% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt;

Of all the women surveyed, 35% did not own any property and of that 35%, 49% experienced physical violence while 84% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The amount of violence was significantly lower in households where women owned land or property.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; According to this particular study, women's access to land and property ownership reduces the risk of spousal abuse by enhancing the livelihood of women as well as providing an escape route and means for survival if abuse begins.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; In many developing countries, where marital violence is prominent, barriers such as unequal laws and social and administrative bias&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; keep women from owning land and property.  A vast number of women are left out of owning immovable property (land or house) furthering their likelihood of experiencing marital violence.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry /&gt; (Chowdhry). It can also be argued that land rights greatly shape an individuals relationship with nature and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;

===Relationship between violence of nature and women===

The WED debate has examined the correlation between the degradation of the environment and the subordination of women.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; [[Carolyn Merchant]] and [[Vandana Shiva]] wrote that there is a connection between dominance of women and dominance of nature. Shiva said, "The rupture within nature and between man and nature, and its associated transformation from a life-force that sustains to an exploitable resource characterizes the Cartesian view which has displaced more ecological world-views and created a development paradigm which cripples nature and woman simultaneously".&lt;ref name=Shiva&gt;Shiva, V. (1988). Staying Alive, London: Zed.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation of women's labor as well as the abuse of natural environment are connected as they are both marginalized within the economy. Both the environment and women have been viewed as exploitable resources that are significantly undervalued.&lt;ref name=Perkins /&gt; This argument supports ecofeminism in that women in developing countries rely on nature to survive, therefore, destruction of the environment results in elimination of women's method to survival.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; According to Jiggins, [[environmental degradation]] effects women the most, furthering the inequalities between men and women.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; One study showed that new developments in technology and developments in land access are denied to women, furthering their subordination and inequality.&lt;ref name=Nightingale&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nightingale, A.|year=2006|title=The nature of gender: work, gender, and environment|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|volume=24|issue=2|pages=165–185|url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/rgroves/nightingalepub1.pdf|doi=10.1068/d01k|hdl=1842/1451|s2cid=44052896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical perspectives==
Global changes affect all human lives; some researchers and activists believe that there is no difference between women and men in how they are affected by these changes. Although some of them believe that the difference between women and men is in their biology, many believes the differences are rooted in a diverse array of cultural and social interpretations of biological differences. There are five major streams of feminism, each addressing these distinctions from a unique perspective:

1. Ecofeminist: posits closeness of the relationship between women and environment in the context of patriarchy.

2. Feminist environmentalist: emphasizes the gendered interest in particular resources based on their responsibilities.

3. Socialist feminist: integrates gender into the political economy by using production to distinguish gender roles in economic systems.

4. Feminist poststructuralist: explains gender and environment as manifestations of knowledge which is shaped by different dimensions of identity and demography.

5. Environmental: treats women as both participants and partners in environmental protection and conservation program.&lt;ref name="Feminist Political Ecology"&gt;{{Cite book|date=2013-04-15|editor-last=Rocheleau|editor-first=Dianne|editor2-last=Thomas-Slayter|editor2-first=Barbara|editor3-last=Wangari|editor3-first=Esther|title=Feminist Political Ecology|publisher=Routledge|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203352205|doi=10.4324/9780203352205|isbn=9780203352205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ecofeminism]] postulates that the subordination, oppression, and/or domination of both women and the environment are similar in structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Warren|first1=Karen J.|last2=Center for Environmental Philosophy, The University of North Texas|date=1990|title=The Power and the Promise of Ecological Feminism|journal=Environmental Ethics|volume=12|issue=2|pages=125–146|doi=10.5840/enviroethics199012221|issn=0163-4275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecofeminism encompasses a variety of views but has a focus of patriarchal oppression and the social constructions relating to women and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Some indicate the biology of women as the reason behind the connection between women and environment, while others credit culture and historical factors.&lt;ref name=Agarwal2000&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=2000|title= Conceptualising environmental collective action: why gender matters|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|volume=24|issue=3|pages=283–310|doi=10.1093/cje/24.3.283|url=http://binaagarwal.com/downloads/apapers/conceptualizing_environmental_collective_action.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.137.2479}}&lt;/ref&gt; This closeness, as understood by some theorists, makes women more nurturing and caring towards their environment. An ecofeminist believes in a direct connection between oppression of nature and the subordination of women. Vandana Shiva, is credited with bringing ecofeminism into public consciousness by her reports of the [[Chipko]] movement.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;
The Chipko movement also led to the formation of anti alcoholism.

===Environmental or ecological feminism===

Environmental or ecological feminism differs from ecofeminism in that it is more focused on the actual, specific interactions with the environment. Connections between environment and gender can be made by looking at the gender division of labor and environmental roles rather than an inherent connection with nature.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; The gender division of labor requires a more nurturing and caring role for women, therefore that caring nature places women closer with the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; The knowledge of nature is shaped by the experiences an individual has.  Women have a distinct knowledge of the land, yet are excluded from policy decisions of development on that land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; This is prominent in many developing countries where the responsibility of collecting fuel and fodder is placed upon the women.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Both the resources and the meanings are taken into consideration with environmental feminism. There is a challenge to not only focus on the gender division of labor but also the actual appropriation methods of the resources.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; In other words, there is not simply an inherent connection between women and nature, rather there are material realities that exist.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; Bina Agarwal&lt;ref name=Agarwal1997&gt;{{cite journal|author=Agarwal, B.|year=1998|title=Gender and environment management in South Asia: can romanticized pasts help model desirable futures?|journal=Macalester International|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1132&amp;context=macintl}} Article 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes ecofeminism and outlines three problematic elements which are:
*Historical characterization of the situation of women and nature
*Linking of the emancipation of women with that of nature
*Assumptions about women's agency

====Criticism====
[[Bina Agarwal]] has critiqued the ideas of environmental feminism. She proposes problems with welfare, efficiency, and source of land. 
*Welfare

Due to gender differences in income-spending patterns, women are at a higher risk of living in poverty. For this reason, access to land is of special importance. Land access allows for a number of production advantages such as growing trees, fodder and/or crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Field of One's Own|last=Agarwal|first=Bina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0521418683|location=Cambridge, England|pages=32 &amp; pp.37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, land access also allows for increased credit, bargaining power and strengthens aggregate real wages rates.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Even the smallest amount of land can have huge impacts on welfare directly as well as increasing entitlement to family welfare.&lt;ref name=Chada&gt;Chadha, G K (1992). Non-farm Sector in India's Rural Economy: Policy, Performance and Growth Prospects, mimeo, Centre for Regional Development, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi (1992), showed that households that owned land earned markedly more than landless households.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Efficiency
#Incentive effect: If women are given secure land rights, there will be a greater incentive for higher production rates.  Women will be motivated to use the best technologies, increase cultivation, and make long-term investments. Environmentally sound use of the land resource and reduced out-migration to cities by women and their dependents are other benefits of women's secure land rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Credit and input access effect: "Titles would enhance women's ability to raise production by improving their access to agricultural credit, as well as by increasing women's independent access to output, savings and cash flow for reinvestment".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;
#Efficiency of resource use effect: Studies have shown the possibility that women use resources more efficiently than men.  This could mean anything from making a more productive use of loans of money earned to the ability of women to achieve higher values of output based on cropping patterns.
#Gender specific knowledge and talent pool effect: Many women have specific and often greater knowledge about certain crops and planting patterns.  If women are included as farm managers, a more diverse and talented informed pool will be created.
#Bargaining power and empowerment effect: Providing women with the opportunity to own land will increase their sense of empowerment and could help women to assert themselves more in various situations such as policy creation other government schemes.

*Source of land
Because public land available for distribution is now quite limited, most of the land will need to come from private sectors.  "To get a share of land, therefore, it is critical for women to stake a claim in privatised land".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;

===Feminist political ecology ===
These frameworks construct a feminist political ecology that is different from political ecology in examining the importance of gender. In contrast, political ecology focuses on access to the resources based on class and ethnicity without considering gender roles. In the authors' view, feminist political ecology must address the following concerns:

1. Women's roles as producers, reproducers, and consumers made them to have combined roles in household, community, and landscape. Specialized science that concentrates on one aspect mostly drops women's ability to integrate daily experiences.

2. Women worldwide are mostly responsible for providing basic household's daily needs, and thus women may suffer more from the lack of subsistence.

3. Ecology and health also have daily and ordinary aspects that are responsive to feminist's viewpoint even though they have become highly technical.

4. While formal science relies on heavy fragmentations, many women have expressed a holistic point of view toward environmental and health issues.

5. Most feminist criticism about science is summarized in inequity of participation, abuse of women in science, universality assumption, use of gendered metaphors, lack of women's everyday experience in ways of learning.Feminist political ecologists discovered that environmental management research is mostly on women. It may cause neglect of men's dominant roles in environmental resources management and put pressure on women.  In the communities that men consider breadwinners and women are expected to be caregivers, men have an opportunity to form social capital based on their gender; they socialize, communicate, support each other and build trust in these social groups.&lt;ref name="Feminist Political Ecology"/&gt; Feminist political ecology seeks to discover the role and place of women in environmental development on a political scale.&lt;ref name="Nightingale" /&gt; Feminist political ecology builds from [[ecofeminism]] and environmental feminism and lays out three essential factors which are: 
# [[wiktionary:gendered knowledge|Gendered knowledge]], or the ways in which access to scientific and ecological knowledge is structured by gender (this is considered part of [[Who Stole Feminism?|gender feminism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |jstor=40435825|title=Public Affairs Quarterly Vol. 6, No. 4 |journal=Public Affairs Quarterly|volume=6|issue=4|date=October 1992 |pages=435–456 |chapter=Multiculturalism and Epistemology |first=Steven |last=Yates |quote=Feminists offer their distinctive twist to this approach by saying that all knowledge and cognition are "gendered"; hence the term gender feminism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
# Gendered environmental rights and responsibilities, including differential access by men and women to various legal and de facto claims to land and resources.
#Gendered politics and grassroots activism, including an examination of women within and as leaders of environmental movements.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt;

==In developed nations==

===Sweden===
Sweden has historically had a political culture that inherently protects the environment. Sweden is one of the highest-ranking countries when assessing gender equality, but the government does agree there is room for improvement. Women in Sweden have been empowered to protect the environment through the government and policies, a lot like other developed nations. In Sweden, the majority of local government workers are women at 64% and since the 2010 election, 45% of Swedish parliament is made up of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Equality in Sweden|url=https://sweden.se/society/gender-equality-in-sweden/|website=Government of Sweden|access-date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has recognized that women are the most affected by climate change and environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denton|first=Fatma|date=July 2002|title=Climate Change Vulnerability, Impacts, and Adaptation: Why Does Gender Matter?|journal=Gender and Development|volume=10|issue=2|pages=10–20|jstor=4030569|doi=10.1080/13552070215903|s2cid=153652862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this recognition they have committed to contribute to increasing the participation for women in decisions and policy debates surrounding climate change and other environmental issues. They also have committed to increasing resources for women in civil society who present issues about the environment, hoping to increase accountability and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government offices of Sweden|title=Policy for Environmental and Climate Issues in Swedish Development Cooperation|url=http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/15/64/98/24249736.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson and Merchant draw on the idea that the women's environmental movement in Sweden was based on both symbolic and political perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson &amp; Merchant|title='Peace with the Earth:' Women and the Environmental Movement in Sweden|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|volume=9|date=1986|issue=9.5–6|pages=465–479|doi=10.1016/0277-5395(86)90039-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of the environmental movement and women's movement in Sweden, women were very aware that changes had to be made both within society and ideologies, then enacted politically to create a cohesive collective society.

Elin Wagner (1882–1949) presented herself as a radical feminist in early movements. She was a writer, journalist, environmentalist, ecologist and pacifist. She was a large inspiration for the environmental and feminist movements. She saw a large flaw in the popular ideology after World War II: that men had the ability to control and conserve nature for the entire global community or all of mankind. With a place in both politics and writing, she was inspired to write her novel, ''Alarm Clock''. Her novel was barely noticed when released in 1941, but during Sweden's women's movement in the 1970s, her messages became a driving force behind the movement. She believed that there should be a large presence of intellectuals in social movements. Wagner and other key Swedish feminist scholars and intellectuals of that time shaped the parameters of Swedish thinking and both the environmental and women's movements. Throughout her life, Wagner stressed the importance of nature and the environment, an idea we see through the identity of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=A|title=Elin wägner and radical environmentalism in Sweden: The good earthworm|journal=Environmental History Review|date=1994|volume=18|issue=3|pages=59–74|jstor=3984710|doi=10.2307/3984710|s2cid=157755784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden has it ingrained in both their identity and traditions to have a deep sense of nature, which has played a huge role in shaping the overall consensus of the country to protect the environment, especially for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breiting &amp; Wickenberg|title=The progressive development of environmental education in Sweden and Denmark|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the transformation of the opinion and ideologies of the Swedish people, it became much easier to entrench environmental policies. Women working within institutions protected the global environment by pushing for bans on nuclear energy or industry degrading local environment. In 1980, there was a national referendum on nuclear power in Sweden. The voting patterns revealed that 43% of women were against nuclear power, while only 21% of men opposed it.&lt;ref name="Merchant1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merchant|first1=C|title=Earthcare: Women and the Environment|date=1996|location=New York|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden and the women of the country have demonstrated that environmental protection can be achieved through transitioning ideologies followed by institutional change.

=== United States ===

Women's involvement in [[environmental movement]]s of the [[United States]] can be traced back to the early 20th century when women of upper and middle-class backgrounds became active in urban organizations advocating for reform in environmental issues such as [[sanitation]], [[smoke]] and [[noise]] abatement, civic cleanliness and purity in [[food]] and [[drug]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Unger, Nancy C. (2004). "Women, Sexuality, and Environmental Justice in American History". In Stein, Rachel. ''New Perspectives on Environmental Justice: Gender, Sexuality, and Activism''. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press. pp. 52, 54, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Female activists of this period included [[Alice Hamilton]], [[Jane Addams]], and [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] who brought to the forefront issues of [[pollution]], urban degradation and health hazards. [[Rose Schneiderman]], a labor activist, advocated for the cleanup of hazardous work environments during this period as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During the eras of [[World War I]], the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] the United States saw a period of inactivity on environmental issues. It was not until 1962, with the publication of ''[[Silent Spring]],'' written by [[Rachel Carson]], denouncing the U.S. government's use of [[pesticide]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;and the nation's increase in [[industrial waste]], that women in the United States returned to environmental issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The book is considered one of the seminal pieces of environmental works written.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 1970&lt;nowiki/&gt;s found women actively engaging in environmental issues. W.A.R.N. ([[Women of All Red Nations]]) was formed by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] women to combat the environmental and health effects of [[uranium mining]] on native lands.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lesbian women formed communal spaces, returning to living on the land, recycling materials, using [[solar power]] and growing organic foods in their efforts to combat [[Industrial Pollution|industrial pollution]] and degradation of natural resources.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 1980&lt;nowiki/&gt;s was an important decade for women in the environment. In 1980 the term '[[ecofeminism]]' was born with two important events taking place. In April, 1980 the conference, "Women and Life on Earth: Ecofeminism in the 1980's" was held in Amherst, MA, the first in a series of conferences on ecofeminism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gaard, Greta (1998). ''Ecological Politics''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. pp. 11, 19, 28–29, 42–43.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In November, 1980 the Women's Pentagon Action took place in Washington D.C.. when the group, "Women and Life on Earth" gathered to protest war, militarism, nuclear weapons and the effects on the environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At its core, ecofeminism recognizes the link between the oppression of women and the oppression of nature.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tong, et al. “Ecofeminism” ''Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction''. 5th ed., Westview Press, 2013. pp.205–206, 210&lt;/ref&gt; The liberation of women and nature are linked and it is towards this end that ecofeminists work towards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Inherent to this concept is [[sexism]]. Australian ecofeminist [[Ariel Salleh|Ariel Kay Salleh]] was an early critic of [[Deep ecology|deep ecologists]] of this time claiming that most of its spokespersons were male and therefore were afraid to confront the naturism and sexism causing environmental crises.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Carol J. Adams|Carol Adams]] furthered this ideology with her work ''[[The Sexual Politics of Meat]] i''n which she established the link between sexual objectification of women to the consumption of animals as objects of food.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Environmental issues continued to dominate women's activism work in the 1980&lt;nowiki/&gt;s with the publication of Judith Plant's book, ''Healing the Wounds the Promise of Ecofeminism'' in 1989, the first North American anthology of ecofeminsim.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Also of importance, in June 1989, the Ecofeminist Caucus of the [[National Women's Studies Association]] was formed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The second half of the decade saw the emergence of American socialist ecofeminists, [[Karen J. Warren|Karen Warren]] and [[Carolyn Merchant]]. Warren 's work was instrumental in defining the four core principles of ecofeminism; the connections between women and nature, the need for the understanding of those connections, that feminist theory and perspective must include ecological perspectives and that ecological solutions must come from a feminist perspective.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Socialist ecofeminists are concerned with issues impacting the environment resulting from the intersection of [[oppression]] by [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[Social class|class]] or [[gender]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Specific issues addressed by Socialist ecofeminists are [[colonialism]], [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] corporate development of the South, global distribution of wealth, [[overpopulation]] and the critique of [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Since the 1990&lt;nowiki/&gt;s the United States has seen women continuing to foster their concerns of the environment. The decade saw the growth of the [[Environmental justice|Environmental Justice]] movement beginning with [[Lois Gibbs]], who formed the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, helping community organizations battle toxic waste issues and others.&lt;ref&gt;"Gibbs, Lois." ''American Environmental Leaders: From Colonial Times to the Present'', Anne Becher, and Joseph Richey, Grey House Publishing, 2nd edition, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Luca, K. M. "A Wilderness Environmentalism Manifesto: Contesting the Infinite Self-Absorption of Humans''" Environmental Justice and Environmentalism : The Social Justice Challenge to the Environmental Movement'', edited by Ronald Sandler, et al., MIT Press, 2007. pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Principles of Environmental Justice were adopted at the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C]]. on October 24–27, 1991.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;"Appendix A" ''Environmental Justice and Environmentalism : The Social Justice Challenge to the Environmental Movement'', edited by Ronald Sandler, et al., MIT Press, 2007. pp. 321–323&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of seventeen mandates, the principles call for [[Public policy|public policies]] guaranteeing the right to responsible uses of [[renewable resource]]s and land, creating a [[sustainable]] planet for all living beings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Feminists involved in current ecological movements continue the examination of the [[intersectionality]] of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[Social class|class]] and [[gender]] in human's experiences within their environments and the examination of perceptions and how values of the connection between humans and the environment are shaped by [[gender role]]s and assumptions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Seager, Joni. “Rachel Carson Died of Breast Cancer: The Coming of Age of Feminist Environmentalism.” ''Signs'', vol. 28, no. 3, 2003, pp. 950.&lt;/ref&gt; Other topics of concern include structures of power at the [[Politics|political]] and [[Economics|economic]] institutional level that are instrumental in the ecological movement, particularly the interdependence between [[oppression]] and domination. Today's environmental feminists' scholarship focuses upon transnational, [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] and [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] [[deconstruction]]s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

During the 2000s women in the environment have turned their focus to another aspect of the environmental justice movement, that of [[Gender Justice|gender justice]]. Gender justice differs from ecofeminism in that this perspective argues that women are affected by the environment in [[Gender-specific inequality|gender-specific]] ways as opposed to the focus on the connection between the oppression of women and nature.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Bell, Karen, “Bread and Roses: A Gender Perspective on Environmental Justice and Public Health” ''International journal of environmental research and public health'' vol. 13,10 1005. 12 Oct. 2016, doi:10.3390/ijerph13101005. pp. 2,5&lt;/ref&gt; Gender disparities for women include the increase of environmental burdens due to their involvement in [[women's work]] of care taking and lack of access to [[resource]]s due to lower incomes or [[poverty]]. Women are more likely to make food sacrifices for their family, and are more impacted by [[climate change]], which impacts at a greater risk those that are already environmentally disadvantaged.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Women are at greater risk during [[natural disaster]]s, and subjected to increased levels of male violence in the wake of these disasters.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Overall, women are less likely to be able to avoid or adapt to environmental degradation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The response to these gender inequities has been an increase in activism by [[women of color]]. In a marked difference from mainstream environmentalists, women of color, primarily Native American and Hispanic, are driving political change using grassroots organizations in a desire to address the gender specific differences of environmental effects.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Prindeville, Diane-Michele. “The Role of Gender, Race/Ethnicity, and Class in Activistsʹ Perceptions of Environmental Justice.” ''New Perspectives on Environmental Justice: Gender, Sexuality, and Activism'', edited by RACHEL STEIN, Rutgers University Press, NEW BRUNSWICK; NEW JERSEY; LONDON, 2004, pp. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Gender justice activists also seek to empower their communities and preserve their cultural traditions in addition to preserving the environment.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Following these principles, environmental leaders such as activist [[Julia Butterfly Hill]], founder of the [[Circle of Life Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;Becher, Anne; Richey, Joseph (2008).

Women have had a longstanding impact on the environment in the United States, with efforts being shaped by larger feminist movements. In the early 20th century women's involvement in the ecological movements grew out of the [[Social feminism|Social Feminist]] work that occurred in between the [[First-wave feminism|First]] and [[Second-wave feminism|Second Waves]] of feminism. Ecofeminism stems from the Second Wave of [[Radical feminism|Radical Feminism]] that was prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s. Environmental Justice and Gender Justice arose from the feminist move towards intersectionality of race, class, and gender in the 1990s. As feminists continue to examine these issues, the environment and women's roles pertaining to it will continue to be topics of concern.

==Women's attitude and the environment==
The deep connection between women and men comes from the daily interaction between them.{{citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=March 2009}} In recent decades, environmental movements have increased as the movements for women's rights have also increased.&lt;ref name = "Mellor"&gt;Mellor, Mary.(1997). Feminism &amp; Ecology. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's union of nature preservation with [[women's rights]] and [[Women's liberation|liberation]] has stemmed from invasion of their rights in the past.&lt;ref name="Merchant1996"/&gt;

In developing areas of the world, women are considered the primary users of [[natural resources]] (Land, forest, and water), because they are the ones who are responsible for gathering food, fuel, and fodder.&lt;ref name= "Abzug"&gt;Abzug, Bella. (1995). Women and the Environment. International Authors Series. New York: The Department of Public Information.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in these countries, women mostly can't own the land and farms outright, they are the ones who spend most of their time working on the farms to feed the [[household]]. Shouldering this responsibility leads them to learn more about soil, plants, and trees and not misuse them. Although, technological inputs increase male involvement with land, many of them leave the farm to go to cities to find jobs; so women become increasingly responsible for an increasing portion of farm tasks.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"&gt;Jiggins, Janice. (1994). Changing the Boundaries: Women-Centered Perspectives on population and the Environment. New York: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These rural women tend to have a closer relationship with land and other natural resources, which promotes a new culture of respectful use and preservation of natural resources and the environment, ensuring that the following generations can meet their needs.&lt;ref name = "Silent"&gt;From Silent Spring to vocal vanguard. (1997, January). United Nations Chronicle, 34(3), 35–38. Retrieved December 13, 2006, from ProQuest database.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides considering how to achieve appropriate [[agricultural]] production and human nutrition, women want to secure access to the land.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"/&gt; Women's perspectives and values for the environment are somewhat different from men's. Women give greater priority to protection of and improving the capacity of nature, maintaining farming lands, and caring for nature and environment's future.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"/&gt; Repeated studies have shown that women have a stake in environment, and this stake is reflected in the degree to which they care about natural resources. [[Ecofeminism]] refers to women's and feminist perspectives on the environment – where the domination and exploitation of women, of poorly resourced peoples and of nature is at the heart of the ecofeminist movement.

==Climate change and women==
One of the biggest drivers of climate change is population growth. The world's population has been set to reach 10 billion by the end of the 21st century, putting a strain on resources such as water supplies, food, energy and people, needing almost 40% more food, 40% more water and 50% more energy.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=November 2012|title=Prosperity and education key in population control|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A307670464/AONE?sid=AONE&amp;xid=ebbc1c7f|journal=Australian Nursing Journal|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projections for the future are based on data from past years, such as 1950–1960 when the developing world's population started to double, increasing from three billion to over six billion by 2000.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bongaarts|first=John|date=February 26, 2016|title=Slow Down Population Growth|journal=Nature|volume=530|issue=7591|pages=409–412|doi=10.1038/530409a|pmid=26911766|s2cid=4463876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niger is projected to go from 15 million to 80 million by 2050, alongside Afghanistan anticipated to go from 30 million to 82 million.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Cleland|date=March 16, 2007|title=Return of the Population Growth Factor|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6ed3454e188a829dc86636205ade6a6d5751ea2|journal=Science|volume=315|issue=5818|pages=1501–1503|doi=10.1126/science.1140057|pmid=17363647|s2cid=178967110}}&lt;/ref&gt; This population growth coupled with consumption and waste will have large effects on ecosystems and communities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; With an increase in population, there is also projection for an increase in emissions, effects of industrialization, contributing to climate change.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Some may argue that the third world is not responsible for the brunt of climate change, considering that the first world is using more resources, which is questionably more impactful on climate change than the population of the developing world.

Population growth is influenced by women's education. Education of women with information and access to birth control are key factors that influence population.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Education for women leads to few children, has been seen to improve health and reduce mortality, affecting the global population outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lutz|first=KC|date=July 29, 2011|title=Global Human Capital: Integrating Education and Population|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d4c2561dbb5b084f95483f80ab3816419db774c6|journal=  Science|volume=333|issue=6042|pages=587–592|bibcode=2011Sci...333..587L|doi=10.1126/science.1206964|pmid=21798940|s2cid=206534530}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to Wolfgang, there is literature and research surrounding the idea that education leads to better health and income, changing thinking and attitudes around jobs with an emphasis on social and economic opportunities instead of family size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1073/pnas.1717178114|pmid = 29093163|pmc = 5699101|title = How population growth relates to climate change|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume = 114|issue = 46|pages = 12103–12105|year = 2017|last1 = Lutz|first1 = Wolfgang|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of using education, as a means of controlling population in developing countries is questioned with the discourse around ‘third world’ women requiring ‘intervention’ and excessively reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kalpana|url=https://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/20444/1/Kalpana%20Wilson%20New%20Formations%202017.pdf|journal=New Formations|volume=91|issue=91|pages=50–68|doi=10.3898/NEWF:91.03.2017|year=2017|title=In the name of reproductive rights: Race, neoliberalism and the embodied violence of population policies|s2cid=148987919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With access for women to family planning, education and ‘socio-economic development,’ working hand-in-hand to increase awareness, and accessibility.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Many countries and organizations have begun a discussion around this topic, such as the United Nations conference on population and development in Cairo, discussing the ‘holistic’ approaches to reproductive health, as well as the American Academy of Sciences and Royal Society of London in New Delhi.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The second Millennium development goal, is to achieve “universal primary education” explaining this as a voluntary limitation of family size is going to help improve the disparity of education between genders and thus lower population as a result.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  U.

Many of the environmental effects of climate change have disproportionately placed women in more vulnerable circumstances. Environmental occurrences that affect the activities women are found to be mainly responsible for in developing countries include increase in storm frequency and intensity, increase in floods, droughts, and fires. The Indian Government's National Action Plan on Climate Change said "The impacts of climate change could prove particularly severe for women. With climate change there would be increasing scarcity of water, reductions in yields of forest biomass, and increased risks to human health with children, women and the elderly in a household becoming the most vulnerable. ...special attention should be paid to the aspects of gender."&lt;ref name="arora"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonsson-Arora|first1=Seema|title=Virtue and vulnerability: Discourses on women, gender and climate change|journal=Global Environmental Change|date=May 2011|volume=21|issue=2|pages=744–751|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the Pacific Islands and coastal areas of Asia women are strongly engaged in subsistence fishing as well as collection of food in local habitats. These habitats, such as [[mangroves]], [[seagrass]] beds, and [[lagoons]] are all being negatively influenced by a changing climate, creating barriers in the direct work of women which then ripple out to their community.&lt;ref name="ESCAP" /&gt;

The subsequent response to the connection between women and climate change has evoked multiple responses in the policy realm.  Policy makers have shifted policy to reflect gender sensitive frameworks to [[climate change mitigation|address climate change]].&lt;ref name=arora /&gt;
Arora-Jonsson argues that by focusing on the vulnerability of women in relation to climate change, it places more responsibility on women and shifts the narrative to ignore the root causes of the issue, power relations and institutional inequality.&lt;ref name=arora /&gt; The outcome of UN movements and policies for promoting women in areas impacted by climate change such as agriculture have not been scientifically proven to have any beneficial results on women communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Missing Women in Agriculture Reforms|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=2002|volume=37|issue=8|pages=679–680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and perception of the environment==
Given the environmental degradation caused while men have had dominance over women, and women's large investment in [[environmental sustainability]], some have theorized that women would protect the Earth better than men if in power. Although there is no evidence for this hypothesis, recent movements have shown that women are more sensitive to the earth and its problems. They have created a special [[value system]] about environmental issues. People's approaches to environmental issues may depend on their relationship with nature. Both women and nature have been considered as subordinates entities by men throughout history, which conveys a close affiliation between them.&lt;ref&gt;Wenz, Peter S. (2001). Environmental Ethics Today. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the perception of the natural environment between men and women differs.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} As an example, rural Indian women collect the dead branches which are cut by storm for fuel wood to use rather than cutting the live trees.&lt;ref&gt;Rodda, Annabel. (1991). Women and the Environment. New Jersey: Zed Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Since African, Asian, and Latin American women use the land to produce food for their family, they acquire the knowledge of the land/soil conditions, water, and other environmental features.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt; Any changes in the environment on these areas, like deforestation, have the most effect on women of that area, and cause them to suffer until they can cope with these changes. One of the good examples would be the Nepali women whose grandmothers had to climb to the mountain to be able to bring in wood and fodder.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt;

An example of female prominence in the defense of natural forests comes from India in 1906.  As forest clearing was expanding conflict between loggers and government and peasant communities increased. To thwart resistance to the forest clearing, the men were diverted from their villages to a fictional payment compensation site and loggers were sent to the forests. The women left in the villages, however, protested by physically hugging themselves to the trees to prevent their being cut down, giving rise to what is now called the [[Chipko movement]], an environmentalist movement initiated by these Indian women (which also is where the term tree-huggers originated).&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998"&gt;Breton, Mary J. (1998). Women pioneers for the environment. Boston: Northeastern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict started because men wanted to cut the trees to use them for industrial purposes while women wanted to keep them since it was their food resource and deforestation was a survival matter for local people.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

Gender-based commitments and movements such as [[feminism]] have reached to a new approach through the combination of feminism and [[environmentalism]] called [[Ecofeminism]]. Ecofeminists believe on the interconnection between the domination of women and nature. According to ecofeminism the superior power treats all subordinates the same. So, ecofeminism takes into account women subordination and nature degradation.&lt;ref name = "Mellor" /&gt; Remarking all these different reactions, one can see that however, most policy decision makers are men.

=== Maria Cherkasova ===
[[Maria Cherkasova]] (b. 1938) is a Russian journalist, ecologist, and director of [[Centre for Independent Ecological Programmers]] (CIEP). She is known for coordinating a 4-year campaign to stop construction of hydro-electric dam on the [[Katun River]]. After Cherkasova's involvement in the student movement on environmental protection in the 1960s, she began to work for the [[Red Data Book]] for the Department of Environmental Protection Institute. She researched and preserved rare species until she became the editor of [[USSR]] Red Data Book. She co-founded the [[Socio-Ecological Union]], which has become the largest ecological NGO in the former Soviet Union. In 1990, she became director of CIEP, which arrange and drives activities in an extensive range of ecologically related areas on both domestic and international fronts. Cherkasova recently has shifted her focus on protecting [[children's rights]] to live in a healthy environment and speaks for them both inside and outside Russia.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

===Rachel Carson===
[[Rachel Carson]] (1907–1964) was an American scientist, writer, and [[ecologist]]. Rachel Carson went to the Pennsylvania College for Women, majoring in English, but she was inspired by her [[biology]] teacher so she switched her major to biology. She became more interested and focused on the sea while she was working at the [[Marine Biological Laboratories in Massachusetts]]. Her eloquent prose let to the publication of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind|Under the Sea-Wind: a Naturalists' Picture of Ocean Life]]'', in 1941. In 1949 she became chief editor of the [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS). Her second book, ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', won the [[National Book Award]] and sold more than 200,000 copies. After that she retired from FWS and became a full-time writer. After her third and final book about the sea, ''The Edge of the Sea'', Carson focused on effects of chemicals and pesticides on the environment. That is when she wrote her book about environment, ''[[Silent Spring]]''. The book was about what man has done to the nature and eventually to himself, and started a modern environmental movement. Carson believed that humanity and nature are mutually dependent on each other. She argued that industrial activities such as [[pesticides]] use can damages the earth [[ecosystem]] and will have far-reaching ecological consequences such as future human health problems. Today, scientific studies have demonstrated these consequences.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

=== Jane Goodall ===
[[Jane Goodall]] (b. 1934) is a female environmentalist most well known for her chimpanzee study, in which she lived among the primates. She became interested in animals as a young child and spent her early adulthood saving money to fund her dream of taking a trip to Africa. Her position as secretary to Louis Leakey led to her participation in several anthropological digs and animal studies, and eventually she was selected to study chimpanzee behavior in Tanzania. She made several discoveries about the behavior of chimpanzees on these studies and is credited with discovering the chimpanzee behavior of eating meat and creating tools. She published a book about the study entitled ''In the Shadow of Man''. She is also known for her activism, promoting the preservation of wild chimpanzee environments and opposing the use of animals in research. She has received numerous awards for her achievements and runs the Jane Goodall Institute for Wildlife Research, Education, and Conservation, a nonprofit organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jane-goodall-9542363#accomplishments|title=Jane Goodall|website=biography.com|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological movements initiated by women==

===Chipko movement===
One of the first environmentalist movement which was inspired by women was the [[Chipko movement]] (Women tree-huggers in India). "Its name comes from a Hindi word meaning "to stick" (as in glue). The movement was an act of defiance against the state government's permission given to a corporation for commercial logging. Women of the villages resisted, embracing trees to prevent their felling to safeguard their lifestyles which were dependent on the forests. Deforestation could qualitatively alter the lives of all village residents but it was the women who agitated for saving [End Page 163] the forests. Organized by a non-governmental organization that Chandi Prasad Bhatt led, the Chipko movement adopted the slogan "ecology is permanent economy". The women embracing the trees did not tag their action as feminist activism; however, as a movement that demonstrated resistance against oppression, it had all the markings of such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Grewal, Jyoti|title=Theorizing Activism, Activizing Theory: Feminist Academics in Indian Punjabi Society|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=20|number=1|pages=161–183|date=Spring 2008|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nwsa_journal/v020/20.1.grewal.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It began when Indian Government give an order for sport equipments to a local company of Utrakhand, India [[Maharajah]] of [[Jodhpur]] wanted to build a new palace in [[Rajasthan]], which is India's [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] foothills. While the [[Lumberjack|axemen]] were cutting the trees, martyr [[Amrita Devi]] hugged one of the trees. This is because in Jodhpur, each child had a tree that could talk to it. The axmen ignored Devi, and after taking her off the tree, cut it down. Her daughters are environmentalists like [[Chandi Prasad Bhatt]] and Sunderlal Bahuguna.

===Green Belt movement===
Another movement, which is one of the biggest in women and environmental history, is the [http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/ Green Belt movement]. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Wangari Maathai]] founded this movement on the [[World Environment Day]] in June 1977.  The starting ceremony was very simple: a few women planted seven trees in Maathai's backyard. By 2005, 30 million trees had been planted by participants in the Green Belt movement on public and private lands. The Green Belt movement aims to bring environmental restoration along with society's economic growth. This movement led by Maathai focused on restoration of [[Kenya]]'s rapidly diminishing forests as well as empowering the rural women through environmental preservation, with a special emphasis on planting indigenous trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Belt Movement|date=2006|access-date=November 15, 2006|url= http://www.wangarimaathai.or.ke/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muthuki|first=Janet|date=2006-01-01|title=Challenging patriarchal structures: Wangari Maathai and the Green Belt Movement in Kenya|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233277225|journal=Agenda|volume=20|issue=69 |pages=83–91|doi=10.1080/10130950.2006.9674752|s2cid=142391945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navdanya Movement===
[[Navdanya]] also known as the 'Nine Seeds Movement' seeks to empower local Indian farmers to move away from growing any [[genetically modified organism]] (GMOs) on their land and return to organic, [[chemical-free]] practices. This movement has reached over 5,000,000 Indian farmers and created over 65 seed banks around India.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;{{cite web|title=Navdanya|access-date=March 5, 2012|url= http://www.navdanya.org/home}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navdanya fights to eliminate the [[commercialization of indigenous knowledge]] also known as 'Biopiracy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yamey, Gavin|title=The Bittersweet Sounds of the Modern Food Chain|journal=PLOS Biology|date=February 2006|volume=4|issue=2|pages=0165–0166|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040047|pmc=1363707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navdanya addresses multiple other international issues including climate change, food security, misapplication of technology, [[food sovereignty]], fair trade, and many others.&lt;ref name="home"/&gt; This movement also created a learning center entitled Bija Vidyapeeth.

===Kenyan land takeover===
In Kenya, starting in the mid-1980s, women protested against the elites and big foreign corporations who were coercing and controlling the production of the land.  Rather than allowing food to be grown for survival, women were pressured by both their husbands and the government to cultivate coffee for foreign profit. Protests continued and gained strength over the next couple of decades.  The protests eventually ended in a Kenyan power shift enforcing democratic national elections which resulted in redistribution of land possible.&lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Perkins, E.|author2=Kuiper, E.|author3=Quiroga-Martínez, R.|author4=Turner, T.

The [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests]] (also known by the hashtag campaign [[NODAPL|#NoDAPL]]) was an opposition to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] is 1,172 miles long, traveling from North to South Dakota and has the capability of transporting thousands of barrels of oil.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whyte|first=Kyle|date=2017-01-01|title=The Dakota Access Pipeline, Environmental Injustice, and U.S. Colonialism|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312040136|journal=Red Ink |volume=19|issue=1|pages=154–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pipeline runs under [[Lake Oahe]], an important water source for the [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation|Standing Rock Reservation]] located near the projected site in South Dakota.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In 2016 construction was set to begin but was soon halted by the opposition the project faced.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation|Standing Rock Reservation]] claimed that the construction of the pipeline was an environmental injustice and could lead to their water source becoming polluted if the pipeline was to burst.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The reservation also claimed that the proposed site that was to be dug was sacred ground and contained buried ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Catherine|date=2016|title=Tribal Culture, Oil Access Collide in North Dakota|url=https://www.proquest.com/openview/6801d48a34cff799d8958d25365887aa/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=27805|journal=Diverse Issues in Higher Education|volume=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], who were responsible for approving the permit needed to proceed with construction, claimed that proper assessments had been taken to ensure that it was environmentally and culturally safe to proceed with the completion of the pipeline.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; With the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] continuing to move forward with construction the [[NoDAPL]] movement was created in April 2016 to try to halt construction of the pipeline in order to protect the Standing Rock Reservation's water source and members.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinman|first=Erich|title=Why was Standing Rock and the #NoDAPL campaign so historic?

Although the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests|NoDAPL]] movement was largely labeled as only an environmental justice movement, the NoDAPL movement's concerns were also gendered. The gendered perspective of the NoDAPL movement was told in the documentary, ''Rise: Standing Rock'' &lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=820&amp;t=30811|title=Transcript for Rise: Standing Rock Documentary 1x01|last=VICE|first=LAND|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Many Standing Rock tribe members claimed that the construction of the pipeline would also lead to an increase of sexual violence against women and girls living on the reservation.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Visiting tribe members from the [[Fort Berthold Indian Reservation|Fort Berthold Reservation]] shared stories of the danger young girls now faced after the increase of [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]] in their community.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; A [[Fort Berthold Indian Reservation|Fort Berthold]] tribe member described how oil workers would pick up young girls walking home within the reservation and kidnap them to be sold amongst the workers for sex.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; According to the book, ''The Beginning and End of Rape: Confronting Sexual Violence in Native America'', Indigenous women are more likely to experience sexual violence than any other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Beginning and End of Rape: Confronting Sexual Violence in Native America|last=Deer|first=Sarah|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many factors that contribute to those high numbers in a 2013 article, Genevieve Le May stated that the increase of oil extraction sites and pipelines near reservations is a big contributing factor due to “man camps” built by reservations to house the oil workers.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Le May|first=Genevieve|date=2018|title=The Cycles of Violence Against Native Women: An Analysis of Colonialism, Historical Legislation and the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013|url=https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1177&amp;context=mcnair|journal=PSU McNair Scholars Online Journal|volume=12|doi=10.15760/mcnair.2018.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le May also claims that it is hard for reservations to seek justice for sexual assaults due to lack of police interference.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; That is why the mobilization of Indigenous people, particularly Indigenous women, in the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests|NoDAPL]] movement was considered to be historical to some.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The documentary also stated that the water from [[Lake Oahe]] was heavily used by women living on the reservation and was another factor for women involvement.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=820&amp;t=30909|title=Transcript for Rise Standing Rock Documentary 1x02|last=VICE|first=LAND|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many female tribe members explained that the water coming out of their faucets was water from the lake. This means that any pollution to the lake would directly affect them and their families since they drink, bathe and cook with the water.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Because this pipeline directly affected their community, participants of the [[NoDAPL]] movement originated with the Sioux Tribe of [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation|Standing Rock]].&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cronin|first=Janelle|date=2018|title=Living in a Liminal Space Standing Rock and Storytelling as a Tool of Activism|url=https://www.proquest.com/openview/9b53309524ab0098e24b7871b93be30b/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y|journal=ProQuest Dissertations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement grew due to support of tribes across the nation, including many members that travelled to [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation|Standing Rock Reservation]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Mary|date=2018|title=Native Youth Contributions to Indigenous Sovereignty and Climate Justice in the noDAPL Movement|url=https://scarab.bates.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1279&amp;context=honorstheses|journal=Bates College: Honors Theses|volume=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to social media the NoDAPL movement was able to include thousands of supporters from all over the world.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The [[NoDAPL]] movement included many protests at Standing Rock Reservation and confrontations with police and NoDAPL supporters all throughout 2016.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; During his last few months in office [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] responded to the protests by ceasing all construction of the pipeline.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The halt of construction was short due to succeeding president, [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; During the first year of his administration, [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] ordered for the completion of the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] which occurred in 2017.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

In the article “Living In A Liminal Space: Standing Rock And Storytelling As A Tool Of Activism”, author Janelle Cronin states that one of the NoDAPL women leaders that needs recognition is [[LaDonna Brave Bull Allard|LaDonna BraveBull Allard]], a member of the Sioux Tribe of Standing Rock.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In 2016 Allard published a video on Facebook asking for the surrounding tribes to come and support Standing Rock in protesting the pipeline, sparking public interest in the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests|NoDAPL]] movement.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In response to people answering her call, Allard created Sacred Stone Camp, which housed protestors for the months that the NoDAPL movement took place.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The [[Viceland|VICELAND]] documentary Rise: Standing Rock showed that Allard provided the camp with food and anything else needed to keep the camp functioning, paying with donations given as well as out of her own pocket.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Even though the pipeline has been completed, the Sacred Stone Camp remains. The camp's official website claims that there is still a need to educate people about the importance of a sustainable lifestyle as well as a need to protect water due to threats that still exist globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacredstonevillage.net/|title=Sacred Stone Village|last=Sacred|first=Stone Village|date=2018-12-12|website=Sacred Stone Village}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another noticeable leader in the NoDAPL movement is Bobbi Jean Three Legs, another member of the Sioux Tribe. In her article, Mary Ferguson claims that Bobbi played an important role in keeping the nation's attention on Standing Rock.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Bobbie and other young tribe members organized a run that would take them from South Dakota to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; This run was created in order to hand deliver a petition asking the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] to deny the construction of the pipeline through their water source.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Bobbi claimed that she became involved with [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests|NoDAPL]] because of her concern for future generations living on the reservation and because she wanted to make sure that clean water would always be available for her daughter.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
