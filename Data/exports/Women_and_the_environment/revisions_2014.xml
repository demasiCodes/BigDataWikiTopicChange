==Women's connection with the environment==

===Women, environment and development (WED) debate===

The women, environment, and development debate (WED) began in the early 1970s due, largely in part, to the oil crisis.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  In Mexico-City, in 1975, at the First World Conference on Women, [[Vandana Shiva]] introduced the issue of '''women and the environment'''.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;Schultz, I., Hummel, D., Empacher, C., Kluge, T., Lux, A., Schramm, E., Schubert, S., Stiess, I.(2001). Research on gender, the environment, and sustainable development. Studies on Gender Impact Assessment of the Programmes of the 5th Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration.&lt;/ref&gt; Concern was raised about the depletion of forestry resources as people began to realize that those resources were finite.  Women's role in agriculture and their role as woodfuel users began to come under scrutiny.  Soon, a major connection was made between the impact environmental development had on women.  According to Schultz et al.,&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; "The women, environment and development debate (WED-debate) is anchored in a critical view of development policies where the link between modernization/industrialization and technology on the one hand and environmental deterioration on the other is focused" (p4).  The WED debate continues today but is more focused on globalization and sustainable development.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

=== Farming and agriculture ===
{{See also|Feminization of agriculture}}

In a majority of the world, women are responsible for farm work and related domestic food production.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992&gt;Agarwal, B. (1992).

(2006) Feminization of Agriculture: Trends and Driving Forces. Santiago: RIMISP&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of women are taking over and expanding their involvement in [[agricultural]] tasks but this has not changed the gender division of labor with regard to reproductive work.&lt;ref name=Lastarria-Cornhiel /&gt;  Esther Boserup looked into the farming systems of men and women in [[Africa]] and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Boserup&gt;Boserup, E. (1970). Woman's Role in Economic Development.  Male and female farming systems  (15-65).&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz ''et al.'' (2001), found that "90% of women in the developing world, where most of the planet's biological wealth is found, depend on their land for survival. Women head 30% of the households in developing countries, 80% of food production in sub-Saharan Africa is done by women, 60% in [[Asia]] and 50% in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; Even though women are largely responsible for the actual agricultural work performed, men, generally own the land, therefore controlling women's labor upon the land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Schultz et al (2001), found that "90% of women in the developing world, where most of the planet's biological wealth is found, depend on their land for survival. Women head 30% of the households in developing countries, 80% of food production in sub-Saharan Africa is done by women, 60% in Asia and 50% in Latin America.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

====Africa====
Esther Boserup examined the farming systems of men and women in Africa and found that "in many African tribes, nearly all the tasks connected with food production continue to be left to women".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; In Botswana, men typically have greater access to advanced technologies and plowing abilities.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Zambia also has a high percentage of women farmers yet they are not explicitly recognize and often neglected entirely.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Consistent lack of access to credit, mobility, technological advancements, and land ownership further complicate women's agricultural roles.

====Latin American and Caribbean====
In Peru, women often participate in food production and family farming yet they do not generally benefit directly from their labor.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Their work is not considered as valuable as men's.  Women in the Caribbean have always been associated with agriculture and do have access to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; However, women still do not have the same access to technology as men and generally have smaller plots of land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; 

The dependence on nature and the environment for survival is common among Third World women.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; It has been argued by environmental feminists &lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; that this dependence creates a deeply rooted connection between women and their surroundings.  The dependency women have on natural resources, based on their responsibilities, creates a specific interest that may be different from the interests of men.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;  Jiggins et al. suggests that the views women have on nature are unique in that they connect the land to immediate survival and concern for future generations rather than simply looking at the land as a resource with monetary value.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; With the development of newer technologies since the 1940s, there has been a shift to more non-farm activities, however, men more than women are the ones participating in the shift, leaving women behind.&lt;ref name=Boserup /&gt; It has been projected that the continuation of men shifting to urban livelihoods, more and more women will be depended on to maintain the household by farming.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; Issues such as climate change could have a greater impact on women because the land they farm will be negatively affected.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

===Land ownership and property management===

In many parts of the world, specifically developing countries, there is a great deal of inequality when it comes to land ownership.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; Traditional practices and bureaucratic factors often prevent women's access to natural resource development and management.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Frequently, women do not have the right to own land and/or property, but they often are the ones who tend to the land. [[Bina Agarwal]], has written a great deal about gender and land rights in Third World countries and according to her, "Hence, insofar as there is a gender and class-based division of labor and distribution of property and power, gender and class structure people's interactions with nature and so structure the effects of environmental change on people and their responses to it."&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Women's access to control of natural resources, land ownership and property management is a developing issue and is the subject of continuous debate in both the environmental realm and women's rights movement.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

===Women's property status and the likelihood of violence===
"World wide, physical violence by husbands against wives is estimated to range between 10% and 50% (p824)".&lt;ref name=P&amp;A&gt;Panda, P., &amp; Agarwal, B. (2005). Marital violence, human development and women's property status in India. World Development. Vol. 33, No 5. pp. 823-850.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to pinpoint the causes of marital violence but economic dependence is widely acknowledged as one of the main sources. Land or property ownership provides women who may be experiencing marital violence with a credible exit option.  Land ownership creates a means of production of both income and power.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry&gt;Chowdhry, P. (2011). Reduction of Violence Against Women: Property Ownership &amp; Economic Independence in Rural Haryana. UN Women. http://www.unwomensouthasia.org/assets/Violence-Property-Rights2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A study performed in Kerala, India examined the effects of property status and the likelihood of violence against women.  Close to 500 women were surveyed about a number of happenings in the household such as the amount of longterm and current violence that occurred, women's ownership of the land or house, and other sociodemographic characteristics.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The violence that occurs can be physical, such as hitting or kicking or psychological, such as threats or belittlement. Long-term violence, or violence that had been occurring throughout the entirety of the marriage, was experienced by 41% of women in rural households, while 27% of urban household women reported violence in various forms. Current violence, or violence occurring within 12 months of the time of survey was experienced by 29% in a physical capacity and 49% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt;

Of all the women surveyed, 35% did not own any property and of that 35%, 49% experienced physical violence while 84% experienced psychological violence.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; The amount of violence was significantly lower in households where women owned land or property.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; According to this particular study, women's access to land and property ownership reduces the risk of spousal abuse by enhancing the livelihood of women as well as providing an escape route and means for survival if abuse begins.&lt;ref name=P&amp;A /&gt; In many developing countries, where marital violence is prominent, barriers such as unequal laws and social and administrative bias&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; keep women from owning land and property.  A vast number of women are left out of owning immovable property (land or house) furthering their likelihood of experiencing marital violence.&lt;ref name=Chowdhry /&gt; (Chowdhry). It can also be argued that land rights greatly shape an individuals relationship with nature and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt;

===Relationship between violence of nature and women===

The WED debate has examined the correlation between the degradation of the environment and the subordination of women.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; [[Carolyn Merchant]] and [[Vandana Shiva]] wrote that there is a connection between dominance of women and dominance of nature. Shiva said, "The rupture within nature and between man and nature, and its associated transformation from a life-force that sustains to an exploitable resource characterizes the Cartesian view which has displaced more ecological world-views and created a development paradigm which cripples nature and woman simultaneously".&lt;ref name=Shiva&gt;Shiva, V. (1988). Staying Alive, London: Zed.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation of women's labor as well as the abuse of natural environment are connected as they are both marginalized within the economy. Both the environment and women have been viewed as exploitable resources that are significantly undervalued.&lt;ref name=Perkins /&gt; This argument supports ecofeminism in that women in developing countries rely on nature to survive, therefore, destruction of the environment results in elimination of women's method to survival.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; According to Jiggins, environmental degradation effects women the most, furthering the inequalities between men and women.&lt;ref name=Jiggins /&gt; One study showed that new developments in technology and developments in land access are denied to women, furthering their subordination and inequality.&lt;ref name=Nightingale&gt;Nightingale, A. (2006) "The nature of gender: work, gender, and environment" Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 24(2) 165 – 185&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Ecofeminism===
[[Ecofeminism]] says that women are closer to nature than men are. This closeness, therefore, makes women more nurturing and caring towards their environment.  Ecofeminism encompasses a variety of views but has a focus of patriarchal oppression and the social constructions relating to women and the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; Some indicate the biology of women as the reason behind the closeness, while others credit culture and historical factors.&lt;ref name=Agarwal2000&gt;Agarwal, B. (2000). Conceptualising environmental collective action: why gender matters. Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol.24(3), p.283-310&lt;/ref&gt; An ecofeminist believes in a direct connection between oppression of nature and the subordination of women. Vandana Shiva, is credited with bringing ecofeminism into public consciousness by her reports of the [[Chipko]] movement. .&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;
Chipko movement also led to the formation of anti alcoholism.

===Environmental or ecological feminism===

Environmental or ecological feminism differs from ecofeminism in that it is more focused on the actual, specific interactions with the environment. Connections between environment and gender can be made by looking at the gender division of labor and environmental roles rather than an inherent connection with nature.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; The gender division of labor requires a more nurturing and caring role for women, therefore that caring nature places women closer with the environment.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; The knowledge of nature is shaped by the experiences an individual has.  Women have a distinct knowledge of the land, yet are excluded from policy decisions of development on that land.&lt;ref name=Tiondi /&gt; This is prominent in many developing countries where the responsibility of collecting fuel and fodder is placed upon the women.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; Both the resources and the meanings are taken into consideration with environmental feminism. There is a challenge to not only focus on the gender division of labor but also the actual appropriation methods of the resources.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1992 /&gt; In other words, there is not simply an inherent connection between women and nature, rather there are material realities that exist.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt; Bina Agarwal &lt;ref name=Agarwal1997&gt;Agarwal, B. (1998). Gender and environment management in South Asia: can romanticized pasts help model desirable futures? Macalester International: Vol. 6, Iss. 1 Article 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes ecofeminism and outlines three problematic elements which are:
*Historical characterization of the situation of women and nature
*Linking of the emancipation of women with that of nature
*Assumptions about women's agency

====Criticism====
Bina Agaarwal has critiqued the ideas of environmental feminism. She proposes problems with welfare, efficiency, and source of land. 
*Welfare
Due to gender differences in income-spending patterns, women are at a higher risk of living in poverty. For this reason, access to land is of special importance. Land access allows for a number of production advantages such as growing trees, fodder and/or crops. But, land access also allows for increased credit, bargaining power and strengthens aggregate real wages rates.&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt; Even the smallest amount of land can have huge impacts on welfare directly as well as increasing entitlement to family welfare.&lt;ref name=Chada&gt;Chadha,G K (1992). Non-farmSectorin India's Rural Economy: Policy, Performance and Growth Prospects, mimeo, Centre for Regional Development, JawaharlalNehru University, Delhi (1992), showed that households that owned land earned markedly more than landless households.&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Efficiency
1. Incentive effect: If women are given secure land rights, there will be a greater incentive for higher production rates.  Women will be motivated to use the best technologies, increase cultivation, and make long-term investments. 

2. Credit and input access effect: "Titles would enhance women's ability to raise production by improving their access to agricultural credit, as well as by increasing women's independent access to output, savings and cash flow for reinvestment".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;

3. Efficiency of resource use effect: Studies have shown the possibility that women use resources more efficiently than men.  This could mean anything from making a more productive use of loans of money earned to the ability of women to achieve higher values of output based on cropping patterns. 

4. Gender specific knowledge and talent pool effect: Many women have specific and often greater knowledge about certain crops and planting patterns.  If women are included as farm managers, a more diverse and talented informed pool will be created. 

5. Bargaining power and empowerment effect: Providing women with the opportunity to own land will increase their sense of empowerment and could help women to assert themselves more in various situations such as policy creation other government schemes.

*Source of land
Because public land available for distribution is now quite limited, most of the land will need to come from private sectors.  "To get a share of land, therefore, it is critical for women to stake a claim in privatised land".&lt;ref name=Agarwal1998 /&gt;

===Feminist political ecology ===
Feminist political ecology builds from ecofeminism and environmental feminism and lays out three essential factors which are: 
# Gendered knowledge, or the ways in which access to scientific and ecological knowledge is structured by gender
# Gendered environmental rights and responsibilities, including differential access by men and women to various legal and de facto claims to land and resources.
#Gendered politics and grassroots activism, including an examination of women within and as leaders of environmental movements.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt;

Feminist political ecology seeks to discover the role and place of women in environmental development on a political scale.&lt;ref name=Nightingale /&gt;

==Women's attitude and the environment==
{{POV-section|date=June 2011}}
The deep connection between women and men comes from the daily interaction between them.{{citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=March 2009}} In recent decades, environmental movements have increased as the movements for women's rights have also increased.&lt;ref name = "Mellor"&gt;Mellor, Mary.(1997). Feminism &amp; Ecology. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's union of nature preservation with [[women's rights]] and [[Women's liberation|liberation]] has stemmed from invasion of their rights in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Merchant, Carolyn. (1996). Earthcare: Women and environment. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing areas of the world, women are considered the primary users of [[natural resources]] (Land, forest, and water), because they are the ones who are responsible for gathering food, fuel, and fodder.&lt;ref name= "Abzug"&gt;Abzug, Bella. (1995). Women and the Environment. International Authors Series. New York: The Department of Public Information.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in these countries, women mostly can't own the land and farms outright, they are the ones who spend most of their time working on the farms to feed the [[household]]. Shouldering this responsibility leads them to learn more about soil, plants, and trees and not misuse them. Although, technological inputs increase male involvement with land, many of them leave the farm to go to cities to find jobs; so women become increasingly responsible for an increasing portion of farm tasks.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"&gt;Jiggins, Janice. (1994). Changing the Boundaries: Women-Centered Perspectives on population and the Environment. New York: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These rural women tend to have a closer relationship with land and other natural resources, which promotes a new culture of respectful use and preservation of natural resources and the environment, ensuring that the following generations can meet their needs.&lt;ref name = "Silent"&gt;From Silent Spring to vocal vanguard. (1997, January). United Nations Chronicle, 34(3), 35-38. Retrieved December 13, 2006, from ProQuest database.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides considering how to achieve appropriate [[agricultural]] production and human nutrition, women want to secure access to the land.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994"/&gt; Women's perspectives and values for the environment are somewhat different from men's. Women give greater priority to protection of and improving the capacity of nature, maintaining farming lands, and caring for nature and environment's future.&lt;ref&gt;Jiggins, Janice. (1994). Changing the Boundaries: Women-Centered Perspectives on  population and the Environment. New York: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated studies have shown that women have a stake in environment, and this stake is reflected in the degree to which they care about natural resources. [[Ecofeminism]] refers to women's and feminist perspectives on the environment - where the domination and exploitation of women, of poorly resourced peoples and of nature is at the heart of the ecofeminist movement.

==Environmental change and women==
{{POV-section|date=June 2011}}
Today, women struggle against alarming global trends, but they are working together to effect change. By establishing domestic and international non-governmental organizations, many women have recognized themselves and acknowledge to the world that they not only have the right to participate in environmental dilemmas but they have different relationship with environment including different needs, responsibilities, and knowledge about natural resources.&lt;ref name="Jiggins, Janice 1994" /&gt; This is why women are affected differently from men by [[environmental degradation]], [[deforestation]], [[pollution]] and [[Overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]]. Women are often the most directly affected by environmental issues, so they become more concerned about environmental problems. Studies have shown the direct effects of chemicals and pesticides on human health.&lt;ref name = "Silent" /&gt; According to [http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/index.html United Nations Chronicle] journal researchers have found an association between breast cancer and the pesticide [[DDT]] and its derivative [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]]; and also one study by the [[World Health Organization]] has found that women who are exposed to pesticides face a higher risk of abortion.&lt;ref name = "Silent" /&gt; These kinds of health problems cause women to feel more responsible regarding environmental issues.

==Gender and perception of the environment==
Given the environmental degradation caused while men have had dominance over women, and women's large investment in [[environmental sustainability]], some have theorized that women would protect the Earth better than men if in power. Although there is no evidence for this hypothesis, recent movements have shown that women are more sensitive to the earth and its problems. They have created a special [[value system]] about environmental issues. People's approaches to environmental issues may depend on their relationship with nature. Both women and nature have been considered as subordinates entities by men throughout history, which conveys a close affiliation between them.&lt;ref&gt;Wenz, Peter S. (2001). Environmental Ethics Today. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history men have looked at natural resources as commercial entities or income generating tools, while women have tended to see the environment as a resource supporting their [[basic needs]].{{citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion.|date=March 2009}} As an example, rural Indian women collect the dead branches which are cut by storm for fuel wood to use rather than cutting the live trees.&lt;ref&gt;Rodda, Annabel. (1991). Women and the Environment. New Jersey: Zed Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Since African, Asian, and Latin American women use the land to produce food for their family, they acquire the knowledge of the land/soil conditions, water, and other environmental features.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt; Any changes in the environment on these areas, like deforestation, have the most effect on women of that area, and cause them to suffer until they can cope with these changes. One of the good examples would be the Nepali women whose grandmothers had to climb to the mountain to be able to bring in wood and fodder.&lt;ref name="Abzug" /&gt;

An example of female prominence in the defense of natural forests comes from India in 1906.  As forest clearing was expanding conflict between loggers and government and peasant communities increased. To thwart resistance to the forest clearing, the men were diverted from their villages to a fictional payment compensation site and loggers were sent to the forests. The women left in the villages, however, protested by physically hugging themselves to the trees to prevent their being cut down, giving rise to what is now called the [[Chipko movement]], an environmentalist movement initiated by these Indian women (which also is where the term tree-huggers originated).&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998"&gt;Breton, Mary J. (1998). Women pioneers for the environment. Boston: Northeastern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict started because men wanted to cut the trees to use them for industrial purposes while women wanted to keep them since it was their food resource and deforestation was a survival matter for local people.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

Gender-based commitments and movements such as [[feminism]] have reached to a new approach through the combination of feminism and [[environmentalism]] called [[Ecofeminism]]. Ecofeminists believe on the interconnection between the domination of women and nature. According to ecofeminism the superior power treats all subordinates the same. So, ecofeminism takes into account women subordination and nature degradation.&lt;ref name = "Mellor" /&gt; Remarking all these different reactions, one can see that however, most policy decision makers are men.

=== Maria Cherkasova ===
[[Maria Cherkasova]] (1938 -   ) is a [[Russia|Russian]] journalist, ecologist, and director of [[Centre for Independent Ecological Programmers]] (CIEP). She is famous because of coordinating a 4-year campaign to stop construction of hydro-electric dam on the [[Katun River]]. After Cherkasova's involvement in the student movement on environmental protection in the 1960s, she began to work for the [[Red Data Book]] for the Department of Environmental Protection Institute. She researched and preserved rare species until she became the editor of [[USSR]] Red Data Book. She co-founded the [[Socio-Ecological Union]], which has become the largest ecological NGO in the former Soviet Union. In 1990, she became director of CIEP, which arrange and drives activities in an extensive range of ecologically related areas on both domestic and international fronts. Cherkasova recently has shifted her focus on children rights protection to live in a healthy environment and speaks for both inside and outside Russia.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

===Rachel Carson===
One of the outstanding women environmentalists is [[Rachel Carson]].  Rachel Carson (1907–1964) was an [[United States|American]] scientist, writer, and [[ecologist]]. Rachel Carson went to the Pennsylvania College for Women, majoring in English, but she was inspired by her [[biology]] teacher so she switched her major to biology. She became more interested and focused on the sea while she was working at the [[Marine Biological Laboratories in Massachusetts]]. Her eloquent prose let to the publication of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind|Under the Sea-Wind: a Naturalists' Picture of Ocean Life]]'', in 1941. In 1949 she became chief editor of the [[Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS). Her second book, ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', won the [[National Book Award]] and sold more than 200,000 copies. After that she retired from FWS and became a full-time writer. After her third and final book about the sea, ''The Edge of the Sea'', Carson focused on effects of chemicals and pesticides on the environment. That is when she wrote her book about environment, ''[[Silent Spring]]''. The book was about what man has done to the nature and eventually to himself, and started a modern environmental movement. Carson believed that human and nature are mutually dependent on each other. She argued that industrial activities such as [[pesticides]] use can damages the earth [[ecosystem]] and will have far-reaching ecological consequences such as future human health problems. Today, scientific studies have demonstrated these consequences.&lt;ref name="Breton, Mary J. 1998" /&gt;

==Ecological movements initiated by women==
===Chipko movement===
One of the first environmentalist movement which was inspired by women was the [[Chipko movement]] (Women tree-huggers in India). "Its name comes from a Hindi word meaning "to stick" (as in glue). The movement was an act of defiance against the state government's permission given to a corporation for commercial logging. Women of the villages resisted, embracing trees to prevent their felling to safeguard their lifestyles which were dependent on the forests. Deforestation could qualitatively alter the lives of all village residents but it was the women who agitated for saving [End Page 163] the forests. Organized by a non-governmental organization that Chandi Prasad Bhatt led, the Chipko movement adopted the slogan "ecology is permanent economy." The women embracing the trees did not tag their action as feminist activism; however, as a movement that demonstrated resistance against oppression, it had all the markings of such.".&lt;ref&gt;Grewal, Jyoti. "Theorizing Activism, Activizing Theory: Feminist Academics in Indian Punjabi Society." NWSA Journal.Volume 20, Number 1, Spring 2008 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nwsa_journal/v020/20.1.grewal.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

It began when [[Maharajah]] of [[Jodhpur]] wanted to build a new palace in [[Rajasthan]] which is India's [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] foot hills. While the [[Lumberjack|axemen]] were cutting the trees, martyr [[Amrita Devi]] hugged one of the trees. This is because in Jodhpur each child had a tree that could talk to it. The axmen ignored Devi and after taking her off the tree cut it down. Her daughters environmentalists like Chandi Prasad Bhatt and Sunderlal Bahuguna

===Green Belt movement===
Another movement, which is one of the biggest in women and environmental history, is the [http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/ Green Belt movement]. [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Wangari Maathai]] founded this movement on the [[World Environment Day]] in June 1977.  The starting ceremony was very simple: a few women planted seven trees in Maathai's backyard. By 2005, 30 million trees had been planted by participants in the Green Belt movement on public and private lands. The Green Belt movement aims to bring environmental restoration along with society's economic growth. This movement led by Maathai focused on restoration of [[Kenya]]'s rapidly diminishing forests as well as empowering the rural women through environmental preservation, with a special emphasis on planting indigenous trees.&lt;ref&gt;Green Belt Movement. (2006). Retrieved November 15, 2006 from http://www.wangarimaathai.or.ke/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navdanya Movement===
[[Navdanya]] also known as the 'Nine Seeds Movement' seeks to empower local Indian farmers to move away from growing any [[genetically modified organism]] (GMOs) on their land and return to organic, [[chemical-free]] practices. This movement has reached over 5,000,000 Indian farmers and created over 65 seed banks around India.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;Navdanya.

===Kenyan land takeover===
In Kenya, starting in the mid-1980s, women protested against the elites and big foreign corporations who were coercing and controlling the production of the land.  Rather than allowing food to be grown for survival, women were pressured by both their husbands and the government to cultivate coffee for foreign profit. Protests continued and gained strength over the next couple of decades.  The protests eventually ended in a Kenyan power shift enforcing democratic national elections which resulted in redistribution of land possible.&lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;Perkins, E., Kuiper, E., Quiroga-Martínez, R., Turner, T. E., Brownhill, L.S., Mellor, M., Todorova, Z., Jochimsen, M.A., McMahon, M. (2005) Explorations: feminist ecological economics. Feminist Economics Vol. 11, Iss. 3 107-150&lt;/ref&gt;
