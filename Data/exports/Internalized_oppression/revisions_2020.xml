In [[social justice]], '''internalized oppression''' is a concept in which an [[oppression|oppressed]] group uses the methods of the oppressing group against itself. It occurs when one group perceives an inequality of value relative to another group, and desires to be like the more highly-valued group.

Members of [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] groups may have an oppressive view of their own group, or affirm negative [[Self-stereotyping|self-stereotypes]]. Internalized oppression may manifest on an individual or group level, and may result in conflict or discrimination within the group.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;David, E. J. R. and Annie O. Derthick. "What Is Internalized Oppression, and so What?." Internalized Oppression: The Psychology of Marginalized Groups., E. J. R. David and E. J. R., (Ed) David, Springer Publishing Co, 2014, pp. 1–30.

It may also exist among [[Immigration|immigrants]] and their descendants. If the host community devalues a foreigner's [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] origin, native language or culture, an immigrant may feel [[Inferiority complex|inferior]]. This can lead to [[self-hatred]], which manifests itself in an exaggerated [[conformity]] to dominant norms. An immigrant may also respond by [[Cultural assimilation|assimilating]] and [[Acculturation|acculturating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van den Berghe|first1=Pierre L.|title=The Ethnic Phenomenon|date=1987|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0275927091|page=258|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=esAA9Njteu0C|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[Internalized racism]] occurs when a member of a group which is a target of racism assumes a racist attitude towards their own group. It indicates a lack of [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Szymanski, Dawn M. and Arpana Gupta. "Examining the Relationship between Multiple Internalized Oppressions and African American Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Questioning Persons' Self-Esteem and Psychological Distress." Journal of Counseling Psychology, vol. 56, no. 1, Jan. 2009, pp. 110–118. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1037/a0013317.&lt;/ref&gt; Internalized racism is an effect of internalized colonialism, in which a colonized people loses its identity and assumes the values of the colonizing society; it may happen gradually, over a long period of time. An example of internalized colonialism is the practice of [[skin whitening]] (see [[Discrimination based on skin color|colorism]]) found in the Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Internalized [[homophobia]], also known as internalized heterosexism, occurs in the [[LGBT community]] when individuals adopt a culture's heterosexual norms. It has a positive correlation with psychological distress, and a negative correlation with self-esteem.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Internalized homophobia is strongly associated guilt and shame (especially among youth) and has been linked to increased anxiety, depression, and suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Puckett, Jae A., et al. "Predictors of Sexual Minority Youth's Reported Suicide Attempts and Mental Health." Journal of homosexuality, vol. 64, no. 6, 2017, pp. 697–715.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[internalized sexism]], individuals (generally women) adopt oppressive attitudes towards their gender which are held by their culture. An example is [[slut-shaming]], where women criticize transgressions of accepted codes of sexual conduct on themselves and other women.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Elizabeth A., et al. "'Good Girls': Gender, Social Class, and Slut Discourse on Campus." Social Psychology Quarterly, vol. 77, no. 2, June 2014, pp. 100–122. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1177/0190272514521220.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A range of internal oppression may occur when an individual belongs to more than one oppressed groups; a woman of color may experience internalized racism and internalized sexism, or a person of color may be homosexual (and also experience internalized homophobia).

==Causes==
Internalized oppression "occurs when a person comes to [[Internalization (sociology)|internalize]] oppressive prejudices and biases about the identity group(s) to which he or she belongs".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joseph, Valerie and Tanya O.

==Effects==
{{see also|Health psychology}}
"If women are surrounded by people who view them as subordinate, incapable, or lacking control over their actions, women are likely to come to understand themselves in a similar way, even if subconsciously."&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Liebow, Nabina. "Internalized Oppression and Its Varied Moral Harms: Self-Perceptions of Reduced Agency and Criminality." Hypatia, vol. 31, no. 4, Fall2016, pp. 713–729. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1111/hypa.12265.&lt;/ref&gt; Internalized oppression fosters the beliefs that the self cannot be [[Autonomy|autonomous]], is unworthy of wielding power, and is little more than an object of sexual gratification (see [[sexual objectification]]).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; "Psychological oppression can be damaging to a person's moral relationship with the self ... Since those who have internalized oppressive prejudices often engage in behavior that further perpetuates these biases, internalized oppression is not only a symptom of an oppressive social climate, but it also represents a mechanism for its continued existence".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; According to [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] doctoral students Valerie Joseph and Tanya O. Williams, "Deep racial self-negation[,]&amp;nbsp;... internalized racial hatred [and] internalized oppression&amp;nbsp;... stymied [their] growth as people and scholars [and] inhibited [their] ability to be…profound, strong, and beautiful&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Individuals can be made to feel "implicated in a project of compliance with the values and goals" of the dominant society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Internalized oppression may also occur in [[Disability|disabled]] individuals, who may distance themselves from others with disabilities to avoid associating themselves with those who may be viewed by society as "weak" or "lazy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahs | first1 = Breanne | title = The Dreaded Body: Disgust and the Production of "appropriate" Femininity | url = | journal = Journal of Gender Studies | year = 2015 | issue = | pages = 1–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nabina Liebow wrote, "[[Person of color|People of color]] who internalize stereotypes regarding [[Crime|criminality]] and moral deviance&amp;nbsp;... can &amp;nbsp;... view themselves as outlaws in the moral community" and may "engage in behavior that further perpetuates these biases&amp;nbsp;... Fulfilling these stereotypes further pushes someone outside the moral fold and intensifies one's damaged moral identity&amp;nbsp;... [I]nternalizing stereotypes about criminality and moral deviance can led to a pervasive feeling of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]]&amp;nbsp;... Persistent feelings of guilt can result in [[Mental health|mental-health]] setbacks such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]]" and "repeated exposure to guilt and similar feelings has been linked with a range of health challenges such as "dysfunctional coping, abdominal obesity, and glucose intolerance complicit in the development of Type 2 diabetes".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Manifestations==
According to [[Audre Lorde]], manifestations of internalized oppression include voluntary isolation.&lt;ref name="Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Re"/&gt; She describes the relationship between older members of an oppressed group and younger members of the same group as "contemptible or suspect or excess."{{sic}}&lt;ref name="Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Re"/&gt; This [[generation gap]] leads to "historical amnesia", with oppressed minorities repeating the learning process and failing to convey knowledge to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Re"/&gt; Lorde cites oppressed individuals as "encouraged to pluck out some one aspect of [one]self and present this as the meaningful whole, eclipsing or denying the other parts of the self";&lt;ref name="Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Re"/&gt; they may hesitate to breach the false stereotypes surrounding them or verbalize resistance to violence.&lt;ref name="Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Re"/&gt; The most common manifestation is self-hatred.&lt;ref name="Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Re"/&gt;

Racial manifestations include "multifaceted and extreme psychological, social, and economic self-sabotage"; a tendency to "defer to [[White people|whites]]", and feelings of being "not [[Black people|black]] enough".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The self is viewed as a diminished, deviant, criminal and undeserving moral agent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Sandra Bartky]] identified disturbances in [[body image]], [[gender expression]] and power dynamics as manifestations of internalized sexism in women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Remedies==
According to Audre Lorde, "[T]he master's tools will never dismantle the master's house&amp;nbsp;... My fullest concentration of energy is available to me only when I integrate all the parts of who I am, openly, allowing power from the particular sources of my living to flow back and forth freely through all my different selves, without the restrictions of externally imposed definition".&lt;ref name="Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Re" /&gt; "To root out internalized patterns of oppression" women must "recognize differences among women who are our equals, neither inferior nor superior, and devise ways to use each other's difference to enrich our visions and our joint struggles …to identify and develop new definitions of power and new patterns of relating across difference&amp;nbsp;... sharpen[ing] self-definition by exposing the self in work and struggle together with those whom we define as different from ourselves, although sharing similar goals".&lt;ref name="Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Re" /&gt; 

To understand and overcome internalized oppression, Joseph and Williams developed a workshop to "introduce and discuss issues of socialization, stereotyping, internalized oppression, and domination." This "social justice education model&amp;nbsp;... encouraged an agent/target model of leadership" in which representatives of the oppressor and oppressed classes joined together to guide "participants in developing a plan of action to address racism."{{quote without source|date=February 2020}} They recommended that fear "left over about discussing race, racism, and internalized racism" be set aside to "talk forthrightly, honestly, reflectively, and thoughtfully about race", and the "need to voice&amp;nbsp;... hurt, the need to surface realities, the need to shine light on a history that was and continues to be ignored" is greater than the fear of discussing the issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The internally oppressed must learn how they have been indoctrinated, to "engage in a process of rejecting internalized subordination as an everyday choice".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Related theories==

French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] "has argued that the rise of parliamentary institutions and of new conceptions of political liberty was accompanied by a darker counter-movement, by the emergence of a new and unprecedented discipline directed against the body. More is required of the body now than mere political allegiance or the approbation of the products of its labor: the new discipline invades the body and seeks to regulate its very forces and operations, the economy and efficiency of its movements&amp;nbsp;... the production of 'docile bodies' requires that an uninterrupted coercion be directed to the very processes of bodily activity, not just their result; this 'micro-physics of power' fragments and partitions the body's time, its space, and its movements".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 18th-century English philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[Panopticon]] is a theoretical model of Foucault's ideas. Its constant state of surveillance, imposed by an oppressive external force, serves {{"'}}to induce in the inmate a state of consciousness and permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power'; each becomes to himself his own jailer".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
