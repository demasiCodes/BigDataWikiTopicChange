==Belgium==
Racism in Belgium exists since its independence declaration during the colonial era. A 2011 study shows that racism against sub-saharan people is strongly influenced by its colonial history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= L’AfricaMuseum de Tervuren inaugure un nouvel espace sur le racisme |url= https://www.rtbf.be/article/lafricamuseum-de-tervuren-inaugure-un-nouvel-espace-sur-le-racisme-11197209 |publisher=[[RTBF]] |date=13 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bulgaria==
On 9 October 1992, the Bulgarian president signed the Council of Europe [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]], signaling a new commitment to uphold minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Human Rights Watch World Report 1998 – 1 January |url= http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6a8a510.html |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=1 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the parliamentary party [[Attack (political party)|Ataka]], identifying itself as nationalist, attacked the mosque in the center of Sofia during the Friday prayer. In 2013 one of the leaders of another nationalist party, [[IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement|VMRO]], Angel Djambasky was put under investigation for calling the people to arm themselves against the immigrants.

At least 6 racist crimes are perpetrated between 3 and 13 November of every year. 
112 intellectuals signed a petition to the attorney general not to register the party Ataka, which was rejected by the attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2011/05/20/1093480_ataka_sreshtu_mjusjulmanite_v_djamiiata_na_sofiia_video/|title=България - "Атака" срещу мюсюлманите в джамията на София (видео) |work=dnevnik.bg|date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paper.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2013-11-05&amp;article=471190|title= Стандарт|work=standartnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bghelsinki.org/media/uploads/documents/external/2013-11-13_signal_na_112_grazhdani_sreshtu_neo-nazi_partia.pdf ОТКРИТ СИГНАЛ] (in Bulgarian) Retrieved 6 February 2023&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2019, Bulgarian supporters shouted racist abuse towards Black English footballers during a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/football/bulgaria-england-racism-uefa-gbr-spt-intl/index.html | title=All eyes on UEFA after football's night of shame | first=Aimee | last=Lewis | publisher=CNN | date=17 October 2019 | access-date=30 April 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyprus==
The National Popular Front, or National People's Front (Greek: Εθνικό Λαϊκό Μέτωπο (ΕΛΑΜ), Ethniko Laiko Metopo [[ELAM (Cyprus)]]), is a far-right movement (and later, political party) founded in 2008 in the Republic of Cyprus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |first=James |last=Mackay |date=2012-03-13 |title=Cyprus racism in the spotlight |url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/13/cyprus-political-racism-doros-polycarpou |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20220707031606/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/13/cyprus-political-racism-doros-polycarpou%23comments |archive-date=2022-07-07 |website=[[The Guardian]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party has been the subject of controversy in the Cypriot media and broader political scene. It has been repeatedly accused of promoting racism and being involved in acts of violence. Guest workers have reportedly often been a target of racial abuse from employers, landlords and government employees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Denmark==
{{main|Racism in Denmark}}
A poll from YouGov in 2019 showed that 72% rated their view on Romas as "totally negative", remarkably higher than the other polled Northern European countries,&lt;ref name="icenews"&gt;{{cite news |title=Denmark is most intolerant country in northern Europe |url=https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/06/05/european-attitudes-minorities |access-date=26 July 2023 |publisher=Yougov |date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims were also viewed more negatively, with 45% having a negative view. This was also tied first with Finland. The perception of Black people and Jews, were however lower than the average of the polled countries, with 11% and 8% respectively. In 2014 it was reported that Adoptees with foreign background are often racially abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foreign adoptees in Denmark often racially abused |url=https://www.icenews.is/2014/12/09/foreign-adoptees-in-denmark-often-racially-abused/ |website=Icenews |date=9 December 2014 |access-date=28 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young non-ethnic Danes have complained that some police officers have acted in a racist manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE472795/politi-de-unge-klager-over-racistiske-betjente/ Politi: De unge klager over racistiske betjente], by Andreas Lindquist, ''Politiken'', 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''hyggeracisme'' ([[hygge]] + racism) is used by some to describe racist phrases/jokes, where the person saying the phrase may perceive it as being unproblematic and funny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=hyggeracisme — Den Danske Ordbog |url=https://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=hyggeracisme |access-date=2022-06-10 |website=ordnet.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2020-06-15 |title=Hinda på 24 oplever tit hyggeracisme: 'Det er klamt, når fyrene ser min hudfarve som en fetich' |url=https://www.dr.dk/mitliv/tvaers/hinda-paa-24-oplever-tit-hyggeracisme-det-er-klamt-naar-fyrene-ser-min-hudfarve-som-en |access-date=2022-06-10 |website=DR |language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2010s, NATO soldiers from the U.S. stationed in Estonia as part of [[Enhanced Forward Presence]] were subject to racist attacks by local civilians, resulting in condemnations from the Estonian Air Force's commander, [[Jaak Tarien]], and the U.S. embassy's chargé d'affaires.&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://observer.com/2016/02/estonia-wants-more-nato-troops-but-only-if-they-arent-black/|title=Estonia Wants More NATO Troops—But Only If They Aren't Black|date=22 February 2016|work=Observer|access-date=29 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estonia.usembassy.gov/sp_eng110415.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160328230440/http://estonia.usembassy.gov/sp_eng110415.html|url-status=dead|title=Speeches and Articles - Tallinn, Estonia - Embassy of the United Stat…|date=28 March 2016|archive-date=28 March 2016|website=archive.is}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Estonians, particularly from the [[Conservative People's Party of Estonia|Conservative People's Party]], voiced their displeasure at the condemnations.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rubaltic.ru/article/segodnya-v-pribaltike/17112015-estoniya-rasizm/|script-title=ru:Американский дипломат осудила расизм в Эстонии|access-date=26 February 2016|work=RuBaltic|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226124801/http://www.rubaltic.ru/article/segodnya-v-pribaltike/17112015-estoniya-rasizm/|archive-date=26 February 2016|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rus.err.ee/v/estonia/5158b28a-87cf-4dcc-aeab-2752f9801619/konservatory-obvinili-diplomata-ssha-vo-vmeshatelstve-v-dela-estonii|script-title=ru:Консерваторы обвинили дипломата США во вмешательстве в дела Эстонии|work=Rus - ERR|year=2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225102922/http://rus.err.ee/v/estonia/5158b28a-87cf-4dcc-aeab-2752f9801619/konservatory-obvinili-diplomata-ssha-vo-vmeshatelstve-v-dela-estonii|access-date=25 December 2015|archive-date=25 December 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports say that racial hate crime is a recent phenomenon, and that they are on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.horus.be/files/99935/MediaArchive/pdf/finland_en.pdf Responding to racism in Finland]. European Network Against Racism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/11/hate_crimes_against_foreigners_rise_2111368.html |title=Hate Crimes against Foreigners Rise &amp;#124; Yle Uutiset |publisher=yle.fi |access-date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of reported hate crimes in 2003 and 2004 were 522 and 558, respectively. In 2009, they had increased to over 1,000 (including non-racist hate crimes). Racial hate crimes have fluctuated from 858 (2009) to 641 (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi/poliisi/poliisioppilaitos/home.nsf/PFBD/AA662EFEA0162E5FC2257C1B0022E970?opendocument | title=Poliisin tietoon tullut viharikollisuus vähentynyt | website=poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi | year=2013 | access-date=3 September 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903171135/http://www.poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi/poliisi/poliisioppilaitos/home.nsf/PFBD/AA662EFEA0162E5FC2257C1B0022E970?opendocument | archive-date=3 September 2014 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the typical suspect have been a Finnish-born young man. However, over 60% of the targets were reported to have been Finland-born, although those with foreign-born parents were counted as well. The most targeted immigrants in 2004 were reported to be of [[Somali people|Somali]], [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin. One-third of the hate crimes were reportedly aimed at the [[Finnish Kale|Kale]], and only one in six were members of the native population.

In European Social Surveys since 2002, Finns have proved to be least racist just after Swedes. Earlier Finnish scientific data reveals that attitudes had been improving continuously for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsd.uta.fi/lehti/fi/28/tietoarkisto09.pdf Yhteiskuntatieteellinen tietoarkisto | www.fsd.uta.fi | 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Social Policy and responsible of Finnish ESS, Heikki Ervasti, denies a common thought of increased negative attitudes against immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tylkkari.fi/ilmiot/kyokkipuheesta-poliittiseksi-voimaksi |title= Kyökkipuheesta poliittiseksi voimaksi | publisher=tylkkari.fi |year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll made in late 2011 revealed that the majority of the Finns viewed Finland as a racist country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Poll+Majority+of+Finns+see+Finland+as+racist+country/1135269860316 |title=Helsingin Sanomat International Edition – Home |work=Helsingin Sanomat |access-date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two thirds considered the country to be fairly racist, 12% recognised a moderate amount of racism, and 2% admitted to be very racist; 35% agreed partly or wholly to the statement "Islam is a threat to Western values and democracy", and 29% agreed more or less to that "people belonging to certain races simply are not suited to live in a modern society". One in five thought "it needs to be recognised as a fact that some nations are more intelligent than others", and 11% agreed partly or completely to "people whose appearance and culture differ much from those of the Finns are unpredictable and frightening".

{{main|Racism in France}}
In 1998, the Council of Europe's European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) made a report stating concern about racist activities in France and accused the French authorities of not doing enough to combat this. The report and other groups have expressed concern about organizations such as [[Front National (France)]]. In a recent [[Pew Research Center|Pew Survey]], 47% of the French deem immigration from [[Central and Eastern Europe]] (mainly from [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]] and [[Romania]], including [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Romani people]]) to be a very bad thing. Likewise, the majority of French respondents revealed negative views on the immigration of [[Muslims]] from [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. A small minority showed signs of anti-Semitism. Roughly 11% had an unfavorable view of Jews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=795 |title=Pew Global Attitudes Project: Summary of Findings: A Year After Iraq War |access-date=16 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216042207/http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=795 |archive-date=16 December 2009 }} (16 March 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and 8% felt that US policy was most influenced by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=803 |title=Pew Global Attitudes Project: III: Opinions of U.S. Policies: U.S. Image Up Slightly, But Still Negative |access-date=12 February 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211125844/http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=803 |archive-date=11 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|section|reason=the section does not mention modern cases post-[[WWII]]|date=May 2021}}
The period after Germany lost [[World War I]] led to an increased use of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and other forms of [[racism]] in political discourse, for example among the right-wing [[Freikorps]], emotions that finally culminated in the ascent to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933. The [[Nazi racial policy]] and the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] against Jews and other non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]] represented the most explicit racist policies in Europe in the twentieth century. These laws deprived all Jews including even half-Jews and quarter-Jews as well as other non-Aryans from German citizenship. Jews' official title became "subject of the state".

==Ireland==

Historically, the most serious racial problems in Ireland stemmed from the colonization of the country by the British, and the racist attitude of the colonists to the native Irish. The English considered themselves to be a distinct race from the Irish, who were classified as '[[Melanochroi]]', or 'half black' by [[Thomas Huxley]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Depictions of the Irish in the popular British press throughout the centuries of British colonisation were noted for their portrayal of the Irish as subhuman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/18th-19th-century-history/punch-and-the-great-famine-by-peter-gray/|title=Punch and the Great Famine|last=Gray|first=Peter|publisher=History Ireland|date=Summer 1993|access-date=26 July 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws suppressing Irish culture and enfranchisement, outlawing the use of the [[Irish language]], education, and the practice of the Roman Catholicism were enforced during various periods from the 14th century onward (see [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] and [[Penal Laws (Ireland)]]).

===20th century===
During the second world war, although [[Irish neutrality during World War II|Ireland was officially neutral]], [[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] was accused of sympathizing with and supporting the [[Nazi regime]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany. Following the death of Hitler in 1945, de Valera was one of many who signed a book of condolence and offered sympathies to the German ambassador at the Embassy in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;''An Irish Statesman and Revolutionary'' by Elizabeth Keane ({{ISBN|978-1845111250}}), page 106&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the belief among [[Allies of World War II|Allied leaders]] such as [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] that de Valera and the Irish in general were supportive of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Public Service Broadcasting – 1940s: De Valera and Broadcasting|work=History of RTÉ|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1940s_a.html|access-date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substantial influx of Nazi war criminals to Ireland following the war and their acceptance into society both officially by the Government of Ireland and by the general public also lead to claims Ireland was tolerant if not supportive of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;"Hidden History: Ireland's Nazis", broadcast by RTÉ - January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must also be borne in mind that Germany had supplied guns to the Irish War of Independence 20 years earlier, and so Irish sympathies to the Germans rather than their long-standing British oppressors can easily be understood in this way, rather than due to anti-semitism. (Main article: [[History of the Jews in Ireland]]).

In mid-twentieth century Ireland there was traditionally very little [[immigration]] in general to the Republic of Ireland, and hence little racial diversity, though in recent decades growing prosperity in the country (see: [[Celtic Tiger]]) attracted increasing numbers of [[immigrants]], mainly from [[Central and Eastern Europe]] (primarily [[Poland]]), [[China]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Also, the absence of colonialist baggage has meant that foreign people are not drawn to Ireland by "[[mother country]]" factors that have affected other European countries. Descendants of [[Irish people]] who emigrated in the past also started moving to the country. Most immigrants have settled in [[Dublin]] and the other cities. Though these developments have been somewhat tolerated by most, there has been a steady rise in racist attitudes among some sections of society. A 2001 survey found that 51% of Irish people surveyed considered the country inherently racist&lt;ref&gt;Liam Collins.

Independent.ie (27 May 2001). Retrieved 2 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and 60% of those in the 25 to 34 age group considered "racism" to be an Irish trait. In 2005, Minister of State for Overseas Development, Conor Lenihan famously advised Socialist politician Joe Higgins to "stick with the kebabs" – referring to his campaigning on behalf of [[Turkey|Turkish]] contract workers who had been paid less than the statutory minimum wage. The Minister later retracted his remarks and apologized.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O’Farrell.

Researchers from the [[University of Amsterdam]] and [[Utrecht University]] conducted between 2016 and 2018 a study where they sent 4,200 job application letters to companies. The fictional applicants were between 23 and 25 years old, with four years of work experience, and applied for real vacancies. All the applicants had a Dutch nationality, but the names and mother tongue of the applicants were adjusted. The conclusion was that Dutch people had the most chances of being invited for a job interview. The candidates with a Western immigrant background had 20% less chance of being invited. And the candidates who had a non-Western immigrant background faced the biggest discrimination with 40% of the applicants not being invited to a job interview. Especially applicants with a Turkish, Moroccan or Antillean background were discriminated against. A side note from the study was that during economic downturns, there was an increased amount of discrimination. For applicants who were discriminated against, an improved CV didn't improve their chances of being invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work= Algemeen Dagblad|location= The Netherlands | author= Marloe van der Schrier | url= https://www.ad.nl/ad-werkt/nog-volop-discriminatie-bij-sollicitaties-inhoud-cv-maakt-nauwelijks-uit~a7567cc9/ |title= Nog volop discriminatie bij sollicitaties: inhoud cv maakt nauwelijks uit (English: Still plenty of discrimination in job applications: content of CV hardly makes any difference) |access-date= 23 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[pogrom]]" became commonly used in English after a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots swept through south-western [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]] in 1881&amp;ndash;1884. A much bloodier wave of pogroms broke out in 1903–1906, leaving an estimated 2,000 Jews dead.  By the beginning of the 20th century, most European Jews lived in the so-called [[Pale of Settlement]], the Western frontier of the [[Russian Empire]] consisting generally of the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and neighboring regions.  Many pogroms accompanied the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]], an estimated 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former [[Russian Empire]]; the number of Jewish orphans exceeded 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism|title=anti-Semitism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary L Rubinstein, Daniel C Cohn-Sherbok, Abraham J Edelheit, William D Rubinstein, ''The Jews in the Modern World'', Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
