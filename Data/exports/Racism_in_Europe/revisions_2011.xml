The article describes the state of '''[[race relations]] and [[racism]] in [[Europe]]'''.  Racism of various forms is found in every country on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engACT400202001|publisher = Amnesty International|title = Racism and the administration of justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Racism is widely condemned throughout the world, with 170 states signatories of the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] by August 8, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/208ba1d9617d31d1c1257259003eed53?Opendocument|title = Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 68th and 69th session|publisher = United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In different countries, the forms that racism takes may be different for historic, cultural, religious, economic or demographic reasons.

==Austria==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
This complacency was tested in the 1986 presidential race when it emerged that [[Kurt Waldheim]] (a former [[UN secretary general]]) had concealed facts about his war-time military service with the [[Wehrmacht]]. Nevertheless Waldheim was elected President. Controversy again erupted in 2000 when [[Jörg Haider]]'s far-right [[Freedom Party of Austria|Freedom Party]] entered into coalition with the conservative [[Austrian People's Party]] having gained 27% of the vote. Progress has been made with settling the disputes and compensation for Jews and others whose property and assets were seized during the Nazi era, with a deal completed in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Elections in 2002 saw a significant drop in support for the Freedom Party, with the party subsequently splitting into opposing factions. [[Jörg Haider]], before his death in a car crash on the 11th October 2008, led the "[[Alliance for the Future of Austria]]".

==Bulgaria==
Racism in Bulgaria has been geared towards the [[Romani people]] who are perceived to be of different racial and ethnic background. However, not all Bulgarians are racist towards the Roma, and it varies with an individual's upbringing, education, area where they lived, and other factors. {{fact|date=September 2011}}
Bulgarian nationalists are also wary of the country's large [[Turkish people|Turkish]] minority because of their perceived ambitions for greater power in Bulgaria and potential separatism in areas where Turks predominantly live. The [[Bulgarization|forced assimilation campaign]] of the late 80s and early 90s directed against ethnic Turks resulted in the [[Muhajir (Turkey)|permanent emigration]] of some 300,000 [[Turks in Bulgaria|Bulgarian Turks]] to Turkey. During this period, Turks were forced to change their names to Slavic Bulgarian ones and [[Turkish culture]] was heavily suppressed. [[Muslim Bulgarians]] (ethnic Bulgarians practicing Islam) were also targeted as Islam was seen as a "foreign "Turkish element" that stood against Bulgarian interests.
The [[National Union Attack]] or Ataka, a party widely considered fanatically xenophobic, surprisingly won 10% of the popular vote at the recent 2005 elections. A bit under 20% also voted for the far right Bulgarian political party [[Attack National Union]] for the recent European Elections. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In regards to the ethnic Macedonian minority in Bulgaria: The Bulgarian president told the Council of Ministers in Strasbourg on April 22 that there was no [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] minority in Bulgaria. Expressions of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] culture were frequently suppressed: on May 5, police arrested fifteen ethnic [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] to prevent a cultural celebration. On October 9, however, the Bulgarian president signed the Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities, signaling a new commitment to uphold minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Human Rights Watch |title= Human Rights Watch World Report 1998 - Macedonia, 1 January 1998 |url= http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6a8a510.html |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=1998-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyprus==
Cyprus has a long history of inter-ethnic conflict between [[Turkish Cypriot]] and [[Greek Cypriot]] citizens.  Following independence, these resulted in a series of escalating incidents of violence, mostly practised by the Greek Cypriot majority against the Turkish Cypriot minority group,and a military action by the Turkish army in 1968.  In 1974, [[Turkey]] invaded a large part of the island with the official explanation that it was in order to maintain peace and save Turkish Cypriots.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
More recently, large-scale immigration to the South has resulted in a growing atmosphere of racism and xenophobia, occasionally spilling into violent incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main.php?id=25896&amp;cat_id=1 "Cyprus must do more to fight racism"] but they are sleeping on their heads&lt;/ref&gt;  The NGO [[KISA (NGO)|KISA]] has been set up to combat this development.

==Denmark==

Several tourists claimed that they were allegedly beaten and harassed by staff in a prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR010011998?open&amp;of=ENG-DNK#DEN DENMARK - Alleged ill-treatment - Veronica Ngozi Ugwuoha], Concerns in Europe, July - December 1997, Amnesty&lt;/ref&gt; However the Regional State Prosecutor for Copenhagen found no basis for a case.

==France==
{{main|Racism in France}}
In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the [[Jews in France]] were subject to frequent massacres. The [[Crusades]] were followed by expulsions; in 1396, 100,000 Jews were expelled from France. [[Jew]]s in Western Europe generally were forced, by decree or by informal pressure, to live in highly segregated [[ghetto]]s.

In the colonial age, the French also displayed negative sentiments toward North Africans and blacks. French violent behavior in its colonies induced a strong resentment from local populations. The fact that Algerians, a formerly colonized population, formed the bulk of late-twentieth century immigration has raised delicate issues, which are exacerbated by the high crime rates and social decay.

France is home to Europe’s largest population of [[Muslims]], about 5,000,000 (8%), as well as the continent’s largest community of Jews, about 650,000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Over the last several years, anti-Jewish violence, property destruction, and racist language has been wildly increasing. Jewish leaders perceive an intensifying anti-Semitism in France, mainly among Muslims of [[Arab]] or Algerian heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Colin |last=Nickerson |title=Anti-Semitism seen rising among France's Muslims |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2006/03/13/anti_semitism_seen_rising_among_frances_muslims/ |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2006-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the Council of Europe's European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) made a report stating concern about racist activities in France and accused the French authorities of not doing enough to combat this. The report and other groups have expressed concern about organizations like [[Front National (France)]]. In a recent [[Pew Research Center|Pew Survey]], 47% of the French deem immigration from Eastern Europe to be a bad thing. A small minority shows signs of Anti-Semitism. Roughly 11% had an unfavorable view of Jews&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=795 Pew Global Attitudes Project: Summary of Findings: A Year After Iraq War&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and 8% felt that US policy was most influenced by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=803 Pew Global Attitudes Project: III: Opinions of U.S. Policies: U.S. Image Up Slightly, But Still Negative&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
{{main|Racism in Germany|Nazism}}
In the nineteenth century, Germany became one of the major centers of nationalist thought, with the ''[[Völkisch movement]]'', and also a major area for development of race-biology, many of these theories virulently racist ''[[Racism#From "racial theory" to "racism"|See above]]''. Anti-Semitic campaigns in this period took on a definitely "racial" valence, as definitely distinct from a religious one.

The period after losing [[World War I]] led to an increased use of Anti-Semitism and other racism in political discourse, for example among the right-wing [[Freikorps]], emotions that finally culminated in the ascent of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933. The [[Nazi racial policy]] and the [[Nuremberg Laws]] against Jews represented the most explicit racist policies in Europe in the twentieth century. During later phases of the Second World War, the Nazis began their genocide: [[the Holocaust]], a systematic murdering of six million [[Jews]], [[Porrajmos|Gypsies]], [[homosexuals]] (see [[homophobia]]), [[disability|disabled people]] and other "undesirables". On the Eastern Front, the Nazi SS soldiers also had orders to shoot all Soviet prisoners of war who had "Mongolian features."

In the post-[[World War II]] era, German reconciliation with its Anti-Semitic past has been a painful experience. A depleted population of young males during WWII and the German economic miracle showed that a recovering economy needed more factory laborers, the West German government recruited immigrants from mainly Turkey in the second half of the 20th century. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Recent concerns about racism have centered around immigrants (''Ausländer''), who encounter prejudice when seeking jobs and apartments, or can even experience direct violent attacks by some right-wing groups. This pattern is similar to what is happening in some other European countries.

The immigrants came in two waves.  The first wave of immigrants came in the early 1950s, the so called ''Gastarbeiter'' (Guest Workers). They were almost exclusively requested and welcomed by the German government and companies as work-force increase to the growing and booming economy. These well trained working people were literally exchanged by their native countries for economical incentives and came mainly from countries such as [[Turkey]], Italy, Greece and [[Yugoslavia]] to [[West Germany]]; and [[Vietnam]], [[Mongolia]], [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] to [[East Germany]]. Initially, the ''Gastarbeiter'' were expected to remain on limited contracts or work-permissions, and then eventually leave. Many of these contracts were extendent and family reunions were granted resulting in children born and raised in Germany.  These second generation "Gastarbeiters" were now granted different rights (the right to live indefinitely in Germany - Aufenthaltsberechtigung) from their parents permission to reside for a limited, but for indefinitely extendible time (Arbeitserlaubnis).  Problems of integration arose when these second and third generation "Gastarbeiter" remained citizens of other countries in which these generations had never lived and were increasingly culturally, socially and economically alienated. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Starting from the 1980s, the second wave of immigrants into Germany were the ''Asylbewerber'' (Asylum Seekers) from war torn and conflicted areas such as [[Iraq]], [[Morocco]], [[Somalia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Argentina]] and [[Lebanon]] among others. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Germany was not prepared and in denial of being a land of migration since at least the 1960s when the first children were being born to ''Gastarbeiter''. By the 2000s, an estimated 3 to 5 million [[Turks]] lived in Germany, concentrated in [[Kreuzberg]], [[Berlin]] and inner-cities or industrial urban areas in the western regions.

Despite the 1950s immigrants of European origin adapting to German culture, it proved to be a different case for Turks and other non-Europeans who held on a cultural identity held to be "exotic" and "alien" by some Germans from that of their own. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A failed integration of the first generation and failed German planning assisted in a general sense of not-belonging and the development of ghetto neighborhoods, creating and enabling racism.

In November 2010, Prime Minister [[Angela Merkel]] publicly remarked that [[multiculturalism]] in Germany has failed. Many Germans criticized her bold move to break a previously held post-WWII [[taboo]] on even peacefully expressing an opposition to multiculturalism in a racially diverse Germany, where a fifth (18-19%) of Germans in 2010 are foreign-born. More conservatives are openly questioning the tolerance of immigrants and their behavior. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Greece==
On April 11, 1919, Greece supported the [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|racial equality proposal]] against some countries strong oppositions in the [[Paris Peace Conference]].

Although not a prosperous welfare state in its own right, Greece has become the focus of Third World illegal immigrants, if only the first port of call by such immigrants in their attempts to move on to Western Europe. Many of these immigrants, mainly from [[Africa]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], have faced racist abuse from the locals. Attacks on them by Greek right-wing groups have happened repeatedly in Athens, often with the silent consent of the Greek city police. {{fact|date=November 2011}}

==Ireland==
Ethnic hatred in Ireland has a long history. For almost eight centuries of [[Irish history]] the most evident segregation in Ireland was the suppression of the indigenous Irish people by a succession of English and Norman rulers, beginning with the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169]]. The English imposed laws forbidding land ownership, the [[Penal Laws]], and later restrictions on freedom of religion (persecution of Roman Catholics following the Protestant Reformation in England), and denial of the right to vote or hold office. Casual racism was also evident in inaction during [[The Great Famine]], leading to approximately 1 million deaths and the exodus of over 2 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Demography (official journal of the Population Association of America), Vol. 23, No. 4 (Nov., 1986), pp. 543-562. Fertility Trends, Excess Mortality, and the Great Irish Famine -
Phelim P. Boyle, Cormac O Grada.
This paper estimates mortality and fertility rates prevailing in Ireland during the 25-year period before the Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. A technique is developed to estimate the age-specific mortality level during the Famine and the number of Famine-related deaths. The paper concludes that fertility rates were declining during the period 1821–1845 and that the effects of the Famine were especially severe on the very young and the very old. Ignoring deaths among emigrants, it is estimated that one million individuals perished as a result of the Famine. The analysis permits year-by-year reconstruction of the Irish population age structure for the period 1821-1851.
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Plantations of Ireland]], run by English colonists, were a direct precursor to the overseas British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Canny, Origins of Empire, The Oxford History of the British Empire&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of wars and rebellions, such as the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]], [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and the [[Irish War of Independence]] of 1919-1921, many [[war crimes]], massacres and atrocities were committed by British forces or (British-supported) Protestant paramilitaries. There were also retaliatory massacres of settlers and their descendants, such as in Co. Wexford following the 1798 rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyirish/Rebelelion%20of%201798%20WEXFORD.html]''&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that as much as a third of the entire population of [[Ireland]] perished during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|civil wars]] and subsequent [[Cromwellian]] conquest in the mid-17th century. Since the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], Ireland had been mainly under the control of the Irish [[Confederate Ireland|Confederate Catholics]].

The [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland#Guerilla warfare, famine and plague|Cromwellian reconquest of Ireland]] was extremely brutal.
The reconquest would [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|today]] be called a [[war crime]]. [[William Petty]], who conducted the first scientific land and [[demographic]] survey of Ireland in the 1650s (the [[Down Survey]]), concluded that between 400,000 and 620,000 people had died in Ireland between 1641 and 1653, many as a result of [[famine]] and [[Black Death|plague]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/ashorthistory/archive/intro99.shtml The curse of Cromwell], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''War and Underdevelopment: Economic and Social Consequences of Conflict v. 1'' (Queen Elizabeth House Series in Development Studies), Frances Stewart, Oxford University Press. 2000. "Faced with the prospect of an Irish alliance with Charles II, Cromwell carried out a series of massacres to subdue the Irish. Then, once Cromwell had returned to England, the English Commissary, General Henry Ireton, adopted a deliberate policy of crop burning and starvation, which was responsible for the majority of an estimated 600,000 deaths out of a total Irish population of 1,400,000."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Levene, 2005, Genocide in the Age of the Nation-State, I.B.Tauris: London: ''[The Act of Settlement of Ireland], and the parliamentary legislation which succeeded it the following year, is the nearest thing on paper in the English domestic record, to a program of state-sanctioned and systematic ethnic cleansing of another people. The fact that it did not include 'total' genocide in its remit, or that it failed to put into practice the vast majority of its proposed expulsions, however, says less about the lethal determination of the English and more about the political, structural and financial weakness of the early modern English state.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the dominant narrative of Irish history was discrimination against the native Irish population in favour of English and Scottish settlers, this evolved into dividing the population by religion, such that adhering to the state religion was equated to ethnic group. Over time, this created two broad-brush groups, Catholic and Protestant. Violence between the local communities became the dominant expression of racism and ultimately led to creation of two States on the island. While Northern Ireland's systems favoured the Protestant majority, the Irish Free State, nominally a republic, also became more polarized after its formation. Following establishment of the Irish Free State, attacks on Protestant families in border areas, as well as the Roman Catholic Church's [[Ne Temere]] policy that all children of religiously mixed marriages were to be raised as Catholics, effectively decimated the non-Catholic population in what is now the Republic of Ireland, falling from over 10% in 1900 to under 4%.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/protestants_1861_1991.html]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shelta]] or [[Irish Travellers]], a nomadic ethnic group once speaking their own language have also experienced persecution in past and modern times, in Northern Ireland and the [[Republic of Ireland]].

Following independence in 1921 there was traditionally very little [[immigration]] by non-whites to the Republic of Ireland due to historic [[poverty]], though in recent decades growing prosperity in the country (see: [[Celtic Tiger]]) attracted increasing numbers of [[immigrants]], mainly from Eastern Europe, China and Africa. Also the absence of colonialist baggage has meant that foreign people are not drawn to Ireland by "[[mother country]]" factors that have affected other European countries. Descendants of [[Irish people]] who emigrated in the past also started moving to the country. Most immigrants have settled in [[Dublin]] and the other cities. Though these developments have been somewhat tolerated by most, there has been a steady rise in racist attitudes among some sections of society. A 2001 survey found that 51% of Irish people surveyed considered the country inherently racist &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/ireland-is-a-country-of-racists--at-least-the-irish-think-thats-true-508512.html]''&lt;/ref&gt; and 60% of those in the 25 to 34 age-group considered "racism" to be an Irish trait. In 2005, Minister of State for Overseas Development, Conor Lenihan famously advised Socialist politician Joe Higgins to "stick with the kebabs" - referring to his campaigning on behalf of Turkish contract workers who had been paid less than the statutory minimum wage. The Minister later retracted his remarks and apologized.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2005/0519/ireland/lenihan-under-pressure-to-apologise-for-kebab-gaffe-626825454.html]''&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 EU-MIDIS survey of attitudes to minorities in the 27 EU States found that Ireland had the most racist attitudes to black Africans in the entire EU.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/ireland-of-the-welcomes-is-a-myth-2133538.html]''&lt;/ref&gt;

While most racist abuse in Ireland is verbal, violent hate crimes regularly occur. In 2000, a white English man was stabbed and seriously injured when defending his Jamaican-born wife from racist abuse by a group of adult men.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/four-charged-with-hatred-in-racist-attack-on-father-son-345834.html]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, a Chinese man Zhao Liu Tao (29) was murdered in Dublin in what was described as the Republic of Ireland's first racially motivated murder.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1813880.stm Murder sparks Irish racism fears]'', [[BBC News]], February 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year Leong Ly Min, a Vietnamese man who had lived in Dublin since 1979,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://republican-news.org/archive/2002/August29/29anti.html Rally against racist attacks]'', [[Republican News]], August 29, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; was mortally wounded by two assailants who had been racially abusing him.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article7094192.ece Death of a dream as racism rears its head in Ireland]'', [[The Times]], April 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, 2 Polish mechanics, Pawel Kalite (29) and Marius Szwajkos (27) were attacked by a group of Dublin youths and died outside their home after each being stabbed in the head with a screwdriver.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://lostchildreninthewilderness.wordpress.com/2010/05/07/dublin-drimnagh-man-david-curran-19-found-guilty-of-double-murder-updated/]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 15-year old schoolboy Toyosi Shitta-bey, born in Nigeria but brought up in Dublin, was killed by two brothers (aged 23 and 38) close to his West Dublin home while returning from the National Aquatic Centre.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/courts/man-38-accused-of-killing-schoolboy-is-granted-bail-2127580.html]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Several issues relating to immigration gained publicity in the early years of the century. After 1997 and prior to 2005 any baby born in the Republic was entitled to Irish citizenship due to stipulations in the [[Good Friday agreement]]. This led to claims that many pregnant women from Africa (overwhelmingly from Nigeria),  having discarded their identification documentation, were travelling to Ireland expressly to give birth and thus allow their child to gain Irish citizenship. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} This became known as [[citizenship tourism]]. Following these alleged abuses of the loophole in the Irish Constitution a referendum on the issue was held. The referendum was duly carried and the loophole was closed.

The large majority of Irish people support their country's membership of the European Union, but growth in unemployment was paralleled by a rise in more visible resentment of migrants from either inside or outside the Union. There are several "anti-racism" groups active in the Republic, as well as those seeking tighter immigration laws such as the [[Immigration Control Platform]].

At the end of the ''[[Reconquista]]'', [[Spanish Inquisition]] imposed ''[[pureza de sangre]]'' ("[[racial purity]]") against Jews and Muslims. The Discovery of the [[New World]] also led to the famous [[Valladolid Controversy]], in which [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] opposed [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda|Sepúlveda]]'s denial of the existence of "Indian souls". ''See [[Eduardo Galeano]]'s ''The Veins of South America'' ''. Spain has attracted mixed race mulatto (African and Caucasian) and mestizo (European and American Indian) persons from its (ex) colonies since the end of the 17th century.

Racist abuse aimed at black footballers has been reported at Spanish football league matches in recent years. This has led to protests and UEFA fines against clubs whose supporters continue the abuse. Several players in the Spanish league including Barcelona striker [[Samuel Eto'o]] and Espanyol goalkeeper [[Carlos Kameni]] have suffered and spoken out against the abuse. In 2006, Real Zaragoza player [[Ewerthon]] stated : "the Spanish Federation have to start taking proper measures and we as black players also have to act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4751876.stm Eto'o makes anti-racism protest] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden was also the first country in the world to open an institute for race-biology research in the Swedish town of Uppsala.&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Rasbiologi|race-biology intitute]]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute recommended the sterilization by force of the mentally ill, physically disabled, homosexuals and ethnic minorities, which was allowed by Swedish law until 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Sterilisering (ingrepp)|sterilization]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sweden is often referred as having been passive regarding WW2, 100 Swedes voluntarily joined the Nazis and participated in Waffen-SS.

[[Sveriges Radio]] reported that the punishments for driving under the influence of alcohol tended to be harsher for immigrants than for Swedes; while over 50% of immigrants were sent to jail for driving under the effect of alcohol, only less than 30% of ethnic Swedes were sent to jail with the same level of alcohol found in blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/ekot/artikel.asp?Artikel=403326 Harder punishments to immigrants]&lt;/ref&gt; There has been evidence that the Swedish police used "Neger Niggerson" as a nickname for a criminal in a police training; this was published in Swedish media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/17424/20090207/ Racist stereotypes used in police training]&lt;/ref&gt; Lately however, many incidents of racial attitudes and discrimination of the Swedish police have led for the first time to the control of racial attitudes of police students under police education &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_3516139.svd Control of police attitudes]&lt;/ref&gt; A recent research done by the Swedish Confederation for Professional Employees (TCO) found that people with foreign background have much lower chances of finding a job that is appropriate for their education, even when they have grown up in Sweden and got their education in Swedish institutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tco.se/Templates/Page2____417.aspx?DataID=8753 Academic immigrants discriminates in labour market]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, there were a total of 3,536 hate crimes (defined as crimes with an ethnic or religious motive) reported to the police, including 118 cases of anti-Semitic agitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/Antisemitism_Update_2009.pdf Fundamental Rights Agency report (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; Racism in Sweden is reported to appear within Swedish health-care services as well. A nurse at a Stockholm suburb hospital lost his job after complaining on racial attitudes of the hospital staff to patients with immigrant background. Staff was cited saying "go back to Arabia", "the patient is screaming because it's in his culture", "send him to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]" and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/sthlm/skoterska-slog-larm-forlorar-jobbet-1.960497 Nurse speaks out about racism]&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish national television (SVT) has reported on a new research done in Sweden which identifies that job seekers with a Swedish name have 50% higher chances to be called for an interview than job seekers with middle-eastern names. The research enlightens that there is not much difference between foreign-born job seekers and job seekers born in Sweden if both don't have a Swedish name; this indicates that ethnic discrimination is the main cause of the variations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svt.se/2.22620/1.1795381/invandrare_kallas_inte_till_intervju?lid=senasteNytt_275216&amp;lpos=rubrik_1795381 Immigrants are not called for job interviews]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switzerland==
[[Switzerland|The Swiss Confederation]] or ''Confederatio Helvetica'' is a nation composed of four subcultural groups: German-speaking (63.7%), French-speaking (20.4%), Italian-speaking (6.5%) and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]-speaking (0.5%) (Source: [http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/bevoelkerung/sprachen__religionen/blank/kennzahlen0/sprachen.html Federal Population Census 2000]). With this diversity and its history of [[Neutral country|neutrality]], Switzerland has been seen as a safe refuge for those genuinely fleeing from persecution, and this is backed up by statistics. Switzerland has seen an increase in refugees in recent years, (particularly from Africa), who have claimed asylum directly in Switzerland. In 1992, the federal refugee office registered some 7,000 black Africans requesting asylum. In the first nine months of 2002 the number was 17,000.

The vast majority of asylum seekers are believed by many Swiss politicians to be economic immigrants rather than genuine asylum seekers. Furthermore, the SVP or [[Swiss People's Party]] has significantly increased its share of the vote in recent years on a perceived "anti-immigrant" platform. It is best known for opposing Swiss membership in international organisations such as the EU and [[United Nations]] and for its campaigning against perceived flaws in the immigration, asylum and penal laws.

Swiss "Confederation Commission Against Racism" which is part of the Swiss "Federal Department of Home Affairs"[http://www.edi.admin.ch/] published a 2004 report, ''Black People in Switzerland'': ''A Life between [[Racial integration|Integration]] and [[Discrimination]]'' [http://www.edi.admin.ch/ekr/dokumentation/shop/00019/00142/index.html?lang=de] (published in German, French, and Italian only). According to this report, discrimination based on skin colour in Switzerland is not exceptional, and affects immigrants decades after their immigration.

Swiss people voted a new parliament in 2007, giving the right-wing [[Swiss People's Party]] a consolidated grip on power. [[UN]] [[Human Rights]] are fearful of the xenophobia that characterized Switzerland, and condemned laws that target the country's immigrants as unjust and racist. The [[Swiss People's Party]] which has the largest number of seats in the Swiss parliament and is a member of the country's coalition government, drew worldwide condemnation with an ad campaign depicting three white sheep kicking a black sheep off a Swiss flag. The poster is, according to the United Nations, the sinister symbol of the rise of a new racism and xenophobia in the heart of one of the world's oldest independent democracies. According to Pascal Sciarini, professor of political science at the [[University of Geneva]], the People's Party's recent electoral success is down to its tough line on foreigners, and it is now a prisoner of this strategy: "They have to keep the fires burning, and that means they have to come up with new ideas and at the same time harden their stance," he said.  Although Switzerland has Europe's toughest naturalisation laws - foreigners must live for 12 years in a Swiss community before they can apply, and being born in Switzerland brings no right to citizenship -, [[Swiss People's Party]] passed a new naturalisation procedure in 2007, called '' Democratic Naturalisation '' in this new procedure foreigners must often be approved by the entire voting community, in a secret ballot, or a show of hands. A report, from Switzerland's Federal Commission on Racial Discrimination, into the new process of naturalisation says the current system is discriminatory and in many respects racist, and recommends far-reaching changes. It criticises the practice of allowing members of a community to vote on an individual's citizenship application. [[Muslims]], [[Jews]], [[Buddhists]] and people from the [[Balkans]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]] are the most likely to be rejected, the report points out. It cites the case of a disabled man originally from [[Kosovo]]. Although fulfilling all the legal criteria, his application for citizenship was rejected by his community on the grounds that his disability made him a burden on taxpayers, and that he was Muslim. [[Swiss People's Party]] claims that Swiss communities have a [[democratic]] right to decide who can or cannot be Swiss. In addition, the report said "Official statements and political campaigns that present immigrants from the EU in a favourable light and immigrants from elsewhere in a bad light must stop", according to the Swiss Federal Statistics Office in 2006, 85.5 percent of the foreign residents in Switzerland are European [http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/themen/01/07/blank/data/01.html]. The [[United Nations]] special rapporteur on racism, [[Doudou Diène]], has observed that Switzerland suffers from racism, [[discrimination]] and [[xenophobia]]. The UN envoy explained that although the Swiss authorities recognised the existence of [[racism]] and xenophobia, they did not view the problem as being serious. Diène pointed out that representatives of minority communities said they experienced serious racism and discrimination, notably for access to public services (e.g. health care), employment and lodging.[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/front/UN_envoy_calls_racism_in_Switzerland_a_reality.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=6382785&amp;cKey=1137401626000&amp;ty=st]
