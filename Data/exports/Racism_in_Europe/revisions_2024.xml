==Belgium==
Racism in Belgium existed since its independence declaration during the colonial era. A 2011 study shows that racism against sub-saharan people is strongly influenced by its colonial history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= L'AfricaMuseum de Tervuren inaugure un nouvel espace sur le racisme |url= https://www.rtbf.be/article/lafricamuseum-de-tervuren-inaugure-un-nouvel-espace-sur-le-racisme-11197209 |publisher=[[RTBF]] |date=13 May 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bulgaria==
[[Romani people]] remain to be one of the most discriminated groups in Bulgaria. In 2023,  Arso Ganev went to a public pool in [[Kyustendil]], [[Bulgaria]] with his family. They were rejected due to being Roma. This is not the only case where Romani people are discriminated against in public pools in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kostova |first=Pavela |date=2023-08-01 |title=No Swimming Allowed: Bulgarian Roma Face Racial Discrimination At Public Pools |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/bulgaria-roma-discrimination-swimming-pools/32529839.html |access-date=2024-07-08 |work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 October 1992, the Bulgarian president signed the Council of Europe [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]], signaling a new commitment to uphold minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Human Rights Watch World Report 1998 – 1 January |url= http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6a8a510.html |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=1 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the parliamentary party [[Attack (political party)|Ataka]], identifying itself as nationalist, attacked the mosque in the center of Sofia during the Friday prayer. In 2013 one of the leaders of another nationalist party, [[IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement|VMRO]], Angel Djambasky was put under investigation for calling the people to arm themselves against the immigrants.

At least 6 racist crimes are perpetrated between 3 and 13 November of every year. 
112 intellectuals signed a petition to the attorney general not to register the party Ataka, which was rejected by the attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2011/05/20/1093480_ataka_sreshtu_mjusjulmanite_v_djamiiata_na_sofiia_video/|title=България - "Атака" срещу мюсюлманите в джамията на София (видео) |work=dnevnik.bg|date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paper.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2013-11-05&amp;article=471190|title= Стандарт|work=standartnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bghelsinki.org/media/uploads/documents/external/2013-11-13_signal_na_112_grazhdani_sreshtu_neo-nazi_partia.pdf ОТКРИТ СИГНАЛ] (in Bulgarian) Retrieved 6 February 2023&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2019, Bulgarian supporters shouted racist abuse towards Black English footballers during a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/15/football/bulgaria-england-racism-uefa-gbr-spt-intl/index.html | title=All eyes on UEFA after football's night of shame | first=Aimee | last=Lewis | publisher=CNN | date=17 October 2019 | access-date=30 April 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2023, Bulgaria's Commission for Protection Against Discrimination (CPD) fined [[VMRO – Bulgarian National Movement|VMRO - Bulgarian National Movement]] (VMRO-BND) because of the “Gypsy Issue” section on their website. They were also prohibited from posting content that promotes hatred against ethnic minorities.

==Cyprus==
The National Popular Front, or National People's Front (Greek: Εθνικό Λαϊκό Μέτωπο (ΕΛΑΜ), Ethniko Laiko Metopo [[ELAM (Cyprus)]]), is a far-right movement (and later, political party) founded in 2008 in the Republic of Cyprus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |first=James |last=Mackay |date=2012-03-13 |title=Cyprus racism in the spotlight |url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/13/cyprus-political-racism-doros-polycarpou |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20220707031606/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/13/cyprus-political-racism-doros-polycarpou%23comments |archive-date=2022-07-07 |website=[[The Guardian]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party has been the subject of controversy in the Cypriot media and broader political scene. It has been repeatedly accused of promoting racism and being involved in acts of violence. Guest workers have reportedly often been a target of racial abuse from employers, landlords and government employees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Denmark==
{{main|Racism in Denmark}}
A poll from YouGov in 2019 showed that 72% rated their view on Romas as "totally negative", remarkably higher than the other polled Northern European countries,&lt;ref name="icenews"&gt;{{cite news |title=Denmark is most intolerant country in northern Europe |url=https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2015/06/05/european-attitudes-minorities |access-date=26 July 2023 |publisher=Yougov |date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims were also viewed more negatively, with 45% having a negative view. This was also tied first with Finland. The perception of Black people and Jews, were however lower than the average of the polled countries, with 11% and 8% respectively. In 2014 it was reported that Adoptees with foreign background are often racially abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foreign adoptees in Denmark often racially abused |url=https://www.icenews.is/2014/12/09/foreign-adoptees-in-denmark-often-racially-abused/ |website=Icenews |date=9 December 2014 |access-date=28 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2010s, NATO soldiers from the U.S. stationed in Estonia as part of [[Enhanced Forward Presence]] were subject to racist attacks by local civilians, resulting in condemnations from the Estonian Air Force's commander, [[Jaak Tarien]], and the U.S. embassy's chargé d'affaires.&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://observer.com/2016/02/estonia-wants-more-nato-troops-but-only-if-they-arent-black/|title=Estonia Wants More NATO Troops—But Only If They Aren't Black|date=22 February 2016|work=Observer|access-date=29 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estonia.usembassy.gov/sp_eng110415.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160328230440/http://estonia.usembassy.gov/sp_eng110415.html|url-status=dead|title=Speeches and Articles - Tallinn, Estonia - Embassy of the United Stat…|date=28 March 2016|archive-date=28 March 2016|website=archive.is}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Estonians, particularly from the [[Conservative People's Party of Estonia|Conservative People's Party]], voiced their displeasure at the condemnations.&lt;ref name=Observer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rubaltic.ru/article/segodnya-v-pribaltike/17112015-estoniya-rasizm/|script-title=ru:Американский дипломат осудила расизм в Эстонии|access-date=26 February 2016|work=RuBaltic|date=17 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226124801/http://www.rubaltic.ru/article/segodnya-v-pribaltike/17112015-estoniya-rasizm/|archive-date=26 February 2016|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rus.err.ee/v/estonia/5158b28a-87cf-4dcc-aeab-2752f9801619/konservatory-obvinili-diplomata-ssha-vo-vmeshatelstve-v-dela-estonii|script-title=ru:Консерваторы обвинили дипломата США во вмешательстве в дела Эстонии|work=Rus - ERR|year=2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225102922/http://rus.err.ee/v/estonia/5158b28a-87cf-4dcc-aeab-2752f9801619/konservatory-obvinili-diplomata-ssha-vo-vmeshatelstve-v-dela-estonii|access-date=25 December 2015|archive-date=25 December 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports say that racial hate crime is a recent phenomenon, and that they are on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.horus.be/files/99935/MediaArchive/pdf/finland_en.pdf Responding to racism in Finland]. European Network Against Racism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/11/hate_crimes_against_foreigners_rise_2111368.html |title=Hate Crimes against Foreigners Rise &amp;#124; Yle Uutiset |date=3 November 2010 |publisher=yle.fi |access-date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of reported hate crimes in 2003 and 2004 were 522 and 558, respectively. In 2009, they had increased to over 1,000 (including non-racist hate crimes). Racial hate crimes have fluctuated from 858 (2009) to 641 (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi/poliisi/poliisioppilaitos/home.nsf/PFBD/AA662EFEA0162E5FC2257C1B0022E970?opendocument | title=Poliisin tietoon tullut viharikollisuus vähentynyt | website=poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi | year=2013 | access-date=3 September 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903171135/http://www.poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi/poliisi/poliisioppilaitos/home.nsf/PFBD/AA662EFEA0162E5FC2257C1B0022E970?opendocument | archive-date=3 September 2014 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the typical suspect have been a Finnish-born young man. However, over 60% of the targets were reported to have been Finland-born, although those with foreign-born parents were counted as well. The most targeted immigrants in 2004 were reported to be of [[Somali people|Somali]], [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin. One-third of the hate crimes were reportedly aimed at the [[Finnish Kale|Kale]], and only one in six were members of the native population.

In European Social Surveys since 2002, Finns have proved to be least racist just after Swedes. Earlier Finnish scientific data reveals that attitudes had been improving continuously for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsd.uta.fi/lehti/fi/28/tietoarkisto09.pdf Yhteiskuntatieteellinen tietoarkisto | www.fsd.uta.fi | 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Social Policy and responsible of Finnish ESS, Heikki Ervasti, denies a common thought of increased negative attitudes against immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tylkkari.fi/ilmiot/kyokkipuheesta-poliittiseksi-voimaksi |title= Kyökkipuheesta poliittiseksi voimaksi | publisher=tylkkari.fi |year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll made in late 2011 revealed that the majority of the Finns viewed Finland as a racist country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Poll+Majority+of+Finns+see+Finland+as+racist+country/1135269860316 |title=Helsingin Sanomat International Edition – Home |work=Helsingin Sanomat |access-date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two thirds considered the country to be fairly racist, 12% recognised a moderate amount of racism, and 2% admitted to be very racist; 35% agreed partly or wholly to the statement "Islam is a threat to Western values and democracy", and 29% agreed more or less to that "people belonging to certain races simply are not suited to live in a modern society". One in five thought "it needs to be recognised as a fact that some nations are more intelligent than others", and 11% agreed partly or completely to "people whose appearance and culture differ much from those of the Finns are unpredictable and frightening".

In 1998, the Council of Europe's European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) made a report stating concern about racist activities in France and accused the French authorities of not doing enough to combat this. The report and other groups have expressed concern about organizations such as [[Front National (France)]]. In a recent [[Pew Research Center|Pew Survey]], 47% of the French deem immigration from [[Central and Eastern Europe]] (mainly from [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]] and [[Romania]], including [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Romani people]]) to be a very bad thing. Likewise, the majority of French respondents revealed negative views on the immigration of [[Muslims]] from [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. A small minority showed signs of anti-Semitism. Roughly 11% had an unfavorable view of [[Jews]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=795 |title=Pew Global Attitudes Project: Summary of Findings: A Year After Iraq War |access-date=16 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216042207/http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=795 |archive-date=16 December 2009 }} (16 March 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and 8% felt that US policy was most influenced by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=803 |title=Pew Global Attitudes Project: III: Opinions of U.S. Policies: U.S. Image Up Slightly, But Still Negative |access-date=12 February 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211125844/http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=803 |archive-date=11 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period after Germany lost [[World War I]] led to an increased use of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and other forms of [[racism]] in political discourse, for example among the right-wing [[Freikorps]], emotions that finally culminated in the ascent to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933. The [[Nazi racial policy]] and the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] against Jews and other non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]] represented the most explicit racist policies in Europe in the twentieth century. These laws deprived all Jews including even half-Jews and quarter-Jews as well as other non-Aryans from German citizenship. Jews' official title became "subject of the state". The Nuremberg Race Laws forbade racially mixed sexual relations and marriage between Aryans and at first Jews but was later extended to "Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring".&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991"&gt;{{cite book | author = Michael Burleigh | title = The Racial State: Germany 1933-1945 | url = https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich | url-access = registration | date = 7 November 1991 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-39802-2 | page = [https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich/page/49 49]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such interracial relations became a criminal and punishable offence under the race laws known as "racial pollution" [[Rassenschande]].&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = S.

According to the 2023 report of [https://fra.europa.eu/en The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA)], [[anti-Black racism]] is rising in European countries, especially Germany. The survey, conducted among black immigrants in 13 EU countries, revealed that approximately a third of participants felt discriminated racially in the previous year, 10% more than the survey conducted six years ago. In Germany, 64% of the participants reported experiencing racial discrimination, nearly twice of the previous survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Germany leads rising anti-Black racism in the EU — study – DW – 10/25/2023 |url=https://www.dw.com/en/germany-leads-rising-anti-black-racism-in-the-eu-study/a-67207725 |access-date=2024-07-08 |website=dw.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-08-17 |title=Being Black in the EU – Experiences of people of African descent |url=https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2023/being-black-eu |access-date=2024-07-08 |website=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[European Union|EU]] report found that legal policies that should protect people from racism and [[xenophobia]] were "not implemented effectively", and it also found that Hungarian public officials denied the fact that racism and discrimination were a problem in their country, despite evidence to the contrary. It noted that such factors contributed to the increase in extremist ideologies in Hungarian politics and media.&lt;ref name="FRA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2013-thematic-situation-report-3_en_1.pdf |title=Racism, discrimination, intolerance and extremism: learning from experiences in Greece and Hungary |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) |date=December 2013 |access-date=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe has also criticized Hungary in a new report, condemning xenophobia and violence against migrants and minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/eu-report-finds-rampant-racism-xenophobia-in-hungary/a-18505689 |title=EU Report in Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other European countries, [[Romani people in Hungary]] faced disadvantages, including unequal treatment, discrimination, segregation and harassment. Negative stereotypes are often linked to the high level of unemployment among Romani people and their reliance on state benefits.&lt;ref name="FRA"/&gt; In 2008 and 2009 nine attacks took place against Romani in Hungary, resulting in six deaths and multiple injuries. According to the Hungarian curia (supreme court), these murders were motivated by [[Antiziganism|anti-Romani sentiment]] and sentenced the perpetrators to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="FRA"/&gt;

==Ireland==

According to historian Bryan Fanning, the roots of racism in the [[Republic of Ireland]] date back the first half of the 20th century, during which minority groups such as [[History of the Jews in Ireland|Jews]] and [[Irish Travellers]] were "[[Other (philosophy)#Racism|othered]]" in a [[Racialization|racialised]] manner as part of the process of [[Nation state|state nationalism]] in Ireland. Fanning also argued that the Irish state's response to [[Emigration of Jews from Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe|Jewish refugees]] fleeing [[the Holocaust]] during the 1930's and 40's were also motivated by racism.&lt;ref&gt; Bryan Fanning, Racism and Social Change in the Republic of Ireland  &lt;/ref&gt; As noted by sociologist Ronit Lentin, 

&lt;blockquote&gt; 

To date, theorizing Irishness as [[white privilege]] has been hampered by legacies of racialisation of Irishness as structured by [[Anti-Irish sentiment|anti-Irish racism]] in Ireland and abroad. However, Ireland's new position as topping the Globalisation Index, its status symbol as the locus of 'cool' culture, and its privileged position within an ever-expanding European Community calls for the understanding of Irishness as [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/29736319 | jstor=29736319 | title=Race, Sex and Nation | last1=Meaney | first1=Gerardine | journal=The Irish Review (1986-) | date=2007 | issue=35 | pages=46–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===

During [[World War II]], although [[Irish neutrality during World War II|Ireland was officially neutral]], [[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] was accused of sympathizing with and supporting the [[Nazi regime]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany. Following the death of Hitler in 1945, de Valera was one of many who signed a book of condolence and offered sympathies to the German ambassador at the Embassy in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;''An Irish Statesman and Revolutionary'' by Elizabeth Keane ({{ISBN|978-1845111250}}), page 106&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the belief among [[Allies of World War II|Allied leaders]] such as [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] that de Valera and the Irish in general were supportive of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Public Service Broadcasting – 1940s: De Valera and Broadcasting|work=History of RTÉ|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1940s_a.html|access-date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substantial influx of Nazi war criminals to Ireland following the war and their acceptance into society both officially by the Government of Ireland and by the general public also lead to claims Ireland was tolerant if not supportive of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;"Hidden History: Ireland's Nazis", broadcast by RTÉ - January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

In mid-twentieth century Ireland there was traditionally very little [[immigration]] in general to the Republic of Ireland, and hence little racial diversity, though in recent decades growing prosperity in the country (see: [[Celtic Tiger]]) attracted increasing numbers of [[immigrants]], mainly from [[Central and Eastern Europe]] (primarily [[Poland]]), [[China]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Also, the absence of colonialist baggage has meant that foreign people are not drawn to Ireland by "[[mother country]]" factors that have affected other European countries. Descendants of [[Irish people]] who emigrated in the past also started moving to the country. Most immigrants have settled in [[Dublin]] and the other cities. Though these developments have been somewhat tolerated by most, there has been a steady rise in racist attitudes among some sections of society. A 2001 survey found that 51% of Irish people surveyed considered the country inherently racist&lt;ref&gt;Liam Collins.

Independent.ie (27 May 2001). Retrieved 2 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and 60% of those in the 25 to 34 age group considered "racism" to be an Irish trait. In 2005, Minister of State for Overseas Development, Conor Lenihan famously advised Socialist politician Joe Higgins to "stick with the kebabs" – referring to his campaigning on behalf of [[Turkey|Turkish]] contract workers who had been paid less than the statutory minimum wage. The Minister later retracted his remarks and apologized.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O’Farrell.

Researchers from the [[University of Amsterdam]] and [[Utrecht University]] conducted between 2016 and 2018 a study where they sent 4,200 job application letters to companies. The fictional applicants were between 23 and 25 years old, with four years of work experience, and applied for real vacancies. All the applicants had a Dutch nationality, but the names and mother tongue of the applicants were adjusted. The conclusion was that Dutch people had the most chances of being invited for a job interview. The candidates with a Western immigrant background had 20% less chance of being invited. And the candidates who had a non-Western immigrant background faced the biggest discrimination with 40% of the applicants not being invited to a job interview. Especially applicants with a Turkish, Moroccan or Antillean background were discriminated against. A side note from the study was that during economic downturns, there was an increased amount of discrimination. For applicants who were discriminated against, an improved CV didn't improve their chances of being invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work= Algemeen Dagblad|location= The Netherlands | author= Marloe van der Schrier | url= https://www.ad.nl/ad-werkt/nog-volop-discriminatie-bij-sollicitaties-inhoud-cv-maakt-nauwelijks-uit~a7567cc9/ |title= Nog volop discriminatie bij sollicitaties: inhoud cv maakt nauwelijks uit (English: Still plenty of discrimination in job applications: content of CV hardly makes any difference) |access-date= 23 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geert Wilders, leader of far-right populist party [[Party for Freedom|PVV]], was also accused of indirectly supporting the violent behavior of the pro-Zwarte Piet movement by tweeting: "There is only 1 #blackpete and he is BLACK!" (''Original: "Er is maar 1 #zwartepiet en die is ZWART!"'') after a violent attack by the pro-Zwarte Piet movement against the anti-Zwarte Piet movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work= NRC Handelsblad |location= The Netherlands | author= Kasper van Laarhoven &amp; Mark Middel | url= https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/11/10/vrees-voor-radicalisering-pro-pieten-a3979844 |title= Vrees voor radicalisering pro-Pieten (English: Fear of radicalization of pro-Petes) |date= 10 November 2019 |access-date= 23 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[pogrom]]" became commonly used in English after a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots swept through south-western [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]] in 1881&amp;ndash;1884. A much bloodier wave of pogroms broke out in 1903–1906, leaving an estimated 2,000 Jews dead.  By the beginning of the 20th century, most European Jews lived in the so-called [[Pale of Settlement]], the Western frontier of the [[Russian Empire]] consisting generally of the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and neighboring regions.  Many pogroms accompanied the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]], an estimated 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former [[Russian Empire]]; the number of Jewish orphans exceeded 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism|title=anti-Semitism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary L Rubinstein, Daniel C Cohn-Sherbok, Abraham J Edelheit, William D Rubinstein, ''The Jews in the Modern World'', Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN envoy explained that although the Swiss authorities recognised the existence of [[racism]] and xenophobia, they did not view the problem as being serious. Diène pointed out that representatives of minority communities said they experienced serious racism and discrimination, notably for access to public services (e.g. health care), employment and lodging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/front/UN_envoy_calls_racism_in_Switzerland_a_reality.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=6382785&amp;cKey=1137401626000&amp;ty=st |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130115201031/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/front/UN_envoy_calls_racism_in_Switzerland_a_reality.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=6382785&amp;cKey=1137401626000&amp;ty=st |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 January 2013 |title=UN envoy calls racism in Switzerland a reality- swissinfo |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=14 January 2006 |access-date=29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6980766.stm | work=BBC News | first=Imogen | last=Foulkes | title=Swiss row over black sheep poster | date=6 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom has long history of racism. The Evidence for Equality National Survey (EVENS) conducted in 2023 has shown the prevalence of racism faced by ethnic and religious groups in Britain. Nearly one in six reported having been the victim of a physical assault motivated by race. 17% of respondents said that their personal property had been damaged. There is also evidence for structural racism in the report: in education and employment about a third of the respondents reported racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=London |first=King's College |title=More than a third of people from minority groups in the UK have experienced racist assaults, survey finds |url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/more-than-a-third-of-people-from-minority-groups-in-the-uk-have-experienced-racist-assaults-survey-finds |access-date=2024-07-08 |website=King's College London |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2023 [[University of Cambridge]] survey which featured the largest sample of Black people in Britain found that 88% had reported racial discrimination at work, 79% believed the police unfairly targeted black people with [[stop and search]] powers and 80% definitely or somewhat agreed that [[discrimination in education|racial discrimination was the biggest barrier to academic attainment for young Black students]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Black British Voices: the findings |url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/black-british-voices-report |website=University of Cambridge |language=en |date=28 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
