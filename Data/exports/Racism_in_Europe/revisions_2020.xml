A study of social attitudes that was conducted at [[Harvard University]] from 2002–15 has mapped the countries in Europe with the highest incidents of racial bias towards black people, based on data from 288,076 white Europeans. It used the [[Implicit-association test]] (a reaction-based psychological test that is designed to measure implicit racial bias). The weakest bias was found in [[Serbia]] and [[Slovenia]], and the strongest bias was found in [[Slovakia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Malta]], [[Moldova]],
[[Italy]], and [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waugh|first1=Rob|title=This map shows the most racist countries in Europe (and how Britain ranks)|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/03/this-map-shows-the-most-racist-countries-in-europe-and-how-britain-ranks-6612608/|website=Metro (British newspaper)|publisher=Metro (British newspaper)|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A more recent survey, &lt;ref&gt;{{url=https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2018/being-black-eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in 2018 by the EU’s Fundamental Rights Agency, shows the proportion of people of African descent who said they had experienced at least one assault they perceived as racist violence in the previous five years was highest in [[Finland]], and [[Ireland]] and [[Austria]] among the 12 EU states surveyed, and lowest in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Portugal]]. The highest proportion of those that had seen racial harassment in the previous year was in Finland, [[Luxembourg]] and Ireland, and the lowest in the U.K. and Malta.

==Bulgaria==
On 9 October 1992, the Bulgarian president signed the Council of Europe [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]], signaling a new commitment to uphold minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Human Rights Watch |title= Human Rights Watch World Report 1998 – 1 January |url= http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6a8a510.html |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=January 1, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 one of the leaders of another nationalist party, [[IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement|VMRO]], Angel Djambasky was put under investigation for calling the people to arm themselves against the immigrants.

At least 6 racist crimes are perpetrated between 3 and 13 November of every year. 
112 intellectuals sign a petition to the attorney general not to register the party Ataka, which was rejected by the attorney general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2011/05/20/1093480_ataka_sreshtu_mjusjulmanite_v_djamiiata_na_sofiia_video/|title=България - "Атака" срещу мюсюлманите в джамията на София (видео) - Dnevnik.bg|work=dnevnik.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paper.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2013-11-05&amp;article=471190|title= Стандарт|work=standartnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bghelsinki.org/media/uploads/documents/external/2013-11-13_signal_na_112_grazhdani_sreshtu_neo-nazi_partia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Discrimination against [[Romani people|Roma]] remains widespread in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anti-Roma protests take place in Bulgarian city of Gabrovo |url=https://apnews.com/7ade2fc2871e40e7a7396468155a2164 |work=The Associated Press |date=12 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Everybody hates us': on Sofia's streets, Roma face racism every day |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/20/bulgaria-sofia-racism-roma-everybody-hates-us-anti-gypsy-abuse |work=The Guardian |date=20 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roma make up 2–3% of population in the [[Czech Republic]]. According to Říčan (1998), Roma make up more than 60% of Czech prisoners and about 20–30% earn their livelihood in illegal ways, such as procuring prostitution, trafficking and other property crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Říčan|first=Pavel|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qtgmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=pavel+%C5%99%C3%AD%C4%8Dan+s+romy+%C5%BE%C3%ADt+budeme&amp;dq=pavel+%C5%99%C3%AD%C4%8Dan+s+romy+%C5%BE%C3%ADt+budeme|title=S Romy žít budeme – jde o to jak: dějiny, současná situace, kořeny problémů, naděje společné budoucnosti|publisher=Portál|year=1998|isbn=80-7178-250-5|location=Praha|pages=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roma are thus more than 20 times overrepresented in Czech prisons than their population share would suggest.

The Romanis are at the centre of the agenda of far-right groups in the Czech Republic, which spread anti-Romanyism. Among highly publicized cases was the [[Vítkov arson attack of 2009]], in which four right-wing extremists seriously injured a three-year-old Romani girl. The public responded by donating money as well as presents to the family, who were able to buy a new house from the donations, while the perpetrators were sentenced to 18 and 22 years in prison.

According to 2010 survey, 83% of Czechs consider Roma asocial and 45% of Czechs would like to expel them from the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/cesi-propadaji-anticikanismu-kazdy-druhy-tu-romy-nechce-zjistil-pruzkum-1qx-/domaci.asp?c=A101209_161615_domaci_js|title=Češi propadají anticikánismu, každý druhý tu Romy nechce, zjistil průzkum|author=Jiří Šťastný|date=8 February 2012|publisher=Zpravy.idnes.cz|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 poll, which followed after a number of brutal attacks by Romani perpetrators against majority population victims, revealed that 44% of Czechs are afraid of Roma people.&lt;ref name="tyden.cz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/romsky-bloger-nekteri-romove-se-chovaji-jako-blazni_216270.html|title=Romsky bloger nekteri romove se chovaji jako blazni|language=Czech|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the [[Czech people]] do not want to have Romanis as neighbours (almost 90%, more than any other group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.romea.cz%2Findex.php%3Fid%3Dservis%2Fz2005_0318&amp;hl=cs&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sl=cs&amp;tl=en|title=Czech don't want Roma as neighbours|language=Czech|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201133920/http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.romea.cz%2Findex.php%3Fid%3Dservis%2Fz2005_0318&amp;hl=cs&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;sl=cs&amp;tl=en|archive-date=1 February 2012|accessdate=15 April 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) seeing them as thieves and social parasites.

In January 2010, Amnesty International launched a report titled ''Injustice Renamed: Discrimination in Education of Roma persists in the Czech Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur71/003/2009/en/ ''Injustice Renamed: Discrimination in Education of Roma persists in the Czech Republic''] Amnesty International report, January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[BBC]], it was Amnesty's view that while cosmetic changes had been introduced by the authorities, little genuine improvement in addressing discrimination against Romani children has occurred over recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8456882.stm|title=Amnesty says Czech schools still fail Roma Gypsies|date=13 January 2010|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 January 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114052029/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8456882.stm|archivedate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2019 [[Pew Research Center|Pew Research poll]] poll found that 66% of Czechs held unfavorable views of Roma.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/10/14/minority-groups/|title=European Public Opinion Three Decades After the Fall of Communism — 6.

A Jew named Dan Uzan was killed by a Muslim in front of a synagogue as part of the [[2015 Copenhagen shootings]]. His funeral was attended by the prime minister and several members of parliament and he was named Dane of the year, because he prevented additional killings by the terrorist at the Jewish institution, which has since been kept under constant surveillance by Danish police in collaboration with Danish military.

Young non-ethnic Danes have claimed that they felt that some police officers have acted in a racist manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE472795/politi-de-unge-klager-over-racistiske-betjente/ Politi: De unge klager over racistiske betjente], by Andreas Lindquist, Politiken, 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, they had increased to over 1 000 (including non-racist hate crimes). Racial hate crimes have fluctuated from 858 (2009) to 641 (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi/poliisi/poliisioppilaitos/home.nsf/PFBD/AA662EFEA0162E5FC2257C1B0022E970?opendocument | title=Poliisin tietoon tullut viharikollisuus vähentynyt | website=poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi | year=2013 | access-date=3 September 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903171135/http://www.poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi/poliisi/poliisioppilaitos/home.nsf/PFBD/AA662EFEA0162E5FC2257C1B0022E970?opendocument | archive-date=3 September 2014 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the typical suspect have been a Finnish-born young man. However, over 60% of the targets were reported to have been Finland-born, although those with foreign-born parents were counted as well. The most targeted immigrants in 2004 were reported to be of [[Somali people|Somali]], [[Kurdish People|Kurdish]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin. One-third of the hate crimes were reportedly aimed at the [[Finnish Kale|Kale]], and only one in six were members of the native population.

In European Social Surveys since 2002, Finns have proved to be least racist just after Swedes. Earlier Finnish scientific data reveals that attitudes had been improving continuously for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsd.uta.fi/lehti/fi/28/tietoarkisto09.pdf Yhteiskuntatieteellinen tietoarkisto | www.fsd.uta.fi | 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Social Policy and responsible of Finnish ESS, Heikki Ervasti, denies a common thought of increased negative attitudes against immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tylkkari.fi/ilmiot/kyokkipuheesta-poliittiseksi-voimaksi |title= Kyökkipuheesta poliittiseksi voimaksi | publisher=tylkkari.fi |year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll made in late 2011 revealed that the majority of the Finns viewed Finland as a racist country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Poll+Majority+of+Finns+see+Finland+as+racist+country/1135269860316 |title=Helsingin Sanomat – International Edition – Home |publisher=hs.fi |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two thirds considered the country to be fairly racist, 12% recognised a moderate amount of racism, and 2% admitted to be very racist; 35% agreed partly or wholly to the statement "Islam is a threat to Western values and democracy", and 29% agreed more or less to that "people belonging to certain races simply are not suited to live in a modern society". One in five thought "it needs to be recognised as a fact that some nations are more intelligent than others", and 11% agreed partly or completely to "people whose appearance and culture differ much from those of the Finns are unpredictable and frightening".

In a 2018 study conducted in 12 EU member states, Finland tops the chart with the most perceived racism, with 62% of those surveyed having experienced racially motivated harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nielsen |first1=Nikolaj |title=Finland shamed on racism in EU study |url=https://euobserver.com/justice/143518 |accessdate=16 September 2019 |work=EUobserver |date=28 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HSL Case===
According to a report from ''[[Iltalehti]]'', an alleged incident of racism and police brutality occurred on the evening of 4 July 2020 at the [[Central railway station metro station (Helsinki)|Central Railway Station]] of [[Helsinki Metro]]. The incident centers on two youths, one white male and one black male, who were apprehended together for not having a valid ticket. According to eyewitness accounts and unverified footage of the incident that was circulating on [[social media]], the white youth was calmly spoken to by the police before being allowed to leave, however, the black teenager was allegedly thrown down onto the floor by security staff and placed in handcuffs. One security staff member was allegedly seen pressing his knee down on the teenager's neck, at which point the victim could be seen yelling out "I can't breathe" in English, which has clearly evoked images on social media in the [[Killing of George Floyd|case of George Floyd]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/news-in-brief/17859-hsl-faces-accusations-of-racism-amid-alleged-incident-on-helsinki-metro.html Helsinki Times: HSL faces accusations of racism amid alleged incident on Helsinki Metro]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Law enforcement officers pressed a dark-skinned boy to the ground and a storm began, in which celebrities also took part - [[Helsinki Regional Transport Authority|HSL]] sees no racism in action: "The young man was completely uncooperative" [https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/jarjestyksenvalvojat-painoivat-tummaihoisen-pojan-maahan-ja-alkoi-somemyrsky-johon-osallistuivat-julkkiksetkin-hsl-ei-nae-toiminnassa-rasismia-nuori-oli-taysin-yhteistyokyvyton/7870880?fbclid=IwAR1dENeip7oNEn653SfN_o46hSS_wrW0knEGPC53goAeIcn8qUXvLvWWNew#gs.awy24t MTV Uutiset: Järjestyksenvalvojat painoivat tummaihoisen pojan maahan ja alkoi somemyrsky, johon osallistuivat julkkiksetkin – HSL ei näe toiminnassa rasismia: "Nuori oli täysin yhteistyökyvytön"] (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish leaders perceive an intensifying [[anti-Semitism in France]], mainly among Muslims of [[Arab]] or [[Berber people|Berber]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Colin |last=Nickerson |title=Anti-Semitism seen rising among France's Muslims |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2006/03/13/anti_semitism_seen_rising_among_frances_muslims/ |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2006-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the Council of Europe's European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) made a report stating concern about racist activities in France and accused the French authorities of not doing enough to combat this. The report and other groups have expressed concern about organizations like [[Front National (France)]].

[[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] emerged as a fringe movement when it was founded in the early 1980s and since then, it has evolved into a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] group within [[Greece]].

In September 2019, Golden Dawn's headquarters in [[Athens]], were closed and dissolved, only two months after the party's defeat in the July general elections.

In a 2016 [[Pew Research]] study, Greeks were found to be most intolerant nationality in Europe of ethnic diversity of all the peoples surveyed, with Europe in general expressing negative sentiment towards ethnic diversity (out of 10 countries in Europe surveyed, people who expressed a positive opinion of ethnic diversity were in the minority in all of them).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/12/in-views-of-diversity-many-europeans-are-less-positive-than-americans/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715014948/http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/12/in-views-of-diversity-many-europeans-are-less-positive-than-americans/|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 July 2016|date=12 July 2016|title=In views of diversity, many Europeans are less positive than Americans|work=Fact Tank|publisher=Pew Research Center|first1=Bruce|last1=Drake|first2=Jacob|last2=Poushter|access-date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hungary==
An [[European Union|EU]] report found that legal policies that should protect people from racism and [[xenophobia]] were "not implemented effectively", and it also found that Hungarian public officials denied the fact that racism and discrimination were a problem in their country, despite evidence to the contrary. It noted that such factors contributed to the increase in extremist ideologies in Hungarian politics and media.&lt;ref name="FRA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2013-thematic-situation-report-3_en_1.pdf |title=Racism, discrimination, intolerance and extremism: learning from experiences in Greece and Hungary |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) |date=December 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe has also criticized Hungary in a new report, condemning xenophobia and violence against migrants and minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/eu-report-finds-rampant-racism-xenophobia-in-hungary/a-18505689 |title=EU Report in Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other European countries, the [[Romani people]] faced disadvantages, including unequal treatment, discrimination, segregation and harassment. Negative stereotypes are often linked to the high level of unemployment among Romani people and their reliance on state benefits.&lt;ref name="FRA"/&gt; In 2008 and 2009 nine attacks took place against Romani in Hungary, resulting in six deaths and multiple injuries.

==Ireland==

During the second world war, although Ireland was officially neutral, Prime Minister [[Éamon de Valera]] was accused of sympathizing with and supporting the [[Nazi regime]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany. Following the death of Hitler in 1945 de Valera was one of many who signed a book of condolence and offered sympathies to the German Minister at the German Embassy in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;''An Irish Statesman and Revolutionary'' by Elizabeth Keane ({{ISBN|978-1845111250}}), page 106&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the belief among [[Allies of World War II|Allied leaders]] such as [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] that de Valera and the Irish in general were supportive of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Public Service Broadcasting – 1940s: De Valera and Broadcasting|work=History of RTÉ|publisher=RTÉ|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1940s_a.html|accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substantial influx of Nazi war criminals to Ireland following the war and their acceptance into society both officially by the Government of Ireland and by the general public also lead to claims Ireland was tolerant if not supportive of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;"Hidden History: Ireland's Nazis", broadcast by RTÉ - January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 
Historically, the Jewish community in Ireland has enjoyed support not enjoyed elsewhere in Europe. (Main article: [[History of the Jews in Ireland]]).

In mid-twentieth century Ireland there was traditionally very little [[immigration]] in general to the Republic of Ireland, and hence little racial diversity, though in recent decades growing prosperity in the country (see: [[Celtic Tiger]]) attracted increasing numbers of [[immigrants]], mainly from [[Central and Eastern Europe]] (primarily [[Poland]]), [[China]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Also the absence of colonialist baggage has meant that foreign people are not drawn to Ireland by "[[mother country]]" factors that have affected other European countries. Descendants of [[Irish people]] who emigrated in the past also started moving back to the country. Most immigrants have settled in [[Dublin]] and the other cities. Though these developments have been somewhat tolerated by most, there has been a steady rise in racist attitudes among some sections of society. A 2001 survey found that 51% of Irish people surveyed considered the country inherently racist &lt;ref&gt;Liam Collins.

Independent.ie (2001-05-27). Retrieved on 2012-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and 60% of those in the 25 to 34 age-group considered "racism" to be an Irish trait. In 2005, Minister of State for Overseas Development, Conor Lenihan famously advised Socialist politician Joe Higgins to "stick with the kebabs" – referring to his campaigning on behalf of [[Turkey|Turkish]] contract workers who had been paid less than the statutory minimum wage. The Minister later retracted his remarks and apologized.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O’Farrell.

==Netherlands==
In the early 2012 the Dutch right-wing [[Party for Freedom]] established an [[Anti-Slavic sentiment|anti-Slavic]] (predominantly [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]]) and  [[Antiziganism|anti-Romani]] website, where native [[Dutch people]] could air their frustration about losing their job because of cheaper workers from [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]] and other non-Germanic [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an countries. This led to commentaries involving [[hate speech]] and other racial prejudice mainly against Poles and Roma, but also aimed at other Central and Eastern European ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/news/115208 Dutch far right opens anti-Polish hotline: ''"Did you lose your job to a Pole, a Bulgarian, a Romanian, or any other Central or Eastern European? We would like to hear about it".'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of systemic racism in the Netherlands has been demonstrated multiple times, especially against Dutch people with a Turkish, Moroccan or Caribbean background. For example, researchers from the [[University of Amsterdam]] and [[Utrecht University]] conducted between 2016 and 2018 a research where they sent 4,200 job application letters to companies. The fictional applicants were between 23 and 25 years old, with four years of work experience who applied for real vacancies. All the applicants had a Dutch nationality, but the names and mother tongue of the applicants were adjusted. The conclusion was that Dutch people had the most chances of being invited for a job interview. The candidates with a Western immigrant background had 20% less chance of being invited. And the candidates who had a non-Western immigrant background faced the biggest discrimination with 40% of the applicants not being invited to a job interview. Especially applicants with a Turkish, Moroccan or Antillean background are discriminated against. A side note from the research was that during economic downturns there was an increased amount of discrimination. And applicants who were discriminated against with an improved CV didn't have a higher chance of being invited either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= Algemeen Dagblad |location= The Netherlands | author= Marloe van der Schrier | url= https://www.ad.nl/ad-werkt/nog-volop-discriminatie-bij-sollicitaties-inhoud-cv-maakt-nauwelijks-uit~a7567cc9/ |title= Nog volop discriminatie bij sollicitaties: inhoud cv maakt nauwelijks uit (English: Still plenty of discrimination in job applications: content of CV hardly makes any difference) |accessdate= 23 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And according to terrorism expert Teun Van Dongen, violence by the pro-Pete movement is becoming normalized. Because white supremacist groups like Pegida and football hooligans have joined the pro-Pete movement. Geert Wilders, leader of far-right populist party the [[Party for Freedom|PVV]], was also accused of indirectly supporting the violence behavior of the pro-Pete movement by tweeting, "There is only 1 #blackpete and he/she is BLACK!" (''Original: "Er is maar 1 #zwartepiet en die is ZWART!"'') after a violent attack by the pro-Pete movement against the anti-Pete movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= NRC |location= The Netherlands | author= Kasper van Laarhoven &amp; Mark Middel | url= https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/11/10/vrees-voor-radicalisering-pro-pieten-a3979844 |title= Vrees voor radicalisering pro-Pieten (English: Fear of radicalization of pro-Petes) |accessdate= 23 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[pogrom]]" became commonly used in English after a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots swept through south-western [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]] in 1881&amp;ndash;1884. A much bloodier wave of pogroms broke out in 1903–1906, leaving an estimated 2,000 Jews dead.  By the beginning of the 20th century, most European Jews lived in the so-called [[Pale of Settlement]], the Western frontier of the [[Russian Empire]] consisting generally of the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and neighboring regions.  Many pogroms accompanied the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]], an estimated 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former [[Russian Empire]]; the number of Jewish orphans exceeded 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism|title=anti-Semitism|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary L.

A study was conducted in 2011 about the Swedes attitudes to mixed marriages. The conclusion was that the views in general were favorable, but that there was a strong hierarchy based on which groups to live with. Swedes primarily preferred relationships with Scandinavians, Western Europeans and [[Southern Europeans]], and then [[Eastern Europeans]], Central Europeans and Latin Americans. At the bottom were South and East Asians, Africans, and Middle Eastern people. Older individuals and women, as well as people with less education and people who were brought up outside of [[Malmö]] (the most multicultural city of Sweden), were generally more prone to having negative attitudes. Most were able to accept family members and friends living in mixed relationships, even if they did not want to do it themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Text: Johanna Svensson |url=http://www.mah.se/english/News/News-2011/-Love-aint-got-no-color--Attitude-toward-interracial-marriage/ |title=Love ain’t got no color? – Attitude toward interracial marriage – Malmö University |publisher=Mah.se |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2012-05-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120905111204/http://www.mah.se/english/News/News-2011/-Love-aint-got-no-color--Attitude-toward-interracial-marriage/ |archivedate=5 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this report, discrimination based on skin colour in Switzerland is not exceptional, and affects immigrants decades after their immigration.

[[Swiss People's Party]] claims that Swiss communities have a [[democracy|democratic]] right to decide who can or cannot be Swiss. In addition, the report said "Official statements and political campaigns that present immigrants from the EU in a favourable light and immigrants from elsewhere in a bad light must stop", according to the Swiss Federal Statistics Office in 2006, 85.5% of the foreign residents in Switzerland are European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/themen/01/07/blank/data/01.html |title=Statistique suisse – Population étrangère – Aperçu général |publisher=Bfs.admin.ch |date=2012-05-03 |accessdate=2012-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608021414/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/fr/index/themen/01/07/blank/data/01.html |archive-date=8 June 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] special rapporteur on racism, [[Doudou Diène]], has observed that Switzerland suffers from racism, [[discrimination]] and [[xenophobia]].

According to the last census from 2011, Roma make up 2.0% of the population in [[Slovakia]].

Three Slovakian Romani women have come before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on grounds of having been forcefully sterilised in Slovakian hospitals.

Roma are the victims of ethnically driven violence and crime in Slovakia. According to monitoring and reports provided by the European Roma Rights Center (ERRC) in 2013, racist violence, evictions, threats, and more subtle forms of discrimination have increased over the past two years in Slovakia. The ERRC considers the situation in Slovakia to be one of the worst in Europe, as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/the-new-roma-ghettos-000519-v20n4?Contentpage=2|title=The New Roma Ghettos &amp;#124; VICE &amp;#124; United States|last=Lake|first=Aaron|date=2013-12-25|website=Vice.com|accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roma people suffer serious discrimination in Slovakia. Roma children are segregated in school and do not receive the level of education as other Slovakian children.
