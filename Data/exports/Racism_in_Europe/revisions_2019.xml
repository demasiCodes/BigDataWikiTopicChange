A  study of social attitudes that was conducted at [[Harvard University]] from 2002–15  has mapped the countries in Europe with the highest incidents of racial bias, based on data from 288,076 White Europeans. It used the [[Implicit-association test]] (a reaction-based psychological test that is designed to measure implicit racial bias). The weakest racial bias was found in [[Serbia]] and [[Slovenia]], and the strongest racial bias was found in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Malta]], [[Moldova]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Italy]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waugh|first1=Rob|title=This map shows the most racist countries in Europe (and how Britain ranks)|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/03/this-map-shows-the-most-racist-countries-in-europe-and-how-britain-ranks-6612608/|website=Metro (British newspaper)|publisher=Metro (British newspaper)|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October 1992, the Bulgarian president signed the Council of Europe [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]], signaling a new commitment to uphold minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Human Rights Watch |title= Human Rights Watch World Report 1998 – 1 January |url= http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6a8a510.html |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=January 1, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the parliamentary party [[Attack (political party)|Ataka]], identifying itself as nationalist, attacked the mosque in the center of Sofia during the Friday prayer. In 2013 one of the leaders of another nationalist party, [[IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement|VMRO]], Angel Djambasky was put under investigation for calling the people to arm themselves against the immigrants.

At least 6 racist crimes are perpetrated between 3 and 13 November of every year.

==Cyprus==
The National Popular Front, or National People's Front (Greek: Εθνικό Λαϊκό Μέτωπο (ΕΛΑΜ), Ethniko Laiko Metopo [[ELAM (Cyprus)]], is an ultranationalist movement (and later, political party) founded in 2008 in the Republic of Cyprus. The party has been the subject of controversy in the Cypriot media and broader political scene. It has been repeatedly accused of promoting racism and being involved in acts of violence.

A Jew named Dan Uzan was killed by a Muslim in front of a synagogue as part of the [[2015 Copenhagen shootings]]. His funeral was attended by the prime minister and several members of parliament and he was named Dane of the year, because he prevented additional killings by the terrorist at the Jewish institution, which has since been kept under constant surveillance by Danish police in collaboration with Danish military.

Young non-ethnic Danes have complained that some police officers have acted in a racist manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE472795/politi-de-unge-klager-over-racistiske-betjente/ Politi: De unge klager over racistiske betjente], by Andreas Lindquist, Politiken, 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Racism in Finland}}
Reports say that racial hate crime is a recent phenomenon, and that they are on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.horus.be/files/99935/MediaArchive/pdf/finland_en.pdf Responding to racism in Finland]. European Network Against Racism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/11/hate_crimes_against_foreigners_rise_2111368.html |title=Hate Crimes against Foreigners Rise &amp;#124; Yle Uutiset |publisher=yle.fi |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of reported hate crimes in 2003 and 2004 were 522 and 558, respectively. In 2009, they had increased to over 1 000 (including non-racist hate crimes). Racial hate crimes have fluctuated from 858 (2009) to 641 (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi/poliisi/poliisioppilaitos/home.nsf/PFBD/AA662EFEA0162E5FC2257C1B0022E970?opendocument | title=Poliisin tietoon tullut viharikollisuus vähentynyt | website=poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi | year=2013 | access-date=3 September 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903171135/http://www.poliisiammattikorkeakoulu.fi/poliisi/poliisioppilaitos/home.nsf/PFBD/AA662EFEA0162E5FC2257C1B0022E970?opendocument | archive-date=3 September 2014 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the typical suspect have been a Finnish-born young man. However, over 60% of the targets were reported to have been Finland-born, although those with foreign-born parents were counted as well. The most targeted immigrants in 2004 were reported to be of [[Somali people|Somali]], [[Kurdish People|Kurdish]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin. One-third of the hate crimes were reportedly aimed at the [[Finnish Kale|Kale]], and only one in six were members of the native population.

In European Social Surveys since 2002, Finns have proved to be least racist just after Swedes. Earlier Finnish scientific data reveals that attitudes had been improving continuously for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsd.uta.fi/lehti/fi/28/tietoarkisto09.pdf Yhteiskuntatieteellinen tietoarkisto | www.fsd.uta.fi | 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Social Policy and responsible of Finnish ESS, Heikki Ervasti, denies a common thought of increased negative attitudes against immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tylkkari.fi/ilmiot/kyokkipuheesta-poliittiseksi-voimaksi |title= Kyökkipuheesta poliittiseksi voimaksi | publisher=tylkkari.fi |year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll made in late 2011 revealed that the majority of the Finns viewed Finland as a racist country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Poll+Majority+of+Finns+see+Finland+as+racist+country/1135269860316 |title=Helsingin Sanomat – International Edition – Home |publisher=hs.fi |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two thirds considered the country to be fairly racist, 12% recognised a moderate amount of racism, and 2% admitted to be very racist; 35% agreed partly or wholly to the statement "Islam is a threat to Western values and democracy", and 29% agreed more or less to that "people belonging to certain races simply are not suited to live in a modern society". One in five thought "it needs to be recognised as a fact that some nations are more intelligent than others", and 11% agreed partly or completely to "people whose appearance and culture differ much from those of the Finns are unpredictable and frightening".

Of the countries in the European Union Finland tops the list of countries with the most racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nielsen |first1=Nikolaj |title=Finland shamed on racism in EU study |url=https://euobserver.com/justice/143518 |accessdate=16 September 2019 |work=EUobserver |date=28 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==
{{main|Racism in France}}
Jewish leaders perceive an intensifying [[anti-Semitism in France]], mainly among Muslims of [[Arab]] or [[Berber people|Berber]] heritage. However, Jewish intellectuals are often accused of racism, such as [[Eric Zemmour]], Alain Finkelkrault or Elisabeth Lévy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Colin |last=Nickerson |title=Anti-Semitism seen rising among France's Muslims |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2006/03/13/anti_semitism_seen_rising_among_frances_muslims/ |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2006-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the Council of Europe's European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) made a report stating concern about racist activities in France and accused the French authorities of not doing enough to combat this. The report and other groups have expressed concern about organizations like [[Front National (France)]]. In a recent [[Pew Research Center|Pew Survey]], 47% of the French deem immigration from [[Central and Eastern Europe]] (mainly from [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]] and [[Romania]], including [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Romani people]]) to be a very bad thing. Likewise, the majority of French respondents revealed negative views on the immigration of [[Muslims]] from [[Africa]] and [[Middle East]]. A small minority showed signs of anti-Semitism. Roughly 11% had an unfavorable view of Jews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=795 |title=Pew Global Attitudes Project: Summary of Findings: A Year After Iraq War |accessdate=2009-12-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216042207/http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=795 |archivedate=16 December 2009 }} (2004-03-16)&lt;/ref&gt; and 8% felt that US policy was most influenced by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=803 |title=Pew Global Attitudes Project: III: Opinions of U.S. Policies: U.S. Image Up Slightly, But Still Negative |accessdate=2008-02-12 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211125844/http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?PageID=803 |archivedate=11 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
{{main|Racism in Germany}}
The period after Germany lost [[World War I]] led to an increased use of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] and other forms of [[racism]] in political discourse, for example among the right-wing [[Freikorps]], emotions that finally culminated in the ascent to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933. The [[Nazi racial policy]] and the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] against Jews and other non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]] represented the most explicit racist policies in Europe in the twentieth century. These laws deprived all Jews including even half-Jews and quarter-Jews as well as other non-Aryans from German citizenship. Jews official title became "subject of the state". The Nuremberg Race Laws forbid racially mixed sexual relations and marriage between Aryans and at first Jews but was later extended to "Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring".&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991"&gt;{{cite book | author = Michael Burleigh | title = The Racial State: Germany 1933-1945 | url = https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich | url-access = registration | date = 7 November 1991 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-39802-2 | page = [https://archive.org/details/racialstate00mich/page/49 49]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such interracial relations became a criminal and punishable offence under the race laws known as "racial pollution" [[Rassenschande]].&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = S.

==Greece==
[[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] emerged as a fringe movement when it was founded in the early 1980s and since then, it has evolved into a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] group within [[Greece]]. Members of Golden Dawn have been accused of carrying out acts of violence as well as [[hate crimes]] against [[Immigration|immigrants]], political opponents, [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] and ethnic minorities.

==Hungary==
An [[European Union|EU]] report found that legal policies that should protect people from racism and [[xenophobia]] were "not implemented effectively", and it also found that Hungarian public officials denied the fact that racism and discrimination were a problem in their country, despite evidence to the contrary. It noted that such factors contributed to the increase in extremist ideologies in Hungarian politics and media.&lt;ref name="FRA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2013-thematic-situation-report-3_en_1.pdf |title=Racism, discrimination, intolerance and extremism: learning from experiences in Greece and Hungary |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) |date=December 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of Europe has also criticized Hungary in a new report, condemning xenophobia and violence against migrants and minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.com/en/eu-report-finds-rampant-racism-xenophobia-in-hungary/a-18505689 |title=EU Report in Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other European countries, the [[Romani people]] faced disadvantages, including unequal treatment, discrimination, segregation and harassment. Negative stereotypes are often linked to the high level of unemployment among Romani people and their reliance on state benefits.&lt;ref name="FRA"/&gt; In 2008 and 2009 nine attacks took place against Romani in Hungary, resulting in six deaths and multiple injuries. According to the Hungarian curia (supreme court), these murders were motivated by [[Antiziganism|anti-Romani sentiment]] and sentenced the perpetrators to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name="FRA"/&gt;

==Ireland==

Historically, the most serious racial problems in Ireland stemmed from the colonization of the country by the British, and the racist attitude of the colonists to the native Irish. The English considered themselves to be a distinct race from the Irish, who were classified as 'melanocroix', or 'half black' by [[Thomas Huxley]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Depictions of the Irish in the popular British press throughout the centuries of British colonization were noted for their subhuman portrayal of the Irish (main article: [[Anti-Irish sentiment]]). Laws suppressing Irish culture and enfranchisement, outlawing the use of the language, education, and the practice of the local religion (Roman Catholicism) were enforced during various periods from the 14th century onward (see [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] and [[Penal Laws (Ireland)]]), only being fully repealed with the independence of Ireland from Britain in the early twentieth century (see [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]).

===20th century===

During the second world war, although Ireland was officially neutral, Prime Minister [[Éamon de Valera]] was accused of sympathizing with and supporting the [[Nazi regime]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany. Following the death of Hitler in 1945 de Valera was one of many who signed a book of condolence and offered sympathies to the German Minister at the German Embassy in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;''An Irish Statesman and Revolutionary'' by Elizabeth Keane ({{ISBN|978-1845111250}}), page 106&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the belief among [[Allies of World War II|Allied leaders]] such as [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] that de Valera and the Irish in general were supportive of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Public Service Broadcasting – 1940s: De Valera and Broadcasting|work=History of RTÉ|publisher=RTÉ|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1940s_a.html|accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substantial influx of Nazi war criminals to Ireland following the war and their acceptance into society both officially by the Government of Ireland and by the general public also lead to claims Ireland was tolerant if not supportive of the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;"Hidden History: Ireland's Nazis", broadcast by RTÉ - January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, it must also be borne in mind that Germany had supplied guns to the Irish war of independence 20 years earlier, and so Irish sympathies to the Germans rather than their long-standing oppressors the British can easily be accounted for in this way, rather than due to anti-semitism. Historically, the Jewish community in Ireland has enjoyed support not enjoyed elsewhere in Europe. (Main article: [[History of the Jews in Ireland]]).

In mid-twentieth century Ireland there was traditionally very little [[immigration]] in general to the Republic of Ireland, and hence little racial diversity, though in recent decades growing prosperity in the country (see: [[Celtic Tiger]]) attracted increasing numbers of [[immigrants]], mainly from [[Central and Eastern Europe]] (primarily [[Poland]]), [[China]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Also the absence of colonialist baggage has meant that foreign people are not drawn to Ireland by "[[mother country]]" factors that have affected other European countries. Descendants of [[Irish people]] who emigrated in the past also started moving to the country. Most immigrants have settled in [[Dublin]] and the other cities. Though these developments have been somewhat tolerated by most, there has been a steady rise in racist attitudes among some sections of society. A 2001 survey found that 51% of Irish people surveyed considered the country inherently racist &lt;ref&gt;Liam Collins. [http://www.independent.ie/national-news/ireland-is-a-country-of-racists--at-least-the-irish-think-thats-true-508512.html Ireland is a country of racists – at least the Irish think that's true – National News]. Independent.ie (2001-05-27). Retrieved on 2012-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and 60% of those in the 25 to 34 age-group considered "racism" to be an Irish trait. In 2005, Minister of State for Overseas Development, Conor Lenihan famously advised Socialist politician Joe Higgins to "stick with the kebabs" – referring to his campaigning on behalf of [[Turkey|Turkish]] contract workers who had been paid less than the statutory minimum wage. The Minister later retracted his remarks and apologized.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O’Farrell.

The researchers from the [[University of Amsterdam]] and [[Utrecht University]] conducted between 2016 and 2018 a research where they sent 4,200 job application letters to companies. The fictional applicants were between 23 and 25 years old, with four years of work experience who applied for real vacancies. All the applicants had a Dutch nationality, but the names and mother tongue of the applicants were adjusted. The conclusion was that Dutch people had the most chances of being invited for a job interview. The candidates with a Western immigrant background had 20% less chance of being invited. And the candidates who had a non-Western immigrant background faced the biggest discrimination with 40% of the applicants not being invited to a job interview. Especially applicants with a Turkish, Moroccan or Antillean background are discriminated against. A side note from the research was that during economic downturns there was an increased amount of discrimination. And applicants who were discriminated against with an improved CV didn't have a higher chance of being invited either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= Algemeen Dagblad |location= The Netherlands | author= Marloe van der Schrier | url= https://www.ad.nl/ad-werkt/nog-volop-discriminatie-bij-sollicitaties-inhoud-cv-maakt-nauwelijks-uit~a7567cc9/ |title= Nog volop discriminatie bij sollicitaties: inhoud cv maakt nauwelijks uit (English: Still plenty of discrimination in job applications: content of CV hardly makes any difference) |accessdate= 23 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[pogrom]]" became commonly used in English after a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots swept through south-western [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]] in 1881&amp;ndash;1884. A much bloodier wave of pogroms broke out in 1903–1906, leaving an estimated 2,000 Jews dead.  By the beginning of the 20th century, most European Jews lived in the so-called [[Pale of Settlement]], the Western frontier of the [[Russian Empire]] consisting generally of the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and neighboring regions.  Many pogroms accompanied the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]], an estimated 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former [[Russian Empire]]; the number of Jewish orphans exceeded 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism|title=anti-Semitism|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary L Rubinstein, Daniel C Cohn-Sherbok, Abraham J Edelheit, William D Rubinstein, ''The Jews in the Modern World'', Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was conducted in 2011 about the Swedes attitudes to mixed marriages. The conclusion was that the views in general were favorable, but that there was a strong hierarchy based on which groups to live with. Swedes primarily preferred relationships with Scandinavians, Western Europeans and Southern Europeans, and then Eastern Europeans, Central Europeans and Latin Americans. At the bottom were South and East Asians, Africans, and Middle Eastern people. Older individuals and women, as well as people with less education and people who were brought up outside of [[Malmö]] (the most multicultural city of Sweden), were generally more prone to having negative attitudes. Most were able to accept family members and friends living in mixed relationships, even if they did not want to do it themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Text: Johanna Svensson |url=http://www.mah.se/english/News/News-2011/-Love-aint-got-no-color--Attitude-toward-interracial-marriage/ |title=Love ain’t got no color? – Attitude toward interracial marriage – Malmö University |publisher=Mah.se |date=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2012-05-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905111204/http://www.mah.se/english/News/News-2011/-Love-aint-got-no-color--Attitude-toward-interracial-marriage/ |archivedate=5 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
