{{Rape}}
{{Violence against women}}
'''Corrective rape''' is a [[hate crime]] in which one or more people are [[rape]]d because of their perceived [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]. The common intended consequence of the rape, as seen by the perpetrator, is to turn the person [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or to enforce conformity with [[gender stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="Bartle" /&gt; 

The term ''corrective rape'' was coined in South Africa after well-known cases of corrective rapes of [[lesbian]]s like [[Eudy Simelane]] (who was also murdered in the same attack) and Zoliswa Nkonyana became public. Although some countries have laws protecting [[LGBT]] people, corrective rape is often overlooked.&lt;ref name="Hawthorne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;

== Definition ==
Corrective rape is the use of rape against people who do not conform to perceived [[Norm (social)|social norms]] regarding [[human sexuality]] and [[gender role]]s, with goals of punishing "abnormal" behavior and reinforcing societal norms.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;  The crime was first identified in South Africa,&lt;ref name="Janoff" /&gt; where it is sometimes supervised by members of the woman's family or local community.&lt;ref name="Bartle" /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[UNAIDS]] 2015 Terminology Guidelines suggests that use of the term ''corrective rape'' should no longer be used, as it gives off the perception that something needs to be fixed. The guidelines state that the term ''homophobic rape'' should be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=UNAIDS 2015 Terminology Guidelines|url=http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2015_terminology_guidelines_en.pdf|website=UNAIDS.org|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on victims ==
Corrective rape is a major contributor to [[HIV]] infection in South African lesbians.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;    Corrective rape and other accompanying acts of violence can result in [[physical trauma|physical]] and [[psychological trauma]], mutilation, HIV infection, unwanted [[pregnancy]],  and may contribute to [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="Hawthorne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt;

== Contributing dynamics ==
A 2000 study suggested the visibility of lesbians within a community, an atmosphere supportive of hate crimes against gay men and lesbians, isolated locations, reactions to hate crimes by the broader community, and responses by police and justice systems contribute to corrective rape.&lt;ref name="Bartle" /&gt;  Failure to conform to social norms for gendered behavior is also thought to contribute.&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt;

Many believe that it should be recognized as a hate crime because of the misunderstanding of homosexuality and the animus toward gay people that motivate corrective rape.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;  In one article, Tina Machida, a Zimbabwean lesbian who lives in [[Harare]], writes, "They locked me in a room and brought [a man] every day to rape me so I would fall pregnant and be forced to marry him. They did this to me until I was pregnant."&lt;ref name="Hawthorne" /&gt;

== Prevalence ==
Corrective rape has been reported in [[Thailand]],&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt; [[Zimbabwe]],&lt;ref name="Shaw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; [[Ecuador]],&lt;ref name="Caselli" /&gt; [[Uganda]]&lt;ref name="GuarUganda"/&gt; and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Middleton" /&gt;

=== Zimbabwe ===
{{Further|LGBT rights in Zimbabwe}}

A U.S. State Department report on Zimbabwe states, "In response to social pressure, some families reportedly subjected their LGBT members to 'corrective' rape and forced marriages to encourage heterosexual conduct. Such crimes were rarely reported to police. Women, in particular, were subjected to rape by male family members."&lt;ref name="USZimbabwe2012"/&gt; 
Following the publication of an earlier report with similar wording,&lt;ref name="USZimbabwe2009"/&gt; Zimbabwean journalist [[Angus Shaw (writer)|Angus Shaw]] said that lesbian women are raped by men to "make them enjoy heterosexual acts" and gay men are raped by women to "remove their sexual orientation tendencies".&lt;ref name="Gonda"/&gt;

In South Africa, women have less sexual and economic power than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mantell|first1=Joanne|last2=Needham|first2=Sarah|last3=Smit|first3=Jennifer Ann|last4=Hoffman|first4=Susie|last5=Cebekhulu|first5=Queen|last6=Adams-Skinner|first6=Jessica|last7=Exner|first7=Theresa|last8=Mabude|first8=Zonke|last9=Beksinska|first9=Mags|last10=Stein|first10=Zena|last11=Milford|first11=Cecilia|title=Gender norms in South Africa: implications for HIV and pregnancy prevention among African and Indian women students at a South African tertiary institution|journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality|date=February 2009|volume=11|issue=2|pages=139â€“157|doi=10.1080/13691050802521155|pmc=2782559|pmid=19247859}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the factors associated with this inequality is strict gender roles, which has led to one of the highest rates of [[violence against women]] in the world.&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt; The South African government conducted a survey in 2009 on sexual assault. One in four men admit to having sex with a woman who did not consent and nearly half of these men admitted to raping more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Clare|title=The Brutality of "Corrective Rape" |url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/07/26/opinion/26corrective-rape.html?_r=0|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrective rape is used as a "punishment" for people who are gay or do not fit traditional gender roles (usually women), where often they are [[verbally abused]] before the rape. The perpetrator may claim to be "teaching [the women] a lesson" on how to be a "real woman." Because women have less control over their [[economics]], which creates economic vulnerability, they have less control over their own sexual activities.&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;  Poor black women who live in townships are more likely to become victims of corrective violence, and gay women are more likely to be isolated with little support, which increases their chances of being targeted.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt;

Corrective rape is not recognized by the South African legal system as a hate crime despite the fact that the [[South African Constitution]] states that no person shall be discriminated against based on his or her [[social status]] and identity, including sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; Crimes based on sexual orientation are not expressly recognized in South Africa; corrective rape reports are not separated from general rape reports.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabuse" /&gt; In December 2009, there had been 31 recorded murders of lesbians in South Africa since 1998, but only one had resulted in a conviction.&lt;ref name="Mieses" /&gt; According to [[Human Rights Watch]], in the last 20 years, attitudes toward [[homosexuality]] have become worse in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Hazelton" /&gt;

Corrective rape is on the rise in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as estimated by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Sexuality" /&gt; It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of corrective rape every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the [[Western Cape]] live in fear of being [[sexually assaulted]], as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; Under-reporting is high for sexually violent crimes, thus the number of corrective rapes are likely higher than what is reported.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; Although it is thought to be uncommon, men also become victims of corrective rape. A study conducted by OUT [[LGBT]] Well-being and the University of South Africa Centre for Applied Psychology (UCAP) showed that "the percentage of black gay men who said they have experienced corrective rape matched that of the black lesbians who partook in the study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Louw|first1=Angelo|title=Men are also 'corrective rape' victims |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-11-men-are-also-corrective-rape-victims|website=Mail&amp;Guardian |accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all men admit to being victims of corrective rape.

One South African man stated, "Lesbians get raped and killed because it is accepted by our community and by our culture."&lt;ref name="Middleton" /&gt;

Galip Asvat, a successful hair salon business owner, is a gay man born in [[Klerksdorp]]. He moved to [[Hillbrow]], which was a haven for the LGBT community, in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="mg.co.za"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Louw|first1=Angelo|title=Men are also 'corrective rape' victims|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-11-men-are-also-corrective-rape-victims|website=Mail&amp;Guardian|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One early morning in 2007, Asvat was ambushed and raped by three men in his apartment building.

Sizakele Sigasa, a lesbian activist living in [[Soweto]], and her partner Salome Masooa were raped, [[torture]]d, and murdered in July 2007 in an attack that South African lesbian-[[gay rights]] organizations, including the umbrella-group Joint Working Group, said were driven by lesbophobia.&lt;ref name="Ndaba"/&gt; Two other rape/murders of lesbians occurred in South Africa earlier in summer 2007: Simangele Nhlapo, member of an [[HIV-positive]] support group was raped and murdered in June, along with her two-year-old daughter; and Madoe Mafubedu, age 16, was raped and stabbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pithouse|first=Richard|title=Only Protected on Paper|url=http://sacsis.org.za/site/article/644.1|publisher=The South African Civil Society Information Service|accessdate=22 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6QiX79Fi5|archivedate=30 June 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, two writers from South African men's magazine ''[[FHM]]'' were fired as a result of corrective rape "jokes" they made on Facebook. After a disciplinary hearing on Friday, July 19, 2013, ''FHM'' dismissed both men from their positions, calling their comments "entirely unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;http://mg.co.za/article/2013-07-19-fhm-fires-rape-comment-writers&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa is a signatory of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which obligates states to remove discriminatory barriers from the full and free exercise of rights by women. The Convention's duty to modify the conduct of private citizens to ensure equality for women covers attitudes that include the inferiority of women and stereotyped gender roles, which arguably encompass the animus toward gay women that motivates many men to commit corrective rape.&lt;ref name="Di" /&gt; 66% of South Africa women said they did not report their attack because they would not be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt; Of these, 25% said they feared exposing their sexual orientation to the police and 22% said they were afraid of being abused by the police.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;

In August 2011, the [[Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|Department of Justice]] established a National Task Team (NTT) to address the issue of hate crimes against LGBT people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Team starts work on gay hate crimes |agency=[[South African Press Association|SAPA]]-DPA |date=10 August 2011 |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/team-starts-work-on-gay-hate-crimes-1.1115051 |newspaper=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL News]] |accessdate=15 August 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6RD3RrFs8|archivedate=20 July 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, then [[Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development|Minister of Justice]] [[Jeff Radebe]] launched a National Intervention Strategy for the LGBTI Sector developed by the NTT to address sex-based violence and [[gender-based violence]] against members of the community. The NTT has established a rapid response team to attend to unsolved criminal cases as a matter of urgency and produced an information pamphlet with frequently asked questions about LGBTI persons. Radebe stated that the Department of Justice acknowledged the need for a specific legal framework for hate crimes and that the matter would be subjected to public debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Intervention Strategy for LGBTI Sector 2014|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/vg/lgbti/2014-LGBTI-Strategy.pdf|publisher=Department of Justice and Constitutional Development|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radebe launches LGBTI violence programme|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/radebe-launches-lgbti-violence-programme-1.1681563#.U8vOjOOSyyg|accessdate=20 July 2014|agency=SAPA|newspaper=IOL|date=29 April 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6RD3bz2dy|archivedate=20 July 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diale|first1=Lerato|title=Plan to combat gender violence|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/124285-1007-53-Plan_to_combat_gender_violence|accessdate=20 July 2014|work=The New Age|date=30 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720144529/http://www.thenewage.co.za/124285-1007-53-Plan_to_combat_gender_violence|archivedate=20 July 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|LGBT rights in Jamaica}}

Amnesty International has received reports of violence against lesbians in [[Jamaica]], including rape and other forms of sexual violence. Lesbians reportedly have been attacked on the grounds of "mannish" physical appearance or other visible "signs" of sexuality. Some reports of abduction and rape come from inner-city communities, where local non-governmental organizations have expressed concerns about high incidences of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Czyzselska | first=Jane | title=No Woman No Cry: Lesbians in Jamaica | url=http://www.gaytimes.co.uk/HotSpots/Travel-page-3-sectionid-1-articleid-357.html | newspaper=GayTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaigning==
Child sponsorship charity [[ActionAid]] has published an article discussing corrective rape, and see ending violence against women as a pivotal part of their mission.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt; The group joined with 26 gay and womenâ€™s rights and community groups, to organize a campaign focused on South Africa but also aimed at the international community, to raise awareness of the issues.  The campaign was dedicated to the rape and murder of two lesbian women in a Johannesburg township and called for sexual orientation to be specifically recognised as grounds for protection by police and justice systems.&lt;ref name="Actionaid" /&gt;

==Nature-nurture debate as a cause==
Some sources argue that many cases of corrective rape are caused by the entire framing and [[is-ought problem|drawing moral conclusions]] from the [[nature-nurture debate]]. That the combination of claiming male homosexuality to be innate, using that claim as an argument for homosexual rights, and claiming homosexuality in women to be subject to environmental factors after birth, as a combo leads to acceptance of ideologies that want to convert lesbians into heterosexual women. People of this viewpoint point at a contradiction between the claim of specifically male biological determinism and claiming gay men to have feminine brains, and suggest as a solution to stop using "nature or nurture" or "biology or choice" arguments for homosexual rights altogether and instead focus on arguments of the one person's sexuality is none of another person's business type.&lt;ref&gt;McCommon B (2006).
