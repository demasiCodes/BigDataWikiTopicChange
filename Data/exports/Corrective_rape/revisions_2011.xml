'''Corrective rape''' is a criminal practice, whereby [[LGBT]] individuals are heterosexually [[rape]]d, sometimes under supervision by members of their families or local communities, purportedly as a means of "curing" them of their non-[[heterosexual]] [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Violet Gonda, [http://www.swradioafrica.com/news080410/corrective-rape080410.htm ‘Corrective rape’ against homosexuals on the rise in Zimbabwe], SW Radio Africa, 8 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbclcr&gt;{{cite news|last=Pumza|first=Fihlani|title=South Africa's lesbians fear 'corrective rape'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13908662|accessdate=30 June 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term corrective rape was first used in the early 2000s by [[human rights]] [[non-governmental organisations]] to describe rapes committed against [[South Africa]]n lesbians. A notable attack of this kind came in 2008 when [[Eudy Simelane]], a member of the [[South Africa women's national football team]] and a vocal [[LGBT]]-rights activist in South Africa, was [[gang rape]]d and [[murder]]ed in [[KwaThema, Gauteng]]. 

A November 2008 report by the NGO [[ActionAid]] and the [[South African Human Rights Commission]] reported that corrective rape is a serious problem.
