"'''Corrective rape'''" is a criminal practice, whereby men [[rape]] [[lesbian]] women, purportedly as a means of "curing" the woman of her [[sexual orientation]]. 

The term "corrective rape" was first used in the early 2000s by [[human rights]] [[non-governmental organisations]] to describe rapes committed against [[South Africa]]n lesbians. A notable attack of this kind came in 2008 when [[Eudy Simelane]], a member of the [[South Africa women's national football team]] and a vocal [[LGBT]]-rights activist in South Africa, was [[gang rape]]d and [[murder]]ed in [[KwaThema, Gauteng]]. 

A November 2008 report by the NGO [[ActionAid]] and the [[South African Human Rights Commission]] called for the creation of legislation to specifically target [[hate crime]]s, including corrective rape.
