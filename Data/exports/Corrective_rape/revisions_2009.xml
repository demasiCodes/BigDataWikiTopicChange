Most reports of corrective rape originate from [[South Africa]].

The term "corrective rape" was invented in the early 2000s by [[human rights]] [[non-governmental organisations]] to describe rapes committed against South African lesbians. The most notable such attack came in 2008 when [[Eudy Simelane]], a member of the [[South Africa women's national football team]] and a vocal [[LGBT]]-rights activist in South Africa, was [[gang rape]]d and [[murder]]ed in [[KwaThema, Gauteng]]. A November 2008 report by the NGO [[ActionAid]] and the [[South African Human Rights Commission]] called for the creation of legislation to specifically target [[hate crime]]s, including corrective rape.
