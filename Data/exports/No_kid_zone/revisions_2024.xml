'''No kid zones''' are places in [[South Korea]] that prohibit children from being on the premises. No kid zones may be enforced by public venues and private businesses.&lt;ref name="TST"&gt;{{cite news |title=South Korean lawmaker's call to abolish 'no-kids zones' sparks controversy |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korean-lawmaker-s-call-to-abolish-no-kids-zones-sparks-controversy |website=The Straits Times |date=5 May 2023 |access-date=13 July 2024 |archive-date=13 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240713020831/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korean-lawmaker-s-call-to-abolish-no-kids-zones-sparks-controversy |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; First becoming common in the early 2010s, no kid zones are commonly established to protect businesses from legal liability, but they may also be used to prevent children from disturbing adults. Places that are commonly designated as no kid zones include coffeehouses, restaurants, and movie theatres as well as national landmarks such as the [[National Library of Korea]]. They are most common on [[Jeju Island]].

The use of no kid zones is debated. Proponents argue that businesses have a right to exclude children, while opponents consider them discriminatory toward children, mothers and fathers. The [[National Human Rights Commission of Korea]] described them as discriminatory in a 2017 decision. Some businesses designate themselves as '''Kids OK Zones''' to indicate that children are allowed on the premises.

== Practice ==
Such zones began to proliferate in the early 2010s. Around this time, a number of court rulings held businesses at least partially responsible after children were injured on the premises. For example, in 2013, a business was held liable after a 10 year old child bumped into a store employee carrying hot water, which resulted in the child being burned.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |last=김 |first=수지 |date=2023-11-16 |title=[팩트체크] '노00존'은 합법? |url=https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20231113122900505 |access-date=2024-07-13 |work=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jeju Research Institute, there are 542 no kid zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mesmer |first1=Phillip |title=South Korea's 'no-kids zones' flourish in cafés and restaurants |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/02/19/south-korea-s-no-kids-zones-reflect-a-society-where-people-have-given-up-on-trying-to-accommodate-each-other_6540962_4.html |website=[[Le Monde]] |date=19 February 2024 |access-date=12 July 2024 |archive-date=12 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240712194757/https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/02/19/south-korea-s-no-kids-zones-reflect-a-society-where-people-have-given-up-on-trying-to-accommodate-each-other_6540962_4.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A service offered by [[Google Maps]] depicts 451 such zones.&lt;ref name="KH"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jung |first1=Min-kyung |date=June 10, 2023 |title=Inside the debate on 'no-kids zones' |url=https://koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20230609000677 |access-date=12 July 2024 |website=[[The Korea Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeju Island]], a well-known tourist destination, has the highest amount of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South Korean lawmaker wants 'no kids' zones banned despite public support for them |url=https://www.asianews.it/news-en/South-Korean-lawmaker-wants-'no-kids'-zones-banned-despite-public-support-for-them-58330.html |website=AsiaNews |access-date=12 July 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; No kid zones are not areas that are normally off-limits to children such as bars or casinos; but they are frequently [[coffeehouse]]s, restaurants,&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; and movie theatres.&lt;ref name="Esther"/&gt; The [[National Library of Korea]] is a no kid zone and prevents children under the age of 16 from entering unless they apply for entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Yu-Young |first1=Jin |title=South Korea Wants More Babies, Just Not in These Places |work=The New York Times |date=16 May 2023 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/world/asia/korea-no-kids-zones.html |access-date=13 July 2024 |archive-date=27 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240627084805/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/world/asia/korea-no-kids-zones.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |last=주 |first=영재 |date=2024-03-04 |title=[취재 후]노키즈존 국립중앙도서관 최선일까 |url=https://weekly.khan.co.kr/khnm.html/?mode=view&amp;dept=115&amp;art_id=202402270600021 |access-date=2024-07-13 |website={{ill|Weekly Kyunghyang|ko|주간경향}} |language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children under this age may instead go to the [[National Library for Children and Young Adults]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2020, the [[Korea National Arboretum]] was reported to be a no kids zone.&lt;ref name="Esther"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chung |first1=Esther |title=Parents learn to adapt to world of kid-free zones: Once controversial, the designation is now more accepted |url=https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2020/01/12/features/Parents-learn-to-adapt-to-world-of-kidfree-zones-Once-controversial-the-designation-is-now-more-accepted/3072509.html |website=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]] |date=12 January 2020 |access-date=14 July 2024 |archive-date=14 July 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240714142005/https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2020/01/12/features/Parents-learn-to-adapt-to-world-of-kidfree-zones-Once-controversial-the-designation-is-now-more-accepted/3072509.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas prohibited to children may be marked with signage or by staff telling parents that children cannot be present on the premises.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Oaten |first1=James |last2=Lee |first2=Sookyoung |title=In South Korea, child-free zones are increasingly popular, but parents say it's holding back the next generation |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-02/inside-south-korea-child-free-zones/103139230 |website=ABC News |date=December 2023 |access-date=12 July 2024 |archive-date=2024-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240711084818/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-02/inside-south-korea-child-free-zones/103139230 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses that allow children in [[Seoul]] may market themselves as a Kids OK Zone, a designation that is regulated by the [[Happy Parenting Division]].

== Legal implications ==
A 2017 decision by the [[National Human Rights Commission of Korea]] ruled that no kid zones were discriminatory, but this did not legally restrict them from existing.&lt;ref name="KH" /&gt; The decision concluded that no kid zones conflict with a child's right to equality under the [[Constitution of South Korea|constitution]] and the United Nation's [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kyung-eun |first1=Song |last2=Hong-joo |first2=Park |last3=Yubin |first3=Han |title=Korea's human rights authority says No Kids zones are discriminative |url=https://pulse.mk.co.kr/m/news/all/10817213 |website=Pulse |access-date=14 July 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
