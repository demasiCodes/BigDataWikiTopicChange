The '''history of eugenics''' is the study of development and advocacy of ideas related to [[eugenics]] around the world. Early eugenic ideas were discussed in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The height of the modern eugenics movement came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

The lack of sources by contemporary Greeks mentioning Spartan eugenics and the lack of archeological evidence has brought ideas about Spartan eugenics into question. While infanticide was practiced by Greeks, no contemporary sources support Plutarch's claims of mass infanticide motivated by eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Disability and Infanticide in Ancient Greece |journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens |date=2021 |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=747 |doi=10.2972/hesperia.90.4.0747 |last1=Sneed |s2cid=245045967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the suggestion that infants were dumped near Mount Taygete was called into question due to a lack of physical evidence.

This purported practice has been described as an archetypal form of utopian eugenics that is closely associated with Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;Doran, Timothy (2017). "Eugenic Ideology in the Hellenistic Spartan Reforms." ''Historia: Zeitschrift Für Alte Geschichte'', 66(3), 258–280. http://www.jstor.org/stable/45019264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huys, Marc (1996).

[[Plato's political philosophy]] included the belief that human reproduction should be cautiously monitored and controlled by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Galton, David J.]] (1998). "Greek theories on eugenics." ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', 24(4), 263–267. doi:10.1136/jme.24.4.263&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated that [[selective breeding]] should be applied to both humans and animals. Plato recognized that this form of government control would not be readily accepted, and proposed the truth be concealed from the public via a fixed lottery. Mates, in Plato's [[Republic (Plato)#Book V–VI: The Ship of State|''Republic'']], would be chosen by a "marriage number" in which the quality of the individual would be quantitatively analyzed, and persons of high numbers would be allowed to procreate with other persons of high numbers. This would then lead to predictable results and the improvement of the human race. Plato acknowledged the failure of the "marriage number" since "gold soul" persons could still produce "bronze soul" children.&lt;ref&gt;The Republic, 457c10-d3&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's ideas may have been one of the earliest attempts to mathematically analyze [[Heredity|genetic inheritance]], prefiguring some of what would much later become known as [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Brumbaugh|Brumbaugh, Robert S.]] (1954). "Plato's Genetic Theory", ''Journal of Heredity'', 45(4):191–196, doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a106472&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographer [[Strabo]] ({{circa}} 64 BCE – {{circa}} 24 CE) stated that the [[Samnites]] would take ten [[Virginity|virgin]] women and ten young men who were considered to be the best representation of their [[sex]] and [[Mating|mate]] them. Any selected male committing a dishonorable act would be separated from his partner.&lt;ref&gt;''[[iarchive:Strabo08Geography17AndIndex/Strabo 02 Geography 3-5/page/n471/mode/2up|Geographica]]'', [[Strabo]], Book 5, page 467. "And they say that among the Samnitae there is a law which is indeed honourable and conducive to noble qualities; for they are not permitted to give their daughters in marriage to whom they wish, but every year ten virgins and ten young men, the noblest of each sex, are selected, and, of these, the first choice of the virgins is given to the first choice of the young men, and the second to the second, and so on to the end; but if the young man who wins the meed of honour changes and turns out bad, they disgrace him and take away from him the woman given him."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galton's theory===
[[File:Francis Galton 1850s.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sir [[Francis Galton]] initially developed the ideas of eugenics using social statistics.]]

Sir [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911) systematized these ideas and practices according to new knowledge about the evolution of man and animals provided by the theory of his half-cousin [[Charles Darwin]] during the 1860s and 1870s. After reading Darwin's ''[[Origin of Species]]'', Galton built upon Darwin's ideas whereby the mechanisms of [[natural selection]] were potentially thwarted by human [[civilization]]. He reasoned that, since many human societies sought to protect the underprivileged and weak, those societies were at odds with the natural selection responsible for extinction of the weakest, and only by changing these social policies could society be saved from a "reversion towards mediocrity", a phrase he first coined in statistics and which later changed to the now-common "[[regression towards the mean]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 3 in [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald A. MacKenzie]], ''Statistics in Britain, 1865–1930: The social construction of scientific knowledge'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; (Incidentally, Galton also coined the phrase "[[nature versus nurture]]".)

Galton first sketched out his theory in the 1865 article "Hereditary Talent and Character", then elaborated further in his 1869 book ''[[Hereditary Genius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Galton, [http://www.mugu.com/galton/essays/1860-1869/galton-1865-hereditary-talent.pdf "Hereditary talent and character"], ''Macmillan's Magazine'' 12 (1865): 157–166 and 318–327; [[Francis Galton]], [http://www.mugu.com/galton/books/hereditary-genius/ ''Hereditary genius: an inquiry into its laws and consequences''] (London: Macmillan, 1869).&lt;/ref&gt; He began by studying the way in which human intellectual, moral, and personality traits tended to run in families. Galton's basic argument was that [[Inheritance of intelligence|"genius" and "talent" were hereditary traits]] in humans, although neither he nor Darwin yet had a working model of this type of heredity. He concluded that, since one could use [[artificial selection]] to exaggerate traits in other animals, one could expect similar results when applying such models to humans. As he wrote in the introduction to ''Hereditary Genius'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I propose to show in this book that a man's natural abilities are derived by inheritance, under exactly the same limitations as are the form and physical features of the whole organic world. Consequently, as it is easy, notwithstanding those limitations, to obtain by careful selection a permanent breed of dogs or horses gifted with peculiar powers of running, or of doing anything else, so it would be quite practicable to produce a highly gifted race of men by judicious marriages during several consecutive generations.&lt;ref&gt;Galton, ''Hereditary Genius'': 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galton claimed that the less intelligent were more fertile than the more intelligent of his time. Galton did not propose any selection methods; rather, he hoped a solution would be found if social [[mores]] changed in a way that encouraged people to see the importance of breeding. He first used the word ''eugenic'' in his 1883 ''[[Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Larson | first=Edward J. | title=Sex, race, and science : eugenics in the deep South | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | publication-place=Baltimore | date=1996 | isbn=0-8018-4938-1 | oclc=35987615}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book in which he meant "to touch on various topics more or less connected with that of the cultivation of race, or, as we might call it, with 'eugenic' questions". He included a footnote to the word "eugenic" which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That is, with questions bearing on what is termed in Greek, ''eugenes'' namely, good in stock, hereditary endowed with noble qualities. This, and the allied words, ''eugeneia'', etc., are equally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognizance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word ''eugenics'' would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a neater word and a more generalized one than ''viriculture'' which I once ventured to use.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Galton, [http://www.mugu.com/galton/books/human-faculty/ ''Inquiries into human faculty and its development''] (London, Macmillan, 1883): 17, fn1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1908, in ''Memories of my Life'', Galton defined eugenics as "the study of agencies under social control that may improve or impair the racial qualities of future generations, either physically or mentally",&lt;ref name="Galton1908"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Francis Galton|title=Memories of My Life|url=https://archive.org/details/memoriesmylife00galtgoog|year=1908|publisher=Methuen &amp; Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/memoriesmylife00galtgoog/page/n338 321]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a definition agreed in consultation with a committee that included the [[biometrician]] [[Karl Pearson]]. It was slightly at odds with Galton's preferred definition, given in a lecture to the newly formed Sociological Society at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1904: "the science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race; also with those that develop them to the utmost advantage".&lt;ref name="Galton1904"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Galton, Francis |author-link=Francis Galton |date=July 1904 |title=Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope, and Aims |journal=The American Journal of Sociology |volume=X |issue=1 |access-date=2010-12-27 |url=http://www.mugu.com/galton/essays/1900-1911/galton-1904-am-journ-soc-eugenics-scope-aims.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103082723/http://galton.org/essays/1900-1911/galton-1904-am-journ-soc-eugenics-scope-aims.htm |archive-date=2007-11-03 |quote=Eugenics is the science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race; also with those that develop them to the utmost advantage. |bibcode=  1904Natur..70...82.|pages=82, 1st paragraph |doi=10.1038/070082a0 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter definition, which encompassed nurture and environment as well as heredity, was favoured by broadly left-wing, liberal elements of the ensuing ideological divide.&lt;ref name="Freeden1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeden|first1=Michael|title=Eugenics and Progressive Thought: a Study in Ideological Affinity|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=22|issue=3|year=1979|pages=645–671|issn=0018-246X|doi=10.1017/S0018246X00017027|pmid=11614586|s2cid=5357663 }}{{rp|645–646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galton's formulation of eugenics was based on a strong [[statistics|statistical]] approach, influenced heavily by [[Adolphe Quetelet]]'s "social physics". Unlike Quetelet,  Galton did not exalt the "average man" but decried him as mediocre. Galton and his statistical heir [[Karl Pearson]] developed what was called the [[biometrics|biometrical]] approach to eugenics, which developed new and complex statistical models (later exported to wholly different fields) to describe the heredity of traits. However, with the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s laws of heredity, two separate camps of eugenics advocates emerged, one of statisticians, the other of biologists. Statisticians thought the biologists had exceptionally crude mathematical models, while biologists thought the statisticians knew little about biology.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapters 2 and 6 in MacKenzie, ''Statistics in Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugenics eventually referred to human selective reproduction with an intent to create children with desirable traits, generally through the approach of influencing [[differential birth rates]]. These policies were mostly divided into two categories: ''positive eugenics'', the increased reproduction of those seen to have advantageous hereditary traits; and ''negative eugenics'', the discouragement of reproduction by those with hereditary traits perceived as poor. Negative eugenic policies in the past have ranged from paying those deemed to have bad genes to voluntarily undergo sterilization, attempts at [[Racial segregation|segregation]], [[compulsory sterilization]], and even [[genocide]]. Positive eugenic policies have typically taken the form of awards or bonuses for "fit" parents who have another child. Relatively innocuous practices such as [[marriage counseling]] had early links with eugenic ideology. Eugenics is superficially related to what later became known as [[Social Darwinism]]. While both claimed intelligence was hereditary, eugenics asserted new policies were needed to actively change the status quo towards a more "eugenic" state, while the Social Darwinists argued that society itself would naturally "check" the problem of "[[dysgenics]]" if no welfare policies were in place—for example, the poor might reproduce more but would have higher mortality rates.&lt;ref name="Donald MacKenzie 1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacKenzie, Donald |title=Eugenics in Britain |journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=503 |year=1975 |doi=10.1177/030631277600600310|pmid=11610196 |s2cid=33556080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Davenport===
[[Charles Davenport]] (1866-1944), a scientist from the United States, stands out as one of history's leading eugenicists. He took eugenics from a scientific idea to a worldwide movement implemented in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2003|p=34}}, describes Davenport as eugenics crusader-in-chief&lt;/ref&gt; Davenport obtained funding from the Carnegie Institution, to establish the [[Station for Experimental Evolution]] at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harbor]] in 1904&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2003|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Eugenics Records Office in 1910, which provided the scientific basis for later Eugenic policies such as [[enforced sterilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2003|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in building  the [[International Federation of Eugenics Organizations]] (IFEO) in 1925, and became its first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2003|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Davenport was located at Cold Spring Harbor and received money from the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institute of Washington]], the organization known as the [[Eugenics Record Office]] (ERO) started to become an embarrassment after the well-known debates between Davenport and [[Franz Boas]]. Davenport continued to occupy the same office and the same address at Cold Spring Harbor, but his organization now became known as the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, which currently retains the archives of the Eugenics Record Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.cshl.edu/archives/archives/ciwfiles.htm |title=CIW files |publisher=Library.cshl.edu |access-date=2011-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927171639/http://library.cshl.edu/archives/archives/ciwfiles.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Davenport's racist{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} views were not supported by all geneticists at Cold Spring Harbor, including [[H. J. Muller]], [[Bentley Glass]], and [[Esther Lederberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estherlederberg.com/Eugenics%20(Anecdotes).html |title=Esther M. Zimmer Lederberg: Eugenics |publisher=Estherlederberg.com |access-date=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, Davenport welcomed [[Ernst Rüdin]], a prominent Swiss eugenicist and race scientist, as his successor in the position of President of the IFEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Black|2003|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rüdin, director of the ''Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'' (German Research Institute for Psychiatry), a [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] located in Munich,&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Walter Schmuhl, "The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics, 1927–1945", Springer Science + Business Media B.

[[File:Galton class eugenics.svg|right|thumb|400px|Galton's view of the British class structure was the basis and emphasis of the eugenics movement in Britain.]]

In September 1903, an "Inter-departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration" chaired by [[Almeric FitzRoy|Almeric W. FitzRoy]] was appointed by the government "to make a preliminary enquiry into the allegations concerning the deterioration of certain classes of the population as shown by the large percentage of rejections for physical causes of recruits for the [[British Army|Army]]", and gave its Report to both houses of parliament in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/b21358916 Report of the Inter-departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration], London, 1904, as digitized in 2015 by the Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; Among its recommendations, originating from professor [[Daniel John Cunningham]], were an anthropometric survey of the British population. The [[Catholic Church in the United Kingdom|Catholic church]] was opposed to eugenics, as illustrated in the writings of Father [[Thomas John Gerrard]].&lt;ref name="Scotti2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paschal Scotti|title=Out of Due Time: Wilfrid Ward and the Dublin Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szxVd-QDzqsC&amp;pg=PA159|date=February 2006|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1427-6|pages=159–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugenics was supported by many prominent figures of different political persuasions before [[World War I]] (and as [[positive eugenics]] after the War), including: [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] economists [[William Beveridge]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]]; [[Fabian Society|Fabian socialists]] such as the Irish author [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[H.

[[Francis Galton]] explained during a lecture in 1901 the groupings which are shown in the opening figure and indicated the proportion of society falling into each group, along with their perceived genetic worth. Galton suggested that negative eugenics (i.e. an attempt to prevent them from bearing offspring) should be applied only to those in the lowest social group (the "Undesirables"), while positive eugenics applied to the higher classes. However, he appreciated the worth of the higher working classes to society and industry.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

In 2012, the British Parliament passed the [[Welfare Reform Act 2012]]. The law created various caps on welfare payments, most prominently the [[Benefit cap|two-child benefits cap]], with the government's stated aims being to push non-working parents into employment, reduce the number of children born to parents in receipt of state benefits and minimise the cost of welfare to taxpayers.

One of the earliest modern advocates of eugenics (before it was labeled as such) was [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. In 1881 Bell investigated the rate of [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|deafness on Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]]. From this he concluded that [[deafness]] was hereditary in nature and, through noting that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children, tentatively suggested that couples where both were deaf should not marry, in his lecture ''Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race'' presented to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] on 13 November 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bell, Alexander Graham|title=Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race  | publisher =Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf  | year =1883  | url =http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED033502&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED033502 | access-date = 2007-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/throughdeafeyes/deaflife/bell_nad.html |title=Through Deaf Eyes .

The committee unequivocally extended the principle to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce, Robert V.|title=Bell: Alexander Graham Bell and the Conquest of Solitude|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1990|pages=410; 417|isbn=978-0-8014-9691-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scientist considered the "father of the American eugenics movement" was [[Charles Benedict Davenport]].&lt;ref name=Micklos&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Micklos, David |author2=Carlson, Elof |title=Engineering American society: the lesson of eugenics  |journal=Nature Reviews.

It was also around that time that Davenport became actively involved with the ABA. This led to Davenport's first eugenics text, "The science of human improvement by better breeding", one of the first papers to connect agriculture and human heredity.&lt;ref name=Micklos/&gt; Davenport later went on to set up a Eugenics Record Office (ERO), collecting hundreds of thousands of medical histories from Americans, which many considered to have a racist and anti-immigration agenda.&lt;ref name=Micklos/&gt; Davenport and his views were supported at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] as late as 1963, when his views began to be de-emphasized.

As the science continued in the 20th century, researchers interested in familial mental disorders conducted a number of studies to document the heritability of such illnesses as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Their findings were used by the eugenics movement as proof for its cause. State laws were written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to prohibit marriage and force sterilization of the mentally ill in order to prevent the "passing on" of mental illness to the next generation. These laws were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1927 and were not abolished until the mid-20th century.  All in all, 60,000 Americans were sterilized.&lt;ref name="sfgate"/&gt;

[[Michigan]] became the first state to introduce a [[compulsory sterilization]] bill on May 16, 1897. However, the law did not pass.

Beginning with [[Connecticut]] in 1896, many states enacted marriage laws with eugenic criteria, prohibiting anyone who was "epileptic, [[imbecile]] or [[feeble-minded]]" from marrying. In 1898 [[Charles Benedict Davenport|Charles B. Davenport]], a prominent American [[biologist]], began as director of a biological research station based in [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harbor]] where he experimented with evolution in plants and animals. In 1904 Davenport received funds from the [[Carnegie Institution]] to found the Station for Experimental Evolution. The [[Eugenics Record Office]] (ERO) opened in 1910 while Davenport and [[Harry H. Laughlin]] began to promote eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;The history of eugenics in the United States is discussed at length in {{cite book|author=Haller, Mark H. |title=Eugenics: hereditarian attitudes in American thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtgnAAAAYAAJ |year=1963 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |location=New Brunswick NJ}} and {{harvnb|Kevles|1985}} ''In the name of eugenics: Genetics and the uses of human heredity'', the latter being the standard survey work on the subject.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] maintained the basic principle of eugenics: that different persons have different inborn characteristics that make them more or less suited for specific kinds of employment, and that by encouraging the most talented members of all races to procreate would better the "stocks" of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, Paul A. (2011), A'' Century of Eugenics in America: From the Indiana Experiment to the Human Genome Era''. pp.&amp;nbsp;74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, David Levering (2001), ''W. E. B.

The [[Immigration Restriction League]] (founded in 1894) was the first American entity associated officially with eugenics. The League sought to bar what it considered dysgenic members of certain races from entering America and diluting what it saw as the superior American racial stock through procreation. They lobbied for a [[literacy test]] for [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]], based on the belief that literacy rates were low among "inferior races". Literacy test bills were vetoed by President [[William McKinley]] in 1897 and by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1913 and 1915; eventually, President Wilson's second veto was overruled by Congress in 1917. Membership in the League included: [[A. Lawrence Lowell]], president of [[Harvard University]], [[William De Witt Hyde|William DeWitt Hyde]], president of [[Bowdoin College]], James T. Young, director of [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]], and [[David Starr Jordan]], president of [[Stanford University]]. The League allied themselves with the American Breeder's Association to gain influence and further its goals and in 1909 established a eugenics committee chaired by David Starr Jordan with members Charles Davenport, Alexander Graham Bell, [[Vernon Lyman Kellogg|Vernon Kellogg]], [[Luther Burbank]], [[William E. Castle|William Earnest Castle]], [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]], H. J. Webber and Friedrich Woods.&lt;ref name="Anglo-America, Ladelle McWhorter 2009, pg 204-205"&gt;{{cite book |author=McWhorter, Ladelle |title=Racism and Sexual Oppression in Anglo-America |url=https://archive.org/details/racismsexualoppr00mcwh |url-access=registration |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2009 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/racismsexualoppr00mcwh/page/n214 204]–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABA's immigration legislation committee, formed in 1911 and headed by League's founder Prescott F. Hall, formalized the committee's already strong relationship with the Immigration Restriction League.&lt;ref name="Anglo-America, Ladelle McWhorter 2009, pg 204-205"/&gt;

In years to come, the ERO collected a mass of family pedigrees and concluded that those who were unfit came from economically and socially poor backgrounds. Eugenicists such as Davenport, the [[psychologist]] [[Henry H. Goddard]] and the conservationist [[Madison Grant]] (all well respected in their time) began to lobby for various solutions to the problem of the "unfit". (Davenport favored [[immigration restriction]] and sterilization as primary methods; Goddard favored segregation in his ''[[The Kallikak Family]]''; Grant favored all of the above and more, even entertaining the idea of extermination.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kevles|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though their methodology and research methods are now understood as highly flawed, at the time this was seen as legitimate scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;See Pg. 23 "'Human Progress' through Eugenics" from Psychology of Mental Fossils, toward an Archeo-psychology by Douglas Keith Candland at [http://www.douglascandland.com/images/chapter7.pdf Douglascandland.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305084850/http://douglascandland.com/images/chapter7.pdf |date=2016-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It did, however, have scientific detractors (notably, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], one of the few Mendelians to explicitly criticize eugenics), though most of these focused more on what they considered the crude methodology of eugenicists, and the characterization of almost every human characteristic as being hereditary, rather than the idea of eugenics itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cravens, Hamilton |title=The triumph of evolution: American scientists and the heredity-environment controversy, 1900–1941 |isbn=0812277449 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |year=1978 |page=[https://archive.org/details/triumphofevoluti0000crav/page/179 179] |url=https://archive.org/details/triumphofevoluti0000crav/page/179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states sterilized "imbeciles" for much of the 20th century. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the 1927 ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'' case that the state of [[Virginia]] could sterilize individuals under the [[Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924]]. The most significant era of [[compulsory sterilization|eugenic sterilization]] was between 1907 and 1963, when over 64,000 individuals were forcibly sterilized under eugenics legislation in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lombardo, "Eugenic Sterilization Laws", essay in the Eugenics Archive, available online at [http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay8text.html Eugenicsarchive.org].&lt;/ref&gt; A favorable report on the results of sterilization in [[California]], the state with the most sterilizations by far, was published in book form by the biologist [[Paul Popenoe]] and was widely cited by the Nazi government as evidence that wide-reaching sterilization programs were feasible and humane.

Such legislation was passed in the U.S. because of widespread public acceptance of the eugenics movement, spearheaded by efforts of progressive reformers.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2698847|year=1989|last1=Allen|first1=GE|title=Eugenics and American social history, 1880–1950|volume=31|issue=2|pages=885–9|journal=Genome|doi=10.1139/g89-156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 19 million people attended the [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition|Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] in [[San Francisco]], open for 10 months from February 20 to December 4, 1915.&lt;ref name=Stern05&gt;{{cite book |first=Alexandra Minna |last=Stern |title=Eugenic Nation: Faults and Frontiers of Better Breeding in Modern America |publisher=University of California Press |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PPIE was a fair devoted to extolling the virtues of a rapidly progressing nation, featuring new developments in science, agriculture, manufacturing and technology. A subject that received a large amount of time and space was that of the developments concerning health and disease, particularly the areas of [[tropical medicine]] and race betterment (tropical medicine being the combined study of [[bacteriology]], [[parasitology]] and [[entomology]] while racial betterment being the promotion of eugenic studies). Having these areas so closely intertwined, it seemed that they were both categorized in the main theme of the fair, the advancement of civilization. Thus in the public eye, the seemingly contradictory areas of study were both represented under progressive banners of improvement and were made to seem like plausible courses of action to better American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stern|2005|pp=27–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of California was at the vanguard of the American eugenics movement, performing about 20,000 sterilizations or one-third of the 60,000 nationwide from 1909 up until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Stern05/&gt; By 1910, there was a large and dynamic network of scientists, reformers and professionals engaged in national eugenics projects and actively promoting eugenic legislation. The American Breeder's Association was the first eugenic body in the U.S., established in 1906 under the direction of biologist Charles B. Davenport. The ABA was formed specifically to "investigate and report on heredity in the human race, and emphasize the value of superior blood and the menace to society of inferior blood". Membership included Alexander Graham Bell, Stanford president David Starr Jordan and Luther Burbank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stern|2005|pp=82–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Nazi administrators went on trial for [[war crimes]] in [[Nuremberg]] after [[World War II]], they attempted to justify the mass sterilizations (over 450,000 in less than a decade) by citing the United States as their inspiration.&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;The connections between U.S. and Nazi eugenicists is discussed in {{cite news |author=Black, Edwin |title=Eugenics and the Nazis – the California connection |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=9 November 2003 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/11/09/ING9C2QSKB1.DTL}}, as well as {{harvnb|Black|2003}}.

The idea of "genius" and "talent" is also considered by [[William Graham Sumner]], a founder of the American Sociological Society (now called the [[American Sociological Association]]). He maintained that if the government did not meddle with the social policy of ''[[laissez-faire]]'', a class of genius would rise to the top of the system of [[social stratification]], followed by a class of talent. Most of the rest of society would fit into the class of mediocrity. Those who were considered to be defective ([[Developmental disability|mentally delayed]], [[Intellectual disability|handicapped]], etc.) had a negative effect on social progress by draining off necessary resources. They should be left on their own to sink or swim. But those in the class of delinquent (criminals, deviants, etc.) should be eliminated from society ("Folkways", 1907).

However, methods of eugenics were applied to reformulate more restrictive definitions of white racial purity in existing state laws banning [[Interracial marriage in the United States|interracial marriage]]: the so-called [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States|anti-miscegenation laws]]. The most famous example of the influence of eugenics and its emphasis on strict racial segregation on such "anti-[[miscegenation]]" legislation was Virginia's [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] overturned this law in 1967 in [[Loving v. Virginia]], and declared anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional.

With the passage of the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], eugenicists for the first time played an important role in the Congressional debate as expert advisers on the threat of "inferior stock" from eastern and southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] asserted that restrictions on [[immigration]] passed in the United States during the 1920s (and overhauled in 1965 with the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]]) were motivated by the goals of eugenics. During the early 20th century, the United States and Canada began to receive far higher numbers of Southern and Eastern European immigrants. It has been argued that this stirred both Canada and the United States into passing laws creating a hierarchy of nationalities, rating them from the most desirable [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Nordic race|Nordic]] peoples to the Chinese and Japanese immigrants, who were almost completely banned from entering the country.&lt;ref&gt;See Lombardo, "Eugenics Laws Restricting Immigration"; and {{harvnb|Gould|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, argued that Congress gave virtually no consideration to these factors, and claim the restrictions were motivated primarily by a desire to maintain the country's cultural integrity against the heavy influx of foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (Free Press, 1994): 5; and [[Mark Syderman]] Richard Herrnstein, "Intelligence tests and the Immigration Act of 1924", ''American Psychologist'' 38 (1983): 986–995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{main|Stolen Generations}}

The policy of removing mixed-race [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] children from their parents emerged from an opinion based on Eugenics theory in late 19th and early 20th century [[Australia]] that the 'full-blood' [[tribal]] Aborigine would be unable to sustain itself, and was doomed to inevitable extinction, as at the time huge numbers of aborigines were in fact dying out, from diseases caught from European settlers.&lt;ref name=McG&gt;Russell McGregor, ''Imagined Destinies. Aboriginal Australians and the Doomed Race Theory, 1880–1939'', Melbourne: MUP, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; An [[ideology]] at the time held that mankind could be divided into a civilizational hierarchy. This notion supposed that Northern [[Europe]]ans were superior in civilization and that Aborigines were inferior. According to this view, the increasing numbers of mixed-descent children in Australia, labeled as "half-castes" (or alternatively "crossbreeds", "quadroons", and "octoroons") should develop within their respective communities, white or aboriginal, according to their dominant parentage.&lt;ref&gt;McGregor (1997: 151)&lt;/ref&gt;

From right to left: a [[half-caste]] grandmother with her [[quadroon]] daughter and [[octoroon]] grandson. Image from a 1947 book by [[eugenicist]] [[A. O. Neville]].]]

In the first half of the 20th century, this led to policies and legislation that resulted in the removal of children from their tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.aus-vn672744-2x |title=Aborigines Act of 1904 |publisher=Nla.gov.au |access-date=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The stated aim was to [[Cultural assimilation|culturally assimilate]] [[multiracial|mixed-descent]] people into contemporary Australian society. In all states and territories legislation was passed in the early years of the 20th century which gave Aboriginal protectors guardianship rights over Aborigines up to the age of sixteen or twenty-one. Policemen or other agents of the state (such as Aboriginal Protection Officers), were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their communities into institutions. In these Australian states and territories, half-caste institutions (both government or [[missionary]]) were established in the early decades of the 20th century for the reception of these separated children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tim-richardson.net/misc/stolen_generation.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001216154300/http://www.tim-richardson.net/misc/stolen_generation.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2000-12-16 |title=Stolen Generation by Tim Richardson |publisher=Tim-richardson.net |date=2003-08-11 |access-date=2011-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special//rsjproject/rsjlibrary/hreoc/stolen/stolen13.html |title=Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission – Bringing them Home – The Report |access-date=2012-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003210357/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/rsjproject/rsjlibrary/hreoc/stolen/stolen13.html |archive-date=2008-10-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 movie [[Rabbit-Proof Fence (film)|''Rabbit-Proof Fence'']] portrays a true story about this system and the harrowing consequences of attempting to overcome it.

In 1922, [[A.O. Neville]] was appointed the second [[Western Australia]] State ''[[Protector of Aborigines|Chief Protector of Aborigines]]''. During the next quarter-century, he presided over the now notorious 'Assimilation' policy of removing mixed-race [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] children from their parents.

Neville believed that biological absorption was the key to 'uplifting the Native race'. Speaking before the [[Moseley Royal Commission]], which investigated the administration of Aboriginals in 1934, he defended the policies of [[Forced settlement of Australian aboriginals|forced settlement]], removing children from parents, surveillance, discipline and punishment, arguing that "they have to be protected against themselves whether they like it or not. They cannot remain as they are. The sore spot requires the application of the surgeon's knife for the good of the patient, and probably against the patient's will". In his twilight years, Neville continued to actively promote his policy. Towards the end of his career, Neville published ''Australia's Coloured Minority'', a text outlining his plan for the biological absorption of aboriginal people into white Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Jacobs | first=Pat | title=Mister Neville, A Biography | publisher=Fremantle Arts Centre Press | isbn=978-0-949206-72-5 | year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kinnane| first=Stephen | title=Shadow Lines | publisher=Fremantle Arts Centre Press | isbn=978-1-86368-237-4 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===

[[File:Redenção.jpg|thumb|right| Portrait "Redenção de Can" (Ham's Redemption), (1895), by [[Galicians|Galician]] painter [[Modesto Brocos]],  illustrating the process of racial whitening (''[[blanqueamiento|branqueamento]]'') through [[miscegenation]] in [[Brazil]]. The painting shows a Brazilian family: The grandmother is black, the mother is mulatto, the father is white, and the baby is white. Note the grandmother gesturing "thank god my grandson is white".&lt;ref&gt;Museu de Arte para a Pesquisa e Educação, [http://www.mare.art.br/detalhe.asp?idobra=3097 "Lia Maria Aguiar Foundation"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085608/http://www.mare.art.br/detalhe.asp?idobra=3097 |date=2012-04-26 }} {{in lang|pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The idea of  Social Darwinism was widespread among [[Brazil]]'s leading scientists, educators, social thinkers, as well as many elected officials, in the late 1800s and early 1900s. This led to the "Politica de Branqueamento" (Whitening Policies) set in practice in Brazil in the early part of the 20th century. This series of laws intended to enlarge the numbers of the [[White Brazilians|white race]] in [[Brazil]] through [[miscegenation]] with European immigrants.

The first official organized movement of eugenics in [[South America]] was a Eugenics Conference in April 1917, which was followed in January 1918 by the founding of the São Paulo Society of Eugenics. This society worked with health agencies and psychiatric offices to promote their ideas. The year 1931 saw the foundation of the "Comitê Central de Eugenismo" (Central Committee on Eugenics) presided by Renato Kehl. Among its suggestions were an end to the immigration of non-whites to Brazil, and the spread of policies against miscegenation.&lt;ref name="pmid21259999"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kehl |first= R | title = 3.-In Brazil | journal = [[The Eugenics Review]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 234–7 | year = 1931 | pmid = 21259999 | pmc = 2985066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of the Central Committee on Eugenics clashed with the Whitening Policies of the beginning of the 20th century. While the Whitening Policies advocated miscegenation in order to reduce the numbers of pure Africans in Brazil in favor of mulattos, who were expected to then produce white off-spring – a policy very similar to the "uplifting the Native race" in Australia – the Central Committee on Eugenics advocated no miscegenation at all and separation between the whites and non-whites in Brazil. When it became obvious that the future of Brazil was in [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] (just as it was for other countries around the world), Brazil had to face whether they had a working force capable of being absorbed by an industrial society. {{dubious|date=June 2016}}{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

A new ideology was needed to counter such racialist claims. This ideology, known as [[Lusotropicalism]], was associated with [[Gilberto Freyre]], and became popular throughout the [[Portuguese Empire]]: specifically, [[Brazil]] and [[Angola]]. Lusotropicalism claimed that its large population of mixed-race people made Brazil the most capable country in tropical climates to carry out a program of industrialization.{{dubious|date=June 2016}} Its mixed-race population had the cultural and intellectual capabilities provided by the white race,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} which could not work in tropical climates, combined with the physical ability to work in tropical climates, provided by the African black race. This excluded the fact that white prisoners, working under penal servitude in [[Puerto Rico]], seemed quite capable of working in a tropical environment. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

====Rockefeller Foundation in Brazil====

In the first decades of the twentieth century, the work of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] was decisive for the implementation of public health initiatives in Brazil, especially in the so-called public health movement. At that time, Brazilian eugenics was the same as public health, as expressed in the maxim "to sanitize is to eugenize".&lt;ref&gt;The Rockefeller Foundation in Brazil, [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1517-45222009000200012&amp;script=sci_arttext] {{in lang|pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the eugenics movement gained support early in the 20th century as prominent physicians drew a direct link between heredity and public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLaren|1990|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugenics was enforced by law in two Canadian provinces. In [[Alberta]], the ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' was enacted in 1928, focusing the movement on the sterilization of [[mental deficiency|mentally deficient]] individuals, as determined by the [[Alberta Eugenics Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLaren|1990|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign to enforce this action was backed by groups such as the United Farm Women's Group, including key member [[Emily Murphy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sterilization Act has Much Backing'', Edmonton Journal (9 March 1928) 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in many other former [[British Empire]] colonies, eugenic policies were linked to racist (and racialist) agendas pursued by various levels of government, such as the [[Compulsory sterilization in Canada|forced sterilization of Canada's indigenous peoples]] and specific provincial government initiatives, such as [[Alberta Eugenics Board|Alberta's eugenics program]]. As a brief illustration, in 1928 the province of Alberta started an initiative, "…allowing any inmate of a native residential school to be sterilized upon the approval of the school Principal. At least 3,500 Indian women are sterilized under this law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadiangenocide.nativeweb.org/intro2.html|title=Hidden from History: The Canadian Holocaust – Chronology of Events|access-date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, research into extant archival records of [[Compulsory sterilization in Canada|sterilization]] and direct killing of [[First Nations in Canada|First Nations]] youth (through intentional transmission of disease and other means) under the residential school program is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Ottawa, churches playing hardball over residential school historical documents, TRC charges |url= http://aptn.ca/pages/news/2011/11/22/ottawa-churches-playing-hardball-over-residential-school-historical-documents-trc-charges/ |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120114075404/http://aptn.ca/pages/news/2011/11/22/ottawa-churches-playing-hardball-over-residential-school-historical-documents-trc-charges/ |archive-date= 14 January 2012 |publisher= Aboriginal Peoples Television Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals were assessed using [[IQ tests]] like the [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|Stanford-Binet]]. This posed a problem to new [[Immigration to Canada|immigrants arriving in Canada]], as many had not mastered the [[English language]], and often their scores denoted them as having impaired intellectual functioning. As a result, many of those sterilized under the ''Sexual Sterilization Act'' were immigrants who were unfairly categorized.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sterilization of Leilani Muir'' (film). Produced by the North West Center, National Film Board of Canada, 1996. Montreal, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; The province of [[British Columbia]] enacted its own ''Sexual Sterilization Act'' in 1933. As in Alberta, the British Columbia Eugenics Board could recommend the sterilization of those it considered to be suffering from "mental disease or mental deficiency".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLaren|1990|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not enforced by laws as it was in [[Western Canada|Canada's western provinces]], an obscenity trial in [[Great Depression in Canada|Depression]]-era [[Ontario]], can be seen as an example of the influence of eugenics in Ontario. [[Dorothea Palmer]], a nurse working for the Parents Information Bureau – a privately funded birth control organization based out of [[Kitchener, Ontario]] – was arrested in the predominantly Catholic community of [[Vanier, Ontario|Eastview, Ontario]] in 1936. She was accused of illegally providing birth control materials and knowledge to her clients, primarily poor women. The defense at her trial was mounted by an industrialist and influential eugenicist from Kitchener, [[Alvin Ratz Kaufman|A.R. Kaufman]]. Palmer was acquitted in early 1937. The trial lasted less than a year, and later became known as [[The Eastview Birth Control Trial]], demonstrating the influence of the eugenics lobby in Ontario.

The popularity of the eugenics movement peaked during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] when sterilization was widely seen as a way of relieving society of the financial burdens imposed by defective individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLaren|1990|pp=117–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the eugenics excesses of [[Nazi Germany]] diminished the popularity of the eugenics movement, the ''Sexual Sterilization Acts'' of Alberta and British Columbia were not repealed until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLaren|1990|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{Main|Nazi eugenics}}[[File:Alkoven Schloss Hartheim 2005-08-18 3589.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hartheim Euthanasia Centre]] in 2005]]

[[Nazi Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] was well known for eugenics programs which attempted to maintain a "pure" [[Aryan race]] through a series of programs that ran under the banner of [[racial hygiene]]. Among other activities, the Nazis performed extensive experimentation on live human beings to test their genetic theories, ranging from simple measurement of physical characteristics to the research for [[Otmar von Verschuer]] carried out by [[Karin Magnussen]] using "human material" gathered by [[Josef Mengele]] on twins and others at [[Auschwitz]] death camp.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miklós Nyiszli]], "Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account", Arcade Publishing, New York, 1960, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s and 1940s, the Nazi regime used [[forced sterilization]] on hundreds of thousands of people whom they viewed as mentally ill, an estimated 400,000 between 1934 and 1937. The scale of the Nazi program prompted one American eugenics advocate to seek an expansion of their program, with one complaining that "the Germans are beating us at our own game."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite journal |author=Selgelid, Michael J. |title=Neugenics? |journal=Monash Bioethics Review |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=9–33 |year=2000 |doi=10.1007/bf03351241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis went further, however, murdering tens of thousands of the institutionalized disabled through compulsory "[[euthanasia]]" programs such as [[Aktion T4]]. They used [[gas chamber]]s and lethal injections to murder their victims.&lt;ref&gt;The Nazi eugenics policies are discussed in a number of sources. A few of the more definitive ones are Robert Proctor, ''Racial hygiene: Medicine under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]], 1988) and Dieter Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine: creating the master race'' (Washington, DC: [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], 2004) ([http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/deadlymedicine/ online exhibit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026014306/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/deadlymedicine/ |date=2012-10-26 }}). On the development of the [[racial hygiene]] movement before National Socialism, see Paul Weindling, ''Health, race and German politics between national unification and Nazism, 1870–1945'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H13374, Philipp Bouhler.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Philipp Bouhler]], Head of the [[Aktion T4]] programme]]They also implemented a number of "positive" eugenics policies, giving awards to [[Aryan race|Aryan]] women who had large numbers of children and encouraged a service in which "racially pure" single women could deliver illegitimate children. Allegations that such women were also impregnated by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officers in the ''[[Lebensborn]]'' were not proven at the Nuremberg trials, but new evidence (and the testimony of Lebensborn children) has established more details about Lebensborn practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article626101.ece |title=Himmler was my godfather |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |access-date=2011-11-28}}{{dead link|date=September 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, "racially valuable" children from occupied countries were forcibly removed from their parents and adopted by German people. Many of their concerns for eugenics and racial hygiene were also explicitly present in their systematic murder of millions of "undesirable" people, especially [[Jew]]s who were singled out for the [[Final Solution]], this policy led to the horrors seen in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269548/Holocaust "Holocaust", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2009]: "the systematic state-sponsored killing of six million Jewish men, women, and children and millions of others by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during World War II ... The Nazis also singled out the Roma (Gypsies). They were the only other group that the Nazis systematically killed in gas chambers alongside the Jews."&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope and coercion involved in the German eugenics programs along with a strong use of the rhetoric of eugenics and so-called "racial science" throughout the regime created an indelible cultural association between eugenics and the [[Third Reich]] in the post-war years.&lt;ref&gt;See Proctor, ''Racial hygiene'', and Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of eugenics and race were used, in part, as justification for German colonial expansion throughout the world. Germany, as well as Great Britain, sought to seize the colonial territories of other 'dying' empires which could no longer protect their possessions. Examples included China, the Portuguese Empire, the [[Spanish Empire]], the [[Dutch Empire]] and the [[Danish colonial empire|Danish Empire]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus the colonies Germany required for her bursting population, as markets for her overproductive industries and sources of vital raw materials, and as symbols of her world power would simply have to be taken from weaker nations, so the pan-Germans asserted publicly and the German government believed secretly.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, "The Samoan Tangle: A Study in Anglo-German-American Relations, 1878–1900", Harper &amp; Row, 1974, pp. 124–125, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Granted that the book was used to strengthen Britain's position vis-a-vis Germany, it must however be borne in mind that the bulk of the evidence contained in the 'Blue Book' is little more than the literal translation of German texts published at the time which were the findings of a German commission of inquiry into the effects of corporal punishment." Thus, when the Blue Book was withdrawn from the public after Germany and England came to an agreement about how to share access to GSWA minerals, this was not censorship; it was just business.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[German colonies in Africa]] from 1885 to 1918 included [[German South-West Africa]] (present-day [[Namibia]]), [[Kamerun]] (present-day [[Cameroon]]), [[Togoland]] (present-day [[Togo]]) and [[German East Africa]] (present-day [[Tanzania]]. [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]). [[Genocide]] was carried out there, against the [[Herero people|Herero]] people of present-day Namibia and later a programme of research in physical anthropology was conducted using their skulls.

The rulers of German South West Africa carried out a programme of genocide against the aboriginal Herero people. One of the officials enacting this program was General [[Adrian Dietrich Lothar von Trotha]].

The 1918 British "Bluebook" documented the genocide that took place at [[Shark Island Concentration Camp|Shark Island]] and [[Windhoek Concentration Camp]]s, including photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ezakwantu.com/Gallery%20Herero%20and%20Namaqua%20Genocide.htm |title=Herero and Namaqua Genocide – Herero Genocide Nama Genocide |publisher=Ezakwantu.com |date=1905-09-28 |access-date=2011-11-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209033514/http://www.ezakwantu.com/Gallery%20Herero%20and%20Namaqua%20Genocide.htm |archive-date=2011-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bluebook was used as a negotiating tool by the British at the end of World War I to gain control of what had been German Southwest Africa, after Germany was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;"Words Cannot Be Found: German Colonial Rule in Namibia: An Annotated Reprint of the 1918 Blue Book", Brill Academic Pub., June 1, 2003. {{ISBN|90-04-12981-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skulls of the Herero were collected from [[Rehoboth, Namibia]] in about 1904, for the purpose of demonstrating the supposed physical inferiority of these people. The [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] used the Herero skulls by 1928.&lt;ref&gt;(See citations and photographs at [[Eugen Fischer#Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics|Eugen Fischer]] and [[Shark Island Extermination Camp#Medical experimentation|Shark Island Extermination Camp]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical anthropologists used measurements of skull capacity, etc., in an attempt to prove that Jews, Blacks and Italians were inherently "inferior" to Whites.

Rita Hauschild, a doctoral student and then staff member of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Human Heredity, Anthropology, and Eugenics, carried out "[[bastard studies]]", anthropometric studies of mixed-heritage populations in [[Trinidad]] and [[Venezuela]], in pursuit of the Nazi doctrine of "racial hygiene". Her research was at first confined to [[Colonia Tovar|Tovar]], [[Venezuela]], a former German colony, and was extended to [[Trinidad]] with support from the [[Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office|UK Foreign Office]]. The populations studied, in 1935 to 1937, were "Chinese-Negro hybrids" in Trinidad, "Chinese-Indian" and "Chinese-Negro" "hybrids" in Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmuhl|first=Hans-Walter|title=The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics, 1927—1945|url=https://archive.org/details/kaiserwilhelmins00schm|url-access=registration|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Houten, Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-6600-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/kaiserwilhelmins00schm/page/n183 171] and n.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Johannes Schaeuble engaged in "bastard studies" in Chile.

In the early part of the [[Shōwa era]], Japanese governments executed a eugenics policy to limit the birth of children with "inferior" traits, as well as aiming to protect the life and health of mothers.&lt;ref&gt;"The National Eugenic Law" The 107th law that Japanese Government promulgated in 1940　(国民優生法) 第一条　本法ハ悪質ナル遺伝性疾患ノ素質ヲ有スル者ノ増加ヲ防遏スルト共ニ健全ナル素質ヲ有スル者ノ増加ヲ図リ以テ国民素質ノ向上ヲ期スルコトヲ目的トス, Kimura, Jurisprudence in Genetics, [http://www.bioethics.jp/licht_genetics.html Bioethics.jp]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Race Eugenic Protection Law'' was submitted from 1934 to 1938 to the [[Imperial Diet (Japan)|Imperial Diet]].

The ''Leprosy Prevention laws'' of 1907, 1931 and 1953, the last one only repealed in 1996, permitted the segregation of patients in sanitariums where [[forced abortion]]s and [[forced sterilization|sterilization]] were common, even if the laws did not refer to it, and authorized punishment of patients "disturbing peace", as most Japanese leprologists believed that vulnerability to the disease was inheritable.&lt;ref&gt;Michio Miyasaka, ''A Historical and Ethical Analysis of Leprosy Control Policy in Japan'', [http://www.clg.niigata-u.ac.jp/~miyasaka/hansen/leprosypolicy.html clg.niigata-u.ac.jp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113060946/http://www.clg.niigata-u.ac.jp/~miyasaka/hansen/leprosypolicy.html |date=2011-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were a few Japanese leprologists such as Noburo Ogasawara who argued against the "isolation-sterilization policy" but he was denounced as a traitor to the nation at the 15th conference of the Japanese Association of Leprology in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clg.niigata-u.ac.jp/~miyasaka/hansen/leprosypolicy.html |title=Michio Miyasaka |publisher=Clg.niigata-u.ac.jp |access-date=2011-11-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113060946/http://www.clg.niigata-u.ac.jp/~miyasaka/hansen/leprosypolicy.html |archive-date=2011-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the last eugenic measures of the Shōwa regime was taken by the [[Naruhiko Higashikuni|Higashikuni]] government. On 19 August 1945, the [[Home Ministry]] ordered local government offices to establish a [[prostitution]] service for [[Occupation of Japan|Allied occupation soldiers]] to preserve the "purity" of the "Japanese race". The official declaration stated: "Through the sacrifice of thousands of "Okichis" of the [[Shōwa era]], we shall construct a [[wikt:dike|dike]] to hold back the mad frenzy of the occupation troops and cultivate and preserve the purity of our race long into the future..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan]]'', 2001, p. 538, citing Kinkabara Samon and Takemae Eiji, ''Showashi : kokumin non naka no haran to gekido no hanseiki-zohoban'', 1989, p.244.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korea===

Early in the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese administration of Korea]], staff at the Japanese Association of Leprology attempted to discourage marriage between Japanese women and Korean men who had been recruited from the peninsula as laborers following its annexation by Japan in 1910. In 1942, a survey report argued that "the Korean laborers brought to Japan... are of the lower classes and therefore of inferior constitution...By fathering children with Japanese women, these men could lower the caliber of the [[Yamato people|Yamato minzoku]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robertson  |first=Jennifer |date=2002 |title=Blood talks: Eugenic modernity and the creation of new Japanese |journal=History and Anthropology |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=191–216 |doi= 10.1080/0275720022000025547|pmid=19499628 |s2cid=41340161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, eugenics pioneer Unno Kōtoku of [[Ryukyu University]] influentially argued based on [[heterosis]] in plants that exclusive Japanese [[endogamy]] might cause "degeneration" of the Japanese race. Since he regarded intermarriage with white or black people as "disastrous", he advocated intermarriage with [[Koreans|Korean]]s, whose "inferior" physical characteristics would be subsumed by the "superior" Japanese, according to his thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=An Island Nation of Pure Blood|title=A Genealogy of 'Japanese' Self-Images|first=Eiji|last=Oguma|author-link1=Eiji Oguma|publisher=Trans Pacific Press|year=2002|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese-Korean intermarriage was promoted by the government in Korea using [[serological]] studies that claimed to prove that Japanese and Koreans had the same pure ancestral origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Struggle for National Survival: Eugenics in the Second Sino-Japanese War and Population Policies|first=Juliette|last=Chung|title=Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Jensen|editor2-first=Jon|editor2-last=Davidann|editor3-first=Yoneyuki|editor3-last=Sugita|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2003|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Eugenics was one of many ideas and programs debated in the 1920s and 1930s in [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republican China]], as a means of improving society and raising China's stature in the world.  The principal Chinese proponent of eugenics was the prominent sociologist [[Pan Guangdan]], and a significant number of intellectuals entered into the debate, including [[Gao Xisheng]], biologist [[Zhou Jianren]], sociologist [[Chen Da (sociologist)|Chen Da]], and [[Chen Jianshan]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dikotter|first=Frank|title=Imperfect Conceptions: Medical Knowledge, Birth Defects, and Eugenics in China|year=1998|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-11370-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dikotter|first=Frank|title=The Discourse of race in modern China|year=1992|publisher=C.

The [[Beijing Genomics Institute]] does whole genome sequencing of very high IQ individuals around the world.

===Other countries===
Other countries that adopted some form of eugenics program at one time include [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], and [[Switzerland]] with programs to sterilize people the government declared to be mentally deficient.&lt;ref&gt;There are a number of works discussing eugenics in various countries around the world. For the history of eugenics in Scandinavia, see [[Gunnar Broberg]] and [[Nils Roll-Hansen]], eds., ''Eugenics And the Welfare State: Sterilization Policy in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland'' (Michigan State University Press, 2005). Another international approach is Mark B. Adams, ed., ''The Wellborn Science: Eugenics in Germany, France, Brazil, and Russia'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; In Denmark, the first eugenics law was passed in 1926, under the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]], with more legislation being passed in 1932. Though the sterilization was initially voluntary (at least theoretically), the law passed in 1932 allowed for involuntary sterilization of some groups.&lt;ref&gt;And Norway passed a law allowing forced sterilization in 1934, under the Liberals. {{Cite book|title=Eugenics and the welfare state : sterilization policy in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland|date=2005|publisher=Michigan State University Press|author1=Roll-Hansen, Nils |author2=Broberg, Gunnar|isbn=978-1-60917-002-8|location=East Lansing|pages=32, 40|oclc=933516327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marginalization after World War II and crypto-eugenics===
[[File:Eugenics Quarterly to Social Biology.jpg|right|thumb|300px|In the decades after [[World War II]], eugenics became increasingly unpopular within academic science. Many organizations and journals that had their origins in the eugenics movement began to distance themselves from the philosophy, as when ''Eugenics Quarterly'' became ''Social Biology'' in 1969.]]

Beginning in the late 1920s, greater appreciation of the difficulty of predicting characteristics of offspring from their heredity, and scientists' recognition of the inadequacy of simplistic theories of eugenics, undermined whatever scientific basis had been ascribed to the social movement. As the [[Great Depression]] took hold, criticism of economic value as a proxy for human worth became increasingly compelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = CSHL Press | isbn = 9780879695873 | last = Carlson | first = Elof Axel | pages = 337–356 | title = The Unfit: A History of a Bad Idea | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the experience of Nazi Germany, many ideas about "racial hygiene" and "unfit" members of society were discredited.{{sfn|Kevles|1985|p={{pn|date=May 2024}}}} The [[Nuremberg Trials]] against former Nazi leaders revealed to the world many of the regime's genocidal practices and resulted in formalized policies of medical ethics and the 1950 [[UNESCO]] statement on race. Many scientific societies released their own similar "race statements" over the years, and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], developed in response to abuses during the Second World War, was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1948 and affirmed, "Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/eng.htm | title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights | access-date=2006-08-26 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060824210743/http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/eng.htm  |archive-date = 2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In continuation, the 1978 [[UNESCO]] declaration on race and racial prejudice states that the fundamental equality of all human beings is the ideal toward which ethics and science should converge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_prejud.htm | title=Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice | access-date=2006-08-26 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060706124402/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_prejud.htm  |archive-date = 2006-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to Nazi abuses, eugenics became almost universally reviled in many of the nations where it had once been popular (however, some eugenics programs, including sterilization, continued quietly for decades). Many pre-war eugenicists engaged in what they later labeled "crypto-eugenics", purposefully taking their eugenic beliefs "underground" and becoming respected anthropologists, biologists and geneticists in the postwar world (including [[Robert Yerkes]] in the U.S. and [[Otmar von Verschuer]] in Germany).{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} Californian eugenicist [[Paul Popenoe]] founded [[marriage counseling]] during the 1950s, a career change which grew from his eugenic interests in promoting "healthy marriages" between "fit" couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barkan|1992}} discusses the general changes in views towards genetics and race after World War II&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source needed|reason=The reference is incomplete and unclear.|date=May 2016}}

In 1957, a special meeting of Britain's Eugenics Society discussed ways to stem losses in membership, including the suggestion "that the Society should pursue eugenic ends by less obvious means, that is by a policy of crypto-eugenics, which was apparently proving successful with the US Eugenics Society". In February 1960 the Council resolved to pursue "activities in crypto-eugenics...vigorously" and "specifically" to increase payments to the [[Family Planning Association]] and the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]]. The subsequent sale of a birth-control clinic (the bequest of Dr [[Marie Stopes]]) to Dr [[Tim Black]] and the change of Society's name to [[Galton Institute]] (on the grounds that it was "less evocative") align with the Society's crypto-eugenic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Activities of the Eugenics Society |journal=Eugenics Review |date=September 1968 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=142–161 |pmc=2906074 |last1=Schenk |first1=F. |last2=Parkes |first2=A. S. |pmid=5710957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Life League]], an opponent of abortion, charges that eugenics was merely "re-packaged" after the war, and promoted anew in the guise of the population-control and environmentalism movements. They claim, for example, that [[Planned Parenthood]] was funded and cultivated by the Eugenics Society for these reasons. [[Julian Huxley]], the first Director-General of [[UNESCO]] and a founder of the [[World Wildlife Fund]], was also a Eugenics Society president and a strong supporter of eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;American Bioethics Advisory Commission, [http://www.all.org/abac/eugen02.htm "Eugenics"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517043304/http://www.all.org/abac/eugen02.htm |date=May 17, 2013 }}, ABAC website&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]ven though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable. --Julian Huxley&lt;ref&gt;''UNESCO: Its Purpose and its Philosophy'' (Washington D.C. 1947), cited in Liagin, Excessive Force: Power Politics and Population Control, at 85 (Washington, D.C.: Information Project for Africa 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

High school and college textbooks from the 1920s through the 1940s often had chapters touting the scientific progress to be had from applying eugenic principles to the population. Many early scientific journals devoted to heredity in general were run by eugenicists and featured eugenics articles alongside studies of heredity in nonhuman organisms.  Even the names of some journals changed to reflect new attitudes. For example, ''Eugenics Quarterly'' became ''Social Biology'' in 1969 (the journal still exists today, though it looks little like its predecessor). Notable members of the [[American Eugenics Society]] (1922–94) during the second half of the 20th century included [[Joseph Fletcher]], originator of [[Situational ethics]]; [[Clarence Gamble]] of the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] fortune; and [[Garrett Hardin]], a [[population control]] advocate and author of the essay ''[[Tragedy of the Commons|The Tragedy of the Commons]]''.

In the United States, the eugenics movement had largely lost most popular and political support by the end of the 1930s, while forced sterilizations mostly ended in the 1960s with the last performed in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;See Broberg and Nil-Hansen, ed., ''Eugenics And the Welfare State'' and Alexandra Stern, ''Eugenic nation: faults and frontiers of better breeding in modern America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Many US states continued to prohibit biracial marriages with "anti-miscegenation laws" such as Virginia's [[Racial Integrity Act]] of 1924, until they were overruled by the Supreme Court in 1967 in [[Loving v. Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay_7_fs.html |title=Essay 7: Marriage Laws |access-date=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Immigration Act of 1924|Immigration Restriction Act]] of 1924, which was designed to limit the immigration of "dysgenic" [[Italians]], and [[Eastern European Jewry|eastern European Jews]], was repealed and replaced by the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay_9_fs.html |title=Essay 9: Immigration Restriction |access-date=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some prominent academics continued to support eugenics after the war. In 1963 the [[Ciba Foundation]] convened a conference in London under the title "Man and His Future", at which three distinguished biologists and Nobel laureates ([[Hermann Joseph Muller|Hermann Muller]], [[Joshua Lederberg]], and [[Francis Crick]]) all spoke strongly in favor of eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Glad|Glad, John]]: "Future Human Evolution: Eugenics in the Twenty-First Century", Hermitage Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2023|reason=[[John Glad]]'s views were fringe and Hermitage Publishers appears tiny and mostly focuses on Russian Literature}} A few nations, notably the Canadian province of [[Alberta]], maintained large-scale eugenics programs, including forced sterilization of mentally handicapped individuals, as well as other practices, until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Emily |title=Regulating Reproduction|url=https://archive.org/details/regulatingreprod00jack|url-access=registration|publisher=Hart|location=Oxford, England|date=October 2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/regulatingreprod00jack/page/n68 45]|isbn=978-1-84113-054-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern eugenics, genetic engineering, and ethical re-evaluation==
Beginning in the 1980s, the history and concept of eugenics were widely discussed as knowledge about [[genetics]] advanced significantly, making practical [[genetic engineering]], which has been widely used to produce [[genetically modified organism]]s, with [[genetically modified food]]s being most visible to the general public. Endeavors such as the [[Human Genome Project]] made the effective modification of the human species seem possible again (as did Darwin's initial theory of evolution in the 1860s, along with the rediscovery of [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendel's laws]] in the early 20th century).  Article 23 of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] prohibits compulsory sterilization of disabled individuals and guarantees their right to adopt children.

A few scientific researchers such as psychologist [[Richard Lynn]], psychologist [[Raymond Cattell]], and scientist [[Gregory Stock]] have openly called for eugenic policies using modern technology, but they represent a minority opinion in current scientific and cultural circles.&lt;ref&gt;See, i.e., [[Richard Lynn]], ''Eugenics: A Reassessment (Human Evolution, Behavior, and Intelligence)'' (Praeger Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; One attempted implementation of a form of eugenics was a "[[Repository for Germinal Choice|genius sperm bank]]" (1980–99) created by [[Robert Klark Graham]], from which nearly 230 children were conceived (the best-known donors were [[Nobel Prize]] winners [[William Shockley]] and [[James D. Watson|J. D. Watson]]). After Graham died in 1997 funding ran out, and within two years his sperm bank had closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bellows|first=Alan|title=Eugenics and You|url=http://www.damninteresting.com/eugenics-and-you/|work=Damn Interesting|publisher=Alan Bellows|access-date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Herrnstein|Richard J. Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]]'s book ''The Bell Curve'' argued that immigration from countries with low [[national IQ]] is undesirable. According to [[Raymond Cattell]], "when a country is opening its doors to immigration from diverse countries, it is like a farmer who buys his seeds from different sources by the sack, with sacks of different average quality of contents".&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, R. B. (1987). Beyondism: Religion from science. New York: Praeger, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980 law dropped all specific conditions bar leprosy, and the 2001 law now specifies no conditions, simply approval by a medical doctor.&lt;ref name="ssm"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3dGGnbVKIYC&amp;pg=PA70|pages=70–1|isbn=978-0-415-37632-7|title=Sex, Science and Morality in China|author=Joanna McMillan|publisher=Routledge|date=2006-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various provinces began to pass laws barring certain classes of people, such as the mentally delayed, from reproducing in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="ssm"/&gt; The Chinese Maternal and Infant Health Care Law (1994), which has been referred to as the "Eugenic Law" in the West, required a health check prior to marriage. Carriers of certain genetic diseases were allowed to marry only if they are sterilized, or agree to use some other form of long-term contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bobrow M |title=Redrafted Chinese law remains eugenic |journal=J.

Local medical doctors make the decision on who is "unfit" to marry.&lt;ref name="ssm"/&gt; Much Western comment on the law has been critical, but many Chinese geneticists are supportive of the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mao X |title=Chinese eugenic legislation |journal=Lancet |volume=349 |issue=9045 |pages=139 |date=January 1997 |pmid=8996454 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)60930-0 |s2cid=40418228 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Chinese province of [[Sichuan]] in 1999, a sperm bank called Notables' Sperm Bank opened, with professors as the only permitted donors. The semen bank was approved by the authority for family planning in the provincial capital [[Chengdu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Xinhua|Xinhua News Agency]]: [http://www.people.com.cn/english/199906/25/chnmedia.html ''China's 1st Notables' Sperm Bank Opens.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020044114/http://www.people.com.cn/english/199906/25/chnmedia.html |date=2012-10-20 }} 24. June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Japan===
In [[Post-occupation Japan|postwar Japan]], the {{nihongo|'''Eugenic Protection Law'''|[[:ja:優生保護法]]|Yusei Hogo Hō}} was enacted in 1948 to replace the National Eugenic Law of 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, ''Postwar Japan as History'', pp.306&lt;/ref&gt; The main provisions allowed for the surgical sterilization of women, when the woman, her spouse, or family member within the 4th degree of kinship had a serious [[genetic disorder]], and where pregnancy would endanger the life of the woman. The operation required consent of the woman, her spouse and the approval of the Prefectural Eugenic Protection Council.&lt;ref name="Sugimoto pp.167"&gt;Sugimoto, An Introduction to Japanese Society, pp.167&lt;/ref&gt;

The law also allowed for [[Abortion in Japan|abortion for pregnancies]] in the cases of [[rape]], [[Leprosy in Japan|leprosy]], [[Genetic disorder|hereditary-transmitted disease]], or if the physician determined that the fetus would not be viable outside of the womb. Again, the consent of the woman and her spouse were necessary. [[Birth control]] guidance and implementation was restricted to doctors, nurses and professional [[midwife|midwive]]s accredited by the Prefectural government. The law was also amended in May 1949 to allow abortions for economic reasons at the sole discretion of the doctor, which in effect fully legalized abortion in Japan.&lt;ref name="Sugimoto pp.167"/&gt;

Although the law's wording is unambiguous, it was used by local authorities as justification for measures enforcing [[compulsory sterilization|forced sterilization]] and abortions upon people with certain [[genetic disorder]]s, as well as [[leprosy]], as well as an excuse for legalized discrimination against people with physical and mental handicaps.&lt;ref name=formerhansen&gt;{{cite web

===Modern Russia===
In Russia, one supporter of preventive eugenics is the president of the [[Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia]] [[Yuri Savenko]], who justifies [[forced sterilization]] of women, which is practiced in Moscow psychoneurological nursing homes. He states that “one needs a more strictly adjusted and open control for the practice of preventive eugenics, which, in itself, is, in its turn, justifiable.”&lt;ref name="Лишённые"&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Лишённые наследства.

===Israel===
{{Main|Dor Yeshorim|Medical genetics of Jewish people}}

Dor Yeshorim, a program which seeks to reduce the incidence of [[Tay–Sachs disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[Canavan disease]], [[Fanconi anemia]], [[familial dysautonomia]], [[glycogen storage disease]], [[Bloom Syndrome]], [[Gaucher disease]], [[Niemann-Pick disease]], and [[mucolipidosis IV]] among certain [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish communities]], is another screening program which has drawn comparisons with [[liberal eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shidduchim.info/medical.html |title=Shidduchim.info |publisher=Shidduchim.info |access-date=2011-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006103447/http://www.shidduchim.info/medical.html |archive-date=2011-10-06 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Israel]], at the expense of the state, the general public is advised to carry out genetic tests to diagnose these diseases early in the pregnancy. If a fetus is diagnosed with one of these diseases, among which Tay–Sachs is the most commonly known, the pregnancy may be terminated, subject to consent.

Most other [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish communities also run screening programs because of the higher incidence of genetic diseases. In some Jewish communities, the ancient custom of matchmaking ([[shidduch]]) is still practiced, and some matchmakers require blood tests so that they can avoid making matches between individuals who share the same recessive disease traits. In order to attempt to prevent the tragedy of infant death which always results from being [[homozygous]] for Tay–Sachs, associations such as the strongly observant Dor Yeshorim (which was founded by Rabbi Joseph Ekstein, who lost four children to the disease) with the purpose of preventing others from suffering the same tragedy test young couples to check whether they carry a risk of passing on fatal conditions.

If both the young man and woman are Tay–Sachs carriers, it is common for the match to be broken off. Judaism,{{dubious|date=October 2011}} like numerous other religions, discourages abortion unless there is a risk to the woman, in which case her needs take precedence. The effort is not aimed at eradicating the hereditary traits, but rather at the occurrence of homozygosity. The actual impact of this program on [[allele]] frequencies is unknown, but little impact would be expected because the program does not impose genetic selection. Instead, it encourages [[disassortative mating]].

===Ethical re-assessment===
Modern inquiries into the potential use of genetic engineering have led to an increased invocation of the history of eugenics in discussions of [[bioethics]], most often as a cautionary tale. Some suggest that even non-coercive eugenics programs would be inherently unethical.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Bill McKibben]], ''Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age'' (Owl, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged by such [[bioethics|bioethicist]] critics as [[Nicholas Agar]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Nicholas Agar]], ''Liberal Eugenics: In Defence of Human Enhancement'' (Blackwell, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern bioethics literature, the history of eugenics presents many moral and ethical questions. Supporters of eugenics programs note that [[Francis Galton]] did not advocate coercion when he defined the principles of eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Allen |author2=Dan W. Brock |author3=Norman Daniels |author4=Daniel Wikler |title=From Chance to Choice|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2001|chapter=Violations of reproductive freedoms|isbn=978-0-521-66977-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Galton's definition, eugenics is the proper label for bioengineering of better human beings, whether coercive or not.

An example of such individual motivations includes parents attempting to prevent homosexuality in their children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/peggy-drexler/when-gay-comes-home_b_227347.html|title=When Gay Comes Home|last=Drexler|first=Peggy|date=2009-07-07|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite lack of evidence of a [[Biology and Homosexuality|single genetic cause of homosexuality]]. The scientific consensus in America, which stems from the 1956 research of [[Evelyn Hooker]], is that homosexuality, in any case, is not a disorder. Therefore, it cannot be treated as a defective trait that is justifiably screened for as part of legitimate medical practice.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Daniel Kevles]] argues that eugenics and the conservation of natural resources are similar propositions. Both can be practiced foolishly so as to abuse individual rights, but both can be practiced wisely. [[James D. Watson]], the first director of the [[Human Genome Project]], initiated the ''Ethical, Legal and Social Implications Program'' (ELSI) which has funded a number of studies into the implications of human genetic engineering (along with a prominent website on the history of eugenics), because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In putting ethics so soon into the genome agenda, I was responding to my own personal fear that all too soon critics of the Genome Project would point out that I was a representative of the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] that once housed the controversial [[Eugenics Record Office]]. My not forming a genome ethics program quickly might be falsely used as evidence that I was a closet eugenicist, having as my real long-term purpose the unambiguous identification of genes that lead to social and occupational stratification as well as genes justifying racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watson |first=James D. |author-link=James D.

Which ideas should be described as "eugenic" are still controversial in both public and scholarly spheres. Some observers such as [[Philip Kitcher]] have described the use of genetic screening by parents as making possible a form of "voluntary" eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kitcher |first=Philip |author-link=Philip Kitcher |title=The Lives to Come |publisher=Penguin |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-14-024490-8 }}.

In 2006, [[Richard Dawkins]] stated that breeding humans for traits is possible and society should not be afraid to debate the ethical differences between breeding a child for an ability versus forcing a child to gain an ability through training.&lt;ref&gt;From the Afterword, by Richard Dawkins, The Herald, (2006). http://www.heraldscotland.com/from-the-afterword-1.836155 Retrieved on Oct 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathaniel C. Comfort]], Professor at the Institute of the History of Medicine at the [[Johns Hopkins University]], published in his 2012 book, ''The Science of Human Perfection: How Genes Became the Heart of American Medicine'', "The eugenic impulse drives us to eliminate disease, live longer and healthier, with greater intelligence, and a better adjustment to the conditions of society." Comfort claims that the question is not whether this eugenic impulse should exist or even whether the modern genetic movement should be called eugenics because these things "just are". Additionally, Dr Nathaniel Comfort claims, "the health benefits, the intellectual thrill and the profits of genetic biomedicine are too great for us to do otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;The Eugenics Impulse, The Chronicle Review, By Nathaniel Comfort. 12 November 2012. http://chronicle.com/article/The-Eugenic-Impulse/135612/ Retrieved on 9.

In a co-authored publication by Keele University, they stated that "[e]ugenics doesn't seem always to be immoral, and so the fact that [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|PGD]], and other forms of selective reproduction, might sometimes technically be eugenic, isn't sufficient to show that they’re wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Eugenics and the Ethics of Selective Reproduction, Stephen and Eve Garrard, published by Keele University 2013. http://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/ri/risocsci/eugenics2013/Eugenics%20and%20the%20ethics%20of%20selective%20reproduction%20Low%20Res.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018020007/http://www.keele.ac.uk/media/keeleuniversity/ri/risocsci/eugenics2013/Eugenics%20and%20the%20ethics%20of%20selective%20reproduction%20Low%20Res.pdf |date=2013-10-18 }} Retrieved on September 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] claims that 21st-century Chinese eugenics may allow the Chinese to increase the IQ of each subsequent generation by five to fifteen IQ points, and after a couple generations it "would be game over for Western global competitiveness." Miller recommends that we put aside our "self-righteous" Euro-American ideological biases and learn from the Chinese.&lt;ref name="edge.org"/&gt;

[[Jon Entine]] claims that new eugenics is not something that should be restricted lightly because it is driven by a motivation for ourselves and our children to be "healthy, intelligent, and fit," and it is not driven by "draconian top-down measures" or a "desire to improve the species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Entine | first=Jon | title=Let's (Cautiously) Celebrate the 'New Eugenics' |newspaper=HuffPost | date=6 December 2017|orig-date=Originally pubclished 30 October 2014 | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lets-cautiously-celebrate_b_6070462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill McKibben]], for example, suggests that emerging reprogenetic technologies would be disproportionately available to those with greater financial resources, thereby exacerbating the gap between rich and poor and creating a "genetic divide".&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=McKibben, Bill|title=Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age|publisher=Times Books|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8050-7096-5|author-link=Bill McKibben}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee M.
