The '''Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace''' was the name given for a conference convened by the United Nations during 4–15 September 1995 in [[Beijing]], China.&lt;ref name=UKcommis&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fourth United Nation's Conference on Women in Beijing 1995|url=http://wnc.equalities.gov.uk/work-of-the-wnc/international-articles/beijing-platform/162-beijing-platform-for-action.html|publisher=Women's National Commission (UK)|access-date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this conference, governments from around the world agreed on a comprehensive plan to achieve global [[equality before the law|legal equality]], known as the Beijing Platform for Action.

== Background ==
[[File:UN charter logo.png|thumb|alt=|UN charter logo]]
The [[United Nations Charter|founding United Nations charter (1945)]] included a provision for equality between men and women ([[Chapter III of the United Nations Charter#Article 8|chapter III, article 8]]). Subsequently, from 1945 to 1975 various female officials within the United Nations and leaders of women's movements on the global stage attempted to turn these principles into action. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed a resolution ([[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3010|resolution 3010]]) that 1975 should be [[International Women's Year]]. In December 1975, the UN General Assembly passed a further resolution ([[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/136|resolution 31/136]]) that 1976–1985 should be the "Decade of Women".&lt;ref name="O'Barr"&gt;{{Citation | last = O'Barr | first = Jean F. | contribution = United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, China (1995) – "Global Framework" of the Platform for Action | editor1-last = DeLamotte | editor1-first = Eugenia | editor2-last = Meeker | editor2-first = Natania | editor3-last = O'Barr | editor3-first = Jean F. | pages = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780415915311/page/502 502–510] | title = Women imagine change: a global anthology of women's resistance from 600 B.C.E. to present | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415915311 | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780415915311/page/502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beijing Platform for Action ===
A summary of the Beijing Platform for Action&lt;ref name=Platform&gt;{{cite web|title=Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, China – September 1995 Action for Equality, Development and Peace – Platform for Action|url=https://www.un.org/esa/gopher-data/conf/fwcw/off/a--20.en|publisher=United Nations|access-date=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is given below:

{{Blockquote|

==== Mission statement ====
1. The Platform for Action is an agenda for women's [[empowerment]]. It aims at accelerating the implementation of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and at removing all the obstacles to women's active participation in all spheres of public and private life through a full and equal share in economic, social, cultural and political [[decision-making]]. This means that the principle of shared power and responsibility should be established between women and men at home, in the workplace and in the wider national and international communities. [[gender equality|Equality between women and men]] is a matter of human rights and a condition for social justice and is also a necessary and fundamental prerequisite for equality, development and peace. A transformed partnership based on equality between women and men is a condition for people-centred sustainable development. A sustained and long-term commitment is essential, so that women and men can work together for themselves, for their children and for society to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.

2. The Platform for Action reaffirms the fundamental principle set forth in the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], adopted by the [[World Conference on Human Rights]], that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. As an agenda for action, the Platform seeks to promote and protect the full enjoyment of all human rights and the fundamental freedoms of all women throughout their life cycle.

3. The Platform for Action emphasizes that women share common concerns that can be addressed only by working together and in partnership with men towards the common goal of gender&lt;ref group=note&gt;For the commonly understood meaning of the term "gender", see annex IV below.&lt;/ref&gt; equality around the world. It respects and values the full diversity of women's situations and conditions and recognizes that some women face particular barriers to their empowerment.

4. The Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful, just and humane world based on human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life, and to this end, recognizes that broad- based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice.

5. The success of the Platform for Action will require a strong commitment on the part of Governments, international organizations and institutions at all levels. It will also require adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries from all available funding mechanisms, including multilateral, bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women; financial resources to strengthen the capacity of national, subregional, regional and international institutions; a commitment to equal rights, equal responsibilities and equal opportunities and to the equal participation of women and men in all national, regional and international bodies and policy- making processes; and the establishment or strengthening of mechanisms at all levels for accountability to the world's women.

''Annex IV''&lt;ref name=AnnexIV&gt;{{cite web|title=Annex IV|url=https://www.un.org/esa/gopher-data/conf/fwcw/off/a-20a1.en|publisher=United Nations|access-date=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Statement by the president of the conference on the commonly understood meaning of the term "gender".'''''

''1.   During the 19th meeting of the Commission on the Status of Women, acting as preparatory body for the Fourth World Conference on Women, an issue arose concerning the meaning of the word "gender" in the context of the Platform for Action of the Conference.  In order to examine the matter, the Commission decided to form a contact group in New York, with the Commission's Rapporteur, Ms. Selma Ashipala (Namibia), as Chairperson.  The Commission mandated the informal contact group to seek agreement on the commonly understood meaning of "gender" in the context of the Platform for Action and to report directly to the Conference in Beijing.''

''2.   Having considered the issue thoroughly, the contact group noted that:''
:(1) ''the word "gender" had been commonly used and understood in its ordinary, generally accepted usage in numerous other United Nations forums and conferences;''
:(2) ''there was no indication that any new meaning or connotation of the term, different from accepted prior usage, was intended in the Platform for Action.''

''3.   Accordingly, the contact group reaffirmed that the word "gender" as used in the Platform for Action was intended to be interpreted and understood as it was in ordinary, generally accepted usage.  The contact group also agreed that the present report should be read by the President of the Conference as a president's statement and that the statement should be part of the final report of the Conference.''

==== Critical areas of concern ====
41. The advancement of women and the achievement of equality between women and men are a matter of human rights and a condition for social justice and should not be seen in isolation as a women's issue. They are the only way to build a sustainable, just and developed society. Empowerment of women and equality between women and men are prerequisites for achieving political, social, economic, cultural and environmental security among all peoples.

42. Most of the goals set out in the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women have not been achieved. Barriers to women's empowerment remain, despite the efforts of Governments, as well as non-governmental organizations and women and men everywhere. Vast political, economic and ecological crises persist in many parts of the world. Among them are wars of aggression, armed conflicts, colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation, civil wars and terrorism. These situations, combined with systematic or de facto discrimination, violations of and failure to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms of all women, and their civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, including the right to development and ingrained prejudicial attitudes towards women and girls are but a few of the impediments encountered since the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality, Development and Peace, in 1985.

43. A review of progress since the Nairobi Conference highlights special concerns – areas of particular urgency that stand out as priorities for action. All actors should focus action and resources on the strategic objectives relating to the critical areas of concern which are, necessarily, interrelated, interdependent and of high priority. There is a need for these actors to develop and implement mechanisms of accountability for all the areas of concern.

44. To this end, Governments, the international community and civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the private sector, are called upon to take strategic action in the following critical areas of concern:
* The persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women
* Inequalities and inadequacies in and unequal access to education and training
* Inequalities and inadequacies in and unequal access to health care and related services
* Violence against women
* The effects of armed or other kinds of conflict on women, including those living under foreign occupation
* Inequality in economic structures and policies, in all forms of productive activities and in access to resources
* Inequality between men and women in the sharing of power and decision-making at all levels
* Insufficient mechanisms at all levels to promote the advancement of women
* Lack of respect for and inadequate promotion and protection of the human rights of women
* Stereotyping of women and inequality in women's access to and participation in all communication systems, especially in the media
* Gender inequalities in the management of natural resources and in the safeguarding of the environment
* Persistent discrimination against and violation of the rights of the girl child

==== Strategic objectives and actions ====
45. In each critical area of concern, the problem is diagnosed and strategic objectives are proposed with concrete actions to be taken by various actors in order to achieve those objectives. The strategic objectives are derived from the critical areas of concern and specific actions to be taken to achieve them cut across the boundaries of equality, development and peace – the goals of the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women – and reflect their interdependence. The objectives and actions are interlinked, of high priority and mutually reinforcing. The Platform for Action is intended to improve the situation of all women, without exception, who often face similar barriers, while special attention should be given to groups that are the most disadvantaged.

46. The Platform for Action recognizes that women face barriers to full equality and advancement because of such factors as their race, age, language, ethnicity, culture, religion or disability, because they are indigenous women or because of other status. Many women encounter specific obstacles related to their family status, particularly as single parents; and to their socio- economic status, including their living conditions in rural, isolated or impoverished areas. Additional barriers also exist for refugee women, other displaced women, including internally displaced women as well as for immigrant women and migrant women, including women migrant workers. Many women are also particularly affected by environmental disasters, serious and infectious diseases and various forms of violence against women.

=== Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women ===
A major result of the conference was the Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women, signed at the NGO Forum in the Indigenous Women's Tent.&lt;ref name="ipcb.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women|url=http://www.ipcb.org/resolutions/htmls/dec_beijing.html|publisher=Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document seeks, in part, to reconcile the tension felt by Indigenous women activists and Indigenous movements dominated by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Joyce|title=Balancing Strategies: Aboriginal Women and Constitutional Rights in Canada|journal=Making Space for Indigenous Feminism|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a significant step forward towards Indigenous women's rights and a significant victory for [[Indigenous feminism]] practice.

The 50-point declaration provides the rationale and a clear call to action for governments navigating Indigenous issues across the globe. The demands in the document are "that all governments and international non-governmental and governmental organizations recognize the right of Indigenous peoples to self-determination, and enshrine the historical, political, social, cultural, economic, and religious rights of the Indigenous peoples in their constitutions and legal systems."&lt;ref name="ipcb.org"/&gt; From that premise, the declaration goes on to specify areas for action including self-determination; development, education and health; human rights violations and violence against Indigenous women; intellectual and cultural heritage; and political participation.

The document addresses the unique problems Indigenous women suffer in addition to those suffered by Indigenous men, which include erosion of culture (and gender roles therein), loss of traditional land, and compromised identity and status in the spaces they inhabit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sayers|first=Judith F.|author2=Kelly A. MacDonald|title=A Strong and Meaningful Role for First Nations Women in Governance|journal=First Nations Women, Governance and the Indian Act: A Collection of Policy Research Reports|year=2001|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As its bases, the declaration cites the "UN Declaration of the International Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples, the Draft Declaration of the Rights of the Indigenous peoples, the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]], the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women, [[Agenda 21]] and the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]], the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]], and the Copenhagen Social Summit Declaration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beijing Declaration of Indigenous Women|url=http://twnside.org.sg/title/dec-ch.htm|publisher=Third World Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global Focus: Women in Art and Culture ==
''Global Focus: Women in Art and Culture'' was a project founded by artist and project director [[Nancy Cusick]] and gave women artists the opportunity to participate in the dialogue at the World Conference of Women. Women artists from around the world used their chosen media as a vehicle to produce work that evoked the universal issues paramount to women, their lives, and their position within the framework of society. Co-sponsored by the [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]] (NMWA), Global Focus presented an art exhibition, a video festival, slide presentations, performance pieces, and workshops that showed the artistic accomplishments and creativity of women. Most of the 880 artworks, produced by women artists from 27 countries, were displayed at the World Trade Center in [[Beijing, China]]. A smaller group of works were also exhibited in [[Huairou]], China. These artworks formed a visual landscape of powerful images that immortalized the women's issues and themes which encompassed the conference—Equality, Development, and Peace.

Following the exhibition of the Global Focus artworks in Beijing, China, the corpus of works traveled to various international locations. Immediately after the close of the Beijing exhibit, a selection of 53 American paintings were displayed at the Elite Gallery in [[Moscow]] from October to November 1995. Subsequently, in November 1995, a selection of 200 works adorned the walls of the art gallery at the United States Department of Health and Human Services in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] Simultaneously, another group of artworks from the collection were exhibited at the United States Information Agency also in Washington D.C. On March 20, 1996, the first public showing of the collection in the United States opened at NMWA in Washington D.C., with a day-long celebration revisiting and reflecting upon the experiences in Beijing. This exhibition, titled "Look at the World Through Women’s Eyes", was on display through April 21, 1996. On September 28, 1996, the collection was exhibited at [[George Washington University]] in Washington D.C., during the National Women's Satellite Conference hosted by First Lady [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]]. From April to June 1997, a selection of 300 works from the collection were exhibited at the Peace Museum in Detroit. The last public display of the Global Focus exhibit was shown during the 20th Anniversary Celebration of the 1977 Spirit of Houston Conference in Washington D.C. After this final showing, the large group of artworks ended its journey, and the entire collection was presented by the project co-directors Nancy Cusick and Mal Johnson to the archives of the National Museum of Women in the Arts.
