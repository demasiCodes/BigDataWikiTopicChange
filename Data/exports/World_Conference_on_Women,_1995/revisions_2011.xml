The [[United Nations]] convened the '''Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace''' on 4-15 September 1995 in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. 189 governments and more than 5,000 representatives from 2,100 non-governmental organizations participated in the Conference. Delegates had prepared a Declaration and Platform for Action that aimed at achieving greater equality and opportunity for [[women]]. The three previous World Conferences were in [[Mexico City]] (International Women's Year, [[1975]]), [[Copenhagen]] ([[1980]]) and Nairobi ([[1985]]).

The issue of global advocacy for [[abortion]] rights was controversial, with the United States and the [[Holy See]] publicly disagreeing over the issue. &lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DE143FF935A1575BC0A963958260&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss New York Times article]&lt;/ref&gt;
