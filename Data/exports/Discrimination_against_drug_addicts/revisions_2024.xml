'''Discrimination against people with substance use disorders''' is a form of [[discrimination]] against people with this disease. In the United States, people with substance use disorders are often blamed for their disease, which is often seen as a moral failing, due to a lack of public understanding about substance use disorders being diseases of the brain with 40-60% heritability. People with substance use disorders are likely to be stigmatized, whether in society or healthcare. 

In the process of [[stigmatization]], people with substance use disorders are
[[stereotype]]d as having a particular set of undesirable traits, in turn causing other individuals to act in a [[fear]]ful or [[prejudicial]] manner toward them.&lt;ref name="Stigma of addiction part I 2017 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corrigan P, Schomerus G, Shuman V, Kraus D, Perlick D, Harnish A, Kulesza M, Kane-Willis K, Qin S, Smelson D | title = Developing a research agenda for understanding the stigma of addictions Part I: Lessons from the Mental Health Stigma Literature | journal = The American Journal on Addictions | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–66 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27779803 | doi = 10.1111/ajad.12458 | quote = Social psychologists have distinguished the largely private experience of stigma in general—stereotypes and prejudice—from the more public, behavioral result which is discrimination.[11] Stereotypes are harmful and disrespectful beliefs about a group.

=== Individual factors ===
Clinicians use DSM-V-TR criteria to establish whether a person has a Substance Use Disorder, which may be classified as mild, moderate, or severe. It may also be ruled out, as some people may use substances or may be prescribed controlled substances that have the potential for addiction, but never go on to develop a substance use disorder. Addictive substances include stimulants, (caffeine, cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, ephedra, etc.), sedatives/anxiolytics (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, quaaludes, etc.), opioids (oxycodone, fentanyl, etc.), alcohol, nicotine/tobacco, cannabis, dissociatives (ketamine, [[nitrous oxide]], etc.), certain hallucinogens (especially MDMA), hormones (testosterone), GHB, Kratom, gabenergic agents (such as gabapentin), and more. The term addiction usually correlates with a severe substance use disorder. Addiction is characterized by behavior that is originally voluntary and reward-seeking that over time, becomes compulsive, with a desire to avoid dysphoria or withdrawal rather than to experience the original positive effects associated. A person may become physiologically dependent, experience withdrawal, and experience significant cravings. It does not degrade their personality, but people may engage in illicit behaviors such as buying drugs that are controlled substances, or engaging in prostitution to fund their addiction. Since these behaviors are illegal and they may face legal issues as a result, people who use drugs may not be forthcoming about these practices and may also delay seeking medical treatment for sequelae related to substance use out of fear of stigma or legal consequences.

=== Institutional basis ===

Stigma by health care professionals has many contributing factors.  The first is a well-documented, decades-long lack of education on substance use disorders in many healthcare professions, such as medicine, nursing, and pharmacy. Due to this gap in educational curricula, and competency, healthcare professionals may be unaware of how much of what they assume to be true about treatment and people with substance use disorders is neither evidence-based nor factual. Very few providers are certified in addiction treatment; addiction is often thought of as a subspecialty with providers having an initial certification in another specialty area, such as psychiatry. 
Healthcare professionals may hold biases similar to those of the general US population, who often see substance use disorders as a moral failure rather than a chronic brain disease that has significant contributory racial and psychosocial factors, with 40-60% heritability. Unfortunately, healthcare providers may perpetuate stigma when they use language that is stigmatizing/non-factual or refuse to provide care that is evidence-based or person-centered as a result of their lack of competency or biases which may be subconscious. Unfortunately, they may also believe stereotypes about people with substance use disorders or drugs, that the general population holds. These include people with SUDs not being able to get better when they have similar relapse rates to people with diabetes or hypertension, and most people with SUDs recovering without treatment. What is more, medications for opioid use disorder are highly effective at preventing relapse; methadone and buprenorphine specifically also prevent all-cause mortality by more than 70% in patients with OUD. However, medical providers may hold the false belief that in being prescribed these, patients are "substituting one drug for another". Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD), Medications for Alcohol Use Disorder (MAUD), and medications for Tobacco Use Disorder, are widely used in the United States Healthcare System. However, regulatory and legal barriers to methadone and buprenorphine prescription have inhibited their utility. Under current law, people on methadone have to go to SAMHSA-approved OTPs (special facilities) to receive this medication, on a nearly daily basis. Although now removed, until recently providers who wanted to prescribe buprenorphine had to be x-waivered, receiving addition education to prescribe, and were limited in the number of patients they could prescribe for. SAMHSA and ASAM have clinical guidelines for things such as medications for addiction treatment, withdrawal management, and non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions as well. 

There are several terms related to addiction that are not stages of addiction per se. Tolerance means the need to take more of a substance to achieve the desired effect when compared to before--it does not matter what the desired effect is (pain control/focus/euphoria/etc.). Tolerance to opioids can develop rapidly. Tolerance may occur in addiction but also occurs in those who are prescribed certain medications who may not meet DSM-V-TR criteria for a Substance Use Disorder. Tolerance quickly develops to the effects of hallucinogens after a few administrations, which is part of the reason why addiction to this class of substances is rare.  When people describe dependence in addiction treatment, they often mean physiological rather than psychological dependence. If someone is physiologically dependent, they are likely to experience withdrawal once the substance is removed, as their body has become accustomed to the substance's presence and its presence has affected their body's homeostasis. Withdrawal symptoms are often unpleasant and are typically the opposite of those experienced during intoxication. Rarely, withdrawal can be life-threatening; this may occur in patients with benzodiazepine, alcohol, or barbiturate dependence for example. Withdrawal is not a stage of addiction but is often a symptom, although a few drugs do not have withdrawal as part of their DSM-V-TR criteria (hallucinogens and cannabis).  


People with substance use disorders may have co-occurring mental health disorders, substance-induced mental disorders, both, or not have mental health disorders. Substance-use disorders are not thought of as mental health disorders, but can induce acute symptoms such as mood alterations or psychosis, depending on the drug and whether a person is intoxicated, experiencing withdrawal. In some cases, a person can be in active recovery (methamphetamine-induced psychosis specifically can last up to 2 years following discontinuation of methamphetamine, and hallucinogen persistent perception disorder can last several months following discontinuation). Generally, however, substance induced mental health symptoms are time-limited, clearing up within one month or less based on DSM-V-TR criteria.  If symptoms persist for longer following discontinuation, providers may consider a mental health disorder as primary, or as stemming from a different etiology, rather than as substance-induced. Thus the person's diagnosis may change based on the timeframe and symptoms following discontinuation. 
People with substance use disorders still have agency, but it may be very difficult to control cravings and urges in early recovery. Therefore, people who use drugs win early recovery may avoid people, places, or things, that serve as triggers for these. If unavoidable, they may urge surf, call a friend or sponsor, or use other coping mechanisms to distract themselves or ride the cravings and urges out. While much substance use is initially voluntary, this is not always the case. People may be exposed to substances in utero, or involuntarily initially in childhood (especially if parents use or manufacture drugs) or in adulthood (e.g. GHB, rophynol, etc.).  Some people who use may use substances that do not know are contaminated (laced) with other substances, such as fentanyl, nitrazine, or xylazine. This is a significant problem, with the DEA reporting fentanyl-related overdoses are the #1 cause of death in people 18-45.

Although 1 in 10 people in the United States will meet criteria for a substance use disorder in their lifetime, few will receive treatment. 


With the increasing number of adults that suffer from an addiction, only a few will receive treatment due to the complexity of health care systems.&lt;ref name="pmid282528922"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (US)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK424857/|title=Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health|author2=Office of the Surgeon General (US)|series=Reports of the Surgeon General|date=November 2016|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|pmid=28252892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most health care systems do not have insurance coverage for addiction recovery and many health care providers have little to no training in treating addiction.&lt;ref&gt;Biancarelli, Dea L, Katie B Biello, Ellen Childs, M Drainoni, Peter Salhaney, Alberto Edeza, Matthew J Mimiaga, Richard Saitz, and Angela R Bazzi.

For instance, as opposed to saying "former addict" or "reformed addict", the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA) recommends language such as "person in recovery" or "person who previously used drugs" to separate the problem from the individual.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brener|first1=Loren|last2=von Hippel|first2=William|last3=von Hippel|first3=Courtney|last4=Resnick|first4=Ilyse|last5=Treloar|first5=Carla|date=September 2010|title=Perceptions of discriminatory treatment by staff as predictors of drug treatment completion: Utility of a mixed methods approach|journal=Drug and Alcohol Review|volume=29|issue=5|pages=491–497|doi=10.1111/j.1465-3362.2010.00173.x|pmid=20887572|issn=0959-5236|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Rastegar|first=Darius A.|title=Overview of Substance Use Disorder Treatment|date=August 2020|work=ASAM Handbook of Addiction Medicine|pages=29–42|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/med/9780197506172.003.0003|isbn=978-0-19-750617-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2021-04-08|title=Words Matter - Terms to Use and Avoid When Talking About Addiction|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/nidamed-medical-health-professionals/health-professions-education/words-matter-terms-to-use-avoid-when-talking-about-addiction|access-date=2021-05-12|website=National Institute on Drug Abuse|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NIDA additionally applies a similar framework to terminology such as "clean" or "dirty" to denote whether or not someone is actively using as they cite the former vocabulary holds punitive connotations.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saitz|first=Richard|date=January 2016|title=International Statement Recommending Against the Use of Terminology That Can Stigmatize People|journal=Journal of Addiction Medicine|volume=10|issue=1|pages=1–2|doi=10.1097/adm.0000000000000178|pmid=26588846|s2cid=32717513|issn=1932-0620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, SUD policy reform advocates report language adjacent to SUD can misconstrue associated medical treatment practices which in turn poses barriers to expanded harm reduction efforts from being adopted.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; An example of this provided in a 2017 executive memorandum from The National Prevention Council was a recommendation to wean usage of "opioid substitution replacement therapy" which many believe falsely alludes that an individual is substituting their addiction for another (i.e. from heroin to methadone) to "opioid agonist therapy".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;
Another term that is losing favor is "abuse", due to its negative connotations and its impact on patient care. Instead, the terms "misuse" for prescribed medications or "use" for illicit substances are used.  Similarly, "user" is not used in favor of person-first language, such as "person with a substance use disorder", or "person who uses intraveneously"

==== Drugs and HIV infection ====
Among people who use drugs intravenously, the incidence of [[HIV]] and Hepatitis C infection is higher than among those who administer drugs through other routes. However punitive and discriminatory measures against people who use drugs are not able to eliminate either the spread of drug addiction or HIV. Researchers say that around 90% of people who choose to inject drugs have missed prior opportunities for HIV testing that were provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stulpin|first1=Caitlyn|date=20 February 2020|title=90% of injection drug users miss opportunities for HIV or HCV testing|work=Healio News|agency=Infections Disease News|url=https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20200220/90-of-injection-drug-users-miss-opportunities-for-hiv-or-hcv-testing}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why annual screening for Hep C and HIV is recommended for patients who use drugs. Also, in states where it is legal, people may use syringe service programs, or use at safe consumption sites. Also, patients may employ other harm reduction measures, such as employing aseptic technique, to reduce their risk of exposure to infectious disease. The website NextDistro has harm reduction resources for people who use drugs to minimize the risk associated with intravenous use.

Narcotic substance use is criminalized in [[Sweden]], with drug offenses holding punishments ranging from fines to six months imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (2019), Sweden, Country Drug Report 2019, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg.&lt;/ref&gt; To apprehend people who use, law enforcement is permitted to conduct urine testing based on suspicion, rather than wholly requiring a public disturbance.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Olsson, B., C.

==== Canada ====

In Vancouver, Canada, there have been efforts to reduce opioid-related deaths. An article published by the Canadian Medical Association Journal discusses new efforts to create safe injection sites for people struggling with opioid addiction. Vancouver politicians created these sites for people to safely use drugs that they are addicted to without the risk of infection or prosecution by the police. These safe injection sites provide sterilized needles to limit the reuse of needles that lead to the spread of AIDS and other diseases.&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt; Drug addicts in Vancouver have been discriminated against on numerous occasions. Mothers who are said to be drug addicts have had their children taken away, as they are thought to be unfit mothers. These women have a hard time getting jobs because employers might not want to hire someone who they believe are drug addicts. Women have started a union for drug users in Vancouver to aid them with housing and education to help them get back on their feet.
