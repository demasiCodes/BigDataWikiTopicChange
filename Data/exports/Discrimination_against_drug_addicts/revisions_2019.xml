'''Discrimination against drug addicts''' is a form of [[discrimination]] against individuals who suffer from a [[drug addiction]]. In the process of [[stigmatization]], drug addicts are [[stereotype]]d as having a particular set of undesirable traits, in turn causing other individuals to act in a [[fear]]ful or [[prejudicial]] manner toward them.&lt;ref name="Stigma of addiction part I 2017 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corrigan P, Schomerus G, Shuman V, Kraus D, Perlick D, Harnish A, Kulesza M, Kane-Willis K, Qin S, Smelson D | title = Developing a research agenda for understanding the stigma of addictions Part I: Lessons from the Mental Health Stigma Literature | journal = The American Journal on Addictions | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–66 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27779803 | doi = 10.1111/ajad.12458 | quote = Social psychologists have distinguished the largely private experience of stigma in general—stereotypes and prejudice—from the more public, behavioral result which is discrimination.[11] Stereotypes are harmful and disrespectful beliefs about a group.

Drug abusers are often depicted as human beings who are not capable of staying drug free and are often addressed using derogatory terms. The reasoning for not helping patients seek the treatments needed are often due to the terms used to identify them, such as "crackhead" or "junkie".&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/issues/discrimination-against-drug-users|title=Discrimination Against Drug Users|website=Drug Policy Alliance|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name calling and stigma places a sense of shame for drug users for a disease that takes control of them physically and psychologically. Discrimination against drug abusers is very common in the workplace, and the most familiar example happens when employers give random drug test to see if the employee will pass it.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asam.org/resources/publications/magazine/read/article/2015/12/15/patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder-need-treatment---not-stigma|title=Patients with Addiction Need Treatment - Not Stigma|website=www.asam.org|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, employers are supposed to ensure that alcoholics and other drug addicts get help and the accommodations that they need.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=76b7c82d-df8e-4ed9-9e35-565406e6ea4e@sessionmgr103|title=Laws Prohibiting Employment Discrimination Against the Alcoholic and the Dr...: Discovery Service for Xavier Univ of Louisiana.|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of job opportunities and treatment for drug addicts often results in relapses or in jail.

Drug abusers often choose the jail system because being in the real world exposes them to the very things that made them turn to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://oceanhillsrecovery.com/blog/leaving-addicted-person-jail-right-choice/|title=Leaving an Addicted Person in Jail: The Right Choice? {{!}} Ocean Hills Recovery|date=2017-12-01|work=Ocean Hills Recovery|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many drug users choose jail so they can utilize the Drug Court Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.drugwarfacts.org/chapter/drug_courts|title=Drug Courts &amp; Treatment Alternatives to Incarceration|work=Drug War Facts|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first drug court program was started in 1989 in Florida. The purpose of the drug court program was to put the court's authority in motion to reduce the drug crime rate by offering rehabilitation to drug addicts. In 2015, up to 3,000 drug courts were available in the U.S. and merely 120,000 defendants were being worked with per year. The overall goal of the drug court program is to reduce the need for drugs and the crimes that accompany them. Statistics have led researchers to believe drug court may be an effective resolution to end drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/news/drug-courts-are-the-answer-64444|title=Drug Courts Are the Answer: Save Money and Reduce Prison Populations|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivational patterns ==
Drugs (especially [[opioid]]s and [[stimulant]]s) can change the motivational patterns of a person and lead to [[desocialization]] and degradation of personality. Acquisition of the drugs some times involves [[black market]] activities and leads to criminal social circle.

== Institutional patterns ==

The drugs Ritalin ([[methylphenidate]]) and Adderall ([[amphetamine]]) are stimulants that are prescribed to kids with ADHD&lt;ref&gt;https://childmind.org/article/understanding-adhd-medications/&lt;/ref&gt; yet in college there's an influx of this drug trafficked. These drugs stimulate your nervous system making you awake and attentive. 

Prescribing opioids to patients and related overdose has become a serious problem in the US.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-opioid-epidemic&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lack of objective information about drugs ==
An important role in the process of discrimination is played by the lack of objective information about drug addiction and drug addicts, caused by legislative barriers to scientific research, the displacement of such information by [[propaganda]] of various kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://credonew.ru/content/view/324/28/ |title=Опасности моральной паники по поводу наркотиков |trans-title=The danger of moral panic about drugs |author=П. Мейлахс |date=2003 |publisher=Кредо-Нью |access-date=2017-12-22 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of information about drug addiction and drug addicts, people do not understand how an individual can become an addict. Drug addiction has been categorized as a subcategory of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = O'Leary D | date = 2016 | title = Addiction &amp; Mental Illness: Does One Cause the Other? | work = Dual Diagnosis | publisher = Foundations Recovery Network |url=https://www.dualdiagnosis.org/addiction-mental-illness-one-cause/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are referred to as co-occurring disorders, which means if a person is dealing with an addiction, they may also struggle with a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor MF, Coall D, Marquis R, Batten R | title = Drug addiction is a scourge on the earth and my grandchildren are its victims: The tough love and resilient growth exhibited by grandparents raising the children of drug-dependent mothers. | journal = International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction | date = December 2016 | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 937–51 | doi = 10.1007/s11469-016-9645-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals who suffer from drug dependency are nearly twice as likely to suffer from a mental illness as well.&lt;ref&gt;Proudfoot, Jesse. 2017. “Drugs, Addiction, and the Social Bond.” Geography Compass 11 (7): n/a-N.PAG. doi:10.1111/gec3.12320.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, about 8.9 million adults who have an addiction also have a psychiatric disorder. When dealing with either a mental illness or a drug addiction some symptoms people will experience are being incapable of controlling their own impulses and mood swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Canbolat F, Kul A, Özdemï M, Atïk U, Aydini A, Özden ST, Tarhan KN | title = Substance Abuse Profiles of Patients Admitted to the Alcohol and Drug Addiction Research, Treatment, and Education Center in Turkey. | journal = Turkish Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | date = December 2017 | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 294–303 | doi = 10.4274/tjps.50470 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When an individual falls victim to drug addiction, they will undergo the five stages of addiction which are the first use, the continued use, tolerance, dependence, and addiction.&lt;ref name="pmid28001458"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Z, Li WX, Zhi-Min L | title = Similarity and Difference in Drug Addiction Process Between Heroin- and Methamphetamine-Dependent Users | journal = Substance Use &amp; Misuse | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 459–467 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28001458 | doi = 10.1080/10826084.2016.1245331 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use stage, is the stage where individuals experiment with drugs and alcohol. This is the stage where individuals will partake in drug use because of curiosity, peer pressure, emotional problems etc. They discover how the drug will make them feel. In the continued use stage, individuals know how the drug makes them feel and is likely to notice that they're not getting “high” as quickly as they use to. In the tolerance stage, the brain and the body have adjusted to the drug and it takes longer to get the “high” an individual is seeking. Tolerance arrives after a period of continued use and is one of the first warning signs of addiction. In the dependence stage, the brain becomes accustomed to the drug and doesn't function well without it. Substance abusers become physically ill without the use of drugs and will begin to develop symptoms of withdrawal. This is sign that the addiction is beginning to take hold of the individual. In the addiction stage,  individuals find it impossible to stop using drugs even if they do not enjoy it or if their behavior has caused problems within an individual's life.

With the increasing number of adults that suffer with an addiction, only a few will receive treatment due to the complexity of health care systems.&lt;ref name="pmid28252892"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = | title = Facing Addiction in America: The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health | date = November 2016 | pmid = 28252892 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK424857/ | publisher =  US Department of Health and Human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most health care systems do not have insurance coverage for addiction recovery and many health care providers have little to no training in treating addiction. Some doctors do not feel comfortable treating an addiction due to their lack of knowledge and training of the topic. This is one of the reasons why drug dependence is difficult to recover from.

== Drugs and HIV infection ==
Among injecting drug users, the incidence of [[HIV]] infection is higher than among other drug addicts, however punitive and discriminatory measures against drug addicts are not able to eliminate either the spread of drug addiction or HIV.

== Global Impact ==

=== Africa ===
Africa has an estimated number 28 million substance users.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Budambula V, Matoka C, Ouma J, Ahmed AA, Otieno MF, Were T | title = Socio-demographic and sexual practices associated with HIV infection in Kenyan injection and non-injection drug users | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 193 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29378631 | pmc = 5789578 | doi = 10.1186/s12889-018-5100-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; This number is impacted by the rising availability of injection'''-'''based drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Socio-demographic factors are often primary determinants of the health status of drug users.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These factors contribute to individual drug use behaviors such as the sharing of needles and the solicitation of sex in exchange for police protection or more drugs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nutritional status, family support, stigma/discrimination, adherence to medication, and recovery from addiction are also impacted by these socio-demographic factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research shows that the majority of drug users transition from the use of non-injection substances to injection substances or use both simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Kenya ===
In Kenya there is a link between injection'''-'''related discrimination, mental health, physical health, and the quality of life for those who inject drugs.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mburu G, Ayon S, Tsai AC, Ndimbii J, Wang B, Strathdee S, Seeley J | title = "Who has ever loved a drug addict?
