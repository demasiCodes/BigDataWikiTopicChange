Governments that have implemented official policies of [[anti-clericalism]] oppose religious institutional power and influence in all aspects of public and political life, including the involvement of religion in the everyday life of the citizen.

Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is designed to protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/3273/normative-instruments/ccpr-general-comment-22-300793-on-iccpr-article-18.html|title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18|work=Minorityrights.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views."

==Communist states==
{{Main article|Marxism and religion}}
{{One source|section|date=May 2015}}

A [[communist state]], in popular usage, is a [[State (polity)|state]] with a [[form of government]] characterized by [[One-party state|one-party rule]] or [[Dominant-party system|dominant-party rule]] of a [[communist party]] and a professed allegiance to a [[Leninist]] or [[Marxist–Leninist]] [[Communism|communist]] ideology as the guiding principle of the state.  The founder and primary theorist of [[Marxism]], the nineteenth-century German sociologist [[Karl Marx]], had an ambivalent attitude to religion, viewing it primarily as "the [[opium of the people]]" that had been used by the ruling classes to give the [[working classes]] false hope for millennia, whilst at the same time recognizing it as a form of protest by the working classes against their poor economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Raines, John. 2002. "Introduction". ''Marx on Religion'' (Marx, Karl). Philadelphia: Temple University Press. Page 05-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Marxist–Leninist interpretation of Marxist theory, developed primarily by Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]], religion is seen as negative to human development, and communist states that follow a Marxist–Leninist variant are [[Atheism|atheistic]] and explicitly [[Antireligion|antireligious]].&lt;ref name=Lenin&gt;

Baggini goes on to argue that "Fundamentalism is a danger in any belief system" and that "Atheism's most authentic political expression... takes the form of state secularism, not state atheism."

After the [[Russian Civil War]], anti religious movements in the Soviet Union (''gosateizm'') attempted to stop the spread of religious beliefs as well as remove "prerevolutionary remnants".&lt;ref name="Kowalewski1980"/&gt; The Bolsheviks were particularly hostile to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (which supported the [[White Movement]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]) and saw it as a supporter of [[Tsarist autocracy]].&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sheila Fitzpatrick|title=Stalin's Peasants: Resistance and Survival in the Russian Village After Collectivization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlBvcNMlr4EC|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510459-2|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a process of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] of land, Orthodox priests distributed pamphlets declaring that the Soviet regime was the [[Antichrist]] coming to place “the Devil’s mark” on the peasants, and encouraged them to resist the government.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick1996"/&gt; [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|Political repression]] was widespread in the Soviet Union, and while religious persecution was applied to most religions,&lt;ref name=RussianOrthodox /&gt; the regime's anti-religious campaigns were often directed against specific religions based on state interests, that varied over time.

From the late 1920s to the late 1930s, such organizations as the [[League of Militant Atheists|League of the Militant Godless]] ridiculed all religions and harassed believers.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Anti-religious and atheistic propaganda was implemented into every portion of soviet life: in schools, communist organizations such as the [[Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization|Young Pioneer Organization]], and the media.

Within about a year of the revolution, the state [[Eminent domain|expropriated]] all church property, including the churches themselves, and in the period from 1922 to 1926, 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and more than 1,200 priests were killed (a much greater number was subjected to persecution).&lt;ref name=RussianOrthodox&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/russia/38.htm Country Studies: Russia-The Russian Orthodox Church] U.S. Library of Congress, Accessed Apr. 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Most seminaries were closed, and publication of religious writing was banned.&lt;ref name=RussianOrthodox /&gt;  The Russian Orthodox Church, which had 54,000 parishes before World War I, was reduced to 500 by 1940.&lt;ref name=RussianOrthodox /&gt;  A meeting of the Antireligious Commission of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party ([[Bolsheviks]]) that occurred on 23 May 1929 estimated the portion of believers in the [[USSR]] at 80 percent, though this percentage may be understated to prove the successfulness of the struggle with religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marjorie Mandelstam Balzer|title=Religion and Politics in Russia: A Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DEufvUyRcygC|year=2009|publisher=M.E.

Religion in [[Albania]] was subordinated in the interest of nationalism during periods of national revival, when it was identified as foreign predation to Albanian culture. During the late nineteenth century, and also when Albania became a state, religions were suppressed in order to better unify Albanians. This nationalism was also used to justify the communist stance of state atheism between 1967 and 1991.&lt;ref name="Hall1999"&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3060414 Representations of Place: Albania], Derek R. Hall, ''The Geographical Journal'', Vol. 165, No. 2, The Changing Meaning of Place in Post-Socialist Eastern Europe: Commodification, Perception and Environment (Jul., 1999), pp. 161–172, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Agrarian Reform Law (Albania)|Agrarian Reform Law]] of August 1945 nationalized most property of religious institutions, including the estates of mosques, monasteries, orders, and dioceses. Many clergy and believers were tried and some were executed. All foreign Roman Catholic priests, monks, and nuns were expelled in 1946.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-186.html|title=Albania - Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign|work=country-data.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious communities or branches that had their headquarters outside the country, such as the [[Jesuit]] and [[Franciscan]] orders, were henceforth ordered to terminate their activities in Albania. Religious institutions were forbidden to have anything to do with the education of the young, because that had been made the exclusive province of the state. All religious communities were prohibited from owning real estate and from operating philanthropic and welfare institutions and hospitals.
Although there were tactical variations in [[Enver Hoxha]]'s approach to each of the major denominations, his overarching objective was the eventual destruction of all organized religion in Albania. Between 1945 and 1953, the number of priests was reduced drastically and the number of Roman Catholic churches was decreased from 253 to 100, and all Catholics were stigmatized as fascists.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt;

The campaign against religion peaked in the 1960s. Beginning in 1967 the Albanian authorities began a campaign to eliminate religious life in Albania. Despite complaints, even by [[Party of Labour of Albania|APL]] members, all churches, mosques, monasteries, and other religious institutions were either closed down or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, or workshops by the end of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-170.html|title=Albania - The Cultural and Ideological Revolution|work=country-data.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1967, religious institutions had been forced to relinquish all 2,169 churches, mosques, cloisters, and shrines in Albania, many of which were converted into cultural centers for young people. As the literary monthly Nendori reported the event, the youth had thus "created the first atheist nation in the world."&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt;

Clerics were publicly vilified and humiliated, their vestments taken and desecrated. More than 200 clerics of various faiths were imprisoned, others were forced to seek work in either industry or agriculture, and some were executed or starved to death. The cloister of the Franciscan order in Shkodër was set on fire, which resulted in the death of four elderly monks.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt;

Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, "The state recognizes no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people.",&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjoerna.dk/dokumentation/Albanian-Constitution-1976.htm#C.%20Education,%20Science,%20Culture C. Education, Science, Culture], The Albanian Constitution of 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for "religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} A new decree that in effect targeted Albanians with Muslim and Christian names, stipulating that citizens whose names did not conform to "the political, ideological, or moral standards of the state" were to change them.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} It was also decreed that towns and villages with religious names must be renamed.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Hoxha's brutal antireligious campaign succeeded in eradicating formal worship, but some Albanians continued to practice their faith clandestinely, risking severe punishment.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Individuals caught with Bibles, Qurans, icons, or other religious objects faced long prison sentences. Religious weddings were prohibited.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Parents were afraid to pass on their faith, for fear that their children would tell others. Officials tried to entrap practicing Christians and Muslims during religious fasts, such as Lent and Ramadan, by distributing dairy products and other forbidden foods in school and at work, and then publicly denouncing those who refused the food. Those clergy who conducted secret services were incarcerated.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt; Catholic priest [[Kurti, Shtjefen|Shtjefen Kurti]] had been executed for secretly baptizing a child in [[Shkodër]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Sinishta, G., 1976.

The article was interpreted by Danes as violating The [[United Nations Charter]] (chapter 9, article 55) which declares that [[religious freedom]] is an inalienable human right. The first time that the question came before the United Nations' [[Commission on Human Rights]] at Geneva was as late as 7 March 1983.

Appearing as it did in Red Flag it is justifiable to conclude that the views expressed in it represented the accepted Communist attitude toward religion. In this article, Ya wrote that the basic policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China is to “recognise that everyone has the freedom to believe in a religion, and also that everyone has the freedom not to believe in a religion.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Practice of Chinese Buddhism, 1900–1950 – Page 393&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|1949 Chinese Revolution]], China began a period of rule by the [[Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Xie, Zhibin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=peah4XTpqnkC&amp;dq Religious diversity and public religion in China], p.145, Ashgate Publishing 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, Christian [https://books.google.com/books?id=bEzNwgtiVQ0C&amp;dq Wild West China], p. 259, Rutgers Univ. Press 2004&lt;/ref&gt; For much of its early history, that government maintained under [[Marxism|Marxist]] thought that religion would ultimately disappear, and characterized it as emblematic of [[feudalism]] and foreign [[colonialism]].

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], student vigilantes known as [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] converted religious buildings for secular use or destroyed them. This attitude, however, relaxed considerably in the late 1970s, with the [[reform and opening up]] period. The [[1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] with a number of restrictions.  Since then, there has been a massive program to rebuild Buddhist and Taoist temples that were destroyed in the Cultural Revolution.

The Communist Party has said that religious belief and membership are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/212827/no-religion-chinese-communist-party.html "No Religion for Chinese Communist Party Cadres".

Religious organizations and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign dominance.”&lt;ref name="Temperman"/&gt;

Article 36 of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] of 1982 specifies that:
{{Block quote|Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief. No state organ, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion.

Most people report no organized religious affiliation; however, people with a belief in folk traditions and spiritual beliefs, such as [[ancestor veneration]] and [[feng shui]], along with informal ties to local temples and unofficial house churches number in the hundreds of millions. The [[United States Department of State]], in its annual report on International Religious Freedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:*Buddhists 8%.
:*Taoists, unknown as a percentage partly because it is fused along with Confucianism and Buddhism.
:*Muslims, 1%, with more than 20,000 [[Imams]]. Other estimates state at least 1%.
:*Christians, Protestants at least 3%. Catholics, about 1.5%.

Statistics relating to [[Buddhism]] and religious [[Taoism]] are to some degree incomparable with statistics for [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. This is due to the traditional [[China|Chinese]] belief system which blends [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Taoism]], so that a person who follows a traditional belief system would not necessarily identify him- or herself as exclusively Buddhist or Taoist, despite attending Buddhist or Taoist places of worship. According to Peter Ng, Professor of the Department of Religion at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, {{as of|2002|lc=y}}, 95% of Chinese were religious in some way if religion is considered to include traditional folk practices such as burning incense for gods or ancestors at life-cycle or seasonal festivals, fortune telling and related customary practices.&lt;ref name=madsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Madsen|first=Richard|title=Chinese society: change, conflict and resistance|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-56073-3|editor=Elizabeth J.
