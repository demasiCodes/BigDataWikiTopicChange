Although many governments throughout history have officially opposed religion (and sometimes persecuted religious leaders), the only country that has ever actually banned religion was [[Albania]] under [[Enver Hoxha]].

State atheism should not be confused either with [[anti-clericalism]] – the effort to reduce the power of the [[clergy]], especially in [[politics]] – or with religious neutrality, in which a government recognizes the legal necessity of the [[separation of church and state]]. A state-sponsored religion within a political system implies preferential treatment of one tradition at the expense of others; thus the separation of church and state protects religious minorities. Finally, state atheism should not be confused with selective [[persecution]] of some religious beliefs or their adherents in favor of some other, more dominant religion. State atheism is opposed to all forms of religion equally.

State atheism implies that the government actively opposes all forms of religion, while secular government can simply involve a government taking a neutral view towards religious matters.  It should be noted that some advocates and opponents of a secular state use the phrase "extreme communism" when referring to state atheism [http://skepdic.com/ultrafundamentalism.html].
