'''State atheism''' is the official promotion of [[atheism]] by a [[government]], sometimes combined with active suppression of [[religious freedom]] and practice.&lt;ref name="Kowalewski1980"&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/128810 Protest for Religious Rights in the USSR: Characteristics and Consequences], David Kowalewski, ''Russian Review'', Vol. 39, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 426–441, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Editors and Board of Trustees of the Russian Review&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, a [[secular state]] purports to be officially neutral in matters of [[religion]], supporting neither religion nor [[irreligion]].&lt;ref&gt;Madeley, John T.

State atheism may refer to a government's [[anti-clericalism]], which opposes religious institutional power and influence in all aspects of public and political life, including the involvement of religion in the everyday life of the citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Anticlericalism'' (2007 Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.)&lt;/ref&gt; State promotion of atheism as a public norm was first practiced during a brief period in [[Revolutionary France]]. Since then, such a policy was repeated only in [[Mexican Revolution|Revolutionary Mexico]] and some [[communist states]].  The Soviet Union had a long history of state atheism,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Greeley2003|Greeley (2003)]].&lt;/ref&gt; in which social success largely required individuals to profess atheism, stay away from churches and even vandalize them; this attitude was especially militant during the middle Stalinist era from 1929-1939.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pospielovsky1998|Pospielovsky (1998)]]:257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miner2003|Miner (2003)]]:70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davies1996|Davies (1996)]]:962.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union attempted to suppress public religious expression over wide areas of its influence, including places such as central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pipes1989|Pipes (1989)]]:55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Revolution==
During the [[French Revolution]] French society considered the prospect of an atheist state.&lt;ref name=McGrath2006p46&gt;[[#McGrath2006|McGrath (2006)]]:46.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Revolution, [[Jacques Hébert]], a radical revolutionary journalist, and [[Anacharsis Cloots]], a politician, both [[anticlerical]] and atheist, had successfully campaigned for the proclamation of the atheistic&lt;ref name=Freemont-Barnes2007p329&gt;[[#Freemont-Barnes2007|Freemont-Barnes (2007)]]:[http://books.google.com/books?id=6_2wkP4j-EsC&amp;pg=PA376&lt;!--this navigates to page 329 (not 376) in the text--&gt; 329].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cult of Reason]], which was adopted by the French Republic on November 10, 1793, though abandoned May 7, 1794 in favor of its [[deism|deistic]] replacement as the state religion, the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]].&lt;ref name=McGrath2006&gt;[[#McGrath2006|McGrath (2006)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloots maintained that "Reason" and "Truth" were "supremely intolerant" and that the daylight of atheism would make the lesser lights of religious night disappear.&lt;ref name=McGrath2006 /&gt;  The state then further pushed its [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|campaign of dechristianization]],&lt;ref name=McGrath2006p45&gt;[[#McGrath2006|McGrath (2006)]]:45.&lt;/ref&gt; which included removal and destruction of religious objects from places of worship and the transformation of churches into "Temples of the Goddess of Reason",  culminating in a celebration of Reason in [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;Latreille, A. FRENCH REVOLUTION, New Catholic Encyclopedia v. 5, pp. 972–973 (Second Ed. 2002 Thompson/Gale) ISBN 0-7876-4004-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spielvogel2005|Spielvogel (2005)]]:549.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tallet1991|Tallet (1991)]]:1&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterrevolution against the [[Persecution of Christians|persecution]] rooted in the anticlerical aspects of the Revolution led to a [[War in the Vendée|war in the Vendée region]] where republicans suppressed the  Catholic and royalist uprising in what some call the first modern [[genocide]].&lt;ref name=McGrath2006p46 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JonassohnBjeornson1998&gt;[[#JonassohnBjeornson1998|Jonassohn, Bjeornson]]:208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike later establishments of anti-theism by communist regimes, the French Revolutionary experiment was short (7 months), incomplete and inconsistent.&lt;ref name="McGrath2006p45"/&gt; Although brief, the French experiment was particularly notable for the influence upon atheists [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] (who called religion an opiate before Marx&lt;ref&gt;Luo, Zhufeng  [http://books.google.com/books?id=cEfiZlUpI5oC&amp;dq Religion under socialism in China], p. 151, M.E. Sharpe 1991&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref name=McGrath2006p46 /&gt;  Using the ideas of Feuerbach, Marx and Freud, "communist" regimes later treated religious believers as subversives or abnormal, sometimes relegated to psychiatric hospitals and reeducation.&lt;ref name=McGrath2006p46 /&gt;

==Mexico under Plutarco Elías Calles==
{{See also|Plutarco Elías Calles|Calles Law|Cristero War}}
Articles 3, 5, 24, 27, and 130 of the The Mexican Constitution of 1917 as originally enacted were anticlerical and enormously restricted religious freedoms.&lt;ref name="lawreview.byu.edu"&gt;Soberanes Fernandez, Jose Luis, [http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2002/2/Sob12.pdf Mexico and the 1981 United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief], pp. 437-438 nn. 7-8, BYU Law Review, June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; At first the anticlerical provisions were only sporadically enforced, but when President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] took office, he enforced the provisions strictly.&lt;ref name="lawreview.byu.edu"/&gt; Calles’ Mexico has been characterized as an atheist state&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Ernst B., [http://books.google.com/books?id=ldKJ_Re6p8AC&amp;pg Nationalism, Liberalism, and Progress: The dismal fate of new nations], Cornell Univ.

All religions had their properties appropriated, and these became part of government wealth. There was a forced expulsion of foreign clergy and the seizure of Church properties.&lt;ref name="ilstu.edu"&gt;http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist263/docs/1917const.html&lt;/ref&gt; Article 27 prohibited any future acquisition of such property by the churches, and prohibited religious corporations and ministers from 
establishing or directing primary schools.&lt;ref name="ilstu.edu" /&gt; This second prohibition was interpreted{{by whom|date=April 2012}} to mean that the Church could not give religious instruction to children within the churches on Sundays, seen as destroying the ability of Catholics to be educated in their own religion.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The Constitution of 1917 also closed and forbade the existence of monastic orders (article 5), forbade any religious activity outside of church buildings (now owned by the government), and mandated that such religious activity would be overseen by the government (article 24).&lt;ref name="ilstu.edu"/&gt;

On June 14, 1926, President Calles enacted an [[anticlerical]] legislation known formally as The Law Reforming the Penal Code and unofficially as the [[Calles Law]].&lt;ref name="Joes, Anthony James p. 70"&gt;Joes, Anthony James [http://books.google.com/books?id=buHXFDFdeoQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=plutarco+calles+anticatholic&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=fnPEry3_KKxtgC6IdVhGGh8lMG8#PPA70,M1 Resisting Rebellion: The History And Politics of Counterinsurgency] p. 70, (2006 University Press of Kentucky) ISBN 0-8131-9170-X&lt;/ref&gt;   His [[anti-Catholic]] actions included outlawing religious orders, depriving the Church of property rights and depriving the clergy of civil liberties, including their right to trial  by jury (in cases involving anti-clerical laws) and the right to vote.&lt;ref name="Joes, Anthony James p. 70"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE CRISTERO REBELLION - PART 1"&gt;Tuck, Jim [http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/history/jtuck/jtcristero1.html THE CRISTERO REBELLION – PART 1] Mexico Connect 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Catholic antipathy towards Calles was enhanced because of his vocal atheism.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book

Due to the strict enforcement of anti-clerical laws, people in strongly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] areas, especially the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Colima]] and [[Michoacán]], began to oppose him, and this opposition led to the [[Cristero War]] from 1926 to 1929, which was characterized by brutal atrocities by both sides. Some Cristeros applied terrorist tactics, while the Mexican government persecuted the clergy, killing suspected Cristeros and supporters and often retaliating against innocent individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Plutarco_Elias_Calles.aspx Calles, Plutarco Elías] The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001–05 Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 28, 1926, Calles was awarded a medal of merit from the head of Mexico's Scottish rite of Freemasonry for his actions against the Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storialibera.it/epoca_contemporanea/messico_1926-1929/articolo.php?id=508 The Cristeros: 20th century Mexico's Catholic uprising, from The Angelus, January 2002 , Volume XXV, Number 1] by Olivier LELIBRE, [[The Angelus]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion in communist states==
{{Main|Marxism and religion}}
The founder and primary theorist of [[Marxism]], the Nineteenth-century German sociologist [[Karl Marx]], had an ambivalent attitude to religion, viewing it primarily as "the [[opium of the people]]" that had been used by the ruling classes to give the [[working classes]] false hope for millennia, whilst at the same time recognizing it as a form of protest by the working classes against their poor economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Raines, John. 2002. "Introduction". ''Marx on Religion'' (Marx, Karl). Philadelphia: Temple University Press. Page 05-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] interpretation of Marxist theory, developed primarily by Russian revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]], religion is seen as negative to human development, and [[communist state]]s that follow a Marxist–Leninist variant are [[Atheism|atheistic]] and explicitly [[Antireligion|antireligious]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; However, several [[Religious communism|religious communist]] groups exist, and [[Christian communism]] was important in the early development of communism.

===Albania===
{{Further2|[[Religion in Albania#Totalitarian regime|Religion in Albania]]}}

State atheism in [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] was taken to an extreme during the totalitarian regime installed after World War II, when religions, identified as imports foreign to Albanian culture, were banned altogether.&lt;ref name="Hall1999"&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/3060414 Representations of Place: Albania], Derek R. Hall, ''The Geographical Journal'', Vol. 165, No. 2, The Changing Meaning of Place in Post-Socialist Eastern Europe: Commodification, Perception and Environment (Jul., 1999), pp. 161–172, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Agrarian Reform Law (Albania)|Agrarian Reform Law]] of August 1945 nationalized most property of religious institutions, including the estates of monasteries, orders, and dioceses. Many clergy and believers were tried, tortured, and executed. All foreign Roman Catholic priests, monks, and nuns were expelled in 1946.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-186.html Albania - Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious communities or branches that had their headquarters outside the country, such as the [[Jesuit]] and [[Franciscan]] orders, were henceforth ordered to terminate their activities in Albania. Religious institutions were forbidden to have anything to do with the education of the young, because that had been made the exclusive province of the state. All religious communities were prohibited from owning real estate and from operating philanthropic and welfare institutions and hospitals.
Although there were tactical variations in Hoxha's approach to each of the major denominations, his overarching objective was the eventual destruction of all organized religion in Albania. Between 1945 and 1953, the number of priests was reduced drastically and the number of Roman Catholic churches was decreased from 253 to 100, and all Catholics were stigmatized as fascists.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt;

The campaign against religion peaked in the 1960s. Beginning in 1967 the Albanian authorities began a violent campaign to try to eliminate religious life in Albania. Despite complaints, even by [[Party of Labour of Albania|APL]] members, all churches, mosques, monasteries, and other religious institutions were either closed down or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, or workshops by the end of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-170.html Albania - The Cultural and Ideological Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1967, religious institutions had been forced to relinquish all 2,169 churches, mosques, cloisters, and shrines in Albania, many of which were converted into cultural centers for young people. As the literary monthly Nendori reported the event, the youth had thus "created the first atheist nation in the world."&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt;

The clergy were publicly vilified and humiliated, their vestments taken and desecrated. More than 200 clerics of various faiths were imprisoned, others were forced to seek work in either industry or agriculture, and some were executed or starved to death. The cloister of the Franciscan order in Shkodër was set on fire, which resulted in the death of four elderly monks.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt;

Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, "The state recognizes no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people.",&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjoerna.dk/dokumentation/Albanian-Constitution-1976.htm#C.%20Education,%20Science,%20Culture C. Education, Science, Culture], The Albanian Constitution of 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for "religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature." A new decree that in effect targeted Albanians with Muslim and Christian names stipulated that citizens whose names did not conform to "the political, ideological, or moral standards of the state" were to change them. It was also decreed that towns and villages with religious names must be renamed. Hoxha's brutal antireligious campaign succeeded in eradicating formal worship, but some Albanians continued to practice their faith clandestinely, risking severe punishment. Individuals caught with Bibles, icons, or other religious objects faced long prison sentences. Religious weddings were prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-184.html Albania - Social Structure under Communist Rule&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents were afraid to pass on their faith, for fear that their children would tell others. Officials tried to entrap practicing Christians and Muslims during religious fasts, such as Lent and Ramadan, by distributing dairy products and other forbidden foods in school and at work, and then publicly denouncing those who refused the food, and clergy who conducted secret services were incarcerated.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt; Catholic priest [[Kurti, Shtjefen|Shtjefen Kurti]] had been executed for secretly baptizing a child in [[Shkodër]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Sinishta, G., 1976. The Fulfilled Promise: A Documentary Account of Religious Persecution in Albania. Albanian Catholic Information Center, Santa Clara.&lt;/ref&gt;

The article was interpreted by Danes as violating The [[United Nations Charter]] (chapter 9, article 55) which declares that [[religious freedom]] is an inalienable human right. The first time that the question came before the United Nations' [[Commission on Human Rights]] at Geneva was as late as 7 March 1983. A delegation from Denmark got its protest over Albania's violation of religious liberty placed on the agenda of the thirty-ninth meeting of the commission, item 25, reading, "Implementation of the Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief.", and on 20 July 1984 a member of the [[Danish Parliament]] inserted an article in one of Denmark's major newspapers protesting the violation of religious freedom in Albania.

===Czechoslovakia===
{{See also|Religion in Czechoslovakia|Religion in Slovakia}}
When in February 1948 [[Communists]] seized power in [[Czechoslovakia]], their agenda included combating "a dangerous ideological enemy holding enormous influence on the masses", a reference to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NMI|url= http://www.upn.gov.sk/obdobie-1945-1989/likvidacia-klastorov-v-komunistickom-ceskoslovensku-barbarska-noc|title= Likvidácia kláštorov v komunistickom Československu – Barbarská noc  ("Eradication of monasteries in communist Czechoslovakia – Barbaric night")|publisher=[http://www.upn.gov.sk/v2/index.php?page=about-nations-memory-institute Nation's Memory Institute]|year=2011}}&lt;!--Destruction of monasteries in communist Czechoslovakia - barbaric night

The Czechoslovak Communists already regarded religious institutes as important entities that had an inconvenient influence on the population. The first actions against religious communities took place in the summer of the same year, when some were closed under the pretext that they were centres of anti-state activities. Although not many were closed at that time, these events indicated the direction later developments would take. But the regime delayed implementation of its action against religious institutes until the first half of 1950 in order to push ahead with other actions such as the establishment of Schismatic Catholic Action in June 1949 and the passing of so-called ecclesiastical laws in the autumn of 1949.

Immediate preparation for "Action K" was the trial of ten members of religious institutes, who were accused of treason and espionage. This was intended to justify the planned action against the institutes in the eyes of public opinion. A thorough "processing" by State Security investigators secured "admission" by the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of "anti-state activities", hatred for "the establishment of people’s democracy", sympathy for "imperialism", illegal production of leaflets, and concealment of "enemy agents", weapons and valuables. One of the accused (coincidentally the only one from Slovakia – the Redemptorist Ján Mastiliak) was sentenced to life imprisonment, while the other sentences totalled 132 years.

Implementation of the action was in the hands of the State Security Service [[StB]]. A reconnaissance of monasteries was carried out to find out the number of their inhabitants. The police corps, military and communist militias were to join in, armed with rifles, submachine guns, light machine guns, batons and gas candles. The action was set for Thursday 13 April 1950 at 24:00. At the appointed time, members of the armed forces took possession of the houses, securing entry by violence where the summons was ignored. The religious were assembled and informed that the intervention was due to alleged sedition and anti-state activities of the institutes. They were then forced into buses and trucks and transported to so-called concentration monasteries all over the Slovakia. 881 religious from 11 religious institutes were displaced in a single night.

After Action K, Action K2 took place during the night from 3 to 4 May 1950, taking over the remaining male religious houses. The two interventions affected in total 1,180 people from 15 institutes living in 76 communities. The relocated monks in Slovakia were concentrated in the following houses: the Monastery of the Martyrs (now Močenok) Hronský Beňadik, Podolinec-Kostolná and Báč.
These concentration houses was governed virtually by prison rules. In addition to forced labour (sticking bags, picking rose-hips, carpentry and tailoring, farming), time was allotted for political re-education. Communication with the outside world was completely eliminated or limited to a minimum. The most stringent regime was in the monastery in Podolínec, where the greatest number were confined. The building was guarded by prison officers selected from the Leopoldov and other prisons who were armed and with dogs. Barbed wire was installed and windows barred. A watch tower was built in the courtyard, and the surrounding area was lit up at night. Religious who violated the prescribed rules were punished by solitary confinement in the basement.

After completion of Actions K, attention was directed to women's religious institutes. Destruction of their communities was given the name R (for ''Rehoľníčky'', nuns in Slovak). The removal of the religious was presented as voluntary, with force applied only where there was resistance. Action R began on 29 August 1950 at 8 in the morning. In about 15 locations in Slovakia citizens who opposed destruction of the religious communities assembled, occupied the buildings and prevented displacement of the religious, sometimes with sharp confrontations and attacks on government officials. In these cases the action was repeated at night with the assistance of the Police Corps, communist militias and the state security service. In total, 1962 people were displaced and 137 buildings seized between 28 and 31 August 1950. The religious were placed in 16 concentration communities. Over 1,600 other women religious had to remain working in hospitals, because the state system could not find an adequate replacements for them.

After the seizure of the buildings many libraries were destroyed by careless treatment and valuable manuscripts, prints, paintings and furniture was stolen. The buildings were handed over to regional and local state administrative offices, sport clubs, orphanages etc. The communist state power saw the religious institutes as a dangerous ideological enemy who has considerable influence over the masses. But the action was also aimed at getting possession of real estate and other assets held by religious institutes. The report to the political secretariat of the Central Communist Committee on the material assets acquired described the result as the largest property transfer since confiscation of the property of displaced Germans, nationalization of private enterprises and land reform. But the most painful result was the sorrowful fate of thousands of religious men and women, who remained for decades a group of citizens subject to persecution by the state.

In 1957, the [[ŠtB]] arrested university students in the eastern Slovakia town of [[Košice]] who were holding [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] meetings. Their leader was Miloš Rataj, whose father was the teacher and poet Ján Rataj. The consequent investigations led to further arrests of [[Christians]] and [[trial]]s in 1959 not open to the public but covered by state-controlled media, which presented information under headlines such as "Poison in gold-foil", "Sects are eradicating the thinking of the young"  and "Report on trial of Blue [[Crusaders]]" ([[Modrý kríž|Blue Cross]] was a Christian [[total abstinence]] association that combatted [[alcoholism]]).

A.L. Eliseev writes that a meeting of the antireligious commission of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) took place on 23 May 1929 under the Chairmanship of E. Laroslavskii.  The commission estimated the portion of believers in the country at 80 percent, though it cannot be ruled out that this percentage was somewhat understated to prove the successfulness of the struggle with religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marjorie Mandelstam Balzer|title=Religion and Politics in Russia: A Reader|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DEufvUyRcygC|year=2009|publisher=M.E.

State atheism in the Soviet Union was known as "''gosateizm''",&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;''[http://www.jstor.org/pss/128810 Protest for Religious Rights in the USSR: Characteristics and Consequences]', JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; and was based on the ideology of [[Marxism–Leninism]]. As the founder of the Soviet state [[Vladimir Lenin]] put it: &lt;blockquote&gt;Religion is the [[opiate of the people]]: this saying of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] is the cornerstone of the entire ideology of Marxism about religion. All modern religions and churches, all and of every kind of religious organizations are always considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Marxism-Leninism has consistently advocated the control, suppression, and, ultimately, the elimination of religion.  Within about a year of the revolution the state [[Eminent domain|expropriated]] all church property, including the churches themselves, and in the period from 1922 to 1926, 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and more than 1,200 priests were killed (a much greater number was subjected to persecution).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/russia/38.htm Country Studies: Russia-The Russian Orthodox Church] U.S. Library of Congress, Accessed Apr. 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1920s to the late 1930s, such organizations as the [[League of Militant Atheists|League of the Militant Godless]] ridiculed all religions and harassed believers. Anti-religious and atheistic propaganda was implemented into every portion of soviet life, in schools, communist organizations (such as the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneer Organization]]), and the media. Though Lenin originally introduced the [[Gregorian calendar]] to the Soviets subsequent efforts to re-organise the week for the purposes of improving worker productivity with the introduction of the [[Soviet calendar]] had a side-effect that a "holiday will seldom fall on Sunday" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Although all religions were persecuted,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; the regime's efforts to eradicate religion, however, varied over the years with respect to particular religions, and were affected by higher state interests. Official policies and practices not only varied with time but also in their application from one nationality and one religion to another. Although all Soviet leaders had the same long-range goal of developing a cohesive Soviet people, they pursued different policies to achieve it. For the Soviet regime, the questions of nationality and religion were always closely linked. Not surprisingly, therefore, the attitude toward religion also varied from a total ban on some religions to official support of others.

Most seminaries were closed, publication of religious writing was banned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  The Russian Orthodox Church, which had 54,000 parishes before World War I, was reduced to 500 by 1940.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Today, approximately 100 million citizens consider themselves Russian Orthodox Christians, amounting to 70% of population, although the Church claims a membership of 80 million;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article551693.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=The rise of Russian Muslims worries Orthodox Church | first=Jeremy | last=Page | date=2005-08-05 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90196.htm Russia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to the CIA Factbook, only 17% to 22% of the population is now Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Ethan [http://www.christianpost.com/article/20080324/31660_Gorbachev_Dispels_'Closet_Christian'_Rumors;_Says_He_is_Atheist.htm Gorbachev Dispels 'Closet Christian' Rumors; Says He is Atheist] Christian Post Reporter, Mar. 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{Further2|[[Religion in China]]}}
Between 1900–1950, 90 percent of the population occasionally resorted to Buddhist rites or temples and 99 percent were affected by Buddhist contributions to Chinese thought and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;The Practice of Chinese Buddhism, 1900–1950 – Page 393&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|1949 Chinese Revolution]], China began a period of rule by the [[Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Xie, Zhibin, [http://books.google.com/books?id=peah4XTpqnkC&amp;dq Religious diversity and public religion in China], p.145, Ashgate Publishing 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, Christian [http://books.google.com/books?id=bEzNwgtiVQ0C&amp;dq Wild West China], p. 259, Rutgers Univ. Press 2004&lt;/ref&gt; For much of its early history, that government maintained under [[Marxism|Marxist]] thought that religion would ultimately disappear, and characterized it as emblematic of [[feudalism]] and foreign [[colonialism]]. 

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], student vigilantes known as [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] converted religious buildings for secular use or destroyed them. This attitude, however, relaxed considerably in the late 1970s, with the [[reform and opening up]] period. The [[1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] with a number of restrictions.  Since the mid-1990s there has been a massive program to rebuild Buddhist and Taoist temples that were destroyed in the Cultural Revolution.

The Communist Party has said that religious belief and membership are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/212827/no-religion-chinese-communist-party.html "No Religion for Chinese Communist Party Cadres".  ''Deccan Herald''.

The state even promotes "normal" religious activity (i.e., not using mosques as a platform to preach jihad against the state) as a force for the stability of China.&lt;ref name="Temperman"/&gt;

Most people report no organized religious affiliation; however, people with a belief in folk traditions and spiritual beliefs, such as [[ancestor veneration]] and [[feng shui]], along with informal ties to local temples and unofficial house churches number in the hundreds of millions. The [[United States Department of State]], in its annual report on International Religious Freedom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

:*Buddhists 8%.
:*Taoists, unknown as a percentage partly because it is fused along with Confucianism and Buddhism.
:*Muslims, 1%, with more than 20,000 [[Imams]]. Other estimates state at least 1%.
:*Christians, Protestants at least 3%. Catholics, about 1.5%. Total Christians according to 2008 different polls: 4.5%.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Statistics relating to [[Buddhism]] and religious [[Taoism]] are to some degree incomparable with statistics for [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. This is due to the traditional [[China|Chinese]] belief system which blends [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Taoism]], so that a person who follows a traditional belief system would not necessarily identify him- or herself as exclusively Buddhist or Taoist, despite attending Buddhist or Taoist places of worship. According to Peter Ng, Professor of the Department of Religion at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as of 2002, 95% of Chinese were religious in some way if religion is considered to include traditional folk practices such as burning incense for gods or ancestors at life-cycle or seasonal festivals, fortune telling and related customary practices.&lt;ref name=madsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Madsen|first=Richard|title=Chinese society: change, conflict and resistance|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-56073-3|editor=Elizabeth J.

===Cambodia===
{{Further2|[[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia]]}}
Though the constitution of [[Democratic Kampuchea]] guaranteed the right to worship according to any religion and the right not to worship according to any religion, it also provided that "Reactionary religions which are detrimental to Democratic Kampuchea and Kampuchean people are absolutely forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dccam.org/Archives/Documents/DK_Policy/DK_Policy_DK_Constitution.htm Constitution of Democratic Kampuchea (1975–1979)], [http://www.dccam.org/ dccam.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Religious people were killed in [[the killing fields]], as the leader of the [[Khmer Rouge]], [[Pol Pot]], suppressed [[Cambodia]]'s [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]: monks were defrocked; temples and artifacts, including statues of Buddha, were destroyed; and people praying or expressing other religious sentiments were often killed. The Christian and Muslim communities were among the most persecuted, as well. The Roman Catholic cathedral of Phnom Penh was razed. The Khmer Rouge forced Muslims to eat pork, which they regard as an abomination. Many of those who refused were killed. Christian clergy and Muslim imams were executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/cambodia/29.htm Cambodia – Society under the Angkar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mongolia===
In 1936, and especially after Japanese encroachments had given the Soviets enough reason to deploy Soviet troops in [[Mongolia]] in 1937, a whole-scale attack on the [[Lamaism|Buddhist faith]] began. At the same time, [[Stalinist purges in Mongolia|Stalinist-style purges]] took place in the Communist Party and in the Mongolian army. Mongolia's leader at that time was [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]], a follower of [[Joseph Stalin]] who emulated many of the policies Stalin had implemented in the Soviet Union. The purges led to the almost complete eradiction of [[Lamaism]] in the country, and cost an estimated 30,000–35,000 lives.

===Cuba===
Originally more tolerant of religion, after the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], [[Cuba]] began arresting many believers and shutting down religious schools, its prisons since the 1960s being filled with clergy.&lt;ref name=Hertzke2006p43&gt;[[#Hertzke2006|Hertzke (2006)]]:[http://books.google.com/books?id=EkIvbxefBNsC&amp;pg=PA43 43]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 The Cuban government confiscated the Catholic schools, including the Jesuit school Fidel Castro had attended. In 1965 it exiled two hundred priests.&lt;ref name=buckley2005-11-21&gt;William F. Buckley Jr., [http://old.nationalreview.com/flashback/1998200511210830.asp Cuba libre?], November 21, 2005, National review.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party of Cuba]] defines one of its aims as "the gradual overcoming of religious beliefs by materialistic scientific propaganda and the cultural advancement of the workers."&lt;ref name="Temperman"/&gt; From 1976 to 1992, the [[Constitution of Cuba]] contained  a clause stating that the "socialist state...bases its activity on, and educates the people in, the scientific materialist concept of the universe [atheism]". In 1992, the Communist Party of Cuba has allowed religious believers to join.&lt;ref name="Temperman"/&gt; Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Cuba has amended its statutes to declare itself a "[[secular state]]" rather than atheistic.

Pope [[John Paul II]] visited Cuba January 21–25, 1998, the first time a pope had visited Cuba and the first time since the Communist Revolution of 1959 that a papal visit was welcome.&lt;ref name=ac-cuba&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/features/cuba/ Pope John Paul II Visits Cuba], January 25, 1998, americancatholic.org&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for the visit was not to call the Communist government to task, but to carry out a pastoral visit to the Catholic community and to deliver a message of evangelization.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Wintz, [http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Apr1998 The Pope in Cuba: A Call for Freedom], americancatholic.org&lt;/ref&gt; In his farewell statement to the pope at the airport Fidel Castro thanked the pope for visiting the "last bastion of Communism."&lt;ref name=buckley2005-11-21 /&gt;

In 2009, when welcoming Cuba's new ambassador to the Vatican, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] said that the Catholic Church had been trying to help suffering Cubans and, thanks to a new government willingness to cooperate, it was able to take part in emergency relief and reconstruction efforts after hurricanes struck the island in 2008. The pope went on to say, "I hope concrete signs of openness to the exercise of religious freedom continue to multiply as they have in recent years,". In particular, he asked for "the opportunity to celebrate Holy Mass in some prisons, to conduct religious processions, for the repair and return of some churches and the construction of houses for religious, (and) the possibility that priests and religious could receive social security. In this way, the Catholic community could more freely exercise its specific pastoral task."&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Wooden, [http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0905435.htm Pope urges greater religious freedom in Cuba, criticizes U.S. embargo], December 10, 2009, Catholic News Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
The process of secularization in Poland began with [[Józef Klemens Piłsudski]], the ''de facto'' dictator of Poland after the [[May Coup (Poland)|May 1926 ''coup d'état'']], and his [[Polish Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] before [[World War II]].  During Piłsudski's reign, the Polish military had many fewer priests, rabbis, and imams per 100,000 soldiers than other European countries, though Piłsudski did not stand against religion as did the Polish Communists who took over Poland in 1956 and continued to rule it with a minimal amount of plurality (there were also a communist farmers' party and social-democratic Intelligencia party) until 1989.  When even the Jehovah Witnesses became readily tolerated{{Contradiction-inline|date=March 2012}} by the communist government of Poland, a Pole in uniform could not attend services in open.  The vast majority of the Polish police officers, the professional military, and even some members of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] were attending services incognito, as well as getting rites, such as [[baptism]] or [[Communion (Christian)|communion]], in secret.  This secret religiosity continued until the 1980s.

===Vietnam===

The [[Constitution of Vietnam]] allows the state to tightly regulate religion, although the actual regulations are detailed in the 2004 Ordinance on Religious Belief.&lt;ref name="Temperman"/&gt;

Author Niels Christian Nielsen has written that the post-Soviet population in areas which were formerly predominantly Orthodox are now "nearly illiterate regarding religion", almost completely lacking the intellectual or philosophical aspects of their faith and having almost no knowledge of other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Niels Christian, Jr., [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ts6w8JumlQMC&amp;d Christianity After Communism], p. 77-78, Westview Press 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, their knowledge of their faith and the faith of others notwithstanding, many post-Soviet populations have a large presence of religious followers. In Russia, the 2007 International Religious Freedom Report published by the US Department of State said that approximately 100 million citizens consider themselves Russian Orthodox Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90196.htm|accessdate=2008-04-08|title=Russia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
