'''Dog-whistle politics''', also known as a '''code word''', is a term used to describe a type of political campaigning or speechmaking using coded language, which appears to mean one thing to the general population but which has a different or more specific meaning for a targeted subgroup of the audience. The term is usually used pejoratively by those that do not approve of the tactics. Ian Welsh [http://agonist.org/ian_welsh/20060925/just_a_comma_dog_whistle_politics wrote about it] as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you speak in code(...), most of the time the only people who hear and understand what you just said are the intended group, who have an understanding of the world and a use of words that is not shared by the majority of the population.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term is by analogy to [[dog whistle]]s, built in such a way that humans cannot hear them due to their high [[frequency]], but dogs can. It could be argued that the term is disparaging of those who can hear the dog whistle message.

The term originated in [[Australian politics]] in the mid 1990s. One notable example was it's use to describe the [[John Howard|Howard Government's]] policy crack down on illegal immigration. The Australian Government took a strong stand against illegal immigration, which was highly popular amongst a segment of voters on both sides of the usual political divide, and which contributed to the [[Australian federal election, 2001|winning of the 2001 Australian Federal Election]].  As a reaction to this political success, some commentators have argued that the stand was playing to racist segments of the community, despite the Government's avoidance of ''overtly'' racist terminology. The Howard Government has used dog whistling as a technique to send a message of support to voters with racist leanings while avoiding critisism from those opposed to prejudice. The key to its use is to maintain the option of "plausible deniability"[http://www.tai.org.au/documents/downloads/DP96.pdf]. An example is the publicity of the citizenship test in 2007 [http://www.citizenship.gov.au/test/index.htm]. It has been argued that the test may appear reasonable at face value, but is really intended to appeal to those opposing immigration from some regions [http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/no-question-about-a-citizenship-test/2006/12/12/1165685675052.html].

The term was introduced to the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Matthew Parris]] in ''[[The Times]]'' on October 31, 2003 in an article about [[Michael Howard]] entitled [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1005337.ece "He is not a rotter and I wish him well (warily)"].  After the phrase caught on in the UK, [[Matthew Parris]] writes in ''[[The Spectator]]'' on April 30, 2005 in an article called [http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/cartoons/13599/only-the-tories-can-cut-the-state-down-to-size.thtml "Only the Tories can cut the state down to size"] about having introduced it.

This approach is a separate strategy from the less nuanced approach of [[wedge politics]] often employed in the [[United States]]. Still, several examples of "dog whistle politics" are thought to exist in American politics. 

In the United States, President [[George W. Bush]] is said to use coded language in his speeches to send messages to his supporters among the [[religious right]] that will be ignored by other parts of the U.S. population. Examples include his frequent use of biblical phrases and the veiled mention of the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'']] Supreme Court decision in the 2004 Presidential debates.  The latter refers to overturning ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which is likened to the ''Dred Scott'' case by some of its critics.
