{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2016}}

'''Dog-whistle politics''' is political messaging employing coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional, different, or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup. The analogy is to a [[dog whistle]], whose [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] tone is heard by dogs but inaudible to humans.

The term is often confused with ''[[Code word (figure of speech)|code words]]'' used in some specialist professions, but can be distinguished in that dog-whistling is specific to the political realm, and the messaging referred to as the dog-whistle has an understandable meaning for a general audience, rather than being incomprehensible.{{vn|date=August 2019}}

==Origin and meaning==
According to [[William Safire]], the term "dog whistle" in reference to politics may have been derived from its use in the field of [[opinion poll]]ing. Safire quotes Richard Morin, director of polling for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', as writing in 1988, "subtle changes in question-wording sometimes produce remarkably different results&amp;nbsp;... researchers call this the 'Dog Whistle Effect': Respondents hear something in the question that researchers do not".&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190"&gt;{{cite book |last=Safire |first=William |author-link=William Safire |date=2008 |title=Safire's Political Dictionary |edition=Revised |location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=190 |isbn=978-0-19-534334-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; He speculates that campaign workers adapted the phrase from political pollsters.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190" /&gt;

In her 2006 book, ''Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia'', academic [[Amanda Lohrey]] writes that the goal of the dog-whistle is to appeal to the greatest possible number of electors while alienating the smallest possible number. She uses as an example politicians choosing broadly appealing words such as "[[family values]]", which have extra resonance for Christians, while avoiding overt Christian moralizing that might be a turn-off for non-Christian voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lohrey |first=Amanda|title=Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia |date=2006 |publisher=Black Inc. |location=Melbourne |isbn=1-86395-230-6 |pages=48–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian political theorist [[Robert E. Goodin]] argues that the problem with dog-whistling is that it undermines democracy, because if voters have different understandings of what they were supporting during a campaign, the fact that they were seeming to support the same thing is "democratically meaningless" and does not give the dog-whistler a [[Mandate (politics)|policy mandate]].&lt;ref name="Goodin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodin |first=Robert E. |title=Innovating Democracy: Democratic Theory and Practice after the Deliberative Turn |date=2008 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-954794-4 |pages=224–228 |edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and usage==

===Australia===
The term was first picked up in [[Australian politics]] in the mid-1990s, and was frequently applied to the political campaigning of [[John Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant Barrett, ''The official dictionary of unofficial English'', McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[Howard Government|his 11 years]] as [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian prime minister]] and particularly in his fourth term, Howard was accused of communicating messages appealing to anxious Australian voters using [[Code word (figure of speech)|code words]] such as "un-Australian", "mainstream", and "illegals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soutphommasane |first=Tim |title=Reclaiming Patriotism: Nation-building for Australian Progressives |date=2009 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Melbourne |isbn=978-0-521-13472-9 |pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gelber |first=Katharine |title=Speech Matters: Getting Free Speech Right |publisher=[[University of Queensland]] Press |location=St Lucia, Qld. |isbn=0-7022-3873-2 |pages=end–notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable example was the Howard government's message on refugee arrivals. His government's tough stance on immigration was popular with voters, but was accused of using the issue to additionally send veiled messages of support to voters with racist leanings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Garran |first=Robert |title=True believer: John Howard, George Bush and the American Alliance |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC |date=2004 |publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]] |isbn=978-1-74114-418-5 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC&amp;pg=PA18 18] |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining [[plausible deniability]] by avoiding overtly racist language.&lt;ref name=TAIFear&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Fear |url= http://www.tai.org.au/sites/default/files/DP96_8.pdf |title=Under the Radar: Dog-whistle Politics in Australia] |work=TAI.org.au |publisher=[[The Australia Institute]] |date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the publicity of the [[Australian citizenship test]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=TAIFear /&gt; It has been argued that the test may appear reasonable at face value, but is really intended to appeal to those opposing immigration from particular geographic regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/no-question-about-a-citizenship-test/2006/12/12/1165685675052.html |title=No Question About a Citizenship Test  |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=December 13, 2006 |access-date=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

During the [[2015 Canadian federal election]], the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative party]] led by incumbent Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] was accused of communicating "code" words in a debate to appeal to his party's base supporters. Midway through the election campaign the Conservative Party hired Australian political strategist [[Lynton Crosby]] as a political adviser when they fell to third place in the polls behind the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the [[New Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-hire-high-profile-australian-strategist-to-reboot-campaign/article26315392/ |title=Controversial Australian strategist to help with Tories' campaign |first=Steven |last=Chase |date=September 11, 2015 |access-date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a televised election debate Stephen Harper, while discussing the government's controversial decision to remove certain immigrants and refugee claimants from accessing Canada's health care system made reference to '[[Old Stock Canadians]]' as being in support of the government's position. Opposition leaders, including former Quebec Liberal MP [[Marlene Jennings]], called his words racist and divisive, as they are used to exclude Canadians of Color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/harper-old-stock-canadians-debate-1.3233615 |title=Harper's 'Old-stock Canadians' Line is Part Deliberate Strategy: Pollster |date=September 18, 2015 |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |access-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Lynton Crosby, who had previously managed [[John Howard]]'s four election campaigns in Australia, worked as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] adviser during the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 UK general election]], and the term was introduced to British political discussion at this time.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190"/&gt; In what Goodin calls "the classic case" of dog-whistling,&lt;ref name="Goodin" /&gt; Crosby created a campaign for the Conservatives with the slogan "Are you thinking what we're thinking?": a series of posters, billboards, TV commercials and direct mail pieces with messages like "It's not racist to impose limits on immigration" and "how would you feel if a bloke on early release attacked your daughter?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lees-Marshment |first=Jennifer |title=Political Marketing: Principles and Applications |date=2009 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-43128-6 |pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on controversial issues like insanitary hospitals, land grabs by squatters and restraints on police behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCallister |first=J.

In April 2016, [[Mayor of London]] and [[Conservative Party (United Kingdom)|Conservative]] [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] [[Boris Johnson]] was accused of "dog whistle racism" by [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[John McDonnell]] when Johnson suggested [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] held a grudge against the United Kingdom due to his "ancestral dislike of the [[British Empire]]" as a result of his "part-Kenyan" heritage, after Obama expressed his support for the UK to vote to remain in the [[European Union]] ahead of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|UK's referendum on EU membership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[John McDonnell]] |user=johnmcdonnellMP |number=723481596096090112 |date=April 22, 2016 |title=Mask slips again.

===United States===
The phrase "[[states' rights]]", literally referring to powers of individual state governments in the United States, was described in 2007 by David Greenberg in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' as "code words" for institutionalized segregation and racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2007/11/dogwhistling_dixie.html |title=Dog-Whistling Dixie.

{{quote|You start out in 1954 by saying, "[[Nigger]], nigger, nigger." By 1968, you can't say "nigger" – that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like [[forced busing]], states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now, you're talking about cutting taxes. And all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me – because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "Nigger, nigger."}}

Atwater was contrasting this with [[Ronald Reagan]]'s campaign, which he felt "was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference."  However, [[Ian Haney López]], an American law professor and author of the 2014 book ''Dog Whistle Politics'',  described Reagan as "blowing a dog whistle" when the candidate told stories about "[[Cadillac]]-driving '[[welfare queen]]s' and 'strapping young bucks' buying T-bone steaks with [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]" while he was campaigning for the presidency.&lt;ref name="Lopez_2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haney López |first=Ian |date=2014 |title=Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class |location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=4 |isbn=978-0-19-996427-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ Full Show: Ian Haney López on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I].

According to López, conservative middle-class whites, convinced by powerful economic interests that minorities are the enemy, supported politicians who promised to curb illegal immigration and crack down on crime but inadvertently also voted for policies that favor the extremely rich, such as slashing taxes for top income brackets, giving corporations more regulatory control over industry and financial markets, [[union busting]], cutting pensions for future public employees, reducing funding for public schools, and retrenching the social welfare state. He argues that these same voters cannot link rising inequality which has impacted their lives to the policy agendas they support, which resulted in a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% of the population since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ |title=Ian Haney López on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I |work=[[Moyers &amp; Company]] |date=February 28, 2014 |via=BillMoyers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2014 |isbn=978-0-19-996427-7 |url= https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dog-whistle-politics-9780199964277?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141218104049/https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dog-whistle-politics-9780199964277?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |archive-date=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[Craig Unger]] wrote that President [[George W.

Sandford|Dred Scott]]'' decision denying the [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizenship]] of any [[African American]]. To most listeners the criticism seemed innocuous, Safire wrote, but "sharp-eared observers" understood the remark to be a pointed reminder that Supreme Court decisions can be reversed, and a signal that, if re-elected, Bush might nominate to the Supreme Court a justice who would overturn ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190" /&gt; This view is echoed in a 2004 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article by Peter Wallsten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2004/oct/13/nation/na-dred13 |title=Abortion Foes Call Bush's Dred Scott Reference Perfectly Clear
