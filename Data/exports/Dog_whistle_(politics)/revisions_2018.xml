'''Dog-whistle politics''' is political messaging employing coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional, different, or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup. The analogy is to a [[dog whistle]], whose [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] whistling sound is heard by dogs but inaudible to humans.

The term can be distinguished from "[[Code word (figure of speech)|code words]]" used in some specialist professions, in that dog-whistling is specific to the political realm. The messaging referred to as the dog-whistle has an understandable meaning for a general audience, rather than being incomprehensible.

==Origin and meaning==
According to [[William Safire]], the term "dog whistle" in reference to politics may have been derived from its use in the field of [[opinion poll]]ing. Safire quotes Richard Morin, director of polling for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', as writing in 1988,&lt;blockquote&gt;subtle changes in question-wording sometimes produce remarkably different results... researchers call this the 'Dog Whistle Effect': Respondents hear something in the question that researchers do not&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190"&gt;{{cite book |last=Safire |first=William |date=2008 |title=Safire's political dictionary |edition=Rev. |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=190 |isbn=0-19-534334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;and speculates that campaign workers adapted the phrase from political pollsters.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190" /&gt;

In her 2006 book, ''Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia'', academic [[Amanda Lohrey]] writes that the goal of the dog-whistle is to appeal to the greatest possible number of electors while alienating the smallest possible number. She uses as an example Australian politicians using broadly appealing words such as "family" and "values", which have extra resonance for Christians, while avoiding overt Christian moralizing that might be a turn-off for non-Christian voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lohrey|first=Amanda|title=Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia|year=2006|publisher=Black Inc.|location=Melbourne, Vic.|isbn=1-86395-230-6|pages=48–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian political theorist [[Robert E. Goodin]] argues that the problem with dog-whistling is that it undermines democracy, because if voters have different understandings of what they were supporting during a campaign, the fact that they were seeming to support the same thing is "democratically meaningless" and does not give the dog-whistler a [[Mandate (politics)|policy mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodin|first=Robert E.|title=Innovating Democracy: Democratic Theory and Practice after the Deliberative Turn|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-954794-7|pages=224–228|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and usage==

===Australia===
The term was first picked up in [[Australian politics]] in the mid-1990s, and was frequently applied to the political campaigning of [[John Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant Barrett, ''The official dictionary of unofficial English'', McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[Howard Government|his 11 years]] as [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian prime minister]] and particularly in his fourth term, Howard was accused of communicating messages appealing to anxious Australian voters using code words such as "un-Australian", "mainstream", and "illegals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soutphommasane|first=Tim|title=Reclaiming patriotism: nation-building for Australian progressives|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-521-13472-2|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelber|first=Katharine|title=Speech matters: getting free speech right|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=St Lucia, Qld.|isbn=0-7022-3873-2|pages=end-notes|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable example was the Howard government's message on refugee arrivals. The Howard government's tough stance on refugee arrivals was popular with voters, but the government was accused of using the issue to additionally send veiled messages of support to voters with racist leanings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Garran|first=Robert|title=True believer: John Howard, George Bush and the American alliance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC|year=2004|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-1-74114-418-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC&amp;pg=PA18 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining [[plausible deniability]] by avoiding overtly racist language.&lt;ref name=TAIFear&gt;Josh Fear, ''[https://www.tai.org.au/documents/downloads/DP96.pdf Under the Radar: Dog-whistle politics in Australia]'', [[The Australia Institute]], September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the publicity of the [[Australian citizenship test]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=TAIFear /&gt; It has been argued that the test may appear reasonable at face value, but is really intended to appeal to those opposing immigration from particular geographic regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Editorial | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/no-question-about-a-citizenship-test/2006/12/12/1165685675052.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=No question about a citizenship test | date=December 13, 2006 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

During the [[Canadian federal election, 2015|2015 Canadian federal election]], the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative party]] led by incumbent Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] was accused of communicating 'code' words in a debate to appeal to his party's base supporters. Midway through the election campaign the Conservative Party hired Australian political strategist [[Lynton Crosby]] as a political adviser when they fell to third place in the polls behind the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the [[New Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-hire-high-profile-australian-strategist-to-reboot-campaign/article26315392/|title=Controversial Australian strategist to help with Tories' campaign|first=Steven|last=Chase|date=11 September 2015|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a televised election debate Stephen Harper, while discussing the government's controversial decision to remove certain immigrants and refugee claimants from accessing Canada's health care system made reference to '[[Old Stock Canadians]]' as being in support of the government's position. Opposition leader reacted calling his words racist and divisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/harper-old-stock-canadians-debate-1.3233615|title=Harper's 'old-stock Canadians' line is part deliberate strategy: pollster|date=18 September 2015|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In France, the phrase "a band of youths" in Paris tends to mean North African descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Reflections-Revolution-Europe-Immigration-Islam/dp/0307276759|date=2009|page=14|title=Reflections on the Revolution In Europe|first=Christopher|last=Caldwell|access-date=February 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[Lynton Crosby]], who had previously managed [[John Howard]]'s four election campaigns in Australia, worked as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] adviser during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 UK general election]], and the term was introduced to British political discussion at this time.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190"/&gt; In what Goodin calls "the classic case" of dog-whistling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodin|first=Robert E.|title=Innovating democracy: democratic theory and practice after the deliberative turn|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-954794-7|pages=226|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby created a campaign for the Conservatives with the slogan "Are you thinking what we're thinking?": a series of posters, billboards, TV commercials and direct mail pieces with messages like "It's not racist to impose limits on immigration" and "how would you feel if a bloke on early release attacked your daughter?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lees-Marshment|first=Jennifer|title=Political marketing: principles and applications|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-43128-X|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on controversial issues like unsanitary hospitals, land grabs by gypsies and restraints on police behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCallister|first=J.F.O.|title=Whistling In the Dark?|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1044651,00.html|accessdate=9 September 2012|newspaper=Time |date=3 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seawright|first=David|title=The British Conservative Party and one nation politics|year=2007|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=0-8264-8974-5|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour MP [[Diane Abbott]] described the 2013 [["Go Home" vans]] advertising campaign by the British [[Home Office]] as an example of dog-whistle politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/26/go-home-ad-campaign-court-challenge|title='Go home' ad campaign targeting illegal immigrants faces court challenge|last=Taylor|first=Matthew|last2=Gidda|first2=Mirren|date=2013-07-26|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07|last3=Syal|first3=Rajeev}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/governments-go-home-vans-backed-by-immigration-minister-mark-harper-8889358.html|title=Government's 'Go home' vans backed by Immigration Minister Mark Harper|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-GB|first=James|last=Legge|date=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016 [[Mayor of London]] and Conservative [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] [[Boris Johnson]] was accused of "dog whistle racism" by [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] when Johnson suggested [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Barack Obama]] held a grudge against the United Kingdom due to his "ancestral dislike of the [[British Empire]]" as a result of his "part-Kenyan" heritage after Obama expressed his support for the UK to vote to remain in the [[European Union]] ahead of the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|UK's referendum on EU membership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]] |user= johnmcdonnellMP|number= 723481596096090112 |date= 22 April 2016 |title= Mask slips again.

In the [[2016 London Mayoral Election]], Conservative candidate [[Zac Goldsmith]] was accused of running a dog-whistle campaign against Labour's [[Sadiq Khan]], playing on Khan's Muslim faith by suggesting he would target Hindus and Sikhs with a "jewellery tax" and attempting to link him to extremists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=15 March 2016  |title= The deafening dogwhistle of Zac Goldsmith’s London mayoral campaign leaflets |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2016/03/deafening-dogwhistle-zac-goldsmith-s-london-mayoral-campaign-leaflets |publisher = [[New Statesman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bienkov |first=Adam |date=4 October 2016 |title=Ethnic minority Tories say Zac Goldsmith's dog-whistle campaign badly damaged party  |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2016/10/04/ethnic-minority-tories-zac-goldsmith-damaged-party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The phrase "[[states' rights]]", literally referring to powers of individual state governments in the United States, was described in 2007 by David Greenberg in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' as "code words" for institutionalized segregation and racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2007/11/dogwhistling_dixie.html | title=Dog-Whistling Dixie.

{{quote|Y'all don't quote me on this. You start out in 1954 by saying, "[[Nigger]], nigger, nigger." By 1968, you can't say "nigger" &amp;mdash; that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like [[forced busing]], states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me &amp;mdash; because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "Nigger, nigger."|Lee Atwater, Republican Party strategist in an anonymous interview in 1981}}

Atwater was contrasting this with [[Ronald Reagan]]'s campaign, which he felt "was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference."  However, others like U.S. law professor and author of the 2014 book ''Dog Whistle Politics'' [[Ian Haney-López]] described Reagan as "blowing a dog whistle" when the candidate told stories about "[[Cadillac]]-driving '[[welfare queen]]s' and 'strapping young bucks' buying T-bone steaks with [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]" while he was campaigning for the presidency.&lt;ref name="Lopez_2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haney López |first=Ian |date=2014 |title=Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=4 |isbn=978-0-19-996427-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ Full Show: Ian Haney López on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I].

According to López, conservative middle-class whites, convinced by powerful economic interests that minorities are the enemy, supported politicians who promised to curb illegal immigration and crack down on crime but inadvertently also voted for policies that favor the extremely rich, such as slashing taxes for top income brackets, giving corporations more regulatory control over industry and financial markets, [[union busting]], cutting pensions for future public employees, reducing funding for public schools, and retrenching the social welfare state. He argues that these same voters cannot link rising inequality which has impacted their lives to the policy agendas they support, which resulted in a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% of the population since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ Full Show: Ian Haney López on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I].

Sandford|Dred Scott]] decision denying the [[Citizenship in the United States|U. S. citizenship]] of any [[African American]]. To most listeners the criticism seemed innocuous, Safire wrote, but "sharp-eared observers" understood the remark to be a pointed reminder that Supreme Court decisions can be reversed, and a signal that, if re-elected, Bush might nominate to the Supreme Court a justice who would overturn ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190" /&gt; This view is echoed in a 2004 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article by Peter Wallsten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/oct/13/nation/na-dred13 | title=Abortion Foes Call Bush's Dred Scott Reference Perfectly Clear
