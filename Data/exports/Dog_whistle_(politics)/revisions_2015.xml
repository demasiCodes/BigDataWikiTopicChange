'''Dog-whistle politics''' is political messaging employing coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has an additional, different or more specific resonance for a targeted subgroup. The phrase is often used as a pejorative, because of the inherently deceptive nature of the practice and because the dog-whistle messages are frequently distasteful to the general populace. The analogy is to a [[dog whistle]], whose high-frequency whistle is heard by dogs but inaudible to humans.

The term can be distinguished from "[[Code word (figure of speech)|code words]]" used in some specialist professions, in that dog-whistling is specific to the political realm. The messaging referred to as the dog-whistle has an understandable meaning for a general audience, rather than being incomprehensible.

==Origin and meaning==
According to [[William Safire]], the term "dog whistle" in reference to politics may have been derived from its use in the field of [[opinion poll]]ing. Safire quotes [[Richard Morin]], director of polling for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', as writing in 1988, "subtle changes in question-wording sometimes produce remarkably different results.... researchers call this the 'Dog Whistle Effect': Respondents hear something in the question that researchers do not", and speculates that campaign workers adapted the phrase from political pollsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=Safire's political dictionary|year=2008|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York |isbn=0-19-534334-4|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia'', academic [[Amanda Lohrey]] writes that the goal of the dog-whistle is to appeal to the greatest possible number of electors while alienating the smallest possible number. She uses as an example Australian politicians using broadly-appealing words such as "family" and "values", which have extra resonance for Christians, while avoiding overt Christian moralizing that might be a turn-off for non-Christian voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lohrey|first=Amanda|title=Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia|year=2006|publisher=Black Inc.|location=Melbourne, Vic.|isbn=1-86395-230-6|pages=48–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian political theorist [[Robert E. Goodin]] argues that the problem with dog-whistling is that it undermines democracy, because if voters have different understandings of what they were supporting during a campaign, the fact that they were seeming to support the same thing is "democratically meaningless" and does not give the dog-whistler a [[Mandate (politics)|policy mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodin|first=Robert E.|title=Innovating Democracy: Democratic Theory and Practice after the Deliberative Turn|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-954794-7|pages=224–228|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and usage==

===Australia===
The term originated in [[Australian politics]] in the mid-1990s, and was frequently applied to the political campaigning of [[John Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant Barrett, ''The official dictionary of unofficial English'', McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout his 11 years as Australian prime minister and particularly in his fourth term, Howard was accused of communicating messages appealing to anxious and perhaps racist white Australian voters using code words such as "un-Australian", "mainstream" and "illegals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soutphommasane|first=Tim|title=Reclaiming patriotism: nation-building for Australian progressives|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-521-13472-2|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelber|first=Katharine|title=Speech matters: getting free speech right|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=St Lucia, Qld.|isbn=0-7022-3873-2|pages=end-notes|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable example was the Howard government's message on illegal immigration. The Howard government's tough stance on illegal immigration was popular with voters, but the government was accused of using the issue to additionally send veiled messages of support to voters with racist leanings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Garran|first=Robert|title=True believer: John Howard, George Bush and the American alliance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC|year=2004|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-1-74114-418-5|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC&amp;pg=PA18 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining [[plausible deniability]] by avoiding overtly racist language.&lt;ref name=TAIFear&gt;Josh Fear, ''[https://www.tai.org.au/documents/downloads/DP96.pdf Under the Radar: Dog-whistle politics in Australia]'', [[The Australia Institute]], September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the publicity of the citizenship test in 2007.&lt;ref name=TAIFear /&gt; It has been argued that the test may appear reasonable at face value, but is really intended to appeal to those opposing immigration from particular geographic regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Editorial | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/no-question-about-a-citizenship-test/2006/12/12/1165685675052.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=No question about a citizenship test | date=December 13, 2006 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Australian political strategist [[Lynton Crosby]], who had previously managed [[John Howard]]'s four election campaigns in Australia, worked as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative Party]] advisor during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 British general election]], and the term was introduced to British political discussion at this time.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190"/&gt; In what Goodin calls "the classic case" of dog-whistling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodin|first=Robert E.|title=Innovating democracy: democratic theory and practice after the deliberative turn|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-954794-7|pages=226|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby created a campaign for the UK Conservatives with the slogan "Are you thinking what we're thinking?": a series of posters, billboards, TV commercials and direct mail pieces with messages like "It's not racist to impose limits on immigration" and "how would you feel if a bloke on early release attacked your daughter?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lees-Marshment|first=Jennifer|title=Political marketing: principles and applications|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-43128-X|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on hot-button issues like dirty hospitals, landgrabs by "gypsies" and restraints on police behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCallister|first=J.F.O.|title=Whistling In the Dark?|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1044651,00.html|accessdate=9 September 2012|newspaper=Time |date=3 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seawright|first=David|title=The British Conservative Party and one nation politics|year=2007|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=0-8264-8974-5|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
U.S. law professor and author of the book ''Dog Whistle Politics ''[[Ian Haney-López]] described [[Ronald Reagan]] as "blowing a dog whistle" when the candidate told stories about "Cadillac-driving '[[welfare queen]]s' and 'strapping young bucks' buying T-bone steaks with food stamps" while he was campaigning for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1 = Ian Haney|last1 = López|first2 = |last2 = |first3 = |last3 = |first4 = |last4 = |title = Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class|url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dog-whistle-politics-9780199964277?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|publisher = Oxford University Press|journal = |date = January 13, 2014|location = |issn = |isbn = 9780199964277|pages = |volume = |series = |issue = |doi = |accessdate = Aug 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ Full Show: Ian Haney López on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I].

Journalist [[Craig Unger]] wrote that President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Karl Rove]] used coded "dog-whistle" language in political campaigning, delivering one message to the overall electorate while at the same time delivering quite a different message to a targeted [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] political base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Craig |title=The Fall of the House of Bush: The Untold Story of How a Band of True believers seized the executive branch, started the Iraq War, and still imperils America's future|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pSQJLqms8CcC|year=2007|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|isbn=978-0-7432-8075-4|chapter=11.

Sandford|Dred Scott]] decision denying the [[Citizenship in the United States|U. S. citizenship]] of any [[African American]]. To most listeners the criticism seemed innocuous, Safire wrote, but "sharp-eared observers" understood the remark to be a pointed reminder that Supreme Court decisions can be reversed, and a signal that, if re-elected, Bush might nominate to the Supreme Court a justice who would overturn ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190"&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=Safire's political dictionary|year=2008|publisher=Oxford Univ.

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] in ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]'' (2007) extensively discusses the subtle use of dog-whistle political rhetoric by [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], [[Irving Kristol]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] in building the rightist "[[movement conservatism]]".

During the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic primaries]], several writers criticized [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign's reliance on code words and innuendo seemingly designed to frame Barack Obama's race as problematic, saying Obama was characterized by the Clinton campaign and its prominent supporters as anti-white due to his association with [[Reverend Wright|Reverend Jeremiah Wright]], as able to attract only black votes, as anti-patriotic, a drug user, possibly a drug seller, and married to an angry, ungrateful black woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Logan|first=Enid Lynette|title="At this defining moment": Barack Obama's presidential candidacy and the new politics of race|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-5298-5|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama was accused of dog-whistling to African-American voters by using a blend of gestures, style and rhetoric, such as fist-bumps and walking with a "street lope," that carefully affirmed and underscored his black identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Haney-Lopez|title=Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Wrecked the Middle Class|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cZe1AQAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-996427-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2014}}

In 2012, journalist [[Soledad O'Brien]] used the phrase 'dog whistle' to describe [[Tea Party Express]] representative [[Amy Kremer]]'s accusation that President [[Barack Obama]] 'does not love America'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/09/04/cnns-soledad-obrien-confronts-tea-party-express-spokeswoman/ | title=CNN's Soledad O'Brien confronts Tea Party Express spokeswoman over 'very odd comment'

During the [[United States presidential election, 2012]], conservative political commentator [[Ben Shapiro]] accused the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|Obama campaign]] of [[anti-Semitic]] dog whistling after campaign staffer [[Julianna Smoot]] said in an email that [[Paul Ryan]] was {{"'}}making a pilgrimage' to Las Vegas to 'kiss the ring{{'"}} of Republican mega-donor [[Sheldon Adelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ben Shapiro |date=August 14, 2012 |url=http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/08/14/Obama-campaign-anti-Ryan-Adelson |title=Obama Campaign: Ryan 'Kisses the Ring' of Jewish Megadonor Adelson |publisher=''Breitbart'' |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was described as "a classic anti-Semitic dog whistle signaling voters that Ryan is in the thrall of the 'Israel Lobby'."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan S. Tobin (August 15, 2012) "[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2012/08/15/whos-anti-semitic-dog-whistling-now-sheldon-adelson-paul-rya/ Whose Anti-Semitic Dog Whistling Now?]" ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]''.

Also in that election cycle, Obama's campaign ran an ad that said Mitt Romney is "not one of us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgiuq2uR6LA|title=Made in Ohio - Obama for America TV Ad|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad, which ''Washington Post'' journalist Karen Tumulty said "echoes a slogan that has been used as a racial code over at least the past half-century",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/obama-mitt-romney-not-one-of-us/2012/10/22/e78714ba-1bb3-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_story.html|title=Obama’s ‘not one of us’ attack on Romney echoes racial code|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; ran in Ohio, a state that is only 0.52% Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership statistics (United States)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States Senate Republican primary election in Mississippi, 2014]], a scandal emerged where politicians were accused of playing the [[Race card]] by using such "[[Code word (figure of speech)|code words]]" as "food stamps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall |first=Sam |url=http://www.clarionledger.com/story/dailyledes/2014/08/04/democrat-kkk-radio-ads/13584097/ |title=Harris denies anyone tied to Cochran involved in KKK ads |publisher=ClarionLedger.Com |date=2014-08-05 |accessdate=2014-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fund"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fund |first=John |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/381187/flier-got-thad-cochran-elected-john-fund |title=The Flier That Got Thad Cochran Elected? |publisher=National Review |date=2014-07-25 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/27/article-2672565-1F31B99200000578-214_306x509.jpg |title=The Tea Party Intends to prevent you from VOTING }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/08/06/why-im-moving-to-censure-henry-barbour-in-the-rnc-over-race-baiting-ads/|title=Why I’m Moving To Censure Henry Barbour In The RNC Over Race-Baiting Ads|publisher=''Daily Caller'' |date=8 August 2014|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Ted Cruz]] called for an investigation,&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marklevinshow.com/common/page.php?pt=Ted+Cruz%3A+We+Need+An+Investigation+Into+the+Mississippi+Race&amp;id=10103|title=Ted Cruz: We Need An Investigation Into the Mississippi Race|publisher=''The Mark Levin Show'' |date=7 July 2014|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "the ads they ran were racially-charged false attacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan |first=Sean |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/07/07/ted-cruz-slams-d-c-machine-over-mississippi-runoff-wants-voter-fraud-investigation/ |title=Ted Cruz slams ‘D.C. machine’ over Mississippi runoff, wants voter-fraud investigation |publisher=Washington Post |date=2014-07-25 |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
