The phrase is only ever used as a pejorative, because of the inherently deceptive nature of the practice and because the dog-whistle messages are frequently themselves distasteful, for example by empathising with racist or revolutionary attitudes. It is an analogy to [[dog whistle]]s, which are built in such a way that their high-frequency whistle is heard by dogs, but is inaudible to humans.

The term can be distinguished from "[[Code word (figure of speech)|code words]]" used by hospital staff or other specialist workers, in that dog-whistling is specific to the political realm, and the messaging referred to as the dog-whistle has an understandable meaning for a general audience, rather than being incomprehensible.

==Origin and meaning==
According to [[William Safire]], the phrase may have been borrowed from the field of [[opinion poll]]ing. Safire quotes [[Richard Morin]], director of polling for [[The Washington Post]], as writing in 1988 that "subtle changes in question-wording sometimes produce remarkably different results. ... researchers call this the 'Dog Whistle Effect': Respondents hear something in the question that researchers do not," and speculates that campaign workers adapted the phrase from political pollsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=Safire's political dictionary|year=2008|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-19-534334-4|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her book ''Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia'', academic [[Amanda Lohrey]] writes that the goal of the dog-whistle is to appeal to the greatest possible number of electors while alienating the smallest possible number. She uses as an example Australian politicians using broadly-appealing words such as "family" and "values" which have extra resonance for Christians, while avoiding overt Christian moralizing that might be a turn-off for non-Christian voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lohrey|first=Amanda|title=Voting for Jesus: Christianity and politics in Australia|year=2006|publisher=Black Inc.|location=Melbourne, Vic.|isbn=1-86395-230-6|pages=48–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Australian political theorist [[Robert E. Goodin]] argues that the problem with dog-whistling is that it undermines democracy, because if voters have different understandings of what they were supporting during a campaign, the fact that they were seeming to support the same thing is "democratically meaningless" and does not give the dog-whistler a [[policy mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodin|first=Robert E.|title=Innovating democracy: democratic theory and practice after the deliberative turn|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-954794-7|pages=224–228|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and usage==
The term originated in [[Australian politics]] in the mid-1990s, and was frequently applied to the political campaigning of [[John Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant Barrett, ''The official dictionary of unofficial English'', McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006, p 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Throughout his 11 years as Australian prime minister and particularly in his fourth term, Howard was accused of communicating messages appealing to anxious and perhaps racist white Australian voters using code words such as "un-Australian", "mainstream" and "illegals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soutphommasane|first=Tim|title=Reclaiming patriotism: nation-building for Australian progressives|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-521-13472-2|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelber|first=Katharine|title=Speech matters: getting free speech right|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=St Lucia, Qld.|isbn=0-7022-3873-2|pages=end-notes|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One notable example was the Howard government's messaging on illegal immigration. The Howard government's tough stance on illegal immigration was popular with voters, but the government was accused of using the issue to additionally send veiled messages of support to voters with racist leanings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Garran|first=Robert|title=True believer: John Howard, George Bush and the American alliance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC|year=2004|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-1-74114-418-5|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC&amp;pg=PA18 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining [[plausible deniability]] by avoiding overtly racist language.&lt;ref name=TAIFear&gt;Josh Fear, ''[https://www.tai.org.au/documents/downloads/DP96.pdf Under the Radar: Dog-whistle politics in Australia]'', [[The Australia Institute]], September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the publicity of the citizenship test in 2007.&lt;ref name=TAIFear /&gt; It has been argued that the test may appear reasonable at face value, but is really intended to appeal to those opposing immigration from particular geographic regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/no-question-about-a-citizenship-test/2006/12/12/1165685675052.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=No question about a citizenship test | date=December 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Dog-whistling was introduced to the UK from Australia {{dubious|Talk:Dog-whistle_politics#Dubious:_.22Dog-whistling_was_introduced_to_the_UK_from_Australia...In_the_2005_British_general_election.22|date=March 2013}} by Australian political strategist and [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative Party]] advisor [[Lynton Crosby]], who had previously managed [[John Howard]]'s four election campaigns in Australia.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190"&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=Safire's political dictionary|year=2008|publisher=Oxford Univ.

===United States===
Journalist [[Craig Unger]] writes that President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Karl Rove]] used coded "dog-whistle" language in political campaigning, delivering one message to the overall electorate while at the same time delivering quite a different message to a targeted [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] political base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Craig |title=The fall of the house of Bush: the untold story of how a band of true believers seized the executive branch, started the Iraq War, and still imperils America's future|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pSQJLqms8CcC|year=2007|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|isbn=978-0-7432-8075-4|chapter=11.

Sandford|Dred Scott]] decision upholding [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. To most listeners the criticism seemed innocuous, Safire wrote, but "sharp-eared observers" understood the remark to be a pointed reminder that Supreme Court decisions can be reversed, and a signal that, if re-elected, Bush might nominate to the Supreme Court a justice who would overturn [[Roe v. Wade]].&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190"/&gt; This view is echoed in a 2004 Los Angeles Times article by Peter Wallsten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/oct/13/nation/na-dred13 | title=Abortion Foes Call Bush's Dred Scott Reference Perfectly Clear

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] in ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]'' (2007) extensively discusses the subtle use of dog-whistle political rhetoric by [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], [[Irving Kristol]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] in building the rightist "[[movement conservatism]]". 

Law Professor [[Ian Haney-López]] in ''[[Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class]]'' (2014) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Dog Whistle Politics : How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class |url=http://www.amazon.com/Dog-Whistle-Politics-Appeals-Reinvented/dp/0199964270/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1383590748&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dog+whistle+politics |publisher= Oxford University Press |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses how candidates such as [[George Wallace]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Mitt Romney]] have utilized Dog Whistle political strategies to garner White votes and encourage White voters from all economic backgrounds to embrace harmful social and economic policies designed to benefit the ultra-rich.

One group of alleged [[Code word (figure of speech)|code words]] in the United States is claimed to appeal to racism of the intended audience. The phrase "[[states' rights]]", although literally referring to powers of individual state governments in the United States, was described by David Greenberg in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' as "code words" for institutionalized segregation and racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2007/11/dogwhistling_dixie.html | title=Dog-Whistling Dixie. When Reagan said "states' rights," he was talking about race | publisher=The Slate Group | date=Nov. 20, 2007 | accessdate=May 21, 2012 | author=Greenberg, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] strategist [[Lee_Atwater#Atwater_on_the_Southern_Strategy|Lee Atwater]] when giving an anonymous interview discussing the GOP's [[Southern Strategy]] (''see also [[Lee_Atwater#Atwater_on_the_Southern_Strategy|Lee Atwater on the Southern Strategy]]'') said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You start out in 1954 by saying, "[[Nigger]], nigger, nigger." [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|By 1968]], you can't say "nigger" &amp;mdash; that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like [[forced busing]], states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me &amp;mdash; because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "Nigger, nigger."&lt;ref&gt;Lamis, Alexander P. et al. (1990) ''The Two Party South.''

During the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic primaries]], in an example of a liberal candidate being accused of dog-whistling, several writers criticized [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign's reliance on code words and innuendo seemingly designed to frame Barack Obama's race as problematic, saying Obama was characterized by the Clinton campaign and its prominent supporters as anti-white due to his association with [[Reverend Wright|Reverend Jeremiah Wright]], as only able to get black votes, as anti-patriotic, a drug user, possibly a drug seller, and married to an angry, ungrateful black woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Logan|first=Enid Lynette|title="At this defining moment": Barack Obama's presidential candidacy and the new politics of race|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-5298-5|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, journalist [[Soledad O'Brien]] used the phrase 'dog whistle' to describe [[Tea Party Express]] representative [[Amy Kremer|Amy Kremer's]] accusation that President [[Barack Obama]] 'does not love America'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/09/04/cnns-soledad-obrien-confronts-tea-party-express-spokeswoman/ | title=CNN’s Soledad O’Brien confronts Tea Party Express spokeswoman over ‘very odd comment’
