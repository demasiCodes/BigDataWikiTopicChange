In politics, a '''dog whistle''' is the use of [[Loaded language|coded or suggestive language]] in political messaging to garner support from a particular group without provoking opposition. The concept is named after [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] [[dog whistle]]s, which are audible to dogs but not humans. Dog whistles use language that appears normal to the majority but communicates specific things to intended audiences. They are generally used to convey messages on issues likely to provoke controversy without attracting negative attention.

==Origin and meaning==
According to [[William Safire]], the term "dog whistle" in reference to politics may have been derived from its use in the field of [[opinion poll]]ing. Safire quotes Richard Morin, director of polling for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', as writing in 1988: &lt;blockquote&gt;
subtle changes in question-wording sometimes produce remarkably different results&amp;nbsp;... researchers call this the "Dog Whistle Effect": Respondents hear something in the question that researchers do not.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190"&gt;{{cite book |last=Safire |first=William |author-link=William Safire |date=2008 |title=Safire's Political Dictionary |edition=Revised |location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=190 |isbn=978-0-19-534334-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He speculates that campaign workers adapted the phrase from political pollsters.&lt;ref name="Safire 2008 190" /&gt;

In her 2006 book, ''Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia'', academic [[Amanda Lohrey]] writes that the goal of the dog-whistle is to appeal to the greatest possible number of electors while alienating the smallest possible number. She uses as an example politicians choosing broadly appealing words such as "[[family values]]", which have extra resonance for Christians, while avoiding overt Christian moralizing that might be a turn-off for non-Christian voters.&lt;ref name="9I6xx"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lohrey |first=Amanda|title=Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia |date=2006 |publisher=Black Inc. |location=Melbourne |isbn=1-86395-230-6 |pages=48–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian political theorist [[Robert E. Goodin]] argues that the problem with dog-whistling is that it undermines democracy, because if voters have different understandings of what they were supporting during a campaign, the fact that they were seeming to support the same thing is "democratically meaningless" and does not give the dog-whistler a [[Mandate (politics)|policy mandate]].&lt;ref name="Goodin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodin |first=Robert E. |title=Innovating Democracy: Democratic Theory and Practice after the Deliberative Turn |date=2008 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-954794-4 |pages=224–228 |edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and usage==

===Australia===
The term was first picked up in [[Australian politics]] in the mid-1990s, and was frequently applied to the political campaigning of [[John Howard]].&lt;ref name="bYiNp"&gt;Grant Barrett, ''The official dictionary of unofficial English'', McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout [[Howard Government|his 11 years]] as [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian prime minister]] and particularly in his fourth term, Howard was accused of communicating messages appealing to anxious Australian voters using [[Code word (figure of speech)|code words]] such as "un-Australian", "mainstream", and "illegals".&lt;ref name="e7GL8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Soutphommasane |first=Tim |title=Reclaiming Patriotism: Nation-building for Australian Progressives |date=2009 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Melbourne |isbn=978-0-521-13472-9 |pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tjWI1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gelber |first=Katharine |title=Speech Matters: Getting Free Speech Right |year=2011 |publisher=[[University of Queensland]] Press |location=St Lucia, Qld. |isbn=978-0-7022-3873-4 |pages=end–notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable example was the Howard government's message on refugee arrivals. His government's tough stance on [[Immigration to Australia|immigration]] was popular with voters, but was accused of using the issue to additionally send veiled messages of support to voters with [[racism in Australia|racist]] leanings,&lt;ref name="IWoUi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garran |first=Robert |title=True believer: John Howard, George Bush and the American Alliance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC |date=2004 |publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]] |isbn=978-1-74114-418-5 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC&amp;pg=PA18 18] |via=Google Books |access-date=August 5, 2016 |archive-date=July 26, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230726112118/https://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining [[plausible deniability]] by avoiding overtly racist language.&lt;ref name="TAIFear"&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Fear |url=http://www.tai.org.au/sites/default/files/DP96_8.pdf |title=Under the Radar: Dog-whistle Politics in Australia] |work=TAI.org.au |publisher=[[The Australia Institute]] |date=September 2007 |access-date=April 11, 2019 |archive-date=November 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112021055/https://www.tai.org.au/sites/default/files/DP96_8.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the publicity of the [[Australian citizenship test]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="TAIFear" /&gt; It has been argued that the test may appear reasonable at face value, but is really intended to appeal to those opposing immigration from particular geographic regions.&lt;ref name="KLDVx"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/no-question-about-a-citizenship-test/2006/12/12/1165685675052.html |title=No Question About a Citizenship Test |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=December 13, 2006 |access-date=July 17, 2014 |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924195822/http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/no-question-about-a-citizenship-test/2006/12/12/1165685675052.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

During the [[2015 Canadian federal election]], the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) drew attention to the [[Conservative Party of Canada| Conservative party]] (led by incumbent Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]) communicating "[a] codeword for non-white Canadians" in a debate to appeal to his party's base supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/harper-old-stock-canadians-debate-1.3233615 |title= Harper's 'Old-stock Canadians' Line is Part Deliberate Strategy: Pollster |date= September 18, 2015 |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |access-date= May 6, 2016 |archive-date= February 5, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210205083436/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/harper-old-stock-canadians-debate-1.3233615 |url-status=live | quote = A codeword for non-white Canadians [...] Former Quebec Liberal MP Marlene Jennings took offence to Harper's use of the phrase in the debate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Midway through the election campaign the Conservative Party had hired Australian political strategist [[Lynton Crosby]] as a political adviser when they fell to third place in the polls - behind the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the [[New Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="0kCMa"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-hire-high-profile-australian-strategist-to-reboot-campaign/article26315392/ |title= Controversial Australian strategist to help with Tories' campaign |first= Steven |last= Chase |date= September 11, 2015 |access-date=6 May 2016 |archive-date=March 8, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210308172906/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conservatives-hire-high-profile-australian-strategist-to-reboot-campaign/article26315392/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September 2015, during a televised election debate, Stephen Harper, while discussing the government's controversial decision to remove certain immigrants and refugee claimants from accessing Canada's health care system, made reference to "[[Old Stock Canadians]]" as being in support of the government's position. Opposition leaders, including former Quebec Liberal MP [[Marlene Jennings]], called his words racist and divisive, as they are used to exclude Canadians of colour.&lt;ref name="9ISYP"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/harper-old-stock-canadians-debate-1.3233615 |title= Harper's 'Old-stock Canadians' Line is Part Deliberate Strategy: Pollster |date= September 18, 2015 |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |access-date=May 6, 2016 |archive-date=February 5, 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210205083436/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/harper-old-stock-canadians-debate-1.3233615 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atwater was contrasting this with then-President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s campaign, which he felt "was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference". However, [[Ian Haney López]], an American law professor and author of the 2014 book ''Dog Whistle Politics'', described Reagan as "blowing a dog whistle" when the candidate told stories about "[[Cadillac]]-driving '[[welfare queen]]s' and 'strapping young bucks' buying T-bone steaks with [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]" while he was campaigning for the presidency.&lt;ref name="Lopez_2014"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haney López |first=Ian |date=2014 |title=Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class |location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=4 |isbn=978-0-19-996427-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JRsX9"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ian Haney López on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race (Part I) {{!}} Moyers &amp; Company |url=https://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ |access-date=2023-07-16 |website=BillMoyers.com |language=en-US |archive-date=December 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221217101310/https://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bpr_berkeley_2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2015/11/09/a-coded-political-mantra/ |title=A Coded Political Mantra |work=Berkeley Political Review |publisher=[[University of California Berkeley]] |date=November 9, 2015 |access-date=February 5, 2016 |last=Yao |first=Kevin |archive-date=July 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710162638/https://bpr.berkeley.edu/2015/11/09/a-coded-political-mantra/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that such rhetoric pushes middle-class white Americans to vote against their economic self-interest in order to punish "undeserving minorities" who, they believe, are receiving too much public assistance at their expense. According to López, conservative middle-class whites, convinced by powerful economic interests that minorities are the enemy, supported politicians who promised to curb illegal immigration and crack down on crime but inadvertently also voted for policies that favor the extremely rich, such as slashing taxes for top income brackets, giving corporations more regulatory control over industry and financial markets, [[union busting]], cutting pensions for future public employees, reducing funding for public schools, and retrenching the social welfare state. He argues that these same voters cannot link rising inequality which has affected their lives to the policy agendas they support, which resulted in a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1 percent of the population since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="atxAG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ |title=Ian Haney López on the Dog Whistle Politics of Race, Part I |work=[[Moyers &amp; Company]] |date=February 28, 2014 |via=BillMoyers.com |access-date=January 4, 2015 |archive-date=August 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815165213/http://billmoyers.com/episode/ian-haney-lopez-on-the-dog-whistle-politics-of-race/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H8hjB"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2014 |isbn=978-0-19-996427-7 |url= https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dog-whistle-politics-9780190229252?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141218104049/https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dog-whistle-politics-9780199964277?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |archive-date=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US the phrase "international bankers" is a well-known dog whistle code for Jews. Its use as such is derived from the anti-Semitic fabrication ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.

During [[Barack Obama]]'s campaign and presidency, a number of left-wing commentators described various statements about Obama as racist dog-whistles. During the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic primaries]], writer Enid Lynette Logan criticized [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign's reliance on code words and innuendo seemingly designed to frame Barack Obama's race as problematic, saying Obama was characterized by the Clinton campaign and its prominent supporters as anti-white due to his association with Rev.

== Criticism ==
Academics disagree on whether the dog-whistle notion has conceptual validity and furthermore on the mechanisms by which discourses identified as dog-whistles function. For instance, the sociologist Barry Hindess criticized Josh Fear's and Robert E. Goodin's respective attempts to theorize dog-whistles on the grounds that they did not pass the [[Max Weber|Weberian]] test of value neutrality: "In the case of the concept of ‘dog-whistle politics,’ we find that the investigator’s –in this case, Fear’s– disapproval enters into the definition of the object of study. Goodin avoids this problem, clearly signalling his disapproval –for example, with his ‘particularly pernicious’ (2008, p. 224)– but not letting it interfere with his own conceptualisation of the phenomenon. The difficulty here is that this abstinence leaves him with no real distinction between the general phenomena of coded messaging [...] and dog whistling in particular, leaving us to suspect that dog whistling should be seen not so much as a novel form of rhetoric, but rather, to borrow an image from Thomas Hobbes’ Leviathan, as a familiar form misliked."&lt;ref name="Whistling the Dog"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hindess|first=Barry|title=Whistling the Dog|date=August 31, 2023|pages=143–154|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13www0c.12|access-date=August 22, 2023|publisher=Australia National University Press|jstor=j.ctt13www0c.12|isbn=9781925021868|archive-date=December 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221202222437/https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13www0c.12|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the philosopher Carlos Santana corroborates Hindess's criticism of the dog-whistle notion as being dependent on the investigator's social and moral values during his own attempted definition writing: "We don’t want every instance of bi-level meaning in political discourse to count as dogwhistles, because not every instance of political doublespeak is problematic in the way prototypical dogwhistles like welfare queen and family values are. Some, like backhanded compliments to political rivals, aren’t a major source of social ills. Some, like aspirational hypocrisy (Quill 2010) and deliberate doublespeak meant to bring diverse constituencies together (Maloyed 2011), might even be socially beneficial. Keep in mind what makes dogwhistles problematic: they harm disadvantaged groups, undermine our ability to have a functioning plural society, and muddle our ability to reliably hold political figures responsible for their actions. Given our interest in addressing these harms, it makes sense to limit our definition of dogwhistles to the types of bi-level meaning which engender them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Santana |first=Carlos |title=What's wrong with dog-whistles |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josp.12409 |journal=Journal of Social Philosophy |date=2022 |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=387–403 |doi=10.1111/josp.12409 |s2cid=233649655 |access-date=August 23, 2023 |archive-date=August 23, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230823035259/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josp.12409 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; For another instance of criticism, albeit from another direction, the psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] has remarked that the concept of dog whistling allows people to "claim that anyone says anything because you can easily hear the alleged dogwhistles that aren't in the actual literal contents of what the person says".&lt;ref name="Reason_Pinker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=Ronald|date=July 10, 2020|title=Steven Pinker Beats Cancel Culture Attack|url=https://reason.com/2020/07/10/steven-pinker-beats-cancel-culture-attack/printer/|access-date=September 25, 2020|publisher=Reason magazine|archive-date=July 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200714135321/https://reason.com/2020/07/10/steven-pinker-beats-cancel-culture-attack/printer/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Liberman]] has argued that it is common for speech and writing to convey messages that will only be picked up on by part of the audience, but that this does not usually mean that the speaker is deliberately conveying a double message.&lt;ref name="upenn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Liberman|first=Mark|date=September 26, 2006|title=The comma was really a dog whistle|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003613.html|access-date=August 28, 2020|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|archive-date=October 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201013105208/http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003613.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Robert Henderson and [[Elin McCready]] argue that [[plausible deniability]] is a key characteristic of dog whistles.&lt;ref name="yjtGp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Robert|last2=McCready|first2=Elin|title=New Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence|chapter=How Dogwhistles Work|date=2018|chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-93794-6_16|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=10838|pages=231–240|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-93794-6_16|isbn=978-3-319-93793-9|s2cid=51876325|access-date=October 4, 2020|archive-date=July 16, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230716103236/https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-93794-6_16|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
