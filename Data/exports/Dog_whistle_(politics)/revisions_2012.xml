The phrase is only ever used as a pejorative, because of the inherently deceptive nature of the practice and because the dog-whistle messages are frequently themselves distasteful, for example by empathizing with racist attitudes. It is an analogy to [[dog whistle]]s, which are built in such a way that their high-frequency whistle is heard by dogs, but is inaudible to humans.

The term can be distinguished from "[[Code_word_(figure_of_speech)|code words]]" used by hospital staff or other specialist workers, in that dog-whistling is specific to the political realm, and the messaging referred to as the dog-whistle has an understandable meaning for a general audience, rather than being incomprehensible.

==Origin and meaning==
According to [[William Safire]], the phrase may have been borrowed from the field of [[Opinion_poll|opinion polling]]. Safire quotes [[Richard Morin]], director of polling for [[The Washington Post]], as writing in 1988 that "subtle changes in question-wording sometimes produce remarkably different results. ... researchers call this the 'Dog Whistle Effect': Respondents hear something in the question that researchers do not," and speculates that campaign workers adapted the phrase from political pollsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=Safire's political dictionary|year=2008|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-19-534334-4|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In her book ''Voting for Jesus: Christianity and Politics in Australia'', academic [[Amanda Lohrey]] writes that the goal of the dog-whistle is to appeal to the greatest possible number of electors while alienating the smallest possible number. She uses as an example Australian politicians using broadly-appealing words such as "family" and "values" which have extra resonance for Christians, while avoiding overt Christian moralizing that might be a turn-off for non-Christian voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lohrey|first=Amanda|title=Voting for Jesus: Christianity and politics in Australia|year=2006|publisher=Black Inc.|location=Melbourne, Vic.|isbn=1-86395-230-6|pages=48-58}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


Australian political theorist [[Robert E. Goodin]] argues that the problem with dog-whistling is that it undermines democracy, because if voters have different understandings of what they were supporting during a campaign, the fact that they were seeming to support the same thing is "democratically meaningless" and does not give the dog-whistler a [[policy mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodin|first=Robert E.|title=Innovating democracy: democratic theory and practice after the deliberative turn|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-954794-7|pages=224-228|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commonly-cited examples==
Commonly-cited examples of dog-whistle politics include [[African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955–1968)|civil rights]]-era use of the phrase "[[forced busing]]," used to enable a person to imply opposition to [[Desegregation|racial integration]] without them needing to say so explicitly; the state of [[Georgia_(U.S._state)|Georgia]]'s adoption, in 1956, of a flag visually similar to the [[Confederate battle flag]], itself understood by many to be a dog-whistle for racism; the phrase "[[Southern strategy]]," used by the Republican Party in the 1960s to describe plans to gain influence in the South by appealing to people's racism; [[Ronald Reagan]], on the campaign trail in 1980, saying in Mississippi "I believe in [[states' rights]]" (a sentence the [[New Statesman]] later described as "perhaps the archetypal dog-whistle statement"), described as implying Reagan believed that states should be allowed, if they want, to retain racial segregation; Reagan's use of the term "[[Welfare_queen|welfare queens]]," said to be designed to rouse racial resentment among white working-class voters against minorities; a 2008 TV ad for Republican presidential candidate [[John McCain]] called "[[The_One_(political_advertisement)|The One]]," which observers said dog-whistled to [[Evangelical_Christians#Evangelicalism_in_the_United_States|evangelical Christians]] who believed Obama might be the [[Antichrist]]; a [[Tea_Party_movement|Tea Party]] spokeswoman saying President Obama "doesn't love America like we do," thought to be an allusion to Obama's race and to the [[Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories|birth certificate controversy]], and Republicans frequently emphasizing Obama's middle name for the same reason; an aide to 2012 Republican presidential nominee [[Mitt Romney]] saying Romney would be a better president than Obama because Romney understood the "shared Anglo-Saxon heritage" of the United States and the United Kingdom; former Republican presidential candidate [[Newt Gingrich]] and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee [[Paul Ryan]], and others, calling Obama "the food stamps president" said to be a way of exploiting stereotypes among racially resentful white voters who see food stamps as unearned giveaways to minorities; Barack Obama referring to Mitt Romney in campaign ads as "not one of us," the implication being that Romney's [[The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints|Mormon]] faith makes him different than most Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kane|first=Eugene|title=Politicians use 'dog whistle' to send message to voters|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/politicians-use-dog-whistle-to-send-message-to-voters-gj6p7df-169049156.html|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal-Sentinel|date=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riehl|first=Jonathan|title=Who hears the dog whistle?|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80677_Page2.html|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=Politico|date=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pitts Jr|first=Leonard|title=The black and white of political code-speak|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-09-02/news/bal-the-black-and-white-of-political-codespeak-20120831_1_food-stamp-black-voters-newt-gingrich|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hearn|first=Alex|title=Top five racist Republican dog-whistles|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/alex-hern/2012/07/top-five-racist-republican-dog-whistles|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=New Statesman|date=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Amy|title=An Antichrist Obama in McCain Ad?|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1830590,00.html|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=Time magazine|date=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sink|first=Justin|title=New Obama ad labels Romney "not one of us"|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/263117-new-obama-ad-labels-romney-not-one-of-us|accessdate=20 October 2012|newspaper=The Hill|date=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin in Australia==
The term originated in [[Australian politics]] in the mid 1990s, and was frequently applied to the political campaigning of [[John Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant Barrett, ''The official dictionary of unofficial English'', McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006, p 90&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout his 11 years as Australian prime minister and particularly in his fourth term, Howard was accused of communicating messages appealing to anxious and perhaps racist white Australian voters using code words such as un-Australian, mainstream and illegals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soutphommasane|first=Tim|title=Reclaiming patriotism: nation-building for Australian progressives|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-521-13472-2|pages=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelber|first=Katharine|title=Speech matters: getting free speech right|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=St Lucia, Qld.|isbn=0-7022-3873-2|pages=end-notes|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One notable example was the Howard government's messaging on illegal immigration. The Howard government's tough stance on illegal immigration was popular with voters, but the government was accused of using the issue to additionally send veiled messages of support to voters with racist leanings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Garran|first=Robert|title=True believer: John Howard, George Bush and the American alliance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC|year=2004|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-1-74114-418-5|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=lKDKREH24PsC&amp;pg=PA18 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining [[plausible deniability]] by avoiding overtly racist language.&lt;ref name=TAIFear&gt;Josh Fear, ''[https://www.tai.org.au/documents/downloads/DP96.pdf Under the Radar: Dog-whistle politics in Australia]'', [[The Australia Institute]], September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the publicity of the citizenship test in 2007&lt;ref name=TAIFear /&gt;. It has been argued that the test may appear reasonable at face value, but is really intended to appeal to those opposing immigration from particular geographic regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/no-question-about-a-citizenship-test/2006/12/12/1165685675052.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=No question about a citizenship test | date=December 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Dog-whistling was introduced to the UK from Australia by Australian political strategist and [[Conservative_Party_(UK)|UK Conservative Party]] advisor [[Lynton Crosby]], who had previously managed [[John Howard]]'s four election campaigns in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=Safire's political dictionary|year=2008|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-19-534334-4|pages=190|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United_Kingdom_general_election,_2005|2005 British general election]], in what Goodin calls "the classic case" of dog-whistling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodin|first=Robert E.|title=Innovating democracy: democratic theory and practice after the deliberative turn|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-954794-7|pages=226|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosby created a campaign for the UK Conservatives with the slogan "Are you thinking what we're thinking?": a series of posters, billboards, TV commercials and direct mail pieces with messages like "It's not racist to impose limits on immigration" and "how would you feel if a bloke on early release attacked your daughter?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lees-Marshment|first=Jennifer|title=Political marketing: principles and applications|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-43128-X|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on hot-button issues like dirty hospitals, landgrabs by "gypsies" and restraints on police behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCallister|first=J.F.O.|title=Whistling In the Dark?|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1044651,00.html|accessdate=9 September 2012|newspaper=Time magazine|date=3 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seawright|first=David|title=The British Conservative Party and one nation politics|year=2007|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=0-8264-8974-5|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==United States==
Journalist [[Craig Unger]] writes that President [[George W. Bush]] and [[Karl Rove]] used coded "dog-whistle" language in political campaigning, delivering one message to the overall electorate while at the same time delivering quite a different message to a targeted [[evangelical]] Christian political base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Craig |title=The fall of the house of Bush: the untold story of how a band of true believers seized the executive branch, started the Iraq War, and still imperils America's future|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pSQJLqms8CcC|year=2007|publisher=[[Simon and Schuster]]|isbn=978-0-7432-8075-4||chapter=11. Dog Whistle Politics|chapterurl=http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=pSQJLqms8CcC&amp;pg=PA159|pages=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=pSQJLqms8CcC&amp;pg=PA172 172–173]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Safire]], in ''[[Safire's Political Dictionary]]'', offered the example of Bush's criticism during the [[2004 presidential campaign]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court's]] 1857 [[Dred_Scott_v._Sandford|Dred Scott]] decision upholding [[Slavery_in_the_United_States|slavery]]. To most listeners the criticism seemed innocuous, Safire wrote, but "sharp-eared observers" understood the remark to be a pointed reminder that Supreme Court decisions can be reversed, and a signal that, if re-elected, Bush might nominate to the Supreme Court a justice who would overturn [[Roe v. Wade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=Safire's political dictionary|year=2008|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-19-534334-4|pages=190|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] in ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]'' (2007) extensively discusses the subtle use of dog-whistle political rhetoric by [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], [[Irving Kristol]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] in building the rightist "[[movement conservatism]]". 

One group of alleged [[Code word (figure of speech)|code words]] in the United States is claimed to appeal to racism of the intended audience. The phrase "[[states' rights]]", although literally referring to powers of individual state governments in the United States, was described by David Greenberg in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' as "code words" for institutionalized segregation and racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2007/11/dogwhistling_dixie.html | title=Dog-Whistling Dixie. When Reagan said "states' rights," he was talking about race | publisher=The Slate Group | date=Nov. 20, 2007 | accessdate=May 21, 2012 | author=Greenberg, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] strategist [[Lee_Atwater#Atwater_on_the_Southern_Strategy|Lee Atwater]] when giving an anonymous interview discussing the GOP's [[Southern Strategy]] (''see also [[Lee_Atwater#Atwater_on_the_Southern_Strategy|Lee Atwater on the Southern Strategy'']]) said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You start out in 1954 by saying, "[[Nigger]], nigger, nigger." [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|By 1968]], you can't say "nigger" &amp;mdash; that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like [[forced busing]], states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me &amp;mdash; because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "Nigger, nigger."&lt;ref&gt;Lamis, Alexander P. et al. (1990) ''The Two Party South.'' [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTHerbert"&gt;[[Bob Herbert|Herbert, Bob]] (October 6, 2005)  [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E6DF1E30F935A35753C1A9639C8B63 "Impossible, Ridiculous, Repugnant."] ''[[New York Times]]''. Retrieved May 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the [[Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2008|2008 Democratic primaries]], in a rare example of a centrist or liberal candidate being accused of dog-whistling, several writers criticized [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign's reliance on code words and innuendo seemingly designed to frame Barack Obama's race as problematic. Obama was characterized by the Clinton campaign and its prominent supporters as anti-white due to his association with [[Reverend_Wright|Reverend Jeremiah Wright]], as only able to get black votes, as anti-patriotic, a drug user, possibly a drug seller, and married to an angry, ungrateful black woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Logan|first=Enid Lynette|title="At this defining moment": Barack Obama's presidential candidacy and the new politics of race|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-5298-5|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, journalist [[Soledad O'Brien]] used the phrase 'dog whistle' to describe [[Tea Party Express]] representative [[Amy Kremer|Amy Kremer's]] accusation that American President [[Barack Obama]] 'does not love America'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/09/04/cnns-soledad-obrien-confronts-tea-party-express-spokeswoman/ | title=CNN’s Soledad O’Brien confronts Tea Party Express spokeswoman over ‘very odd comment’
