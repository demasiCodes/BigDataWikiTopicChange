:''This article is specifically about the use of "code words" in politics, for the concept generally, see [[Code word (figure of speech)]]''

'''Dog-whistle politics''', also known as the use of '''code words''', is a term for a type of political campaigning or speechmaking which employs coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general population but has a different or more specific meaning for a targeted subgroup of the audience. The term is invariably pejorative, and is used to refer both to messages with an intentional subtext, and those where the existence or intent of a secondary meaning is disputed. According to blogger Ian Welsh,

&lt;blockquote&gt;When you speak in code(...), most of the time the only people who hear and understand what you just said are the intended group, who have an understanding of the world and a use of words that is not shared by the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agonist.org/ian_welsh/20060925/just_a_comma_dog_whistle_politics Just A Comma: Dog Whistle Politics | The Agonist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term is an analogy to [[dog whistle]]s, which are built in such a way that the high-[[frequency]] whistle is heard by dogs, but appears silent to human hearing.

==Origin in Australia==
The term originated in [[Australian politics]] in the mid 1990s. One notable example was its use to describe the [[John Howard|Howard Government's]] policy to crack down on illegal immigration. The Australian Government took a strong stand against illegal immigration, which was highly popular among a segment of voters on both sides of the usual political divide, and which contributed to the [[Australian federal election, 2001|winning of the 2001 Australian Federal Election]].  In response to this political success, some commentators have argued that the stand was playing to racist segments of the community, despite the Government's avoidance of ''overtly'' racist terminology. The Howard Government is accused of having used dog whistling as a technique to send a message of support to voters with racist leanings while avoiding criticism from those opposed to prejudice. The key to its use is to maintain the option of "[[plausible deniability]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tai.org.au/documents/downloads/DP96.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the publicity of the citizenship test in 2007 {{Fact|date=April 2009}}. It has been argued that the test may appear reasonable at face value, but is really intended to appeal to those opposing immigration from some regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/editorial/no-question-about-a-citizenship-test/2006/12/12/1165685675052.html No question about a citizenship test - Editorial - Opinion - smh.com.au&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The term was introduced to the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Matthew Parris]] in ''[[The Times]]'' on October 31, 2003 in an article about [[Michael Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1005337.ece|title=He is not a rotter and I wish him well (warily)|first=Matthew|last=Parris|publisher=The Times|date=2003-10-31|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  After the phrase caught on in the UK, [[Matthew Parris]] wrote in ''[[The Spectator]]'' on April 30, 2005 about having introduced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/cartoons/13599/only-the-tories-can-cut-the-state-down-to-size.thtml|title=Only the Tories can cut the state down to size|first=Matthew|last=Parris|publisher=The Spectator|date=2005-04-30|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
One group of American code words is claimed to appeal to racism of the intended audience. The phrase "[[states' rights]]", although literally referring to powers of individual state governments in the United States, has been described as a code word for institutionalized segregation and racism.&lt;ref&gt;David Greenburg, "[http://www.slate.com/id/2178379/pagenum/2/ Dog-Whistling Dixie]", Slate, Nov. 20, 2007. Accessed April 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms that some people say are used to indicate alleged veiled racism are "crime in the streets" and "[[Welfare queen|welfare queens]]". &lt;ref&gt;
David Hogberg, "[http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=6384 Outsourcing Bigotries]", American Spectator, April 5, 2005. Accessed April 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former president [[George W. Bush]] allegedly used coded language in his speeches to send messages to his supporters among the [[Christian right|religious right]] that will be ignored by other parts of the U.S. population. Examples include his frequent use of biblical phrases and the veiled mention of the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'']] Supreme Court decision in the 2004 Presidential debates.  The latter refers to overturning ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which is likened to the ''Dred Scott'' case by some of its critics. &lt;ref&gt;Timothy Noah, "[http://www.slate.com/id/2108083/ Why Bush Opposes Dred Scott], Slate, Oct. 11, 2004. Accessed April 8, 2008. National Right To Life, [http://www.nrlc.org/news/1999/NRL699/slave.html Court Blunders on Slavery and Abortion]. Accessed April 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Gergen claimed that John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign against [[Barack Obama]] used dog whistle tactics targeting racists, while retaining [[plausible deniability]] though only cited one example in which a McCain ad featured Obama as "The One". David Gergen said that it was implying Obama was "uppity" and that was code for "he should stay in his place". The McCain campaign made it clear it was in reference to Obama's popularity as a god-like figure. &lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6194119833937526436&amp;q=gergen+uppity&amp;ei=fhqWSIsgh5SvAvC8wJsN&amp;hl=en Gergen Calls Out Racial "Signals" of McCain Ads]&lt;/ref&gt;
