It is usually used pejoratively by those that do not approve of the tactics.

The term is by analogy to [[dog whistle]]s, built in such a way that humans cannot hear them due to their high [[frequency]], but dogs can. It could be argued that the term is disparaging of those who can hear the dog whistle message.

The term originated in [[Australian politics]] in the late 1990s, on occasion used to describe the [[John_Howard|Howard Government's]] [[immigration]] policy. The Government took a strong stand against illegal immigrants. Some commentators argued that the stand was playing to racist fears in the community, despite the Government never using ''overtly'' racist terminology.

The term is thought to have been introduced to the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Lynton Crosby]], where it played a role in the [[UK general election, 2005|2005 general election]]; [[Michael Howard]] was often accused of practising "dog-whistle politics" on contentious subjects like [[immigration]], with a campaign slogan that asked "Are you thinking what we're thinking?".
