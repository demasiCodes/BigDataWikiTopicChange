'''''"Don't ask, don't tell"''''' is the common term for the U.S. military policy which implements {{USPL|103|160}} ({{usc|10|654}}). Unless one of the numerous exceptions from 10 U.S.C. 654(b) applies, the policy prohibits anyone who "demonstrate(s) a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts" from serving in the [[Military of the United States|armed forces of the United States]], because it "would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability." The act prohibits any [[homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] person from disclosing his or her [[sexual orientation]], or from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including marriages or other familial attributes, while serving in the [[United States armed forces]]. The policy also requires that as long as gay or bisexual men and women in the military hide their [[sexual orientation]], commanders are not allowed to investigate their sexuality. 

==Beginning of the policy==
It was introduced as a compromise measure in 1993 and approved by then President [[Bill Clinton]] who, while campaigning for the Presidency, had promised to allow all citizens regardless of [[sexual orientation]] to serve openly in the military, a departure from the then complete ban on those who are not [[heterosexual]]. The actual policy was crafted by [[Colin Powell]] and has been maintained by Clinton's successor, [[George W. Bush]]. 

{{quotation|Sexual orientation will not be a bar to service unless manifested by homosexual conduct. The military will discharge members who engage in homosexual conduct, which is defined as a homosexual act, a statement that the member is homosexual or bisexual, or a marriage or attempted marriage to someone of the same gender.|quoted in "The Pentagon's New Policy Guidelines on Homosexuals in the Military", ''[[The New York Times]]'' ([[July 20]][[1993]]), p.A14.}}

More generally, "Don't ask, don't tell" has come to describe any instance in which one person must keep their sexual orientation and any related attributes, including their family, a secret, but where deliberate lying would be undesirable.

==History==
The armed forces, during the early American revolutionary war, treated [[sodomy]] (then broadly defined as oral or anal sexual conduct) as grounds for being dishonorably discharged. The first recorded efforts of such a discharge were in [[1778]] when Lieutenant [[Gotthold Frederick Enslin]] was dishonorably discharged, with the approval of General [[George Washington]], for a conviction of homosexual sodomy and [[perjury]]. The [[Articles of War]] maintained the crime of sodomy, but it was not until [[1942]] that the armed forces considered homosexual status, assessed by the military through a process of recruitment screening or internal investigations, as grounds for being separated from the military. Thus, anyone in the armed forces labeled as gay or bisexual were subject to criminal sanctions under the sodomy prohibition, or could be given a dishonorable discharge (often a [[Section 8 (military)|Section 8]]) and returned to civilian life where they would not receive [[veterans]] benefits and often had difficulty finding employment because most civilian employers knew what a Section 8 discharge meant.

The success of the armed forces in pre-screening out self-identified gay and bisexual people from the 1940s - 1981 remains in dispute; during the [[Vietnam Conflict]] some men would try to pretend to be gay in order to avoid the draft. However, a significant number of gay and bisexual men and women did manage to avoid the pre-screening process and serve in the military, some with special distinction. For example, in the 1950s - 1960s the Navy medical doctor [[Thomas Anthony Dooley|Tom Dooley]] received national fame for his anti-Communist and humanitarian efforts in Vietnam. His homosexuality was something of an open secret in the Navy, but eventually he was forced to resign and the Navy conducted the first official study on sexual orientation and the Navy regulations and rules. The 1957 report, titled ''Report of the Board Appointed to Prepare and Submit Recommendations to the Secretary of the Navy for the Revision of Policies, Procedures and Directives Dealing With Homosexuals'' (aka the [[Crittenden Report]]) found that gay-identified people were no more likely to be a security risk than heterosexual-indentified people, and found there was no rational basis for excluding gay people from the Navy, although it stopped short of recommending a change in the regulations because of social mores.

Beyond the official regulations, gay people were often the target of various types of [[harassment]] by their fellow servicemen, designed to persuade them to resign from the military or turn themselves in to investigators. The most infamous type of such harassment was called a [[blanket party]] and involved several other service members during the night in the barracks, who first covered the face of the victim with a blanket and then committed assault, often quite severely and sometimes even fatally as in the case of [[Allen R. Schindler, Jr.]]. Cited by President Clinton when passing the Don't Ask, Don't Tell bill, [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[Radioman]] [[Petty Officer Third Class|Third Class]] Schindler was brutally murdered by shipmate Terry M. Helvey (with the aid of an accomplice) leaving a "nearly-unrecognizable corpse."&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, Dr. Aaron." Abandoning "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" Will Decrease Anti-Gay Violence" Naval Institute: Proceedings Monthly. 1 May, 2005. [http://www.palmcenter.org/press/dadt/in_print/abandoning_dont_ask_dont_tell_will_decrease_anti_gay_violence]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The introduction of "Don't ask, don't tell" with the later amendment of "don't pursue, don't harass" has officially prohibited such behavior, but reports suggest that such harassment continues.  

The degree of official and unofficial attempts to separate gay people from the armed forces seems to be directly related to the personnel needs of the armed forces.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Hence, during wartime, it has not been uncommon for the rules regarding homosexuality to be relaxed. Up until 1981 it was the policy of all branches of the armed forces to retain, at their discretion, anyone suspected of homosexual activity, thus promoting the "queen for a day" rule, which allowed a person accused of homosexuality to remain in the armed forces if one could successfully claim that their behavior was only a singular occurrence.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} This especially became the case during the Vietnam War.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} 

However, during the 1970s several high-profile court challenges to the military's regulations on homosexuality occurred, with little success, and when such successes did occur it was when the plaintiff had been open about his homosexuality from the beginning or due to the existence of the "queen for a day" rule. In 1981 the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] issued a new regulation on homosexuality that was designed to ensure withstanding a court challenge by developing uniform and clearly defined regulations and justifications that made homosexual status, whether self-applied or by the military, and conduct grounds for discharge (DOD Directive 1332.14 (Enlisted Administrative Separations), January, 1981):

{{quotation|Homosexuality is incompatible with military service. The presence in the military environment of persons who engage in homosexual conduct or who, by their statements, demonstrate a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct, seriously impairs the accomplishment of the military mission. The presence of such members adversely affects the ability of the armed forces to maintain discipline, good order, and morale; to foster mutual trust and confidence among service members; to insure the integrity of the system of rank and command; to facilitate assignment and worldwide deployment of service members who frequently must live and work in close conditions affording minimal privacy; to recruit and retain members of the armed forces; to maintain the public acceptability of military service; and to prevent breaches of security.}}

The directive justified the policy and removed the "queen for a day" rule that had prompted some courts to rule against the armed forces. However, the intent of the policy had also been to treat homosexuality as being akin to a disability discharge and thus ensure that anyone found engaging in homosexual activity and/or identifying as gay, would be separated with an honorable discharge. The DOD policy has since withstood most court challenges, although the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has refused to weigh in on the constitutionality of the policy, preferring to allow lower courts and the [[United States Congress]] to settle the matter.

However, in the 1980s many of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] presidential candidates had expressed an interest in changing the regulations concerning homosexuality in the armed forces, and, as American social mores changed, public opinion began to express more sympathy with gay people in armed forces, at least to the extent that investigations into a serviceman or -woman's sexual behaviour and/or orientation were seen as a witch-hunt. "Gays in the military" became a political issue during the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 Presidential campaign]], when Clinton, the Democratic candidate, promised to lift the military's ban on homosexual and bisexual people.

In 1992 the United States General Accounting Office published a report entitled ''Defense Force Management: DOD’s Policy on Homosexuality. GAO/NSAID-92-98'', that outlined the DOD policy on homosexuality and the reasons for it. The report also included excerpts from a previously unpublished 1988 DOD study on homosexuality that made similar conclusions as the 1957 Crittenden Report. In 1993 the two reports were published alongside an argument by an armed forces general who argued against lifting the ban on homosexual- and bisexual-indentified people based on a belief that they pose a security risk, will erode unit cohesion and morale alongside the argument that most homosexual and bisexual oriented people are [[pedophile]]s who engage in a self-destructive and immoral life-style.

Congressional opposition to lifting the ban on gay and bisexual people in the armed forces was led by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Senator [[Sam Nunn]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] who organized Congressional hearings that largely buffed the armed forces position that has remained unchanged since the 1981 directive. While Congressional support for reform was led by Democrat Congressmen [[Barney Frank]] of [[Massachusetts]], who fought for a compromise, and retired [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], who argued for a complete repeal of the ban. After a large number of people flooded the Congressional phone lines with oppositions to lifting the ban, President Clinton soon backed off on his campaign promise to lift the ban on homosexual and bisexual people in the armed forces. The final result was a Congressional compromise of "Don't ask, don't tell" that was later amended to include "don't harass." Officially, the compromise dictates that the armed forces will no longer ask recruits about their sexual activity and/or orientation, will not investigate any serviceman or servicewoman's sexual activity and/or orientation without solid evidence (thus preventing witch-hunts), and self-identified homosexual servicemen and women agree that they will not engage in homosexual sex acts, or do anything that announces that they are a homosexual, i.e. public statements or participate in a same-sex marriage openly.

In 2000, Northwestern University Professor [[Charles Moskos]], the principal author of DADT (Which, as originally coined by Moskos, was "Don't Ask Don't Tell; Don't Seek Don't Flaunt"), told "Lingua Franca" that he felt that policy will be gone within five to ten years. Moskos also dismissed the unit cohesion argument, instead arguing that gay people should be banned due to "modesty rights", saying "Fuck unit cohesion. I don't care about that...I should not be forced to shower with a woman. I should not be forced to shower with a gay [man]." Moskos did not offer any alternative to his DADT policy. &lt;ref&gt;

On [[September 13]], [[2005]], the [http://www.gaymilitary.ucsb.edu/ Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military] (on [[October 23]], [[2006]] renamed the
[http://www.palmcenter.org/ Michael D. Palm Center]), a [[think tank]] affiliated with the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], issued a news release revealing the existence of a 1999 [[FORSCOM]] regulation (Regulation 500-3-3) that allowed the active duty deployment of Army Reservists and National Guard troops who say that they are gay or who are accused of being gay. U.S. Army Forces Command spokesperson Kim Waldron later confirmed the regulation and indicated that it was intended to prevent Reservists and National Guard members from pretending to be gay to escape combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Chibbaro, Lou| year=2005| title= Out gay soldiers sent to Iraq - Regulation keeps straights from ‘playing gay’ to avoid war| work=Washington Blade | url=http://washblade.com/2005/9-23/news/national/outiraq.cfm | accessdate=2006-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" has been upheld five times in federal court, and in a recent [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, [[Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights]], the Supreme Court unanimously held that the federal government could withhold funding in order to force universities to accept military recruiters in spite of their nondiscrimination policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mears, Bill| year=2006| title= Justices uphold military recruiting on campuses| work=CNN Law Center | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/03/06/scotus.recruiting/index.html | accessdate=2006-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
Polls have shown that a large majority of the American public favors allowing gay and lesbian people to serve openly in the US military. A national poll conducted in May 2005 by the [[Boston Globe]] showed 79% of participants having nothing against openly gay people from serving in the military. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in March 2006 showed that 60% favor allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, with 32% opposed. [http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=273]
Over recent years, while the American public has begun to favor the idea of allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, the military remains largely opposed.  An Army Times poll of military members only found 25% in favor of allowing homosexuals to serve openly.  [http://www.washtimes.com/national/20041012-101444-1302r.htm]

== Financial impact of policy ==

In February 2005, the [[Government Accountability Office]] released estimates on the cost of the policy. Cautioning that the amount may be too low, The GAO reported $95.4 million in recruiting costs and $95.1 million for training replacements for the 9,488 troops discharged from 1994 through 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006| title= Report: 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' costs $363M| work=USA Today, Washington/Politics | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-02-14-dont-ask-report_x.htm | accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, a [[University of California]] [[Blue Ribbon Commission]] including [[Lawrence Korb]], a former assistant defense secretary during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, former [[Defense Secretary]] [[William Perry]], a member of the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration, and professors from [[West Point]] U.S. [[Military Academy]] concluded that figure should be closer to $363 million including $14.3 million for "separation travel" once a service member is discharged, $17.8 million for training officers, $252.4 million for training enlistees and $79.3 million in recruiting costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006| title= Report: 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' costs $363M| work=USA Today, Washington/Politics | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-02-14-dont-ask-report_x.htm | accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission report stated that the GAO didn't take into account the value the military lost from the departures.

== Military Readiness Enhancement Act ==

The [[Military Readiness Enhancement Act]] ({{USBill|110|H.R.|1246}}) is a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] introduced in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on [[February 28]], [[2007]].  Sponsored by Representative [[Marty Meehan]] (D-MA) with 136 cosponsors, the bill is currently in committee.

The stated purpose of the bill is "to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the readiness of the Armed Forces by replacing the current policy concerning homosexuality in the Armed Forces, referred to as 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell', with a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."

A previous version of the bill was introduced in the Republican-controlled 109th Congress.  The bill did not make it out of committee.

==Criticism==

Both former [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Gen. [[John Shalikashvili]] (Ret.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gordon|last=Lubold|title=Former JCS chairman: It’s time to give ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy another look|url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/issues/stories/0-AIRPAPER-2461638.php|publisher=Air Force Times|date=[[2007-01-15]]|accessdate=2007-01-13|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former [[United States Senate|Senator]] and [[Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}} spoke against the policy publicly in early January 2007.

==Situation outside the United States==
{{main|Sexual orientation and military service}}

Some Western military forces have now removed policies excluding individuals of other sexual orientations (with strict policies on [[sexual harassment]]). Of the 25 countries that participate militarily in [[NATO]], more than twenty permit gay people to serve; of the permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], two (Britain, France) permit gay people to serve openly, and three (United States, Russia, China) do not. 

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] policy is to allow gay men and lesbians to serve openly and discrimination on a sexual orientation basis is forbidden. It is also forbidden for someone to pressure LGBT people to [[Coming out|come out]]. All personnel  are subject to the same "no-touching" rules.



===Israel===
The State of Israel's military policies also allow for gay men and lesbians to serve openly without discrimination or harassment due to actual or perceived sexual orientation.
