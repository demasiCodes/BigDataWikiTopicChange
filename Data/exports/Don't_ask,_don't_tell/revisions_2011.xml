"'''Don't ask, don't tell'''" ('''DADT''') was the official United States policy on [[Sexual orientation and military service|homosexuals serving in the military]] from December 21, 1993 to September 20, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/dodd/corres/html2/d130426x.htm |title=Defense Directive 1304.26: Qualification Standards for Enlistment, Appointment, and Induction |date=December 21, 1993 |publisher=Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1671028/dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.jhtml&lt;/ref&gt; The policy prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing [[closeted]] [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] service members or applicants, while barring openly gay, [[lesbian]], or bisexual persons from military service. The restrictions were mandated by United States federal law {{USPL|103|160}} ({{usc|10|654}}). The policy prohibited people who "demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts" from serving in the armed forces of the United States, because their presence "would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and [[unit cohesion]] that are the essence of military capability."&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|10|654|b}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act prohibited any homosexual or bisexual person from disclosing his or her [[sexual orientation]] or from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including marriages or other familial attributes, while serving in the United States armed forces. The act specified that service members who disclose that they are homosexual or engage in homosexual conduct should be separated (discharged) except when a service member's conduct was "for the purpose of avoiding or terminating military service" or when it "would not be in the best interest of the armed forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|10|654(e)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "don't ask" part of the DADT policy specified that superiors should not initiate investigation of a servicemember's orientation without witnessing disallowed behaviors, though credible evidence of homosexual behavior could be used to initiate an investigation. Unauthorized investigations and harassment of suspected servicemen and women led to an expansion of the policy to "don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue, don't harass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/d9/D9Legal/docs/05_2010MAYNewsletterDontAskDontTell.pdf |title=United States Coast Guard Ninth District Legal Office '&amp;#39;The Legal Brief'&amp;#39; "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t Pursue, Don’t Harass: Reference (a): Personnel Manual, COMDTINST M1000.6, Ch. 12.E.", May 2010 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010|congressional bill to repeal DADT]] was enacted in December 2010, specifying that the policy would remain in place until the [[President of the United States|President]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] certified that repeal would not harm military readiness, followed by a 60-day waiting period.&lt;ref name="Obama_Signed"&gt;{{cite news|author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|title=With Obama's Signature, 'Don't Ask' Is Repealed|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 22, 2010|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/us/politics/23military.html|accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A July 6, 2011 ruling from a federal appeals court barred further enforcement of the U.S. military's ban on openly gay service members.&lt;ref name="Judged_Halts"&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=In reversal, federal court orders immediate end to 'don't ask, don’t tell' policy|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 6, 2011|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-reversal-federal-court-orders-immediate-end-to-dont-ask-dont-tell-policy/2011/07/06/gIQAAdux0H_story.html |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[US President|President]] [[Barack Obama]], [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Leon Panetta]], and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Michael Mullen|Mike Mullen]], sent that certification to Congress on July 22, 2011, which set the end of DADT for September 20, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama certifies end of military's gay ban|agency=[[Reuters]]|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=July 22, 2011|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43859711/ns/us_news-life/|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Further|[[Sexual orientation and the United States military]]}}
[[Image:Dontaskdonttellcredible.jpg|thumb|310px|The U.S. Army training guide on the homosexual conduct policy gives official guidelines on what can be considered credible information of someone's homosexuality.]]

[[Sodomy]] has been grounds for discharge from the American military since the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], but the LGBT-related policies changed over the course of the 20th century. [[Frederick Gotthold Enslin|Lieutenant Gotthold Frederick Enslin]] was the first soldier discharged from the U.S. military (at that time, the [[Continental Army]]) for sodomy, in 1778.&lt;ref name="Herek"&gt;{{cite web| url = Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S. Military: Historical Background | title = Don't Ask, Don't Tell Revisited | accessdate =June 3, 2010 | last = Herek | first = Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the United States prepared to enter [[World War II]], the military added psychiatric screening to its induction process. At the time, [[psychiatry]] labeled homosexuality as an indicator of [[psychopathology]], and this notion was added to military practices. The first time "homosexual" people were distinguished from "normal" people in the military literature was in revised army mobilization regulations in 1942.&lt;ref name="Herek"/&gt; Whereas before the buildup to the war gay servicemembers were court-martialed, imprisoned and dishonorably discharged, in wartime commanding officers found it difficult to convene court-martial boards of commissioned officers and the administrative [[blue discharge]] became the discharge of choice for gay and lesbian personnel. In 1944, a new policy directive decreed that homosexuals were to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists and discharged under Regulation 615-360, [[Section 8 (military)|section 8]].&lt;ref&gt;Bérubé, p. 142–3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, blue discharges were discontinued and two new classifications were created: "general" and "undesirable". Under such a system, a servicemember found to be gay but who had not committed any sexual acts while in service would tend to receive an undesirable discharge. Those found guilty of engaging in sexual conduct were usually dishonorably discharged.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; A 1957 U.S. Navy study known as the [[Crittenden Report]] dismissed the charge that homosexuals constitute a security risk, but advocated stringent anti-homosexual policies because "Homosexuality is wrong, it is evil, and it is to be branded as such."&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Terry, ''An American Obsession: Science, Medicine, and Homosexuality in Modern Society'' (University of Chicago Press, 1999), 347&lt;/ref&gt; It remained secret until 1976.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lawrence Gibson, ''Get Off my Ship : Ensign Berg vs. the U.S. Navy'' (NY: Avon, 1978), 256–67&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fannie Mae Clackum]] was the first service member to successfully appeal such a discharge, winning eight years of back pay from the [[United States Court of Federal Claims|US Court of Claims]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America | publisher = Penguin | year = 1991 | place = New York | page = 155 | isbn = 0140171223 | author = [[Lillian Faderman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1940s through the Vietnam War, some notable gay servicemembers avoided discharges despite pre-screening efforts, and when personnel shortages occurred, homosexuals were allowed to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America | publisher = Penguin | year = 1991 | place = New York | pages = 119–138 | isbn = 0140171223 | author = [[Lillian Faderman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[LGBT social movements|gay and lesbian rights movement]] in the 1970s and 1980s raised the issue by publicizing several noteworthy dismissals of gay servicemembers, with Sgt. [[Leonard Matlovich]] appearing on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917785,00.html "The Sexes: The Sergeant v. the Air Force," September 8, 1975], accessed July 26, 2011. Other prominent cases included [[Vernon Berg, III|Copy Berg]], [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Stephen Donaldson]], and [[Joseph Steffan]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Defense issued a 1982 policy (DOD Directive 1332.14) stating that homosexuality was clearly incompatible with military service.&lt;ref name="Herek"/&gt; The policy garnered public scrutiny through the 1980s and 1990s, and it became a political issue in the [[1992 U.S. presidential election]] with [[Bill Clinton]] and others citing the brutal murder of gay [[United States Navy|Navy]] petty officer [[Allen R. Schindler, Jr.]]

After Bill Clinton won the presidency, Congress rushed to enact the existing gay ban policy into federal law, outflanking Clinton's planned repeal effort. Clinton called for legislation to overturn the ban, but it encountered intense scrutiny by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], members of Congress, and portions of the public. DADT emerged as a compromise policy.&lt;ref name="Herek"/&gt;

==Origin==
The policy was introduced as a compromise measure in 1993 by President Bill Clinton who campaigned on the promise to allow all citizens to serve in the military regardless of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Shankar, Thom"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Shankar, Thom|title=A New Push to Roll Back ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’|work=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/us/30military.html |accessdate=March 25, 2010 | date=November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, per the December 21, 1993 Department of Defense Directive 1332.14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dont.stanford.edu/regulations/DOD1332.14.html |title=DoDD 1332.14, December 21, 1993 |publisher=Dont.stanford.edu |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was legal policy (10 U.S.C. § 654)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html |title=Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 37, § 654.

Congress overrode Clinton by including text in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (passed in 1993) requiring the military to abide by regulations essentially identical to the 1982 absolute ban policy.&lt;ref name=stanforddont /&gt; The Clinton Administration on December 21, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/dodd/corres/html2/d130426x.htm |title=Defense Directive 1304.26: Qualification Standards for Enlistment, Appointment, and Induction |date=December 21, 1993 |publisher=Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued Defense Directive 1304.26, which directed that military applicants were not to be asked about their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=stanforddont /&gt; This is the policy now known as "Don't Ask, Don't Tell". The phrase was coined by [[Charles Moskos]], a military sociologist.

The full name of the policy at the time was "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t Pursue." The "Don’t Ask" provision mandated that military or appointed officials will not ask about or require members to reveal their sexual orientation. The "Don’t Tell" stated that a member may be discharged for claiming to be a homosexual or bisexual or making a statement indicating a tendency towards or intent to engage in homosexual activities. The "Don’t Pursue" established what was minimally required for an investigation to be initiated. A "Don’t Harass" provision was added to the policy later. It ensured that the military would not allow harassment or violence against service members for any reason.&lt;ref name="Herek"/&gt;

At times beatings of gay personnel were severe and occasionally even fatal, as in the case of [[Allen R. Schindler, Jr.]]. In defense of his DADT policy, President Clinton cited [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Radioman]] [[Petty Officer Third Class|Third Class]] Schindler, brutally murdered by shipmate Terry M. Helvey (with the aid of an accomplice), leaving a "nearly-unrecognizable corpse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Aaron Belkin |url=http://www.palmcenter.org/press/dadt/in_print/abandoning_dont_ask_dont_tell_will_decrease_anti_gay_violence |title=Belkin, Dr. Aaron.

DADT has officially prohibited such behavior, but harassment continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmcenter.org/publications/dadt/perceived_sexual_orientation_based_harrassment_in_military_and_civilian_contexts |title=Moradi, Dr. Bonnie "Perceived Sexual-Orientation-Based Harassment in Military and Civilian Contexts" Military Psychology 2006, 18(1), 39–60 |publisher=Palmcenter.org |date=April 1, 2006 |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of the 1993 controversy, the National Defense Research Institute prepared a study for the Office of the Secretary of Defense published as ''Sexual Orientation and U.S. Military Personnel Policy: Options and Assessment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=National Defense Research Institute |title=Sexual orientation and U.S. military personnel policy: options and assessment |publisher=Rand |location=Santa Monica, Calif |year=1993 |isbn=0-8330-1441-2 |url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR323/}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded, in measured language, that "circumstances could exist under which the ban on homosexuals could be lifted with little or no adverse consequences for recruitment and retention"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=National Defense Research Institute |title=Sexual orientation and U.S. military personnel policy: options and assessment |publisher=Rand |location=Santa Monica, Calif |year=1993 |page=406 |isbn=0-8330-1441-2 |url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR323/}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the policy were implemented with care, principally because many factors contribute to individual enlistment and re-enlistment decisions.

In Congress, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Sam Nunn]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] led the contingent that favored maintaining the absolute ban on gays. Reformers were led by Democratic Congressman [[Barney Frank]] of [[Massachusetts]], who favored modification (but ultimately voted for the defense authorization bill with the gay ban language), and retired [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], who argued on behalf of full repeal. After Congressional phone lines were flooded by organized anti-gay opposition, President Clinton backed off on his campaign promise to repeal the ban in favor of DADT.

===Reservist exception===
&lt;!-- [[File:Congressman Marty Meehan joined by retired flag officers interested in repealing DADT.jpg|right|thumb|400px|In 2005, member of Congress [[Marty Meehan]] (third from left) unsuccessfully attempted to repeal the policy.]] --&gt;

In September 2005, the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military – a [[think tank]] affiliated with the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], and renamed the Michael D. Palm Center in October 2006 – issued a news release revealing they had found a 1999 FORSCOM Regulation (500-3-3 RC Unit Commander's Handbook) that allowed the active duty deployment of Army Reservists and National Guard troops who say that they are gay or who are accused of being gay. U.S. Army Forces Command spokesperson Kim Waldron later confirmed the regulation and indicated that it was intended to prevent Reservists and National Guard members from pretending to be gay to escape combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chibbaro |first=Lou |year=2005|title=Out gay soldiers sent to Iraq – Regulation keeps straights from 'playing gay' to avoid war |work=Washington Blade |url=http://washblade.com/2005/9-23/news/national/outiraq.cfm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080516002106/http://washblade.com/2005/9-23/news/national/outiraq.cfm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 |accessdate=March 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court challenges===
{{Main|Log Cabin Republicans v. United States of America}}
DADT has been upheld by four of the federal Courts of Appeal,&lt;ref&gt;''Richenberg v. Perry'', 97 F.3d 256 (8th Cir. 1996); ''Thomasson v. Perry'', 80 F.3d 915 (4th Cir. 1996); ''[[Able v. United States]]'', 155 F.3d 628 (2d Cir. 1998); ''[[Cook v. Gates]]'', 528 F.3d 42 (1st Cir. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and in a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, [[Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.]] (2006), the Supreme Court unanimously held that the federal government could constitutionally withhold funding from universities if they refuse to give military recruiters access to school resources, in spite of any university nondiscrimination policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mears |first=Bill |year=2006 |title=Justices uphold military recruiting on campuses |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/03/06/scotus.recruiting/index.html |accessdate=March 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 a federal lawsuit challenging DADT was filed by the [[Log Cabin Republicans]], the nation's largest Republican gay organization.&lt;ref name = dadt722&gt;{{cite web

On September 9, 2010, Judge Phillips ruled that the ban was unconstitutional, as a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jIWJ1V2EsAQ8O7sPsyfXG0OAQTBwD9I56TQ82 |title=US judge: 'Don't ask, don't tell' unconstitutional |agency=Associated Press |date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/09/federal-judge-declares-us-military-ban-on-openly-gay-service-members-unconstitutional-.html |title=Judge declares U.S. military's 'don't ask, don't tell' policy openly banning gay service members unconstitutional |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 9, 2010 |author=Phil Willon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following passage of the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]], the Justice Department asked the Ninth Circuit to suspend LCR's suit in light of the legislative repeal. LCR opposed the request, noting that gay personnel were still subject to discharge.

The Military Readiness Enhancement Act was a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 2005 by [[Marty Meehan|Rep. Martin T. Meehan]] with the stated purpose "to amend [[Title 10 of the United States Code|title 10, United States Code]], to enhance the readiness of the [[United States armed forces|Armed Forces]] by replacing the current policy concerning homosexuality in the Armed Forces, referred to as 'Don't ask, don't tell,' with a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation." The bill was introduced again in 2007 and 2009.

====Implementation====
The repeal act established a process for winding down the DADT policy. The President, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were required to certify in writing that they had reviewed the Pentagon's report on the effects of DADT repeal, that the appropriate regulations had been reviewed and drafted and that implementation of repeal regulations "is consistent with the standards of military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention of the Armed Forces". Once certification was given, a 60-day waiting period would begin before DADT was formally repealed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.4023: Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative [[Duncan D. Hunter]] announced plans in January 2011 to introduce a bill designed to delay DADT repeal. Had his bill been adopted, all of the chiefs of the armed services would have needed to submit the certification at the time required only of the President, Defense Secretary and Joint Chiefs Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2011/01/military-bill-to-delay-dadt-repeal-011411w/ New bill seeks to slow DADT repeal]&lt;/ref&gt;

While waiting for certification, several service members were discharged at their own insistence&lt;ref name="Still_discharges"/&gt; until a July 6 ruling from a federal appeals court barred further enforcement of the U.S. military's ban on openly gay service members,&lt;ref name="Judged_Halts"/&gt; which the military promptly did.&lt;ref&gt;''Army Times'': [http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/07/military-DADT-Pentagon-court-ruling-070811w/ Andrew Tighman, "Pentagon suspends DADT in wake of court ruling," July 8, 2011], accessed July 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a December 2010 [[Washington Post]]-[[ABC News]] poll 77 percent of Americans say gays and lesbians who publicly disclose their sexual orientation should be able to serve in the military. That number showed little change from polls over the two years, but represents the highest level of support in a Post-ABC poll. The support also cuts across partisan and ideological lines, with majorities of Democrats (86%), Republicans (74%), independents (74%), liberals (92%), conservatives (67%), white evangelical Protestants (70%) and non-religious (84%) in favor of homosexuals' serving openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Keefe |first=Ed |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2010/12/most_back_repealing_dont_ask_d.html |title=Most back repealing 'don't ask, don't tell,' poll says |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date=December 15, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The two polls report virtually the same number who say they oppose gays serving openly in the military, which suggests that there are some people who favor that change in policy but for some reason were reluctant to admit that to the Pew interviewers.

A 2006 [[Zogby International]] poll of military members found that 26% were in favor of gays serving in the military, 37% were opposed, while 37% expressed no preference or were unsure. Of the respondents who had experience with gay people in their unit, 6% said their presence had a positive impact on their personal morale, 66% said no impact, and 28% said negative impact.

In December 2007, 28 retired generals and admirals urged Congress to repeal the policy, citing evidence that 65,000 gay men and women are currently serving in the armed forces and that there are over 1,000,000 gay veterans.&lt;ref name="newletter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MSN-MilitaryView"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Associated Press |title=Admirals, generals: Let gays serve openly |work=MSNBC |date=November 18, 2008 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27774058/page/2/ |accessdate=October 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 17, 2008, 104 retired generals and admirals signed a similar statement.&lt;ref name="MSN-MilitaryView"/&gt;

On May 4, 2008, while Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral [[Mike Mullen]] addressed the graduating cadets at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], a cadet asked what would happen if the next administration were supportive of legislation allowing gays to serve openly. Mullen responded, "Congress, and not the military, is responsible for [DADT]." Previously, during his Senate confirmation hearing in 2007, Mullen told lawmakers, "I really think it is for the American people to come forward, really through this body, to both debate that policy and make changes, if that's appropriate." He went on to say, "I'd love to have Congress make its own decisions" with respect to considering repeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |title=Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Tells Cadets Military Ready to Accept Gay Service Members |publisher=Servicemembers Legal Defense Network |date=May 6, 2008 |url= http://www.sldn.org/news/archives/chairman-of-the-joint-chiefs-tells-cadets-military-ready-to-accept-gay-serv |accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on CNN's ''State of the Union'' broadcast on July 5, 2009, Colin Powell said he thought that the policy was "correct for the time" but that "sixteen years have now gone by, and I think a lot has changed with respect to attitudes within our country, and therefore I think this is a policy and a law that should be reviewed." In the same program, Admiral Mullen said the policy would continue to be implemented until the law was repealed, and that his advice was to "move in a measured way...

In November 2010, the Defense Department published a [[:File:DADT Defense Department report.pdf|comprehensive report]] on the effects of repeal.

In 1993, [[Gregory M. Herek]], associate research psychologist at the [[University of California at Davis]] and an authority on public attitudes toward lesbians and gay men, testified before the [[House Armed Services Committee]], chaired by Representative [[Ron Dellums]]. Testifying on behalf of the [[American Psychological Association]] and five other national professional organizations (the [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[National Association of Social Workers]], the [[American Counseling Association]], the [[American Nursing Association]], and the [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]]), Herek stated "My written testimony to the Committee summarizes the results of an extensive review of the relevant published research from the social and behavioral sciences. That review is lengthy. However, I can summarize its conclusions in a few words: The research data show that there is nothing about lesbians and gay men that makes them inherently unfit for military service, and there is nothing about heterosexuals that makes them inherently unable to work and live with gay people in close quarters."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M. Herek: [http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/miltest2.html Oral Statement of Gregory M. Herek, PhD to the House Armed Services Committee – Made on behalf of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association, National Association of Social Workers, American Counseling Association, American Nursing Association, and the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; In his testimony, Herek reviewed existing scientific research concerning issues of unit cohesion and effectiveness and the fitness of lesbians and gay men for military service. He concluded that straight personnel could overcome their prejudices and adapt to living and working in close quarters with gays. Furthermore, he said gays are as capable of military service as straight men and women are. "The assumption that heterosexuals cannot overcome their prejudices toward gay people is a mistaken one," said Herek.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M. Herek: [http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/miltest1.html Psychologist Testifies Against Military's Anti-Gay Ban – Researcher Cites Scientific Evidence That Nondiscriminatory Military Policy Can Be Implemented]&lt;/ref&gt; Herek stated in 2008: "Today, as then (1993), the real question is not whether sexual minorities can be successfully integrated into the military. The social science data answered this question in the affirmative then, and do so even more clearly now. Rather, the issue is whether the United States is willing to repudiate its current practice of anti-gay discrimination and address the challenges associated with a new policy."&lt;ref&gt;Beyond Homophobia: [http://www.beyondhomophobia.com/blog/2008/07/23/from-1993-to-2008-dadt-and-the-house-armed-services-committee/ From 1993 to 2008: DADT and the House Armed Services Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Psychological Association]] has stated:
{{quote|Empirical evidence fails to show that sexual orientation is germane to any aspect of military effectiveness including unit cohesion, morale, recruitment and retention (Belkin, 2003; Belkin &amp; Bateman, 2003; Herek, Jobe, &amp; Carney, 1996; MacCoun, 1996; National Defense Research Institute, 1993).

Comparative data from foreign militaries and domestic police and fire departments show that when lesbians, gay men and bisexuals are allowed to serve openly there is no evidence of disruption or loss of mission effectiveness (Belkin &amp; McNichol, 2000–2001; Gade, Segal, &amp; Johnson, 1996; Koegel, 1996).

When openly gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals have been allowed to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces (Cammermeyer v. Aspin, 1994; Watkins v. United States Army, 1989/1990), there has been no evidence of disruption or loss of mission effectiveness.

The U.S. military is capable of integrating members of groups historically excluded from its ranks, as demonstrated by its success in reducing both racial and gender discrimination (Binkin &amp; Bach, 1977; Binkin, Eitelberg, Schexnider, &amp; Smith, 1982; Kauth &amp; Landis, 1996; Landis, Hope, &amp; Day, 1984; Thomas &amp; Thomas, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association [http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/military.aspx Proceedings of the American Psychological Association, Incorporated, for the legislative year 2004.

On November 30, 2010 the Palm Center issued a joint statement from 30 professors and scholars (current and former academics at the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]], [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]], [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]], [[Naval Post Graduate School]], [[Naval War College]], [[Air Command and Staff College]] and [[National Defense University]] as well as civilian universities including [[Harvard University|Harvard]], Yale and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]) in response to the Pentagon’s Comprehensive Working Group Report on gays in the military. The statement read in part:
{{quote| We write as scholars who have studied the military for decades. The release of the Pentagon’s Comprehensive Working Group report on gays in the military echoes more than 20 studies, including studies by military researchers, all of which reach the same conclusion: allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly will not harm the military. Unsurprisingly, the new Pentagon study, which is based on exhaustive research, confirms that the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” poses little if any risk to the armed forces. We hope that our collective statement underscores that the debate about the evidence is now officially over, and that the only remaining rationale for “don’t ask, don’t tell” is prejudice. In light of the report’s findings, this month’s debate in Congress is about one thing and one thing only: will prejudice continue to determine military policy or not?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmcenter.org/press/dadt/releases/military-civilianprofessorsdadtdebateover |title=Military and Civilian Professors Say That "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" Debate is Over – 30 Scholars Conclude that Prejudice is the Only Remaining Rationale for Gay Ban |publisher=Palmcenter.org |date=December 15, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 2009, the White House and other Democrats reportedly pressured Florida Rep.

During President Obama's [[2010 State of the Union Address|State of the Union Address]] on January 27, 2010, he claimed that he would work with Congress and the military to enact a repeal of the gay ban law. He had made similar statements during other speeches; however, his State of the Union speech was the first in which he definitively committed to repealing the law on a set timetable.

On November 30, 2010, the Department of Defense's Comprehensive Review Working Group (CRWG) on DADT repeal issued its formal report outlining a path to implementation of repeal in the Armed Forces. The United States Senate took up two days of hearings on December 2 and 3, 2010 to discuss the CRWG report and interview Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs Chairman Michael Mullen, and each of the Service Chiefs. During these hearings, President Obama undertook a surprise trip to Afghanistan to visit deployed servicemembers and was, therefore, unable to provide any direct statement of support for the Senate hearings while they were in the media spotlight.

===Letter of support for maintaining DADT===
Citing a letter signed by "over one thousand former general and flag officers who have weighed in on this issue," Senator [[John McCain]] of Arizona claimed that "we should pay attention and benefit from the experience and knowledge" of these officers. At the February 2, 2010 congressional hearing of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral [[Mike Mullen]] and Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]], McCain read directly from the letter, saying "We firmly believe that this law, which Congress passed to protect good order, discipline and morale in the unique environment of the armed forces, deserves continued support." [[Servicemembers United]], a veterans' group opposed to "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", issued a subsequent report on the letter’s legitimacy. They found that the claimed signees of the letter included officers who had no knowledge of their inclusion, who had refused to be included, and even one instance of a widow signing the letter in the guise of her husband, a former general who had died before the survey was published. The average age of the officers listed in the letter was 74, the oldest was 98, and Servicemembers United noted that "only a small fraction of these officers have even served in the military during the 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell' period, much less in the 21st century military."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Johnson, [http://www.washingtonblade.com/2010/03/03/new-report-undermines-officers%E2%80%99-letter-supporting-%E2%80%98don%E2%80%99t-ask%E2%80%99/ New report undermines officers’ letter supporting ‘Don’t Ask’], ''Washington Blade'', Mar 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the policy was introduced in 1993, the military has discharged over 13,000 troops from the military under DADT.&lt;ref name="MSN-MilitaryView"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ObamaEnd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=60043|title=Stars and Stripes: Obama Wants to End "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" |last=Shane|first=Leo|date=January 16, 2009|work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Defense]]|accessdate=January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/05/20/continued_discharges_anger_dont_ask_dont_tell_critics/ Continued discharges anger 'don't ask, don't tell' critics: Gay-rights groups urge reversal now] Bryan Bender, Boston Globe; May 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of discharges per fiscal year under DADT dropped sharply after the [[September 11 attacks]] and has remained comparatively low since. Discharges exceeded 600 every year until 2009. Unofficial statistics on the number of persons discharged per year follow:

==Financial impact of policy==
In February 2005, the [[Government Accountability Office]] released estimates on the cost of the policy. The GAO reported at least $95.4&amp;nbsp;million in recruiting costs and at least $95.1&amp;nbsp;million for training replacements for the 9,488 troops discharged from 1994 through 2003, while noting that the true figures might be higher.&lt;ref name = "qkuldr"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Report: 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' costs $363M|work=USA Today, Washington/Politics |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-02-14-dont-ask-report_x.htm |accessdate=May 25, 2007 | date=February 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, a [[University of California]] [[Blue Ribbon Commission]] including [[Lawrence Korb]], a former assistant defense secretary during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, former Defense Secretary [[William Perry]], a member of the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration, and professors from the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point concluded that figure should be closer to $363&amp;nbsp;million, including $14.3&amp;nbsp;million for "separation travel" once a servicemember is discharged, $17.8&amp;nbsp;million for training officers, $252.4&amp;nbsp;million for training enlistees and $79.3&amp;nbsp;million in recruiting costs.&lt;ref name = "qkuldr"/&gt; The commission report stated that the GAO did not take into account the value the military lost from the departures.

==Chaplains and religious groups==
Chaplain groups and religious organizations are taking various positions concerning the policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Some view that the policy must be withdrawn to make the military more inclusive. The Southern Baptist Convention is battling the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, warning that their endorsements for chaplains may be withdrawn if the repeal takes place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbio.com/Gay+and+Lesbian+Rights/articles/wZNA33qCpho/Baptists+Catholics+Threaten+Withdraw+Chaplains Baptists, Catholics Threaten to Withdraw Chaplains Over DADT – Gay and Lesbian Rights – Zimbio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/18/AR2010061804890.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Adelle M. | last=Banks | title=Southern Baptists Convention fighting 'don't ask, don't tell' repeal | date=June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They take the position that allowing gay men and women to serve in the military without restriction will have a negative impact on the ability of chaplains who think homosexuality is a sin to speak freely regarding their religious beliefs. The Roman Catholic Church has called for the retention of the policy, but has no plans to withdraw its priests from serving as military chaplains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/18/AR2010061804890.html |title=Washington Post, June 18, 21010 |work=The Washington Post |date= June 19, 2010|accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-five retired chaplains signed a letter opposing repeal, stating that repeal would make it impossible for chaplains whose faith teaches that same-sex behavior is immoral to minister to military servicemembers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/oct/31/retired-chaplains-back-dont-ask/ Retired chaplains back 'don't ask' – Washington Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other religious organizations and agencies call the repeal of the policy a "non-event" or "non-issue" for chaplains, claiming that chaplains have always supported military service personnel, whether or not they agree with all their actions or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrcbackstory.org/2010/04/religious-organizations-support-%E2%80%9Cdon%E2%80%99t-ask-don%E2%80%99t-tell%E2%80%9D-repeal |title=HRC Back Story, April 28, 2010 |publisher=Hrcbackstory.org |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sldn.org/blog/archives/bishop-robinsons-letter-exposes-empty-arguments-of-repeal-opponents |title=Servicemembers Legal Defense Network |publisher=Sldn.org |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Resnicoff |first=Arnold E. |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-07-12-column12_ST_N.htm |title=Op-Ed, Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff, USA Today, July 12, 2010 |work=USA Today |date=July 14, 2010 |accessdate=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
