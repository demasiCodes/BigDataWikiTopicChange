'''''Don't ask, don't tell''''' is the common term for the policy about homosexuality in the U.S. military mandated by federal law {{USPL|103|160}} ({{usc|10|654}}). Unless one of the exceptions from {{uscsub|10|654|b}} applies, the policy prohibits anyone who "demonstrate(s) a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts" from serving in the [[Military of the United States|armed forces of the United States]], because it "would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability." The act prohibits any [[homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] person from disclosing his or her [[sexual orientation]] or from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including marriages or other familial attributes, while serving in the [[United States armed forces]].

==Beginning of the policy==
The policy was introduced as a compromise measure in 1993 and approved by then President [[Bill Clinton]] who, while campaigning for the Presidency, had promised to allow all citizens regardless of sexual orientation to serve openly in the military, a departure from the then complete ban on those who are not [[heterosexual]]. The actual policy was crafted by [[Colin Powell]] and has been maintained by Clinton's successor, [[George W. Bush]].

{{quotation|Sexual orientation will not be a bar to service unless manifested by homosexual conduct. The military will discharge members who engage in homosexual conduct, which is defined as a homosexual act, a statement that the member is homosexual or bisexual, or a marriage or attempted marriage to someone of the same gender.|quoted in "The Pentagon's New Policy Guidelines on Homosexuals in the Military", ''[[The New York Times]]'' ([[July 20]][[1993]]), p.A14.}}

More generally, "Don't ask, don't tell" has come to describe any instance in which one person must keep sexual orientation and any related attributes, including family, a secret, but where deliberate lying would be undesirable.

==History==
During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the armed forces treated [[sodomy]] (then broadly defined as oral or anal sexual conduct) as grounds for being dishonorably discharged. The first such recorded discharge was in 1778, when Lieutenant Gotthold Frederick Enslin was (with the approval of General [[George Washington]] {{Fact|date=July 2008}}) dishonorably discharged following a conviction of homosexual sodomy and [[perjury]]. The [[Articles of War]] maintained the crime of sodomy, but it was not until 1942 that the armed forces considered homosexual status (as assessed by the military through a process of recruitment screening or internal investigations) as grounds for being separated from the military. Thus, anyone in the armed forces labeled as gay or bisexual were subject to criminal sanctions under the sodomy prohibition, or could be given a dishonorable discharge (often a [[Section 8 (military)|Section 8]]) and returned to civilian life, where they would not receive [[veterans]] benefits and often had difficulty finding employment because most civilian employers knew what a Section 8 discharge meant.

The success of the armed forces in pre-screening self-identified gay and bisexual people from the 1940s through 1981 remains in dispute; during the [[Vietnam Conflict]], some men pretended to be gay in order to avoid the draft. However, a significant number of gay and bisexual men and women did manage to avoid the pre-screening process and serve in the military, some with special distinction. For example, in the 1950s and 1960s, the Navy medical doctor [[Thomas Anthony Dooley|Tom Dooley]] received national fame for his anti-Communist and humanitarian efforts in Vietnam. His homosexuality was something of an open secret in the Navy, but eventually he was forced to resign; the Navy subsequently conducted the first official study on sexual orientation and the Navy regulations and rules. The 1957 report, titled ''Report of the Board Appointed to Prepare and Submit Recommendations to the Secretary of the Navy for the Revision of Policies, Procedures and Directives Dealing With Homosexuals'' (better known as the [[Crittenden Report]]) found that gay-identified people were no more likely to be a security risk than heterosexual-identified people, and found there was no rational basis for excluding gay people from the Navy, although it stopped short of recommending a change in the regulations because of social [[mores]].

Beyond the official regulations, gay people were often the target of various types of [[harassment]] by their fellow servicemen, designed to persuade them to resign from the military or turn themselves in to investigators. The most infamous type of such harassment was called a [[blanket party]]; during the night in the barracks, several service members first covered the face of the victim with a blanket and then committed assault, often quite severely and sometimes even fatally, as in the case of [[Allen R. Schindler, Jr.]]. When passing the "Don't ask, don't tell" bill, President Clinton cited [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Radioman]] [[Petty Officer Third Class|Third Class]] Schindler, who was brutally murdered by shipmate Terry M. Helvey (with the aid of an accomplice), leaving a "nearly-unrecognizable corpse".&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.palmcenter.org/press/dadt/in_print/abandoning_dont_ask_dont_tell_will_decrease_anti_gay_violence Belkin, Dr. Aaron. "Abandoning 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Will Decrease Anti-Gay Violence" Naval Institute: Proceedings Monthly. 1 May, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;
The introduction of "Don't ask, don't tell" with the later amendment of "don't pursue, don't harass" has officially prohibited such behavior, but reports suggest that such harassment continues.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.palmcenter.org/publications/dadt/perceived_sexual_orientation_based_harrassment_in_military_and_civilian_contexts Moradi, Dr. Bonnie "Perceived Sexual-Orientation-Based Harassment in Military and Civilian Contexts" Military Psychology 2006, 18(1), 39-60]&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of official and unofficial attempts to separate gay people from the armed forces seems to be directly related to the personnel needs of the armed forces.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} Hence, during wartime, it has not been uncommon for the rules regarding homosexuality to be relaxed. Until 1981, it was the policy of all branches of the armed forces to retain, at their discretion, anyone suspected of homosexual activity, thus promoting the "queen for a day" rule, which allowed a person accused of homosexuality to remain in the armed forces if one could successfully claim that their behavior was only a singular occurrence.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} This especially became the case during the Vietnam War.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

During the 1970s, several high-profile court challenges to the military's regulations on homosexuality occurred, with little success, and when such successes did occur it was when the plaintiff had been open about his homosexuality from the beginning or due to the existence of the "queen for a day" rule. In 1981, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] issued a new regulation on homosexuality that was designed to ensure withstanding a court challenge by developing uniform and clearly defined regulations and justifications that made homosexual status, whether self-applied or by the military, and conduct grounds for discharge (DOD Directive 1332.14 (Enlisted Administrative Separations), January, 1981):

{{quotation|Homosexuality is incompatible with military service. The presence in the military environment of persons who engage in homosexual conduct or who, by their statements, demonstrate a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct, seriously impairs the accomplishment of the military mission. The presence of such members adversely affects the ability of the armed forces to maintain discipline, good order, and morale; to foster mutual trust and confidence among service members; to insure the integrity of the system of rank and command; to facilitate assignment and worldwide deployment of service members who frequently must live and work in close conditions affording minimal privacy; to recruit and retain members of the armed forces; to maintain the public acceptability of military service; and to prevent breaches of security.}}

The directive justified the policy and removed the "queen for a day" rule that had prompted some courts to rule against the armed forces. However, the intent of the policy had also been to treat homosexuality as being akin to a disability discharge and thus ensure that anyone found engaging in homosexual activity and/or identifying as gay, would be separated with an honorable discharge. The DOD policy has since withstood most court challenges, although the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has refused to weigh in on the constitutionality of the policy, preferring to allow lower courts and the [[United States Congress]] to settle the matter.

In the 1980s, many of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] presidential candidates expressed an interest in changing the regulations concerning homosexuality in the armed forces, and, as American social mores changed, public opinion began to express more sympathy with gay people in armed forces, at least to the extent that investigations into a serviceman or -woman's sexual behaviour and/or orientation were seen as a witch-hunt. "Gays in the military" became a political issue during the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 Presidential campaign]], when Clinton, the Democratic candidate, promised to lift the military's ban on homosexual and bisexual people.

In 1992, the United States General Accounting Office published a report entitled ''Defense Force Management: DOD's Policy on Homosexuality. GAO/NSAID-92-98'', that outlined the DOD policy on homosexuality and the reasons for it. The report also included excerpts from a previously unpublished 1988 DOD study on homosexuality that made similar conclusions as the 1957 Crittenden Report. In 1993 the two reports were published alongside an argument by an armed forces general who argued against lifting the ban on homosexual- and bisexual-identified people based on a belief that they pose a security risk, will erode unit cohesion and morale alongside the argument that most homosexual and bisexual oriented people are [[pedophile]]s who engage in a self-destructive and immoral life-style (Most paedophiles are heterosexual. [[Paedophillia]] itself is a court martial offence, therefore ''Don't ask, Don't tell'' also applies to other sexual [[paraphillia]]s). {{Fact|date=October 2008}}

Congressional opposition to lifting the ban on gay and bisexual people in the armed forces was led by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Sam Nunn]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] who organized Congressional hearings that largely buffed the armed forces position that has remained unchanged since the 1981 directive. While Congressional support for reform was led by Democratic Congressman [[Barney Frank]] of [[Massachusetts]], who fought for a compromise, and retired [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], who argued for a complete repeal of the ban. After a large number of people flooded the Congressional phone lines with oppositions to lifting the ban, President Clinton soon backed off on his campaign promise to lift the ban on homosexual and bisexual people in the armed forces. The final result was a Congressional compromise of "Don't ask, don't tell" that was later amended to include "don't harass". Officially, the compromise dictates that the armed forces will no longer ask recruits about their sexual activity and/or orientation, will not investigate any serviceman or servicewoman's sexual activity and/or orientation without solid evidence (thus preventing witch-hunts), and self-identified homosexual servicemen and women agree that they will not engage in homosexual sex acts, or do anything that announces that they are a homosexual, i.e. public statements or participate in a same-sex marriage openly.

In 2000, Northwestern University Professor [[Charles Moskos]], the principal author of DADT (which, as originally coined by Moskos, was "Don't Ask Don't Tell; Don't Seek Don't Flaunt"), told "Lingua Franca" that he felt that policy will be gone within five to ten years. Moskos also dismissed the unit cohesion argument, instead arguing that gay people should be banned due to "modesty rights", saying "Fuck unit cohesion. I don't care about that...I should not be forced to shower with a woman. I should not be forced to shower with a gay [man]." Moskos did not offer any alternative to his DADT policy.&lt;ref&gt;

On [[September 13]], [[2005]], the [http://www.gaymilitary.ucsb.edu/ Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military] (on [[October 23]], [[2006]] renamed the
[http://www.palmcenter.org/ Michael D. Palm Center]), a [[think tank]] affiliated with the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], issued a news release revealing the existence of a 1999 [[FORSCOM]] regulation (Regulation 500-3-3) that allowed the active duty deployment of Army Reservists and National Guard troops who say that they are gay or who are accused of being gay. U.S. Army Forces Command spokesperson Kim Waldron later confirmed the regulation and indicated that it was intended to prevent Reservists and National Guard members from pretending to be gay to escape combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chibbaro, Lou|year=2005|title=Out gay soldiers sent to Iraq - Regulation keeps straights from 'playing gay' to avoid war|work=Washington Blade |url=http://washblade.com/2005/9-23/news/national/outiraq.cfm |accessdate=2006-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Don't ask, don't tell" has been upheld five times in federal court, and in a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights]]'', the Supreme Court unanimously held that the federal government could withhold funding in order to force universities to accept military recruiters in spite of their nondiscrimination policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mears, Bill|year=2006|title=Justices uphold military recruiting on campuses|work=CNN Law Center |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/03/06/scotus.recruiting/index.html |accessdate=2006-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the National Defense Research Institute of the Rand Corporation published ''Sexual Orientation and U.S. Military Personnel Policy: Options and Assessment'', prepared for the Office of the Secretary of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;Identified as MR-323-OSD and with ISBN 0-8330-1441-2, 13 Chapters, 518 pages, paperback.&lt;/ref&gt; On page 409, "Appendix A" exhibits an "Illustrative Standard of Professional Conduct". On page 411, "Appendix B" gives a detailed study of "Living and Privacy Conditions in the Military Service". "Appendix C" analyzes "Legal Provisions Concerning Sodomy". "Appendices D and E" study foreign armed forces (especially Canada's), and "Appendix F" gives "Relevant Data from Surveys".

==Public opinion==
Polls have shown that a large majority of the American public favors allowing gay and lesbian people to serve openly in the U.S. military. A national poll conducted in May 2005 by the [[Boston Globe]] showed 79% of participants having nothing against openly gay people from serving in the military. In a 2008 ''[[Washington Post]]''–[[ABC News]] poll, 75% of Americans – including 80% of Democrats, 75% of independents, and 66% of conservatives – said that openly gay people should be allowed to serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/18/AR2008071802561.html?nav=rss_nation Acceptance of Gay People in Military Grows Dramatically - washingtonpost.com&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the military remains largely opposed.  An ''[[Army Times]]'' poll of military members only found 25% in favor of allowing homosexuals to serve openly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/national/20041012-101444-1302r.htm Washington Times - GOP gays targeting 'don't ask, don't tell'&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial impact of policy ==

In February 2005, the [[Government Accountability Office]] released estimates on the cost of the policy. Cautioning that the amount may be too low, the GAO reported $95.4 million in recruiting costs and $95.1 million for training replacements for the 9,488 troops discharged from 1994 through 2003.&lt;ref name = "qkuldr"&gt;{{cite web |year=2006|title=Report: 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' costs $363M|work=USA Today, Washington/Politics |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-02-14-dont-ask-report_x.htm |accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, a [[University of California]] [[Blue Ribbon Commission]] including [[Lawrence Korb]], a former assistant defense secretary during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, former [[Defense Secretary]] [[William Perry]], a member of the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration, and professors from [[West Point]] U.S. [[Military Academy]] concluded that figure should be closer to $363 million, including $14.3 million for "separation travel" once a service member is discharged, $17.8 million for training officers, $252.4 million for training enlistees and $79.3 million in recruiting costs.&lt;ref name = "qkuldr"/&gt; The commission report stated that the GAO didn't take into account the value the military lost from the departures.

== Military Readiness Enhancement Act ==

The [[Military Readiness Enhancement Act]] ({{USBill|110|HR|1246}}) is a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] introduced in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on [[February 28]], [[2007]].  Sponsored by Representative [[Marty Meehan]] (D-MA) with 142 cosponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR01246:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;#major%20actions The Library of Congress - Status of H.R.1246]&lt;/ref&gt; On [[March 28]], [[2007]] the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Committee on Armed Services]] sent the bill to the [[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel|Subcommittee on Military Personnel]].

The stated purpose of the bill is "to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the readiness of the Armed Forces by replacing the current policy concerning homosexuality in the Armed Forces, referred to as 'Don't ask, don't tell', with a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."

A previous version of the bill ([http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:H.R.1059: H.R. 1059]) was introduced in the Republican-controlled [[109th United States Congress|109th Congress]].  It also was sponsored by Rep. Meehan, and it had 122 cosponsors. The bill did not make it out of committee.

== Criticism from military personnel ==

Former [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Gen. [[John Shalikashvili]] (Ret.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gordon|last=Lubold|title=Former JCS chairman: It's time to give 'don't ask, don't tell' policy another look|url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/issues/stories/0-AIRPAPER-2461638.php|publisher=Air Force Times|date=2007-01-15|accessdate=2007-01-13|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former [[United States Senate|Senator]] and [[Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}} spoke against the policy publicly in early January 2007: "I now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military, they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces," General Shalikashvili wrote.  "Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East, and we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job."&lt;ref name="newletter" /&gt;

In December 2007, 28 retired generals and admirals urged Congress to repeal the policy.  They cited evidence that 65,000 gay men and women are currently serving in the armed forces, and that there are over 1,000,000 gay veterans.&lt;ref name="newletter"&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom|last=Shanker|coauthors=Healy, Patrick|title=A New Push to Roll Back 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/us/30military.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=2007-11-30|accessdate=2007-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[4 May]], [[2008]], current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. [[Mike Mullen]], when speaking to graduating cadets at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], expressed the view "that Congress, and not the military, is responsible for the 'Don't ask, don't tell' law banning openly lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans from military service." Mullen's answer came in response to a cadet's question asking what would happen if the next administration were supportive of legislation allowing gays to serve openly. During his Senate confirmation hearing in 2007, Mullen told lawmakers, "I really think it is for the American people to come forward, really through this body, to both debate that policy and make changes, if that's appropriate." He went on to say, "I'd love to have Congress make its own decisions", with respect to considering repeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sldn.org/templates/press/record.html?section=2&amp;record=4798 SLDN Press Release - Admiral Mullen speaks at West Point]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situation outside the United States==
{{main|Sexual orientation and military service}}

Most Western military forces have now removed policies excluding individuals of sexual orientations other than heterosexual (with strict policies on [[sexual harassment]]). Of the 25 countries that participate militarily in [[NATO]], more than twenty permit gay people to serve; of the permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], two (Britain, France) permit gay people to serve openly, and three (United States, Russia, China) do not.

===Australia===

The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] policies are to allow gay men and lesbians to serve openly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5D81139F937A15752C1A964958260 "Australia Ends a Prohibition On Homosexuals in Military"], ''New York Times'', November 24, 1992 &lt;/ref&gt; Attention has been drawn to dual [[American Australian|American–Australian]] citizen [[Norbert Basil MacLean III]], who served in the [[U.S. Navy]] from 1989–1994 but was [[court-martialled]] on what he claims were trumped-up charges due to his sexuality.  Had MacLean served in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] he would have been permitted to serve as an openly gay man.  MacLean's case in the U.S. has resulted in congressional bills in both houses of the 110th [[U.S. Congress]] related to Supreme Court review of American courts-martial cases. On September 12, 2008, the ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'' reported in a front page article that MacLean has applied to join the [[Royal Australian Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;"Senate OKs Review of Courts-Martial", by Laura Ernde, ''Los Angeles Daily Journal'', September 12, 2008, front page&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

On [[October 27]], [[1992]], protocol officer Air Force lieutenant [[Michelle Douglas]] won a suit against the [[Canadian Forces]] for discrimination that had forced her resignation. Subsequently, Canada's official policy toward gay men and women in uniform has been one of non-discrimination.

A series of provincial and territorial Supreme Court decisions beginning in 2003 ruled in favour of the legality of [[gay marriage]], and a national law to that effect was passed by Canada's [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] in 2005 by the [[Paul Martin]] Liberal government. In May 2005, Canada's first military gay wedding took place at [[Nova Scotia]]'s [[CFB Greenwood|Canadian Forces Base Greenwood]]. Officials described the ceremony as low-key but touching. A similar wedding has since taken place between two male [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officers.

During the 2008 Toronto Pride Parade, ten members of the Canadian Forces marched for the first time.  Before the parade began, they worked an information booth. Lt(N) Steven Churm said, "The message to the public is that the Canadian Forces is an employer of choice. We have employment opportunities that people can pursue, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation. For our own members, they can be proud of what they're doing and also be proud of who they are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/06/29/gay-pride.html Soldiers march in Toronto Gay Pride parade]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The German [[Bundeswehr]] ruled that it is forbidden to discriminate based on sexual orientation. The "Working Committee of Homosexual Employees in the Military Forces"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahsab.de/|A.H.s.A.B. - Arbeitskreis homosexueller Angehöriger der Bundeswehr] (Site is only in German)&lt;/ref&gt; is the representation of interests for homosexuals in the armed forces.

===Israel===
The [[Israel Defense Forces]] policies allow for gay men and lesbians to serve openly without discrimination or harassment due to actual or perceived sexual orientation. Moreover, gays in the IDF have additional rights, such as the right to take a shower alone if they want to.

===Italy===
The [[Military of Italy|Armed Forces of Italy]] can not deny men or women of homosexual orientation to serve within their ranks, as this would be a [[Constitution of Italy|violation of Constitutional rights]]. However, much prejudice about homosexuals still exists within the Italian armed forces, so that they generally decide to hide their sexual orientation.{{Fact|date=October 2008}} In the past, homosexual conduct was grounds for being discharged from the Italian armed forces for reason of insanity, and feigning homosexuality was a very popular way to obtain medical rejection and skip [[Conscription|draft]].{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] policy is to allow gay men and lesbians to serve openly, and discrimination on a sexual orientation basis is forbidden. It is also forbidden for someone to pressure LGBT people to [[Coming out|come out]]. All personnel  are subject to the same "no-touching" rules.

===Switzerland===
Switzerland's military policies also allow for gay men and lesbians to serve openly without discrimination or harassment due to actual or perceived sexual orientation.
