{{LGBT rights}}
'''''Don't ask, don't tell''''' ('''DADT''') is the common term for the policy restricting the  [[United States military]] from efforts to discover or reveal [[closeted]] [[gay]], [[lesbian]], and [[bisexual]] servicemembers or applicants, while barring those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. The restrictions are mandated by federal law {{USPL|103|160}} ({{usc|10|654}}). Unless one of the exceptions from {{uscsub|10|654|b}} applies, the policy prohibits anyone who "demonstrate(s) a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts" from serving in the [[Military of the United States|armed forces of the United States]], because "it would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order, discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability." The act prohibits any [[homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] person from disclosing his or her [[sexual orientation]] or from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including marriages or other familial attributes, while serving in the [[United States armed forces]].

As it exists, DADT specifies that the "don't ask" part of the policy indicates that superiors should not initiate investigation of a servicemember's orientation in the absence of disallowed behaviors, though credible and articulable evidence of homosexual behavior may cause an investigation. Violations of this aspect through persecutions and harassment of suspected servicemen and women resulted in the policy's current formulation as "don't ask, don't tell, don't harass, don't pursue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/d9/D9Legal/docs/05_2010MAYNewsletterDontAskDontTell.pdf |title=United States Coast Guard Ninth District Legal Office '&amp;#39;The Legal Brief'&amp;#39; "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t Pursue, Don’t Harass: Reference (a): Personnel Manual, COMDTINST M1000.6, Ch. 12.E.", May 2010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Syn|date=October 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/05/22/national/main4117730.shtml |title=The Associated Press, '&amp;#39;New Scrutiny For "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" Federal Appeals Court Rejects Automatic Dismissal Of Openly Gay Service Members'&amp;#39;, May 22, 2008 |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV-statement|date=October 2010}}&lt;!--References not use the terms "persecution" or "harassment"; Coast Guard newsletter simply explains DADT, and both refs say "Don't Harass" is part of DADT.--&gt;

In 2010 the House of Representatives passed a bill that would repeal the relevant sections of the law, but this measure was stalled in the Senate.

In the autumn of 2010, a federal district court judge [[Log Cabin Republicans v. United States of America|declared]] the Don't ask, don't tell policy unconstitutional and issued an injunction prohibiting the Department of Defense from enforcing or complying with the policy. The appellate court stayed the injunction pending appeal; thus Don't Ask, Don't Tell remains in effect. On November 12, the [[US Supreme Court]] refused to overturn the stay.

==Background==
{{Further|[[LGBT policy in the U.S. military]]}}

[[Image:Dontaskdonttellcredible.jpg|thumb|310px|The U.S. Army training guide on the homosexual conduct policy gives official guidelines on what can be considered credible information of someone's homosexuality.]]

[[Sodomy]] has been grounds for discharge from the American military since the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], but the LGBT-related policies changed over the course of the 20th century. The subject remains a debate in [[United States Congress|Congress]], the topic of political campaigns and activism, presidential speeches, and popular opinion polls. [[Frederick Gotthold Enslin|Lieutenant Gotthold Frederick Enslin]] was the first soldier discharged from the U.S. military (at that time, the [[Continental Army]]) for sodomy, in 1778.&lt;ref name="Herek"&gt;{{cite web| url = Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S. Military: Historical Background | title = Don't Ask, Don't Tell Revisited | accessdate = 2010-06-03 | last = Herek | first = Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in 1916, neutral [[blue discharge]]s were often given to gay personnel. As the U.S. prepared to enter [[World War II]], the military added psychiatric screening to its induction process. At the time, [[psychiatry]] labeled homosexuality as an indicator of [[psychopathology]], and this notion was added to military practices. The first time "homosexual" people were differentiated from "normal" people in the military literature was in revised army mobilization regulations in 1942.&lt;ref name="Herek"/&gt; In 1947, the blue discharges were discontinued and instead labeled "general" and "undesirable". Under such a system, a servicemember found to be gay but who had not committed any sexual acts while in service would receive an undesirable discharge. Those found guilty of engaging in sexual conduct were dishonorably discharged. From the 1940s through the Vietnam War, some notable gay servicemembers avoided discharges despite pre-screening efforts, and when personnel shortages occurred, homosexuals were allowed to serve. In the 1970s, the [[LGBT social movements|gay and lesbian rights movement]] emerged in the U.S. and chose the anti-gay military policy as one of its main targets. Partially as a response to this movement, the Department of Defense issued a 1982 policy (DOD Directive 1332.14) stating that homosexuality was clearly incompatible with military service.&lt;ref name="Herek"/&gt;  The policy garnered public scrutiny through the 1980s and 1990s, and it became a political issue in the [[1992 U.S. presidential election]] with [[Bill Clinton]] and others citing the brutal murder of gay [[U.S. Navy]] petty officer [[Allen R. Schindler, Jr.]] After Bill Clinton won the presidency, Congress rushed to enact the existing gay ban policy into federal law, outflanking Clinton's planned repeal effort. Clinton introduced Congressional legislation to overturn the ban, but it encountered intense scrutiny by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], members of Congress, and portions of the U.S. public. "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" emerged as a compromise policy.&lt;ref name="Herek"/&gt;

==History==
===Origin===
The policy was introduced as a compromise measure in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton who campaigned on the promise to allow all citizens to serve in the military regardless of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Shankar, Thom"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Shankar, Thom|title=A New Push to Roll Back ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’|work=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/us/30military.html |accessdate=2010-03-25 | date=November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, per the December 21, 1993  Department of Defense Directive 1332.14,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dont.stanford.edu/regulations/DOD1332.14.html DoDD 1332.14, December 21, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; it was legal policy (10 U.S.C. § 654)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html Title 10, Subtitle A, Part II, Chapter 37, § 654.

Congress overrode Clinton by including text in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (passed in 1993) requiring the military to abide by regulations essentially identical to the 1982 absolute ban policy.&lt;ref name=stanforddont /&gt; The Clinton Administration on December 21, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/dodd/corres/html2/d130426x.htm |title=Defense Directive 1304.26:  Qualification Standards for Enlistment, Appointment, and Induction |date=December 21, 1993 |publisher=Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued Defense Directive 1304.26, which directed that military applicants were not to be asked about their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=stanforddont /&gt; This is the policy now known as "Don't Ask, Don't Tell".

The full name of the policy at the time was "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Don’t Pursue." The "Don’t Ask" provision mandates that military or appointed officials will not ask about or require members to reveal their sexual orientation. The "Don’t Tell" states that a member may be discharged for claiming to be a homosexual or bisexual or making a statement indicating a tendency towards or intent to engage in homosexual activities. The "Don’t Pursue" establishes what is minimally required for an investigation to be initiated. A "Don’t Harass" provision was added to the policy later. It ensures that the military will not allow harassment or violence against service members for any reason.&lt;ref name="Herek"/&gt;

Gay personnel were often the target of various types of [[harassment]] by their comrades, intended to compel them to resign or confess to investigators.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} An infamous version of this harassment was called a [[blanket party]]; at night several servicemembers would restrain their victim in their bunk with a blanket or sheet, and then beat the victim.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} At times beatings of gay personnel were severe and occasionally even fatal, as in the case of [[Allen R. Schindler, Jr.]]. In defense of his DADT policy, President Clinton cited [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Radioman]] [[Petty Officer Third Class|Third Class]] Schindler, brutally murdered by shipmate Terry M. Helvey (with the aid of an accomplice), leaving a "nearly-unrecognizable corpse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Aaron Belkin |url=http://www.palmcenter.org/press/dadt/in_print/abandoning_dont_ask_dont_tell_will_decrease_anti_gay_violence |title=Belkin, Dr. Aaron.

DADT has officially prohibited such behavior, but harassment continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmcenter.org/publications/dadt/perceived_sexual_orientation_based_harrassment_in_military_and_civilian_contexts |title=Moradi, Dr. Bonnie "Perceived Sexual-Orientation-Based Harassment in Military and Civilian Contexts" Military Psychology 2006, 18(1), 39–60 |publisher=Palmcenter.org |date=2006-04-01 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of the 1993 controversy, the National Defense Research Institute prepared a study for the Office of the Secretary of Defense published as ''Sexual Orientation and U.S. Military Personnel Policy: Options and Assessment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=National Defense Research Institute |title=Sexual orientation and U.

In Congress, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Sam Nunn]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] led the contingent that favored maintaining the absolute ban on gays. Reformers were led by Democratic Congressman [[Barney Frank]] of [[Massachusetts]], who favored modification (but ultimately voted for the defense authorization bill with the gay ban language), and retired [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], who argued on behalf of full repeal. After Congressional phone lines were flooded by organized anti-gay opposition, President Clinton backed off on his campaign promise to repeal the ban in favor of the DADT "compromise."

===Reservist exception: 1999===

[[File:Congressman Marty Meehan joined by retired flag officers interested in repealling DADT.jpg|right|thumb|400px|In 2005, member of Congress [[Marty Meehan]] (third from left) unsuccessfully attempted to repeal the policy.]]

In September 2005, the Center for the Study of Sexual Minorities in the Military – a [[think tank]] affiliated with the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], and renamed the Michael D. Palm Center in October 2006 – issued a news release revealing they had found a 1999 FORSCOM Regulation (500-3-3 RC Unit Commander's Handbook) that allowed the active duty deployment of Army Reservists and National Guard troops who say that they are gay or who are accused of being gay. U.S. Army Forces Command spokesperson Kim Waldron later confirmed the regulation and indicated that it was intended to prevent Reservists and National Guard members from pretending to be gay to escape combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chibbaro |first=Lou |year=2005|title=Out gay soldiers sent to Iraq – Regulation keeps straights from 'playing gay' to avoid war |work=Washington Blade |url=http://washblade.com/2005/9-23/news/national/outiraq.cfm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080516002106/http://washblade.com/2005/9-23/news/national/outiraq.cfm |archivedate=2008-05-16 |accessdate=2006-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unsuccessful court challenges===
DADT has been upheld by four of the federal Circuit Courts of Appeal,&lt;ref&gt;''Richenberg v. Perry'', 97 F.3d 256 (8th Cir. 1996); ''Thomasson v. Perry'', 80 F.3d 915 (4th Cir. 1996); ''Able v. United States'', 155 F.3d 628 (2d Cir. 1998); ''Cook v. Gates'', 528 F.3d 42 (1st Cir. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and in a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, [[Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.]] (2006), the Supreme Court unanimously held that the federal government could constitutionally withhold funding from universities if they refuse to give military recruiters access to school resources, in spite of any university nondiscrimination policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mears |first=Bill |year=2006 |title=Justices uphold military recruiting on campuses |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/03/06/scotus.recruiting/index.html |accessdate=2006-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed repeal: 2008–2010===

In his election campaign, President Barack Obama also advocated a full repeal of the laws barring gays from serving in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24046489/ |title=Obama: Repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell' possible |agency=Associated Press |publisher=MSNBC |date=April 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As president, Obama said in his first State of the Union Address, "This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/01/27/obama.gays.military/index.html |title=Obama calls for 'don't ask, don't tell' repeal |publisher=CNN |date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 2010, Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] announced new rules mandating that only [[flag officers]] may initiate discharge proceedings and imposing more stringent rules of evidence be used during discharge proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/03/25/us/politics/AP-US-Military-Gays.html |title=Pentagon Changes Rules for Discharging Gays |agency=Associated Press |work=The New York Times |date=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2010, a federal district judge declared the policy to be unconstitutional in [[Log Cabin Republicans v. United States of America]].

==Responses to DADT==
===Psychological community===
In 1993, [[Gregory M. Herek]], Ph.D., associate research psychologist at the [[University of California at Davis]] and a national authority on public attitudes toward lesbians and gay men, testified before the [[House Armed Services Committee]], chaired by Representative [[Ron Dellums]]. Testifying on behalf of the [[American Psychological Association]] and five other national professional organizations (the [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[National Association of Social Workers]], the [[American Counseling Association]], the [[American Nursing Association]], and the [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]]), Herek stated "My written testimony to the Committee summarizes the results of an extensive review of the relevant published research from the social and behavioral sciences. That review is lengthy. However, I can summarize its conclusions in a few words: The research data show that there is nothing about lesbians and gay men that makes them inherently unfit for military service, and there is nothing about heterosexuals that makes them inherently unable to work and live with gay people in close quarters."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M. Herek: [http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/miltest2.html Oral Statement of Gregory M. Herek, Ph.D to the House Armed Services Committee – Made on behalf of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association, National Association of Social Workers, American Counseling Association, American Nursing Association, and the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States]&lt;/ref&gt; In his testimony, Herek reviewed existing scientific research concerning issues of unit cohesion and effectiveness and the fitness of lesbians and gay men for military service. He concluded that straight personnel can overcome their prejudices and adapt to living and working in close quarters with gays. Furthermore, he said gays are not inherently less capable of military service than are straight women and men. "The assumption that heterosexuals cannot overcome their prejudices toward gay people is a mistaken one," said Herek.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M. Herek: [http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/miltest1.html Psychologist Testifies Against Military's Anti-Gay Ban – Researcher Cites Scientific Evidence That Nondiscriminatory Military Policy Can Be Implemented]&lt;/ref&gt; Herek stated in 2008: "Today, as then (1993), the real question is not whether sexual minorities can be successfully integrated into the military. The social science data answered this question in the affirmative then, and do so even more clearly now. Rather, the issue is whether the United States is willing to repudiate its current practice of anti-gay discrimination and address the challenges associated with a new policy."&lt;ref&gt;Beyond Homophobia: [http://www.beyondhomophobia.com/blog/2008/07/23/from-1993-to-2008-dadt-and-the-house-armed-services-committee/ From 1993 to 2008: DADT and the House Armed Services Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

American Psychological Association states:
{{quote|Empirical evidence fails to show that sexual orientation is germane to any aspect of military effectiveness including unit cohesion, morale, recruitment and retention (Belkin, 2003; Belkin &amp; Bateman, 2003; Herek, Jobe, &amp; Carney, 1996; MacCoun, 1996; National Defense Research Institute, 1993).

Comparative data from foreign militaries and domestic police and fire departments show that when lesbians, gay men and bisexuals are allowed to serve openly there is no evidence of disruption or loss of mission effectiveness (Belkin &amp; McNichol, 2000–2001; Gade, Segal, &amp; Johnson, 1996; Koegel, 1996).

When openly gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals have been allowed to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces (Cammermeyer v. Aspin, 1994; Watkins v. United States Army, 1989/1990), there has been no evidence of disruption or loss of mission effectiveness.

The U.S. military is capable of integrating members of groups historically excluded from its ranks, as demonstrated by its success in reducing both racial and gender discrimination (Binkin &amp; Bach, 1977; Binkin, Eitelberg, Schexnider, &amp; Smith, 1982; Kauth &amp; Landis, 1996; Landis, Hope, &amp; Day, 1984; Thomas &amp; Thomas, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;American Psychological Association [http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/military.aspx Proceedings of the American Psychological Association, Incorporated, for the legislative year 2004.

Public opinion polls have been widely varied in their results.  A national poll conducted in May 2005 by the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' showed 79% of participants don't oppose openly gay people from serving in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/specials/gay_marriage/articles/2005/05/15/one_year_later_nation_divided_on_gay_marriage/ |title=Boston.com |publisher=Boston.com |date=2005-05-15 |accessdate=2010-10-13 | first=Scott S. | last=Greenberger}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 ''[[Washington Post]]''–[[ABC News]] poll, 75% of Americans – including 80% of Democrats, 75% of independents, and 66% of conservatives – said that openly gay people should be allowed to serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/18/AR2008071802561.html |title=Acceptance of Gay People in Military Grows Dramatically – |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= July 19, 2008|accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 [[Zogby International]] poll of military members found that 26% were in favor of gays serving in the military, 37% were opposed, while 37% expressed no preference or were unsure.  Of the respondents who had experience with gays in their unit, 6% said their presence had a positive impact on their personal morale, 66% said no impact, and 28% said negative impact.  Likewise, regarding overall unit morale, 3% said positive impact, 64% no impact, and 27% negative impact. As for respondents uncertain whether they had served with gay personnel, 2% thought gays would have a positive effect on personal morale, while 29% thought that they would have no impact and 48% thought that they would have a negative effect. Likewise, regarding overall unit morale, 2% thought that gays would have a positive effect on overall unit morale, 26% thought they would have no effect, and 58% thought they would have a negative effect.  More generally, 73% of respondents said that they felt comfortable in the presence of gay and lesbian personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmcenter.org/files/active/0/ZogbyReport.pdf |title=Opinions of Military Personnel on Sexual Minorities in the Military |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East, and we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job."&lt;ref name="newletter" /&gt;

In December 2007, 28 retired generals and admirals urged Congress to repeal the policy, citing evidence that 65,000 gay men and women are currently serving in the armed forces and that there are over 1,000,000 gay veterans.&lt;ref name="newletter"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Tom|last=Shanker|coauthors=Healy, Patrick|title=A New Push to Roll Back 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/us/30military.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|work=[[New York Times]]|date=2007-11-30|accessdate=2007-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSN-MilitaryView"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Admirals, generals: Let gays serve openly|work=MSNBC|date=18 November 2008|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27774058/page/2/|accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 17, 2008, 104 retired generals and admirals signed a similar statement.&lt;ref name="MSN-MilitaryView"/&gt;

On May 4, 2008, while Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral [[Mike Mullen]] addressed the graduating cadets at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], a cadet asked what would happen if the next administration were supportive of legislation allowing gays to serve openly. Mullen responded, "Congress, and not the military, is responsible for [DADT]." Previously, during his Senate confirmation hearing in 2007, Mullen told lawmakers, "I really think it is for the American people to come forward, really through this body, to both debate that policy and make changes, if that's appropriate." He went on to say, "I'd love to have Congress make its own decisions" with respect to considering repeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sldn.org/templates/press/record.html?section=2&amp;record=4798 SLDN Press Release – Admiral Mullen speaks at West Point]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on CNN's ''State of the Union'' broadcast on July 5, 2009, Colin Powell said he thought that the policy was "correct for the time" but that "sixteen years have now gone by, and I think a lot has changed with respect to attitudes within our country, and therefore I think this is a policy and a law that should be reviewed." In the same program, Admiral Mullen said the policy would continue to be implemented until the law was repealed, and that his advice was to "move in a measured way... At a time when we're fighting two conflicts there is a great deal of pressure on our forces and their families."&lt;ref name="July5_Powell_Mullen"&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE5641A920090705 Time to review policy on gays in U.S. military: Powell], July 5, [[Reuters]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Air Force Colonel Om Prakash sharply criticized the policy in an article published in ''[[Joint Force Quarterly]]''.

Nineteen days after his election, Obama's advisers announced that plans to repeal the policy may be delayed until as late as 2010, because Obama "first wants to confer with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his new political appointees at the Pentagon to reach a consensus, and then present legislation to Congress."&lt;ref name="scarborough"&gt;Rowan Scarborough.[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/nov/21/obama-to-delay-repeal-of-dont-ask-dont-tell/ "Obama to delay repeal of 'don't ask, don't tell': advisers see consensus building before lifting ban on gays] ''Washington Times'', November 21, 2008.

He had made similar statements during other speeches; however, his State of the Union speech was the first in which he definitively committed to repealing the law on a set timetable.

===Letter of support for maintaining DADT===
Citing a letter signed by "over one thousand former general and flag officers who have weighed in on this issue," Senator [[John McCain]] of Arizona claimed that "we should pay attention and benefit from the experience and knowledge" of these officers. At the February 2, 2010 congressional hearing of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral [[Mike Mullen]] and Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]], McCain read directly from the letter, saying "We firmly believe that this law, which Congress passed to protect good order, discipline and morale in the unique environment of the armed forces deserves continued support." [[Servicemembers United]], a veterans' group opposed to "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", issued a subsequent report on the letter’s legitimacy. They found that the letter’s claimed signees included officers who had no knowledge of their inclusion, who had refused to be included, and even veterans who had died before the survey was conducted, including one instance of a widow signing the letter in the guise of her husband, a former general. The average age of the officers listed in the letter was 74, the oldest was 98, and Servicemembers United noted that "only a small fraction of these officers have even served in the military during the 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell' period, much less in the 21st century military."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Johnson, [http://www.washingtonblade.com/2010/03/03/new-report-undermines-officers%E2%80%99-letter-supporting-%E2%80%98don%E2%80%99t-ask%E2%80%99/ New report undermines officers’ letter supporting ‘Don’t Ask’], ''Washington Blade'', Mar 03, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2010, Judge Phillips ruled that the ban was unconstitutional, as a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jIWJ1V2EsAQ8O7sPsyfXG0OAQTBwD9I56TQ82 |title=US judge: 'Don't ask, don't tell' unconstitutional |agency=Associated Press |date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/09/federal-judge-declares-us-military-ban-on-openly-gay-service-members-unconstitutional-.html |title=Judge declares U.S. military's 'don't ask, don't tell' policy openly banning gay service members unconstitutional |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=September 9, 2010 |author=Phil Willon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2010, Judge Phillips ordered the military to suspend and discontinue any investigation or discharge, separation, or other proceeding that have been commenced under the "Don't ask, don't tell".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The Department of Justice responded two days later with an appeal and the request for an emergency stay to allow them to continue to work under the policy.&lt;ref name="stay"/&gt;

==Number of discharges==
Since the policy was introduced in 1993, the military has discharged over 13,000 troops from the military under DADT.&lt;ref name="MSN-MilitaryView"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ObamaEnd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=60043|title=Stars and Stripes: Obama Wants to End “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” |last=Shane|first=Leo|date=January 16, 2009|work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Defense]]|accessdate=2009-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/05/20/continued_discharges_anger_dont_ask_dont_tell_critics/ Continued discharges anger 'don't ask, don't tell' critics: Gay-rights groups urge reversal now] Bryan Bender, Boston Globe; May 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of discharges per fiscal year under DADT dropped sharply after the [[September 11 attacks]] and has remained comparatively low since. Discharges exceeded 600 every year until 2009. Statistics on the number of persons discharged per year follow:

==Financial impact of policy==
In February 2005, the [[Government Accountability Office]] released estimates on the cost of the policy. Cautioning that the amount may be too low, the GAO reported $95.4 million in recruiting costs and $95.1 million for training replacements for the 9,488 troops discharged from 1994 through 2003.&lt;ref name = "qkuldr"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Report: 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' costs $363M|work=USA Today, Washington/Politics |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-02-14-dont-ask-report_x.htm |accessdate=2007-05-25 | date=February 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, a [[University of California]] [[Blue Ribbon Commission]] including [[Lawrence Korb]], a former assistant defense secretary during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, former [[Defense Secretary]] [[William Perry]], a member of the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration, and professors from the United States [[Military Academy]] at [[West Point]] concluded that figure should be closer to $363 million, including $14.3 million for "separation travel" once a servicemember is discharged, $17.8 million for training officers, $252.4 million for training enlistees and $79.3 million in recruiting costs.&lt;ref name = "qkuldr"/&gt; The commission report stated that the GAO didn't take into account the value the military lost from the departures.

==Military Readiness Enhancement Act==
{{Main|Military Readiness Enhancement Act}}
The Military Readiness Enhancement Act is a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] with the stated purpose "to amend [[Title 10 of the United States Code|title 10, United States Code]], to enhance the readiness of the [[United States armed forces|Armed Forces]] by replacing the current policy concerning [[homosexuality]] in the Armed Forces, referred to as 'Don't ask, don't tell,' with a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."

==Comprehensive Review Working Group (CRWG)==
On March 2, 2010, Secretary Gates issued a [http://www.defense.gov/news/crtor.pdf memorandum] directing that an intra-department, inter-service working group be stood up "to conduct a comprehensive review of the issues associated with a repeal of the [Don't Ask, Don't Tell] law," with a due date of December 1, 2010, for the CRWG final report.  The working group is co-chaired by General [[Carter Ham]] and DOD General Counsel [[Jeh Johnson]]&lt;ref name="SAS"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lisa M. Novak |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/dadt-working-group-hosting-forums-at-overseas-bases-1.113433 |title=Stars and Stripes, Aug 4, 2010 |publisher=Stripes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of its work, the group has traveled extensively to military bases throughout the United States and overseas, and has issued a world-wide military survey to 400,000 servicemembers and 150,000 military spouses, with a due date of Aug 15, 2010.&lt;ref name="SAS"/&gt;

==Chaplains and religious groups==
Chaplain groups and religious organizations are taking various positions concerning the policy of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Some view that the policy must be withdrawn to make the military more inclusive. Some groups such as the Southern Baptist Convention are battling the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, warning that its endorsements for chaplains may be withdrawn if the repeal takes place.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The Convention takes the position that allowing gay men and women to serve in the military without restriction will have a negative impact on the ability of chaplains who think homosexuality is a sin to speak freely regarding their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/18/AR2010061804890.html |title=Washington Post, June 18, 21010 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= June 19, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third group of religious organizations and agencies call the repeal of the policy a "non-event" or "non-issue" for chaplains, claiming that chaplains have always supported military service personnel, whether or not they agree with all their actions or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrcbackstory.org/2010/04/religious-organizations-support-%E2%80%9Cdon%E2%80%99t-ask-don%E2%80%99t-tell%E2%80%9D-repeal |title=HRC Back Story, April 28, 2010 |publisher=Hrcbackstory.org |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sldn.org/blog/archives/bishop-robinsons-letter-exposes-empty-arguments-of-repeal-opponents |title=Servicemembers Legal Defense Network |publisher=Sldn.org |date=2010-08-04 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Resnicoff |first=Arnold E. |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/2010-07-12-column12_ST_N.htm |title=Op-Ed, Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff, USA Today, July 12, 2010 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Obama Administration==
Then-Senator Obama campaigned for the presidency on a platform that included allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military. Almost immediately after taking the oath of office, President Obama acknowledged that repeal would not happen immediately and that he needed to confer with his civilian and military advisers before any change was made.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} On October 10, 2009, President Obama stated in a speech before the [[Human Rights Campaign]] that he will end the ban, but offered no timetable.&lt;ref name="Simmons"/&gt;
Obama did offer a time table in his 2010 State of the Union Address when he declared: "This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/State_of_the_Union/state-of-the-union-2010-president-obama-speech-transcript/story?id=9678572 |title=Go.com |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-01-27 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement was quickly followed up by Defense Secretary Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Mullen voicing their support for a repeal of DADT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/us/politics/03military.html NYtimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; A repeal of DADT was adopted as an amendment to the FY 2011 Defense Bill by US House of Representatives on May 27, 2010. This amendment provided for the repeal following a study conducted by US Army General [[Carter Ham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/27/AR2010052704540.html |title=Washingtonpost.com |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= May 28, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar amendment was adopted by the US Senate Armed Services Committee later that week. On June 20, 2010 Gates stated that Obama may veto the FY 2011 Defense Bill even if it does include a repeal due to concerns over waste and over spending by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-dont-ask-20100529,0,3412532.story LAtimes.com]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20, 2010 [[Lady Gaga]] attended a rally organized by the [[Servicemembers Legal Defense Network]] (SLDN) to encourage Maine Republican Senators [[Olympia Snowe]] and [[Susan Collins]] to vote on including a provision (initiated by Nevada Democratic Senator [[Harry Reid]]) to the FY 2011 Defense Bill that would repeal DADT.  On September 21, 2010, [[John McCain]] led a successful (Yea 56, Nay 43) filibuster against the debate on the Defense Authorization Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/09/21/senate.defense.bill/index.html?iref=allsearch | work=CNN | title=Senate halts 'don't ask, don't tell' repeal | date=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
