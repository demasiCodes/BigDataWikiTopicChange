'''Biphobia''' is aversion toward [[bisexuality]] and bisexual people as a [[social group]] or as individuals. People of any [[sexual orientation]] can experience such feelings of aversion. Biphobia is a source of [[discrimination]] against bisexuals, and may be based on negative bisexual [[stereotype]]s or irrational fear.

== Etymology and use ==
''Biphobia'' is a [[portmanteau word]] patterned on the term ''[[homophobia]]''. It derives from the English [[English prefixes#Neo-classical|neo-classical prefix]] ''bi-'' (meaning "two") from ''bisexual'' and the root ''-phobia'' (from the {{lang-el|φόβος}}, ''phóbos'', "fear") found in ''homophobia''. Along with ''[[transphobia]]'', ''homophobia'' and ''biphobia'' are members of the family of terms used when [[Bigotry|intolerance]] and discrimination is directed toward [[LGBT]] people.

''Biphobia'' need not be a [[phobia]] as defined in [[clinical psychology]] (i.e., an [[anxiety disorder]]). Its meaning and use typically parallel those of ''[[xenophobia]]''.

The [[adjective|adjectival]] form ''biphobic'' describes things or qualities related to biphobia, whereas the noun ''biphobe'' is a label for people thought to harbor biphobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eliason, MJ|title=The prevalence and nature of biphobia in heterosexual undergraduate students|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=26|issue=3|year=1997|pages=317–26|pmid=9146816|doi=10.1023/A:1024527032040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative stereotypes ==
While biphobia and homophobia are distinct phenomena, they do share some traits: attraction to one's own gender being a part of bisexuality, the [[heterosexist]] view of heterosexuality as the only “proper” attraction or lifestyle apply to bisexual people as well as to gay people. However, bisexuals are also stigmatized in other ways: two classifications of negative stereotypes about them center on the belief that bisexuality does not exist and the generalization that bisexual people are promiscuous.

=== Denialism ===
The belief that bisexuality does not exist stems from [[Binary thinking|binary]] views of sexuality, that people are assumed to be exclusively homosexual ([[gay]]/[[lesbian]]) or heterosexual (straight), with bisexuals either [[The closet|closeted]] gay people wishing to appear heterosexual,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Musto, April 7, 2009.

Resulting negative stereotypes represent bisexuals as confused, undecided, dabblers, insecure, experimenting or "just going through a phase".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bisexualindex.org.uk/index.php/Main/ItsJustAPhase "It's Just A Phase" Is Just A Phrase], The Bisexual Index&lt;/ref&gt;  Attractions toward both sexes are considered fashionable as in "[[bisexual chic]]" or [[gender bending]]. Relations are dismissed as a substitute for sex with members of the "right" sex or as a more accessible source of [[sexual gratification]]. [[Situational homosexuality]] due to [[Sex segregation|sex-segregated]] environments or groups such as the armed forces, schools, sports teams, religious orders, and [[prison sexuality|prisons]] is another facet of explaining why someone is allegedly temporarily gay.

=== Promiscuity ===
The strict association of bisexuality with promiscuity stems from a variety of negative stereotypes targeting bisexuals as mentally or socially unstable people for whom sexual relations only with men, only with women or only with one person is not enough. These stereotypes may result from cultural false assumptions that "men and women are so different that desire for one is an entirely different beast from desire for the other" ("a defining feature of [[heterosexism]]"), and that "verbalizing a sexual desire inevitably leads to attempts to satisfy that desire."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pepperminty.com/writing/bis-and-slut-myth.pdf "Bisexuals and the Slut Myth"], presented at the 9th [[International Conference on Bisexuality]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result bisexuals bear a [[Stigma (sociological theory)|social stigma]] from accusations of cheating on or betraying their partners, leading a [[double life]], being "on the [[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]]", and spreading [[sexually transmitted disease]]s such as [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]. They are characterized as being "slutty", insatiable, “easy”, indiscriminate, and in the case of women, [[nymphomaniac]]s. Furthermore, they are strongly associated with [[polyamory]], [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging]], and [[polygamy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glaad.org/programs/cim/birepresentations.php GLAAD: Cultural Interest Media] {{Wayback |url=http://www.glaad.org/programs/cim/birepresentations.php |date=20060419203924 |bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last being an established heterosexual tradition sanctioned by some religions and legal in several countries. People of any sexual orientation can change partners, practice [[serial monogamy]] or have multiple casual sex partners or multiple romantic relationships. The fact that bisexuals are potentially sexually attracted to both men and women does not mean that they must simultaneously engage in sexual relationships with both men and women to be satisfied.

== Bisexual erasure ==
[[Bisexual erasure]] or ''bisexual invisibility'' is the tendency to ignore, remove, falsify, or reexplain evidence of [[bisexuality]] in [[history]], [[academia]], the [[news media]], and other [[primary source]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://queersunited.blogspot.com/2008/05/word-of-gay-bisexual-erasure.html Word Of The Gay: BisexualErasure] May 16, 2008 "Queers United"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ronsuresha.com/?p=1018 The B Word] Suresha, Ron. "The B Word," Options (Rhode Island), November 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In its most extreme form, bisexual erasure can include denying that bisexuality exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hutchins |first=Loraine |authorlink=Loraine Hutchins |title=Sexual Prejudice: The erasure of bisexuals in academia and the media |journal=[[American Sexuality magazine]] |volume=3 |issue=4 |publisher=[[National Sexuality Resource Center]] |year=2005 |url=http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/MagArticle.cfm?Article=475&amp;PageID=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/MagArticle.cfm?Article=475&amp;PageID=0 | title = Sexual Prejudice - The erasure of bisexuals in academia and the media | accessdate = 2007-07-19 | last = Hutchins | first = Loraine | authorlink = Loraine Hutchins | work = American Sexuality Magazine | publisher = National Sexuality Resource Center, San Francisco State University | location = San Francisco, CA 94103, United States | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071216065035/http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/MagArticle.cfm?Article=475&amp;PageID=0 | archivedate = 2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often a manifestation of biphobia, although it does not necessarily involve overt antagonism.

However, there is also increasing support, inclusion, and visibility in both bisexual and non-bisexual communities, especially in the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref name="Queers United"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://queersunited.blogspot.com/ |title=Queers United }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="the task force"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/issues/bisexuality |title=Task Force Report On Bisexuality }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.org/issues/coming_out/bisexual/bisexual_articles.asp?listpage=2 |title=HRC article on bisexuality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GLAAD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glaadbackup.com/2009/documents/GLAADNRI2009.pdf|title=GLAAD TV Report }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maria, September 24, 2009.

== Monosexism ==
Monosexism is a term used to refer to beliefs, structures, and actions that promote [[monosexuality]] (either exclusive heterosexuality or homosexuality) as the only legitimate or right sexual orientation, excluding [[bisexual]] or other non-[[monosexual]] orientations.&lt;ref name="Highleyman"&gt;Highleyman, Liz (1995). [http://www.black-rose.com/articles-liz/bipol.html "Identities and Ideas: Strategies for Bisexuals"], from the anthology ''Bisexual Politics: Theories, Queries, and Visions''. Haworth Press. ''Black Rose Web Pages''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rust"&gt;[[Paula Rodriguez Rust|Rust, Paula C Rodriguez]] (2002). [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3778/is_200201/ai_n9069533/pg_18 "Bisexuality: The state of the union, Annual Review of Sex Research, 2002"], ''BNET''. {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may be considered analogous to biphobia.&lt;ref name="rust"/&gt;

The term is primarily used in discussions of [[sexual orientation]] to denote aversion towards all non-[[monosexual]] people as a social group or as individuals. It was likely adopted in place of [[unisexual]], which is already used in biology and would produce confusion. It is sometimes considered derogatory by the people to whom it is applied.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alan (2000). ''{{waybackdate|site=http://www.biresource.org/pamphlets/glossary.html|date=20070805044122}} ''of "LesBiGay and Transgender Glossary", ''[http://www.biresource.net/ Bisexual Resource Center]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportion of people who fit into the category depends on how one uses the word.  If the term is used to mean exclusively monosexual in behavior, then according to [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s [[Kinsey Reports|studies]], 63% of men and 87% of women are what may now be termed "monosexual" as determined by experiences leading to [[orgasm]].&lt;ref&gt;(1999). [http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/bib-homoprev.html "Prevalence of Homosexuality"], ''The Kinsey Institute''. Note that Kinsey did not use the term "bisexual", but that he uses "exclusively homosexual" and "exclusively heterosexual".&lt;/ref&gt; Freud thought that no one was born monosexual and that it had to be taught by parents or society, though most people appear to believe that monosexuals are in fact the majority and identify as such.&lt;ref&gt;Rethinking Marxism: A Journal of Economics, Culture &amp; Society, Volume 8, Issue 3, 1995, Feminist Economies, DOI:10.1080/08935699508685453, Margaret Nash, pages 66-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversial studies ==
A 2002 study said that a sample of men self-identifying as bisexual did not respond equally to pornographic material involving only men, and to pornography involving only women, but instead showed four times more arousal to one than the other. However, bisexuality does not imply equal attraction towards both genders. In addition, opponents state that genital arousal to homosexual pornographic material is not a good indicator of orientation both because the material is chosen by the researchers, ignoring the study participants' preferences (i.e. body types, looks, scenarios, particular fetishes, presentation of relationships, etc.), and because tumescence is problematic as an indicator of arousal (some tumescence may be caused or prevented by anxiety, and erectile dysfunction should be considered before such studies commence). They also state that the study showed a third of men had no arousal, and ask why this does not mean that one third of men are really [[Asexuality|asexual]].&lt;ref name="Carey"&gt;{{cite news |last=Carey |first=Benedict |title=Straight, Gay or Lying?

The study, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' article which reported it in 2005, were subsequently criticized as flawed and biphobic.&lt;ref name="Carey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ngltf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAIR"/&gt; [[Lynn Conway]] criticized the author of the study, [[J. Michael Bailey]], citing his controversial history and stating that the study has not been scientifically repeated and confirmed by any independent researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/Bailey/Bisexuality/Bisexuality-NYT%207-05-05.html "Straight, Gay or Lying? Bisexuality Revisted" J. Michael Bailey attacks the identities of bisexual men]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a new article published in ''The New York Times'' mentioned a new study elaborated by Jerome Cerny and Erick Janssen showing evidence of bisexuality in men and therefore contradicting Bailey's study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/health/23bisexual.html | work=The New York Times | first=David | last=Tuller | title=No Surprise for Bisexual Men: Report Indicates They Exist | date=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both studies have been criticized for the aforementioned flaws in their methodology, this study attempts to resolve the sampling bias, by finding subjects from bisexual-specific communities who had experience with sex and relationships involving both sexes.
