It need not
include [[homophobia]] or [[heterophobia]], because there are [[stereotype]]s that are specific to bisexuals.

These include, but are not limited to: [[promiscuity]], [[polygamy]], living the [[swinging]] lifestyle, and being confused. Often, however, heterosexuals and homosexuals will add more stereotypes based on homophobia or heterophobia. Homophobes may think that bisexuals are gender nonconformist. Heterophobes will often think of bisexuals as maintaining privilege and collaborating with the homophobes. [[Lesbian]] [[feminist]]s sometimes think that bisexual women are giving in to [[patriarchy]].
