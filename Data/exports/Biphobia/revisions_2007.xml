'''Biphobia''' is a term used to describe the fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against [[bisexuality]] or [[LGBT]] people (or those perceived to be) who are bisexual or perceived to be bisexual. It can also mean hatred, hostility, disapproval of, or prejudice towards LGBT people, sexual behavior, or cultures. '''Biphobic''' is the adjective form of this term used to describe the qualities of these characteristics while the less common '''biophobe''' is the noun form given as a title to individuals with "biphobic" characteristics. It need not include or exclude [[homophobia]] or [[heterophobia]], because there are [[stereotype]]s that are specific to bisexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eliason, MJ|title=The prevalence and nature of biphobia in heterosexual undergraduate students.|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=26|issue=3|year=1997|pages=317-26|pmid=9146816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biphobic stereotypes==
Bisexual stereotypes include, but are not limited to: [[promiscuity]], [[polygamy]], living the [[swinging]] lifestyle, and being "confused" or "greedy" or "slutty". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.glaad.org/programs/cim/birepresentations.php&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, bisexuals are accused of bringing [[sexually transmitted disease]]s into the heterosexual community or into the LGBT community. A related stereotype is one in which a bisexual person is presumed to be willing to have sex with just about anyone. This stereotype leads to unwanted attention of a sexual nature directed at bisexual [[female]]s by swingers and heterosexual males while often stereotyping bisexual males as walking [[AIDS]] risks.

Often, however, heterosexuals will add more stereotypes based on homophobia. Homophobes may think that bisexuals are gender nonconformist. Homosexual people will sometimes experience bisexuals as maintaining privilege and collaborating with the homophobes while simultaneously enjoying the LGBT lifestyle. Some consider the belief that people are either heterosexual or homosexual, and thus that bisexuality does not truly exist, to be biphobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dworkin, SH | title=Treating the bisexual client|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=57|issue=5|year=2001|pages=671-80}} PMID 11304706&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study claimed that a sample of men self-identifying as bisexual did not respond equally to pornographic material involving only men, and to pornography involving only women, but instead showed four times more arousal to one than the other. However, bisexuality does not imply equal attraction towards both genders. In addition, opponents claim that genital arousal to homosexual pornographic material is not a good indicator of orientation. They also point out that the study showed a third of men had no arousal, and ask why this does not mean that one third of men are really [[asexual]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetaskforce.org/media/NYTBiArt/LettersFromTheCommunity.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; The study, and the New York Times article which reported it in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/health/05sex.html Straight, Gay or Lying? Bisexuality Revisited] New York Times, July 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; were subsequently criticized as flawed and biphobic.&lt;ref&gt;http://zzz.pridesource.com/article.shtml?article=15015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://main.bisexual.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3799 "Gay Straight or Lying? Bisexuality Revisited," Revisited - Part 1 by [[William Burleson]] June 26 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lynn Conway]] criticised the author of the study, [[J. Michael Bailey]], citing his controversial history, and pointing out that the study has not been scientifically repeated and confirmed by any independent researchers.&lt;ref&gt;http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/Bailey/Bisexuality/Bisexuality-NYT%207-05-05.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, there is a school of thought that says that "everyone is bisexual."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biresource.org/pamphlets/myths.pdf Myths About Bisexuality] (PDF pamphlet from Bisexual Resource Center)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Discrimination}}
One common motive for negative attitudes toward bisexuality may be fear for straight males and straight females that their husbands/boyfriends and wives/girlfriends may [[divorce]] them or [[break up]] with them for members of the same sex. The same fears exists among gay people as well. For [[lesbian]]s it may be the fear that a bisexual [[woman]] will leave a woman for a [[man]]; and vice versa with gay males fearing that they would be dumped for a woman. The heterosexual male is seen as having an unfair systemic advantage both due to [[sexism]] and due to homophobia.  Bisexual persons may also be the target of homophobia from those who consider only heterosexuality appropriate.  

Some [[radical feminism|radical]] [[Lesbian feminism|lesbian feminists]] think that bisexual women are giving in to [[patriarchy]]. Others say that people against bisexuals are insecure about their sexuality themselves, similarly to homophobia. It is fair to note many anti-bisexuals are also [[homophobia|homophobic]], while maintaining there are only heterosexual and homosexual as sexual preferences, and a common stereotype is that female bisexuals are attention seeking heterosexuals, while male ones are just self-denying homosexuals too afraid to fully acknowledge their true orientation.
