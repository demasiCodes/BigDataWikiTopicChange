Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and [[institution]]s in all parts of the world, including some, where such discrimination is generally decried. In some places, countervailing measures such as quotas have been used to redress the balance in favor of those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination. These attempts have often been met with controversy, and sometimes been called [[reverse discrimination]].

==Etymology==

The term ''discriminate'' appeared in the early 17th century in the English language. It is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''discriminat-'' 'distinguished between', from the verb ''discriminare'', from ''discrimen'' 'distinction', from the verb ''discernere'' (corresponding to "to discern").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of discrimination; Origin|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/discriminate?q=discriminate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514145943/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/discriminate?q=discriminate|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 14, 2013|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher= Oxford University|access-date=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[American Civil War]] the term "discrimination" generally evolved in [[American English]] usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable [[Social group|group]] or social category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Introduction to sociology |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc. |year=2009 |edition=7th |location=New York |page=324 |medium=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Before this sense of the word became almost universal, it was a synonym for discernment, tact and culture as in "taste and discrimination", generally a laudable attribute; to "discriminate against" being commonly disparaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Simpson, J.A. |title=The Oxford Dictionary |edition=2nd |year=1989 |volume=IV |page=758 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=0-19861216-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Macquarie Concise Thesaurus — Australia's National Thesaurus |editor=Richard Tardif |year=1985 |publisher=The Macquarie Library |isbn=0-94975797-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2024}}

==Definitions==

Moral philosophers{{who|date=November 2024}} have defined{{when|reason=When was this definition ratified?|date=November 2024}} discrimination using a [[Morality|moralized]] definition. Under this approach, discrimination is defined as acts, practices, or policies that wrongfully impose a relative disadvantage or deprivation on persons based on their membership in a salient social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Altman|first=Andrew|title=Discrimination|date=2020|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2020/entries/discrimination/|encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2020|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|quote=[A]s a reasonable first approximation, we can say that discrimination consists of acts, practices, or policies that impose a relative disadvantage on persons based on their membership in a salient social group. [...] [W]e can refine the first-approximation account of discrimination and say that the moralized concept of discrimination is properly applied to acts, practices or policies that meet two conditions: a) they wrongfully impose a relative disadvantage or deprivation on persons based on their membership in some salient social group, and b) the wrongfulness rests (in part) on the fact that the imposition of the disadvantage is on account of the group membership of the victims.|access-date=2020-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. He or she just needs to be treated ''worse'' than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to children of a particular race out of a racist attitude, he or she will be acting in a discriminatory way even if he or she actually benefits the people he discriminates against by donating some money to them.&lt;ref&gt;Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen, "Private Discrimination: A Prioritarian, Desert-Accommodating Account", ''San Diego Law Review'', 43, 817-856 (2006); Oscar Horta, "Discrimination in Terms of Moral Exclusion", ''Theoria: Swedish Journal of Philosophy'', 76, 346-364 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination also develops into a source of [[oppression]], the action of recognizing someone as 'different' so much that they are treated inhumanly and degraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Thompson |first=Neil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVIJDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=equality&amp;pg=PP1 |title=Anti-Discriminatory Practice: Equality, Diversity and Social Justice |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-137-58666-7 |language=en }}{{Dead link|date=February 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This moralized definition of discrimination is distinct from a non-moralized definition - in the former, discrimination is wrong by definition, whereas in the latter, this is not the case.&lt;ref name="Altman 2020"&gt;{{Citation |last=Altman |first=Andrew |title=Discrimination |date=2020 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2020/entries/discrimination/ |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |edition=Summer 2020 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=2020-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] stance on discrimination includes the statement: "Discriminatory behaviors take many forms, but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp |title=United Nations CyberSchoolBus: What is discrimination? |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601211521/http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp |archive-date=2014-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] and other international bodies work towards helping ending discrimination around the world.

===Age===

{{Main|Ageism|Adultism}}
[[Ageism]] or age discrimination is discrimination and stereotyping based on the grounds of someone's age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Ageism|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ageism?q=ageism|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514145002/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ageism?q=ageism|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 14, 2013|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a set of beliefs, norms, and values which used to justify discrimination or subordination based on a person's age.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickKatsiaficas1987"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=George R.|last2=Katsiaficas|first2=George N.|last3=Kirkpatrick|first3=Robert George|author4=Mary Lou Emery|title=Introduction to critical sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdf2QupEaHgC&amp;pg=PA261|access-date=January 28, 2011|year=1987|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-0-8290-1595-9|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ageism is most often directed toward elderly people, or adolescents and children.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson J and Ferraro K, "Thirty Years of Ageism Research". In Nelson T (ed). ''Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons''. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php "Young and Oppressed"]. youthrights.org.

Age discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in the United States. Joanna Lahey, professor at The [[Bush School of Government and Public Service]] at [[Texas A&amp;M]], found that firms are more than 40% more likely to interview a young adult job applicant than an older job applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Lahey, J. (2005) [https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html Do Older Workers Face Discrimination?] Boston College. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414230847/https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html |date=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, Stijn Baert, Jennifer Norga, Yannick Thuy and Marieke Van Hecke, researchers at [[Ghent University]], measured comparable ratios in Belgium. They found that age discrimination is heterogeneous by the activity older candidates undertook during their additional post-educational years. In Belgium, they are only discriminated if they have more years of inactivity or irrelevant employment.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., Norga, J., Thuy, Y., Van Hecke, M. (In press) [http://users.ugent.be/~sbaert/BaertNorgaThuyVanHecke_GettingGreyHairs_JEP.pdf Getting Grey Hairs in the Labour Market: An Alternative Experiment on Age Discrimination] Journal of Economic Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey for the [[University of Kent]], England, 29% of respondents stated that they had suffered from age discrimination. This is a higher proportion than for [[Sexism|gender]] or [[Racism|racial]] discrimination. [[Dominic Abrams]], social psychology professor at the university, concluded that ageism is the most pervasive form of [[prejudice]] experienced in the UK population.&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/media/how_ageist_is_britain.pdf How Ageist is Britain?] London: Age Concern. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027165812/http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/media/how_ageist_is_britain.pdf |date=October 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability===
{{Main|Disability discrimination}}

Discrimination against people with [[Disability|disabilities]] in favor of people who are not is called [[ableism]] or [[disablism]]. Disability discrimination, which treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of 'normal living', results in public and private places and services, educational settings, and social services that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby excluding those with various disabilities. Studies have shown that disabled people not only need employment in order to be provided with the opportunity to earn a living but they also need employment in order to sustain their mental health and well-being. Work fulfils a number of basic needs for an individual such as collective purpose, social contact, status, and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vornholt|first=Katharina|author2=Sjir Uitdewilligen |author3=Frans J.N. Nijhuis |title=Factors Affecting the Acceptance of People with Disabilities at Work: A Literature Review|journal=Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation|date=December 2013|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463–75|doi=10.1007/s10926-013-9426-0|pmid=23400588|s2cid=10038886|url=https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/309d145f-bd62-4b5b-826b-a08c64b00bb0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person with a disability is often found to be socially isolated and work is one way to reduce his or her isolation. In the United States, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] mandates the provision of equality of access to both buildings and services and is paralleled by similar acts in other countries, such as the [[Equality Act 2010]] in the UK.

===Region===

{{see also|Regional discrimination in China}}
Regional or geographic discrimination is a form of discrimination that is based on the region in which a person lives or the region in which a person was born. It differs from national discrimination because it may not be based on national borders or the country in which the victim lives, instead, it is based on prejudices against a specific region of one or more countries. Examples include discrimination against Chinese people who were born in regions of the countryside that are far away from cities that are located within China, and discrimination against [[Americans]] who are from the [[Southern United States|southern]] or [[Northern United States|northern]] regions of the United States. It is often accompanied by discrimination that is based on accent, dialect, or cultural differences.&lt;ref name="Accent"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/a/accent-discrimination/ | title=Accent Discrimination Law and Legal Definition|publisher=USLegal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious discrimination is valuing or treating people or groups differently because of what they do or do not believe in or because of their feelings towards a given [[religion]]. For instance, the Jewish population of Germany, and indeed a large portion of Europe, was subjected to discrimination under [[Adolf Hitler]] and his Nazi party between 1933 and 1945. They were forced to live in ghettos, wear an identifying star of David on their clothes, and sent to concentration and death camps in rural Germany and Poland, where they were to be tortured and killed, all because of their Jewish religion. Many laws (most prominently the Nuremberg Laws of 1935) separated those of Jewish faith as supposedly inferior to the Christian population.

Restrictions on the types of occupations that [[Jews|Jewish]] people could hold were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to religious Jews, pushing them into marginal roles that were considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], occupations that were only tolerated as a "[[necessary evil]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20050721005923/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0718_050718_ashkenazim.html Did Discrimination Enhance Intelligence of Jews?]". National Geographic News. July 18, 2005 &lt;/ref&gt; The number of Jews who were permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghetto]]s and banned from owning land.

Those expressing religious beliefs other than Islam may face imprisonment of up to five years or house arrest, fines ranging from 5,000 to 20,000 rufiyaa ($320 to $1,300), and deportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maldives |url=https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-report-on-international-religious-freedom/maldives/ |website=United States Department of State |access-date=30 March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States commission on civil rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] which are guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for [[Freedom of Religion]] (in the United States as secured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied "equal protection under the law, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: ''Religious discrimination.

One's [[sexual orientation]] is a "predilection for homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality".&lt;ref&gt;''World English Dictionary'', [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+orientation "Sexual Orientation"]&lt;/ref&gt; Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexuality; a term for such hatred based upon one's sexual orientation is often called [[homophobia]]. Many continue to hold negative feelings towards those with non-heterosexual orientations and will discriminate against people who have them or are thought to have them. People of other uncommon sexual orientations also experience discrimination. One study found its sample of heterosexuals to be more prejudiced against [[asexuality|asexual people]] than against homosexual or bisexual people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intergroup bias toward "Group X": Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals |first1=Cara C. |last1=MacInnis |first2=Gordon |last2=Hodson |journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations |doi=10.1177/1368430212442419 |volume=15 |number=6 |pages=725–743 |year=2012|s2cid=3056711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Employment discrimination]] based on sexual orientation varies by country.

A number of countries, especially those in the [[Western world]], have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay [[hate crimes]] and workplace discrimination. Some have also legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the [[United Nations]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights.

===Reverse discrimination===

[[File:Protesto contra o sistema de cotas.jpg|thumb|upright|Students protesting against [[racial quota]]s in Brazil: "''Quer uma vaga? Passe no vestibular!''" ("Do you want a spot? Pass the entrance exam!")]]

[[Reverse discrimination]] is discrimination against members of a dominant or majority group, in favor of members of a minority or historically disadvantaged group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Reverse Discrimination |url=https://www.findlaw.com/employment/employment-discrimination/reverse-discrimination.html |access-date=2023-01-17 |website=Findlaw |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This discrimination may seek to redress [[social inequalities]] under which minority groups have had less access to privileges enjoyed by the majority group. In such cases it is intended to remove discrimination that minority groups may already face. Reverse discrimination can be defined as the unequal treatment of members of the majority groups resulting from preferential policies, as in college admissions or employment, intended to remedy earlier discrimination against minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reverse Discrimination|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reverse+discrimination |website=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptualizing [[affirmative action]] as reverse discrimination became popular in the early- to mid-1970s, a time period that focused on under-representation and action policies intended to remedy the effects of past discrimination in both government and the business world.&lt;ref name="Embrick"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Embrick |first1=David G. |editor1-last=Schaefer |editor1-first=Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society, Volume 1 |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-41-292694-2 |pages=12–19 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&amp;q=%22reverse+discrimination%22&amp;pg=PT64 |chapter=Affirmative Action in Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories and philosophy==

[[Social theories]] such as [[egalitarianism]] assert that [[social equality]] should prevail. In some societies, including most developed countries, each individual's civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weblocator.com/attorney/mn/law/concivrig.html#30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991023101723/http://www.weblocator.com/attorney/mn/law/concivrig.html#30 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 23, 1999 |title=Civil rights |access-date= March 20, 2019 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain or suffering shared by all animals, [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist]] or [[Veganism|vegan]] egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual (regardless of their species), warrant [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]] with the interests of humans, and that not doing so is [[speciesist]].&lt;ref name="singerethics-sentience"&gt;{{cite book |title=Practical Ethics |last=Singer |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Singer |orig-year=1993 |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-43971-8 |edition=Second |pages=[https://archive.org/details/practicalethics00sing_0/page/57 57–58] |chapter=Equality for Animals? |quote=If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. ... This is why the limit of sentience&amp;nbsp;... is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others. ... Similarly those I would call 'speciesists' give greater weight to their own species when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of other species.|title-link=Practical Ethics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers have debated as to how inclusive the definition of discrimination should be. Some philosophers have argued that discrimination should only refer to wrongful or disadvantageous treatment in the context of a socially salient group (such as race, gender, sexuality etc.) within a given context. Under this view, failure to limit the concept of discrimination would lead to it being overinclusive; for example, since most murders occur because of some perceived difference between the perpetrator and the victim, many murders would constitute discrimination if the social salience requirement is not included. Thus this view argues that making the definition of discrimination overinclusive renders it meaningless. Conversely, other philosophers argue that discrimination should simply refer to wrongful disadvantageous treatment regardless of the social salience of the group, arguing that limiting the concept only to socially salient groups is arbitrary, as well as raising issues of determining which groups would count as socially salient. The issue of which groups should count has caused many political and social debates.&lt;ref name="Altman 2020"/&gt;

# ''Realistic competition'' is driven by self-interest and is aimed at obtaining material resources (e.g., food, territory, customers) for the in-group (e.g., favoring an in-group in order to obtain more resources for its members, including the self).
# ''Social competition'' is driven by the need for self-esteem and is aimed at achieving a positive social status for the in-group relative to comparable out-groups (e.g., favoring an in-group in order to make it better than an out-group).
# ''Consensual discrimination'' is driven by the need for accuracy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Prejudice &amp; Discrimination Theories #2 |url=https://www.integratedsociopsychology.net/society/prejudice-discrimination/prejudice-discrimination-theories-2/ |access-date=2023-01-17 |website=Keith E Rice's Integrated SocioPsychology Blog &amp; Pages |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reflects stable and legitimate intergroup status hierarchies (e.g., favoring a high-status in-group because it is high status).

===Labeling theory===

[[File:Zajęcia Akademii Edukacji Antydyskryminacyjnej w Centrum Żydowskim w Oświęcimiu.jpg|thumb|An anti-discrimination education workshop at the [[Auschwitz Jewish Center in Oświęcim|Auschwitz Jewish Center]], Poland, 2019]]
Discrimination, in [[labeling theory]], takes form as mental categorization of minorities and the use of [[stereotype]]. This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm, which results in internal devaluation and [[social stigma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Slattery| first=M. | year=2002 | title=Key Ideas in Sociology | publisher=Nelson Thornes| isbn=978-0-7487-6565-2 | pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be seen as discrimination. It is started by describing a "natural" social order. It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Skoll |first=Geoffrey R. |date=2010 |title=The Theory of Fear / Chapter 3 / States and Social Control |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/9780230112636_3.pdf |journal=The Theory of Fear|doi=10.1057/9780230112636_3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} The [[Nazis]] in 1930s-era Germany and the pre-1990 [[Apartheid]] government of South Africa used racially discriminatory agendas for their political ends.

===Game theory===

Economist [[Yanis Varoufakis]] (2013) argues that "discrimination based on utterly arbitrary characteristics evolves quickly and systematically in the experimental laboratory", and that neither classical [[game theory]] nor [[neoclassical economics]] can explain this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 11: Evolving domination in the laboratory
|author=Yanis Varoufakis
|page=13
|year=2013
|title=Economic Indeterminacy: A personal encounter with the economists' peculiar nemesis
|series=Routledge Frontiers of Political Economy
|isbn=978-0-415-66849-1
|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Varoufakis and Shaun Hargreaves-Heap ran an experiment where volunteers played a computer-mediated, multiround [[hawk-dove game]]. At the start of each session, each participant was assigned a color at random, either red or blue. At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent. Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players' behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a [[Nash equilibrium]] where players of one color (the "advantaged" color) [[pure strategy|consistently]] played the aggressive "hawk" strategy against players of the other, "disadvantaged" color, who played the acquiescent "dove" strategy against the advantaged color. Players of both colors used a [[mixed strategy]] when playing against players assigned the same color as their own. The experimenters then added a [[prisoners' dilemma|cooperation]] option to the game, and found that disadvantaged players usually cooperated with each other, while advantaged players usually did not. They state that while the equilibria reached in the original hawk-dove game are predicted by [[evolutionary game theory]], game theory does not explain the emergence of cooperation in the disadvantaged group. Citing earlier psychological work of [[Matthew Rabin]], they hypothesize that a norm of differing entitlements emerges across the two groups, and that this norm could define a "fairness" equilibrium within the disadvantaged group.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]
