{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Discrimination''' is the prejudicial treatment of an individual based on their membership in a certain group or category.  It involves the actual behaviors towards groups such as excluding or restricting members of one group from opportunities that are available to another group. The term began to be used as an expression of derogatory racial prejudice in the 1830s from [[Thomas D. Rice]]'s performances as "Jim Crow".

Since the [[American Civil War]] the term 'discrimination' generally evolved in [[American English]] usage as an understanding of [[prejudice|prejudicial]] treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable [[Social group|group]] or social category.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc, 2009. page 324. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Discernment has remained in [[British English]] as a term denoting elite status in [[perception]] and [[insight]], often attributed to success in [[Investment strategy|investment finance]], or anyone with admirable choice in [[Fashion|style]], often [[Socialite|high society]] leaders.

Discriminatory laws such as [[redlining]] exist in many countries. In some places, controversial attempts such as [[racial quotas]] have been used to redress negative effects of discrimination.

It should be noted that discrimination is not always against a disadvantaged group. When a majority group (white, male, heterosexual, rich etc.) is discriminated against because they are a member of this group this is usually called reverse discrimination.

==Definitions==
Within [[sociology]], 'discrimination' is the [[prejudice|prejudicial]] treatment of an individual based on their membership in a certain group or category. Discrimination is the ''actual behavior'' towards members of another group. It involves excluding or restricting members of one group from opportunities that are available to other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc, 2009. page 334. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Moral philosophers have defined it as ''disadvantageous'' treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. He or she just needs to be treated ''worse'' than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, he or she will be acting in a discriminatory way even if he or she actually benefits the people he discriminates against by donating some money to them.&lt;ref&gt;Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen, “Private Discrimination: A Prioritarian, Desert-Accommodating Account”, ''San Diego Law Review'', 43, 817-856 (2006); Oscar Horta, “Discrimination in Terms of Moral Exclusion”, ''Theoria: Swedish Journal of Philosophy'', 76, 346-364 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] stance on discrimination includes a statement that: "Discriminatory behaviors take many forms, but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection."&lt;ref&gt;{{PDF|[http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp United Nations CyberSchoolBus: What is discrimination?]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial and ethnic discrimination==
{{Main|Racism}}

Racial discrimination differentiates between individuals on the basis of real and perceived racial differences, and has been official government policy in several countries, such as [[South Africa]] in the [[apartheid]] era, the Occupied Palestinian Territories with the apartheid separation wall and the USA.

Title VII is the principal federal statute with regard to employment discrimination prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, labor organizations, training programs and employment agencies based on race or color, religion, gender, and national origin.

Title VII also prohibits retaliation against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute.

Title VII also provides that race and color discrimination against every race and color is prohibited.

==Sex, Gender and Gender Identity discrimination==
{{Main|Sexism}}

Though gender discrimination and sexism refers to beliefs and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] in relation to the [[gender]] of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. '''Sex discrimination''', on the other hand, may have legal consequences.

Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.

Currently, discrimination based on sex is defined as adverse action against another person, which would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. This is considered a form of [[prejudice]] and is illegal in certain enumerated circumstances in most countries.

Sexual discrimination can arise in different contexts. For instance an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or because an [[employer]] did not hire, promote or wrongfully terminated an employee based on their gender, or employers pay unequally based on gender.

In an educational setting there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship due to their gender. In the housing setting there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on their gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one’s gender.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, F. (2003) Organizational Behaviour and Gender (2nd Edition), Aldershot: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend their credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on one’s gender.

Socially, sexual differences have been used to justify different roles for men and women, in some cases giving rise to claims of primary and secondary roles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk/ciod_papers/54/ Ridley-Duff, R. J. (2008) "Gendering, Courtship and Pay Equity: Developing Attraction Theory to Understand Work-Life Balance and Entrepreneurial Behaviour", paper to the ''31st ISBE Conference'', 5th–7th November, Belfast]&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are alleged non-physical differences between men and women, major reviews of the academic literature on gender difference find only a tiny minority of characteristics where there are consistent psychological differences between men and women, and these relate directly to experiences grounded in biological difference.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, J. S. (2005) “The Gender Similarities Hypothesis”, ''American Psychologist'', 60(6): 581–592.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are also some psychological differences in regard to how problems are dealt with and emotional perceptions and reactions which may relate to hormones and the successful characteristics of each gender during longstanding roles in past primitive lifestyles.

Unfair discrimination usually follows the [[sexism|gender stereotyping]] held by a society.

The [[United Nations]] had concluded that women often experience a "[[glass ceiling]]" and that there are no societies in which women enjoy the same opportunities as men. The term "glass ceiling" is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement in employment based on discrimination, especially sex discrimination.

In the [[United States]] in 1995, the Glass Ceiling Commission, a government-funded group, stated: "Over half of all Master’s degrees are now awarded to women, yet 95% of senior-level managers, of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies are men. Of them, 97% are white." In its report, it recommended [[affirmative action]], which is the consideration of an employee's gender and race in hiring and promotion decisions, as a means to end this form of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Glass Ceiling Commission"&gt;{{cite web

The [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s leading headhunter, Chinahr.com, reported in 2007 that the average salary for white-collar men was 44,000 yuan ($6,441), compared with 28,700 yuan ($4,201) for women.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newsweek.com/id/209954/page/1 A Great Leap Backward for China's Women]". [[Newsweek]]. August 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PwC research found that among FTSE 350 companies in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2002 almost 40% of senior management posts were occupied by women. When that research was repeated in 2007, the number of senior management posts held by women had fallen to 22%.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2007/mar/08/business.workingparents Women quit before hitting glass ceiling]".

[[Transgender]] individuals, both male to female and female to male, often experience problems which often lead to dismissals, underachievement, difficulty in finding a job, social isolation, and, occasionally, violent attacks against them. Nevertheless, the problem of gender discrimination does not stop at transgender individuals or with women. Men are often the victim in certain areas of employment as men begin to seek work in office and childcare settings traditionally perceived as "women's jobs". One such situation seems to be evident in a recent case concerning alleged YMCA discrimination and a Federal Court Case in Texas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!-- could not find previously cited story:http://www.nowpublic.com/world/blacks-men-are-racial-gender-discrimination-not-dead-yet --&gt; The case actually involves alleged discrimination against both men and blacks in childcare, even when they pass the same strict background tests and other standards of employment. It is currently being contended in federal court, as of fall 2009, and sheds light on how a workplace dominated by a majority (women in this case) sometimes will seemingly "justify" whatever they wish to do, regardless of the law. This may be done as an effort at self-protection, to uphold traditional societal roles, or some other faulty, unethical or illegal prejudicial reasoning.

==Employment discrimination==
{{Main|Employment discrimination}}

Employment discrimination refers to disabling certain people to apply and receive jobs based on their race, age, gender, religion, height, weight, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity. In relationship to sociology, employment discrimination usually relates to what events are happening in society at the time. For example, it would have seemed ludicrous to hire an African American male and absolutely unheard of to hire an African American woman over 50 years ago. However, in our society today, it is the absolute norm to hire any qualified person.

Many laws prohibit employment discrimination.  If a person uses discriminatory hiring practices, they can be sued for hate crimes.  However, some minority groups (notably LGBT people) remain unprotected by U.S. federal law from employment discrimination.

The American federal laws that protect against:

{{Main|Linguistic discrimination}}
[[File:Protesto contra o sistema de cotas.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Students protesting against [[racial quota]]s in [[Brazil]]. The sign reads: "Want a vacancy? Pass the [[Vestibular]]!"]]
Diversity of language is protected and respected by most nations who value cultural diversity. However, people are sometimes subjected to different treatment because their preferred language is associated with a particular group, class or category. Commonly, the preferred language is just another attribute of separate [[ethnic group]]s. Discrimination exists if there is prejudicial treatment against a person or a group of people who speak a particular language or dialect.

Language discrimination is suggested to be labeled '''[[linguicism]]''' or '''logocism'''. Anti-discriminatory and inclusive efforts to accommodate persons who speak different languages or cannot have fluency in the country's predominant or "official" language, is [[bilingualism]] such as official documents in two languages, and [[multiculturalism]] in more than two languages.

==Reverse discrimination==
{{Main|Reverse discrimination}}

Some attempts at antidiscrimination have been criticized as '''reverse discrimination'''. In particular, minority quotas (for example, [[affirmative action]]) discriminate against members of a dominant or majority group. In its opposition to race preferences, the American Civil Rights Institute's [[Ward Connerly]] stated, "There is nothing positive, affirmative, or equal about 'affirmative action' programs that give preference to some groups based on race."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org/pr_7_25_07.html American Civil Rights Institute | Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases, however, such as the Noack v. YMCA case in U.S. Fifth Circuit Court, which include outright anti-male gender bias in a traditionally female work environment like childcare. That former employee claims to have suffered even physical assaults, and was allegedly also told to not hire too many blacks or men.

==Disability discrimination==
{{Main|Disability discrimination}}

Discrimination against people with disabilities in favor of people who are not is called [[ableism]] or [[disablism]]. Disability discrimination, which treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of ‘normal living’, results in public and private places and services, education, and social work that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby excluding those with various disabilities.

In the United States, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] mandates the provision of equality of access to both buildings and services and is paralleled by similar acts in other countries, such as the [[Equality Act 2010]] in the UK.

==Religious discrimination==
{{Main|Religious discrimination}}

{{Status of religious freedom}}
Religious discrimination is valuing or treating a person or group differently because of what they do or do not believe. For instance, the indigenous Christian population of [[Balkans]] (known as "rayah" or "protected flock") lived under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Kanun–i–Rayah. The word is sometimes translated as 'cattle' rather than 'flock' or 'subjects' to emphasize the inferior status of the rayah.&lt;ref&gt;Maan Z. Madina, ''Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the Muslim ''[[dhimmi]]'' system, Christians were guaranteed limited freedoms (such as the right to worship), but were treated as [[second-class citizen]]s. Christians and Jews were not considered equals to [[Muslim]]s: testimony against Muslims by Christians and Jews was inadmissible in courts of law. They were forbidden to carry weapons or ride atop horses, their houses could not overlook those of Muslims, and their religious practices would have to defer to those of Muslims, in addition to various other legal limitations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taner Akcam|Akcam, Taner]]. ''A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility''. New York: Metropolitan Books, 2006 p. 24 ISBN 0-8050-7932-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Restrictions upon [[Jew]]ish occupations were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to Jews, pushing them into marginal roles considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], occupations only tolerated as a "necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0718_050718_ashkenazim.html Did Discrimination Enhance Intelligence of Jews?]". National Geographic News. July 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghetto]]s and were not allowed to own land. The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 decreed that Jews must wear distinguishing clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/MedievalSocialTO/Clothing/JewishHat.htm Medieval Jewish History: An Encyclopedia.

In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States commission on civil rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for [[Freedom of Religion]] (in the United States secured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied " the equal protection of the laws, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: ''Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington D.C., April 9–10, 1979''&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax-exempt status of religious organizations discriminates against atheists or people who do not believe in organized religions, in much the same way that mobility allowance for people who can't walk discriminates against those who simply have bad knees but can still walk.

==Theories==
===Discrimination===
[[Social theories]] such as [[Egalitarianism]] claim that [[social equality]] should prevail. In some societies, including most developed countries, each individual's civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weblocator.com/attorney/mn/law/concivrig.html#30 |title=Civil rights |accessdate=2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain and/or suffering shared by all animals, '[[abolitionist]]' or '[[vegan]]' egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual (regardless its species), warrant [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]] with the interests of humans, and that not doing so is "[[speciesism|speciesist]]".&lt;ref name="singerethics-sentience"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Practical Ethics]] |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |origyear=1993 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-43971-X |edition=Second |pages=57&amp;ndash;58 |chapter=Equality for Animals? |quote=If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. &amp;hellip; This is why the limit of sentience&amp;hellip;is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others. &amp;hellip; Similarly those I would call 'speciesists' give greater weight to their own species when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of other species. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative and anarcho-capitalist===
In contrast, [[conservatism|conservative]] writer and law professor [[Matthias Storme]] has claimed that the freedom of discrimination in human societies is a fundamental human right, or more precisely, the basis of all fundamental freedoms and therefore the most fundamental freedom. Author [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]], in an essay&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe4.html Lewrockwell.com], {{cite web |last=Hoppe |first=Hans-Hermann |year=2001 |url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe4.html |title=Democracy: The God That Failed |accessdate=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; about his book [[Democracy: The God That Failed]], asserts that a natural social order is characterized by increased discrimination.

===Labeling theory===
Discrimination, in [[labeling theory]], takes form as mental categorization of minorities and the use of [[stereotype]]. This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm, which results in internal devaluation and social stigma&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Slattery| first=M. | year=2002 | title=Key Ideas in Sociology | publisher=Nelson Thornes| isbn=978-0748765652 | p=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be seen as discrimination. It is started by describing a 'natural' social order. It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy. The [[Nazis]] in 1930's-era Germany, the pre-1990 [[Apartheid]] government of South Africa used racial discriminatory agendas for their political ends. This practice continues with some present day governments.

==State discrimination vs. free market discrimination==
===State discrimination===
In politics, the dominating part of the population rules. Therefore, the worst discrimination in the history has been committed by states. For example, the [[anti-semitic]] practices of the [[Nazi-Germany]] would not have happened on [[free market]]s, because they would have caused losses.&lt;ref name=murphy&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2010/Murphydiscrimination.html The Economics of Discrimination], Robert P. Murphy, Library of Economics, AUGUST 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, government officials and politicians need not care about losses as much as companies, which decreases their incentive not to discriminate. For example, around 1900 the afro-Americans started to compete of jobs that had previously been all-white jobs. Because whites had more voting power, they enacted a law that made photographs of the applicants obligatory in civil service job applications. The number of blacks in federal employment plummeted for decades.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Discrimination.html Discrimination], The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, Library of Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 20th century South Africa mine owners preferred hiring black workers because they were cheaper. Then the whites successfully persuaded the government to enact laws that highly restricted the black' rights to work (see [[Apartheid]]).&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

Similarly, to make more profits, producers hires secretly screenwriters who were on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s blacklist, which mitigated the effects of the list.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

When the "Jim Crow" racial segregation laws were enacted in the U.S., many companies disobeyed them for years, because the market automatically punishes companies that discriminate: they lose customers and get additional expenses. It took 15 years for the government to break down the resistance of the companies.&lt;ref name=roback&gt;Jennifer Roback, “The Political Economy of Segregation: The Case of Segregated Streetcars.” Journal of Economic History 56, no. 4 (December 1986): 893–917.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markets punish the discriminator===
The Nobel prize winning economist [[Gary Becker]] showed in his book ''The Economics of Discrimination'' (University of Chicago Press, 1957) how the markets automatically punish the companies that discriminate.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;

The profitability of the company that discriminates is decreased, and the loss is "directly proportional to how much the employer's decision was based on prejudice, rather than on merit." Indeed, choosing a worker with lower performance (in comparison to salary) causes losses proportional to the difference in performance. Similarly, the customers who discriminate against certain kinds of workers in favor of less effective ones have to pay more for their services, on average.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;

If a company discriminates, it typically loses profitability and market share to the companies that do not discriminate, unless the state limits free competition protecting the discriminators.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

==Scapegoats==
Many people blame scapegoats for problems that are not their fault. This is common when two deprived ethnic groups compete with one another for economic rewards. This is normally directed against groups that are relatively powerless, because they make an easy target. It frequently involves projection, which is the unconscious attribution to the others of ones own desires or characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company Inc, 2009. Page 324. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
