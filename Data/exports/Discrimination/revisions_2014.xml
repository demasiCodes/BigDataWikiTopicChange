{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Discrimination''' is action that denies social participation or human rights to categories of people based on [[prejudice]].{{citation needed|reason=Always based on prejudice?|date=September 2014}}
This includes treatment of an individual or group based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, "in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=discrimination, definition|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/discrimination_1?q=discrimination |work=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction, influencing the individual's actual behavior towards the group or the group leader, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the exclusion of the individual or entities based on logical or irrational decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc, 2009. page 334. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all discrimination is based on prejudice, however. In the U.S., government policy known as [[affirmative action]] was instituted to encourage employers and universities to seek out and accept groups such as African-Americans and women, who have been subject to the opposite kind of discrimination for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography on Race, Gender and Affirmative Action|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~eandersn/biblio.htm |work=Race, Gender, and Affirmative Action|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices, and laws exist in many countries and [[institution]]s in every part of the world, even in ones where discrimination is generally looked down upon. In some places, controversial attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those believed to be current or past victims of discrimination—but have sometimes been called [[reverse discrimination]] themselves. 

==Etymology==
The term ''discriminate'' appeared in the early 17th century in the [[English language]]. It is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] discriminat- 'distinguished between', from the verb discriminare, from discrimen 'distinction', from the verb discernere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of discrimination; Origin|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/discriminate?q=discriminate|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the [[American Civil War]] the term "discrimination" generally evolved in [[American English]] usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable [[Social group|group]] or social category.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc, 2009. page 324. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Discrimination" derives from Latin, where the verb ''discrimire'' means "to separate, to distinguish, to make a distinction".

==Definitions==
Moral philosophers have defined discrimination as ''disadvantageous'' treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. He or she just needs to be treated ''worse'' than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, he or she will be acting in a discriminatory way even though people he discriminates against are actually benefitted by having some money donated to them.&lt;ref&gt;Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen, "Private Discrimination: A Prioritarian, Desert-Accommodating Account", ''San Diego Law Review'', 43, 817-856 (2006); Oscar Horta, "Discrimination in Terms of Moral Exclusion", ''Theoria: Swedish Journal of Philosophy'', 76, 346-364 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Realistic competition'' is driven by self-interest and is aimed at obtaining material resources (e.g., food, territory, customers) for the in-group (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to obtain more resources for its members, including the self).
# ''Social competition'' is driven by the need for self-esteem and is aimed at achieving a positive social status for the in-group relative to comparable out-groups (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to make it better than an out-group).
# ''Consensual discrimination'' is driven by the need for accuracy{{clarify|date=February 2012}} and reflects stable and legitimate intergroup status hierarchies (e.g., favouring a high-status in-group because it is high status).

The [[United Nations]] stance on discrimination includes the statement:  "Discriminatory behaviors take many forms, but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection."&lt;ref&gt;{{PDF|[http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp United Nations CyberSchoolBus: What is discrimination?]}}&lt;/ref&gt; International bodies [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] work towards helping ending discrimination around the world.

==Types==

===Age===
{{Main|Ageism}}

Ageism or age discrimination is discrimination and stereotyping based on the grounds of someone's age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Ageism|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ageism?q=ageism|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a set of beliefs, norms, and values which used to justify discrimination and/or subordination based on someone's age.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickKatsiaficas1987"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=George R.|last2=Katsiaficas|first2=George N.|last3=Kirkpatrick|first3=Robert George|coauthors=Mary Lou Emery|title=Introduction to critical sociology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xdf2QupEaHgC&amp;pg=PA261|accessdate=28 January 2011|year=1987|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-0-8290-1595-9|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ageism is most often directed towards old people, or adolescents and children.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson J and Ferraro K, Thirty Years of Ageism Research. In Nelson T (ed). Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php "Young and Oppressed"]. youthrights.org. Retrieved on 11 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Age discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in the [[United States]].  Joanna Lahey, professor at The Bush School of Government and Public Service at [[Texas A&amp;M]], found that firms are more than 40% more likely to interview a young adult job applicant than an older job applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Lahey, J. (2005) [http://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html Do Older Workers Face Discrimination?] Boston College.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey for the [[University of Kent]], England, 29% of respondents stated that they had suffered from age discrimination.  This is a higher proportion than for [[Sexism|gender]] or [[Racism|racial]] discrimination.  Dominic Abrams, social psychology professor at the university, concluded that Ageism is the most pervasive form of prejudice experienced in the UK population.&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/media/how_ageist_is_britain.pdf How Ageist is Britain?] London: Age Concern.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caste===
{{See also|Caste}}

According to [[UNICEF]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], [[caste]] discrimination affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide.&lt;ref name="unicef 1"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_discrimination.html Discrimination], [[UNICEF]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/08/29/global1815.htm Global Caste Discrimination]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newint.org/issue380/facts.htm Caste - The Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination based on caste, as perceived by [[UNICEF]], is prevalent mainly in parts of [[Asia]], ([[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Japan]]), [[Africa]] and others.&lt;ref name="unicef 1"/&gt; {{As of|2011}}, there were 200 million [[Dalit]]s or [[Scheduled Castes]] (formerly known as "untouchables") in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idsn.org/news-resources/idsn-news/read/article/india-official-dalit-population-exceeds-200-million/128/|title=India: Official Dalit population exceeds 200 million|date=29 May 2013|publisher=International Dalit Solidarity Network|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability===
{{Main|Disability discrimination}}

Discrimination against people with disabilities in favor of people who are not is called [[ableism]] or [[disablism]]. Disability discrimination, which treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of ‘normal living’, results in public and private places and services, education, and social work that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby excluding those with various disabilities. Studies have shown, employment is needed to not only provide a living but to sustain mental health and well being. Work fulfils a number of basic needs for an individual such as collective purpose, social contact, status, and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vornholt|first=Katharina|author2=Sjir Uitdewilligen |author3=Frans J.N.

In the United States, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] mandates the provision of equality of access to both buildings and services and is paralleled by similar acts in other countries, such as the [[Equality Act 2010]] in the UK.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Employment===
[[Image:Demonstration-6.11.06.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ethiopian Jews]] protest in Israel over non-employment of Ethiopian academics.]]
{{Main|Employment discrimination}}
Denying someone employment, or disallowing one from applying for a job, is often recognized as employment discrimination when the grounds for such an exclusion is not related to the requirements of the position, and protected characteristics may include age, disability, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, height, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, skin color, and weight.

The United States federal laws that protect against:
* Race, color and national origin discrimination include the [http://www.finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21] [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], [http://www.finduslaw.com/executive_order_number_11478_equal_employment_opportunity_in_the_federal_government] [[Executive Order Number 11478]] among other numerous laws that protect people from [http://www.finduslaw.com/employment_discrimination/race_national_origin race, color and national origin discrimination].

Most other western nations have similar laws protecting these groups.

Still unrelated to the requirements of the position, only 9% of [[Chief Financial Officers]] (CFOs) are women while they are over 60% among accountants and auditors. And yet those who reach a high responsibility position are paid on average 16% lower than their male colleagues. (According to a recent report, 2013) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfo-insight.com/corporate-strategy/corporate-strategy/female-cfos-may-be-best-remedy-against-discrimination/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluative orientation===
{{Main|Evaluative diversity}}
Evaluative orientation is a preference among forms of evaluation, not just preference for particular [[virtues]], [[law]]s, or measurable [[goal]]s, but for the use of virtues, laws, goals, or something else entirely as a foundation for evaluation. In this sense, machines, as well as humans, have evaluative orientations and can be victims of evaluative discrimination.&lt;ref name=SantosLang2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Santos-Lang |first=Christopher | year=In Press |editor1-first=Simon |editor1-last=van Rysewyk  |editor2-first=Matthijs |editor2-last=Pontier |title=Machine Medical Ethics |publisher=Springer | location=New York | chapter=Moral Ecosystem Approaches | url=http://grinfree.com/MoralEcology.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This may explain why early studies of evaluative diversity (a.k.a. moral diversity) portrayed people of unpriviledged orientations as "uneducated" or "mentally ill".&lt;ref name="higheststage"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kohlberg | first=Lawrence | title=The Claim to Moral Adequacy of a Highest Stage of Moral Judgment | journal=Journal of Philosophy | volume=70 | year=1973 | pages=630–646 | doi=10.2307/2025030 | issue=18 | publisher=The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 70, No. 18 | jstor=2025030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lind1978"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lind |first=Georg |editor-last=Portele |editor-first=G. |title=Sozialisation und Moral | location=Weinheim | publisher=Beltz |year=1978 |pages=171–201 |chapter=Wie misst man moralisches Urteil? Probleme und alternative Möglichkeiten der Messung eines komplexen Konstrukts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs designed to require [[originality]], [[emotional labor]], [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], or attempts to maximize a measurable variable (e.g. [[profit motive|profit]]) discriminate against employees who do not prefer the associated kind of evaluation. As [[Mitch Kapor]] put it, 
{{quote|"Every new employee who is hired has to be integrated into the organization.  There are certain values, styles of behavior, and practices which are characteristic of the entity.  Until a new employee learns to operate within those norms, he or she is like a foreign body introduced into an organism.  The body system recognizes an alien invader and mobilizes its immune system to neutralize it.  Newcomers are rendered impotent and, worse, start counterproductive efforts (infections) which have to be extinguished."&lt;ref name=Elkington2008&gt;{{Cite book | first1 = John | last1 = Elkington | first2 = Pamela | last2 = Hartigan  | year = 2008 |  title = The Power of Unreasonable People: How Social Entrepreneurs Create Markets That Change the World | publisher = [[Harvard Business Press]] | location = Boston | page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Mitch Kapor}}

Discrimination is implied also by correlations between evaluative orientation and inclusion in certain groups (e.g. liberal vs. conservative, religious groups, interest groups, etc.)&lt;ref name=Alford2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=RK/&gt;&lt;ref name=Graham2009/&gt; There are currently [[List of anti-discrimination acts|no laws]] prohibiting evaluative discrimination.

===Language===
{{refimprove|date=January 2012}}
{{Main|Linguistic discrimination}}
[[File:Corsican nationalism.jpg|thumb|Nationalists on [[Corsica]] sometimes spray-paint or shoot traffic signs in [[French language|French]].]]
Diversity of language is protected and respected by most nations who value cultural diversity.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} However, people are sometimes subjected to different treatment because their preferred language is associated with a particular group, class or category. Commonly, the preferred language is just another attribute of separate [[ethnic group]]s.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} Discrimination exists if there is prejudicial treatment against a person or a group of people who speak a particular language or dialect.

Language discrimination is suggested to be labeled '''[[linguicism]]''' or '''logocism'''{{by whom|date=January 2012}} Anti-discriminatory and inclusive efforts to accommodate persons who speak different languages or cannot have fluency in the country's predominant or "official" language, is [[bilingualism]] such as official documents in two languages, and [[multiculturalism]] in more than two languages.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Nationality===
Discrimination on the basis of [[nationality]] is usually included in employment laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/discrimination_civil_rights/publication_erd_14009_pweb.htm Race, Color, National Origin and Ancestry], State of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt; (see below [[Discrimination#Employment|section for employment discrimination]] specifically). It is sometimes referred to as bound together with racial discrimination&lt;ref name="KenLaMance"&gt;Ken LaMance, [http://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/race-or-nationality-discrimination.html Prohibitions Against Race and Nationality]&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be separate. It may vary from laws that stop refusals of hiring based on nationality, asking questions regarding origin, to prohibitions of firing, forced retirement, compensation and pay, etc., based on nationality.&lt;ref name="KenLaMance"/&gt;

Discrimination on the basis of nationality may show as a "level of acceptance" in a sport or work team regarding new team members and employees who differ from the nationality of the majority of team members.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Schwieren, [http://sgr.sagepub.com/content/39/6/643.abstract Mechanisms Underlying Nationality-Based Discrimination in Teams. A Quasi-Experiment Testing Predictions From Social Psychology and Microeconomics], Maastricht University&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[UAE]] and other [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] states, for instance, nationality is not frequently given to residents and expatriates. In the workplace, preferential treatment is given to full citizens, even though many of them lack experience and/or motivation to do the job. State benefits are also generally available for citizens only.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/emiratisation-wont-work-if-people-dont-want-to-learn&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial discrimination differentiates individuals on the basis of real and perceived racial differences and has been official government policy in several countries, such as [[South Africa]] in the [[apartheid]] era. Discriminatory policies towards ethnic minorities include the race-based discrimination of ethnic [[Malaysian Indian|Indians]] and Chinese in [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7121534.stm Malaysia's lingering ethnic divide]".

The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] expanded the damages available in Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to a jury trial.

===Regional===
{{see also|Regional discrimination in China}}
Regional or geographic discrimination is discrimination based on the region in which a person lives or was born. It differs from national discrimination in that it may not be based on national borders or the country the victim lives in, but is instead based on prejudices against a specific region of one or more countries. Examples include discrimination against mainland Chinese within China, or discrimination against Americans from the south in the United States. It is often accompanied by discrimination based on accent, dialect, or cultural differences.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Religious===
{{Main|Religious discrimination}}

{{Status of religious freedom}}
Religious discrimination is valuing or treating a person or group differently because of what they do or do not believe or because of their feelings towards a given religion. For instance, the indigenous Christian population of [[Balkans]] (known as "rayah" or "protected flock") lived under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Kanun–i–Rayah.  The word is sometimes translated as 'cattle' rather than 'flock' or 'subjects' to emphasize the inferior status of the rayah.&lt;ref&gt;Maan Z. Madina, ''Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Restrictions upon [[Jew]]ish occupations were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to Jews, pushing them into marginal roles considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], occupations only tolerated as a "necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0718_050718_ashkenazim.html Did Discrimination Enhance Intelligence of Jews?]". National Geographic News. July 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghetto]]s and were not allowed to own land.

In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States commission on civil rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for [[Freedom of Religion]] (in the United States secured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied " the equal protection of the laws, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: ''Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington. D.C., April 9–10, 1979''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse===

[[File:Protesto contra o sistema de cotas.jpg|thumb|upright|Students protesting against [[racial quota]]s in Brazil: "''Quer uma vaga? Passe no vestibular!''" ("Do you want a university place? Be successful in the entrance exam!")]]
Some attempts at antidiscrimination have been criticized as reverse discrimination. In particular, minority quotas (for example, [[affirmative action]]) may discriminate against members of a dominant or majority group or other minority groups. In its opposition to race preferences, the American Civil Rights Institute's [[Ward Connerly]] stated, "There is nothing positive, affirmative, or equal about 'affirmative action' programs that give preference to some groups based on race."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org/pr_7_25_07.html American Civil Rights Institute | Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex, gender, and gender-identity===
{{Main|Sexism}}
{{See also|Misogyny|Misandry|Transphobia|Discrimination towards non-binary gender persons}}

Though gender discrimination and sexism refers to beliefs and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] in relation to the [[gender]] of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. '''Sex discrimination''', on the other hand, may have legal consequences.

Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of [[prejudice]] and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.

Sexual discrimination can arise in different contexts. For instance an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an [[employer]] not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee based on his or her gender.
[[Image:OECD Gender Pay Gap.001.png|thumb|350px|The gender gap in median earnings of full-time employees according to the [[OECD]] 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[OECD]]. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf ''OECD Employment Outlook 2008 – Statistical Annex'']. OECD, Paris, 2008, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Sexual discrimination in the workplace can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group. One such example is Wikipedia. In the Wikipedian community, around 13 percent of registered users are women.&lt;ref&gt;Glott, R., Schmidt, P., &amp; Ghosh, R. A. (2010, March). Wikipedia survey—Overview of results. Retrieved from UNI-MERIT at http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-
FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This creates gender imbalances, and leaves room for [[systemic bias]]. Women are not only more harshly scrutinized, but the representation of women authors are also overlooked. Relative to men, across all source lists, women have a 2.6 greater odd of omission in Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;Reagle, J., &amp; Rhue, L. (2011). Gender Bias in Wikipedia and Britannica. http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631&lt;/ref&gt;
In an educational setting there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship because of his or her gender. In the housing setting there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on his or her gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one’s gender.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, F. (2003) Organizational Behaviour and Gender (2nd Edition), Aldershot: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt;  As with other forms of unlawful discrimination there are two types of sex discrimination – direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct sex discrimination is fairly easy to spot – ‘Barmaid wanted’, but indirect sex discrimination, where an unnecessary requirement puts one sex at a disproportionate disadvantage compared to the opposite sex, is sometimes less easy to spot, although some are obvious – ‘Bar person wanted – must look good in a mini skirt’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/sex-discrimination&lt;/ref&gt;

Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend his or her credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on one’s gender.

Socially, sexual differences have been used to justify [[gender role|different roles for men and women]], in some cases giving rise to claims of primary and secondary roles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.shu.ac.uk/ciod_papers/54/ Ridley-Duff, R. J. (2008) "Gendering, Courtship and Pay Equity: Developing Attraction Theory to Understand Work-Life Balance and Entrepreneurial Behaviour", paper to the ''31st ISBE Conference'', 5th–7th November, Belfast]&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are alleged non-physical differences between men and women, major reviews of the academic literature on gender difference find only a tiny minority of characteristics where there are consistent psychological differences between men and women, and these relate directly to experiences grounded in biological difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyde | first1 = J. S. | year = 2005 | title = The Gender Similarities Hypothesis | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 60 | issue = 6| pages = 581–592 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.60.6.581}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are also some psychological differences in regard to how problems are dealt with and emotional perceptions and reactions that may relate to hormones and the successful characteristics of each gender during longstanding roles in past primitive lifestyles.

Unfair discrimination usually follows the [[sexism|gender stereotyping]] held by a society.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond F. Gregory, ''Women and Workplace Discrimination: Overcoming Barriers to Gender Equality,'' Piscataway, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] had concluded that women often experience a "[[glass ceiling]]" and that there are no societies in which women enjoy the same opportunities as men.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, ''Glass Ceilings and Open Doors,'' Fordham Law Review,  64.2, 1995, pp.291-449; Carol Hymowitz and Timothy Schellhardt, ''The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can’t Seem to Break the Invisible Barrier that Blocks them from the Top Jobs,'' The Wall Street Journal, 4, March 24, 1986, pp.10-40&lt;/ref&gt; The term "glass ceiling" is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement in employment based on discrimination, especially sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bolton, Joe R. Feagin ''Black in Blue: African-American Police Officers and Racism,'' Routledge, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] in 1995, the Glass Ceiling Commission, a government-funded group, stated: "Over half of all Master’s degrees are now awarded to women, yet 95% of senior-level managers, of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies are men. Of them, 97% are white." In its report, it recommended [[affirmative action]], which is the consideration of an employee's gender and race in hiring and promotion decisions, as a means to end this form of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Glass Ceiling Commission"&gt;{{cite web

They outnumbered men in such occupations as public relations managers, financial managers, and human resource managers.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/QS-womenwork2010.htm Quick Stats on Women Workers, 2010]". [[U.S. Department of Labor]], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], ''Employment and Earnings, 2010 Annual Averages and the Monthly Labor Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transgender]] individuals, both male to female and female to male, often experience [[transphobia|transphobic]] problems that often lead to dismissals, underachievement, difficulty in finding a job, social isolation, and, occasionally, violent attacks against them. Nevertheless, the problem of gender discrimination does not stop at transgender individuals or with women. Men are often the victim in certain areas of employment as men begin to seek work in office and childcare settings traditionally perceived as "women's jobs". One such situation seems to be evident in a recent case concerning alleged YMCA discrimination and a Federal Court Case in Texas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!-- could not find previously cited story:http://www.nowpublic.com/world/blacks-men-are-racial-gender-discrimination-not-dead-yet --&gt; The case actually involves alleged discrimination against both men and blacks in childcare, even when they pass the same strict background tests and other standards of employment. It is currently being contended in federal court, as of fall 2009.

Discrimination in slasher films is relevant.  Gloria Cowan had a research group study on 57 different slasher films. Their results showed that the non-surviving females were more frequently sexual than the surviving females and the non-surviving males. Surviving as a female slasher victim was strongly associated with the absence of sexual behavior. In slasher films, the message appears to be that sexual women get killed and only the pure women survive. Slasher films reinforce the idea that female sexuality can be costly.&lt;ref name=Cowan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=Glora|author2=O'Brien, Margaret|title=Gender and Survival vs. Death in Slasher Films: A Content Analysis|journal=Sex Roles|year=1990|volume=23|pages=187–196|doi=10.1007/BF00289865|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual orientation===
[[File:Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill protest.jpg|thumb|right|Protests in New York City against [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill|Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Bill]].]]
{{See also|Heterosexism|Heteronormativity|Biphobia|Homophobia}}
One’s sexual orientation is a “predilection for homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality”.&lt;ref&gt;''World English Dictionary'', [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+orientation "Sexual Orientation"]&lt;/ref&gt; Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are not immune to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexual preferences; a term for such hatred based upon one’s sexual orientation is often called [[homophobia]]. Many continue to hold negative feelings towards those with non-heterosexual orientations and will discriminate against people who have them or are thought to have them.

People of other uncommon sexual orientations also experience discrimination. One study found its sample of heterosexuals to be more prejudiced against [[asexuality|asexuals]] than to homosexuals or bisexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intergroup bias toward "Group X": Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals |first1=Cara C. |last1=MacInnis |first2=Gordon |last2=Hodson |journal=Group Processes Intergroup Relations |doi=10.1177/1368430212442419 |volume=15 |number=6 |pages=725–743 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[ILGA]] published a report based on research carried out by Daniel Ottosson at Södertörn University College, Stockholm, Sweden. This research found that of the 80 countries around the world that continue to consider [[homosexuality]] illegal, five carry the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for homosexual activity, and two do in some regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7883204&amp;page=1 New Benefits for Same-Sex Couples May Be Hard to Implement Abroad]".

On February 5, 2005 the [[IRIN]] issued a reported titled "Iraq: Male homosexuality still a taboo." The article stated, among other things that [[honor killings]] by Iraqis against a gay family member are common and given some legal protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=51540&amp;SelectRegion=Middle_East IRIN Middle East | Middle East | Iraq | IRAQ: Male homosexuality still a taboo | Human Rights |Feature]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009 Human Rights Watch published an extensive report detailing torture of men accused of being [[LGBT rights in Iraq|gay in Iraq]], including the blocking of men's anuses with glue and then giving the men laxatives.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/85049/section/3 They Want Us Exterminated]".

{{further|LGBT rights by country or territory}}
A number of countries, especially those in the [[Western world]], have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay hate crimes and workplace discrimination. Some have also legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the [[United Nations]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights.

==Theories==
[[Social theories]] such as [[egalitarianism]] assert that [[social equality]] should prevail. In some societies, including most developed countries, each individual's civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weblocator.com/attorney/mn/law/concivrig.html#30 |title=Civil rights |accessdate=2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain or suffering shared by all animals, "abolitionist" or "vegan" egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual (regardless its species), warrant [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]] with the interests of humans, and that not doing so is "[[speciesist]]".&lt;ref name="singerethics-sentience"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Practical Ethics]] |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |origyear=1993 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-43971-X |edition=Second |pages=57–58 |chapter=Equality for Animals? |quote=If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. ... This is why the limit of sentience&amp;nbsp;... is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others. ... Similarly those I would call 'speciesists' give greater weight to their own species when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of other species.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labeling theory===
Discrimination, in [[labeling theory]], takes form as mental categorization of minorities and the use of [[stereotype]]. This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm, which results in internal devaluation and [[social stigma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Slattery| first=M. | year=2002 | title=Key Ideas in Sociology | publisher=Nelson Thornes| isbn=978-0-7487-6565-2 | pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be seen as discrimination. It is started by describing a "natural" social order. It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} The [[Nazis]] in 1930s-era Germany and the pre-1990 [[Apartheid]] government of South Africa used racially discriminatory agendas for their political ends. This practice continues with some present day governments.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Game theory===
Economist [[Yanis Varoufakis]] (2013) argues that that "discrimination based on utterly arbitrary characteristics
evolves quickly and systematically in the experimental laboratory", and that neither classical [[game theory]] nor [[neoclassical economics]] can explain this.

At the start of each session, each participant was assigned a color at random, either red or blue.  At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent.  Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players' behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a [[Nash equilibrium]] where players of one color (the "advantaged" color) [[pure strategy|consistently]] played the aggressive "hawk" strategy against players of the other, "disadvantaged" color, who played the acquiescent "dove" strategy against the advantaged color.  Players of both colors used a [[mixed strategy]] when playing against players assigned the same color as their own.

The experimenters then added a [[prisoners' dilemma|cooperation]] option to the game, and found that disadvantaged players usually cooperated with each other, while advantaged players usually did not.  They state that while the equilibria reached in the original HD game are predicted by [[evolutionary game theory]], game theory does not explain the emergence of cooperation in the disadvantaged group.  Citing earlier psychological work of [[Matthew Rabin]], they hypothesize that a norm of differing entitlements emerges across the two groups, and that this norm could define a "fairness" equilibrium within the disadvantaged group.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]

===State discrimination===

In politics, the dominating part of the population rules. Some believe the [[anti-semitic]] practices of the [[Nazi-Germany]] would not have happened in [[free market]]s, because they would have caused losses.&lt;ref name=murphy&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/y2010/Murphydiscrimination.html The Economics of Discrimination], Robert P. Murphy, Library of Economics, AUGUST 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, government officials and politicians need not care about losses as much as companies, which decreases their incentive not to discriminate. In the U.S. for example, around 1900 African-Americans started to compete for jobs that had previously been all-white. Officials, voted in by white majorities, changed the hiring rules for the federal civil service. Photographs of applicants were made obligatory in civil service job applications, and hiring officials were given discretion to choose between the three top scoring applicants. The number of blacks in federal employment was kept artificially low for decades.&lt;ref name=enc&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Discrimination.html Discrimination], The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics, Library of Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 20th century South Africa mine owners preferred hiring black workers because they were cheaper. Then the whites successfully persuaded the government to enact laws that highly restricted the black's rights to work (see [[Apartheid]]).&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

Similarly, to make more profits, producers secretly hired screenwriters who were on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s blacklist, which mitigated the effects of the list.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

When the "Jim Crow" racial segregation laws were enacted in the U.S., many companies disobeyed them for years, because the market automatically punishes companies that discriminate: they lose customers and get additional expenses. It took 15 years for the government to break down the resistance of the companies.&lt;ref name=roback&gt;Jennifer Roback, "The Political Economy of Segregation: The Case of Segregated Streetcars." Journal of Economic History 56, no. 4 (December 1986): 893–917.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Markets punish the discriminator===
In his book ''The Economics of Discrimination'' (University of Chicago Press, 1957) the Nobel Prize–winning economist [[Gary Becker]] asserts that markets automatically punish the companies that discriminate.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;  According to Becker, the profitability of the company that discriminates is decreased, and the loss is "directly proportional to how much the employer's decision was based on prejudice, rather than on merit." Indeed, choosing a worker with lower performance (in comparison to salary) causes losses proportional to the difference in performance. Similarly, the customers who discriminate against certain kinds of workers in favor of less effective ones have to pay more for their services, on average.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;

If a company discriminates, it typically loses profitability and market share to the companies that do not discriminate, unless the state limits free competition protecting the discriminators.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;

In  ''The Welfare Implications of Becker’s Discrimination Coefficient''   Richard S. Toikka disagrees, citing the ambivalent relations between discrimination and economic efficiency, as shown by the literature. According to Toikka the “discriminatory tastes,” in Becker’s explanation, was shown to be problematic because it implies discrimination is efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Toikka, The Welfare Implications of Becker’s Discrimination Coefficient, 13 J. ECON. THEORY 472, 472 (1976);  Glen G. Cain, The Economic Analysis of Labor Market Discrimination: A Survey, in 1 HANDBOOK OF LABOR ECONOMICS 693, 774 (Orley Ashenfelter &amp; Richard Layard eds., 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the very aim of the markets is to cater efficiently for the different "tastes" of all individuals, including customers, employees, employers, and firm owners (and discrimination happens within and between all these groups). If discrimination were just another "taste" then the markets were not to punish for it. Second, microeconomic theory turns to unusual method - explicit treatment of production functions - when it analyzes discrimination. And third, the very existence of discrimination in employment (defined as wages which differ from marginal product of the discriminated employees) at the long run, contradicts perfect competition and efficiency (which imply equality of wages and the said marginal product). Hence, the very existence of discrimination at the long run, contradicts the claim that the markets function well and punish the discriminators.&lt;ref&gt;For review of the literature in regard to the last two points see [http://www.glima.info/pdf/Employment-Discrimination-Paper-final.pdf Menahem Pasternak, Employment Discrimination: Some Economic Definitions, Critique and Legal Implications, 33 N.
