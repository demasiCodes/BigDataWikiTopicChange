{{About|the prejudicial treatment}}
{{Discrimination sidebar|state=collapsed}}
In human [[social behavior|social affairs]], '''discrimination''' is treatment or consideration of, or making a distinction towards, a person based on the group,class, or category to which the person is perceived to belong. These include [[ageing|age]], [[skin color|colour]], [[convictions]]  for which a pardon has been granted or a record suspended, [[height]], [[disability]], [[ethnicity]], [[family|family status]], [[gender identity]], [[Genetics|genetic characteristics]], [[marital|marital status]], [[nationality]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[religion]], [[sex]], and [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca/eng/content/what-discrimination-1 |title=What is Discrimination? |publisher=Canadian Human Rights Commission |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415190505/https://www.chrc-ccdp.gc.ca/eng/content/what-discrimination-1 |archive-date=2018-04-15 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination consists of treatment of an individual or group, based on their actual or perceived membership in a certain group or social category, "in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=discrimination, definition|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/american-english/discrimination |work=Cambridge Dictionaries Online|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the group's initial reaction or interaction going on to influence the individual's actual behavior towards the group leader or the group, restricting members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to another group, leading to the [[social exclusion|exclusion]] of the individual or entities based on illogical or irrational decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to sociology. 7th ed. New York: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc, 2009. p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discriminatory traditions, policies, ideas, practices and laws exist in many countries and [[institution]]s in every part of the world, including in territories where discrimination is generally looked down upon. In some places, controversial attempts such as quotas have been used to benefit those who are believed to be current or past victims of discrimination—but they have sometimes been called [[reverse discrimination]].

==Etymology==
The term ''discriminate'' appeared in the early 17th century in the English language. It is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''discriminat-'' 'distinguished between', from the verb ''discriminare'', from ''discrimen'' 'distinction', from the verb ''discernere''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of discrimination; Origin|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/discriminate?q=discriminate|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the [[American Civil War]] the term "discrimination" generally evolved in [[American English]] usage as an understanding of prejudicial treatment of an individual based solely on their race, later generalized as membership in a certain socially undesirable [[Social group|group]] or social category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Introduction to sociology |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] Inc. |year=2009 |edition=7th |location=New York |page=324 |medium=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Discrimination" derives from Latin, where the verb ''discrimire'' means "to separate, to distinguish, to make a distinction".

==Definitions==
Moral philosophers have defined discrimination as ''disadvantageous'' treatment or consideration. This is a comparative definition. An individual need not be actually harmed in order to be discriminated against. They just need to be treated ''worse'' than others for some arbitrary reason. If someone decides to donate to help orphan children, but decides to donate less, say, to black children out of a racist attitude, then they would be acting in a discriminatory way despite the fact that the people they discriminate against actually benefit by receiving a donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lippert-Rasmussen |first=Kasper |year=2006 |title=Private Discrimination: A Prioritarian, Desert-Accommodating Account |journal=San Diego Law Review |volume=43 |pages=817–856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1755-2567.2010.01080.x|title = Discrimination in Terms of Moral Exclusion| journal=Theoria| volume=76| issue=4| pages=314–332|year = 2010|last1 = Horta|first1 = Oscar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this discrimination develops into a source of oppression. It is similar to the action of recognizing someone as 'different' so much that they are treated inhumanly and degraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nVIJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;q=equality|title=Anti-Discriminatory Practice: Equality, Diversity and Social Justice|last=Thompson|first=Neil|date=2016-05-12|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137586667|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on realistic-conflict theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Group conflict and co-operation |last=Sherif |first=M. |publisher=Routledge |year=1967 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social-identity theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The social psychology of intergroup relations |last=Tajfel |first=H. |last2=Turner |first2=J.

# ''Realistic competition'' is driven by self-interest and is aimed at obtaining material resources (e.g., food, territory, customers) for the in-group (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to obtain more resources for its members, including the self).
# ''Social competition'' is driven by the need for self-esteem and is aimed at achieving a positive social status for the in-group relative to comparable out-groups (e.g., favouring an in-group in order to make it better than an out-group).
# ''Consensual discrimination'' is driven by the need for accuracy{{clarify|date=February 2012}} and reflects stable and legitimate intergroup status hierarchies (e.g., favouring a high-status in-group because it is high status).

The [[United Nations]] stance on discrimination includes the statement:  "Discriminatory behaviors take many forms, but they all involve some form of exclusion or rejection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp |title=United Nations CyberSchoolBus: What is discrimination? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601211521/http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/discrim/id_8_ud_print.asp |archivedate=2014-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; International bodies [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] work towards helping ending discrimination around the world.

==Types==

===Age===
{{Main|Ageism|Adultism}}
Ageism or age discrimination is discrimination and stereotyping based on the grounds of someone's age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Ageism|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ageism?q=ageism|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a set of beliefs, norms, and values which used to justify discrimination or subordination based on a person's age.&lt;ref name="KirkpatrickKatsiaficas1987"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=George R.|last2=Katsiaficas|first2=George N.|last3=Kirkpatrick|first3=Robert George|author4=Mary Lou Emery|title=Introduction to critical sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdf2QupEaHgC&amp;pg=PA261|accessdate=28 January 2011|year=1987|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=978-0-8290-1595-9|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ageism is most often directed towards old people, or adolescents and children.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson J and Ferraro K, Thirty Years of Ageism Research. In Nelson T (ed). Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php "Young and Oppressed"]. youthrights.org. Retrieved on 11 April 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728105250/http://www.youthrights.org/oppressed.php |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age discrimination in hiring has been shown to exist in the United States.  Joanna Lahey, professor at The Bush School of Government and Public Service at [[Texas A&amp;M]], found that firms are more than 40% more likely to interview a young adult job applicant than an older job applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Lahey, J. (2005) [https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html Do Older Workers Face Discrimination?] Boston College. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414230847/https://ideas.repec.org/p/crr/issbrf/ib33.html |date=April 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, Stijn Baert, Jennifer Norga, Yannick Thuy and Marieke Van Hecke, researchers at [[Ghent University]], measured comparable ratios in Belgium. They found that age discrimination is heterogeneous by the activity older candidates undertook during their additional post-educational years. In Belgium, they are only discriminated if they have more years of inactivity or irrelevant employment.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., Norga, J., Thuy, Y., Van Hecke, M. (In press) [http://users.ugent.be/~sbaert/BaertNorgaThuyVanHecke_GettingGreyHairs_JEP.pdf Getting Grey Hairs in the Labour Market: An Alternative Experiment on Age Discrimination] Journal of Economic Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey for the [[University of Kent]], England, 29% of respondents stated that they had suffered from age discrimination.  This is a higher proportion than for [[Sexism|gender]] or [[Racism|racial]] discrimination. [[Dominic Abrams]], social psychology professor at the university, concluded that ageism is the most pervasive form of prejudice experienced in the UK population.&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/media/how_ageist_is_britain.pdf How Ageist is Britain?] London: Age Concern. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027165812/http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/media/how_ageist_is_britain.pdf |date=October 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caste===
{{See also|Caste}}

According to [[UNICEF]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], [[caste]] discrimination affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide.&lt;ref name="unicef 1"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/protection/index_discrimination.html Discrimination], UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2001/08/29/global1815.htm|title=Global Caste Discrimination|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newint.org/issue380/facts.htm Caste - The Facts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811033342/http://www.newint.org/issue380/facts.htm |date=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination based on caste, as perceived by [[UNICEF]], is mainly prevalent in parts of [[Asia]], ([[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Japan]]), [[Africa]] and others.&lt;ref name="unicef 1"/&gt; {{As of|2011}}, there were 200 million [[Dalit]]s or [[Scheduled Castes]] (formerly known as "untouchables") in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idsn.org/news-resources/idsn-news/read/article/india-official-dalit-population-exceeds-200-million/128/|title=India: Official Dalit population exceeds 200 million|date=29 May 2013|publisher=International Dalit Solidarity Network|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability===
{{Main|Disability discrimination}}

Discrimination against people with [[Disability|disabilities]] in favor of people who are not is called [[ableism]] or [[disablism]]. Disability discrimination, which treats non-disabled individuals as the standard of 'normal living', results in public and private places and services, education, and social work that are built to serve 'standard' people, thereby excluding those with various disabilities. Studies have shown, employment is needed to not only provide a living but to sustain mental health and well-being. Work fulfils a number of basic needs for an individual such as collective purpose, social contact, status, and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vornholt|first=Katharina|author2=Sjir Uitdewilligen |author3=Frans J.N. Nijhuis |title=Factors Affecting the Acceptance of People with Disabilities at Work: A Literature Review|journal=Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation|date=December 2013|volume=23|issue=4|pages=463–75|doi=10.1007/s10926-013-9426-0|pmid=23400588}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person with a disability is often found to be socially isolated and work is one way to reduce isolation.

In the United States, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] mandates the provision of equality of access to both buildings and services and is paralleled by similar acts in other countries, such as the [[Equality Act 2010]] in the UK.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Language===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
{{Main|Linguistic discrimination}}
[[File:Corsican nationalism.jpg|thumb|Nationalists in [[Corsica]] sometimes spray-paint or shoot traffic signs in [[French language|French]].]]
Diversity of language is protected and respected by most nations who value cultural diversity.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} However, people are sometimes subjected to different treatment because their preferred language is associated with a particular group, class or category. Notable examples are the [[Anti-French sentiment in the United States]] as well as the [[Anti-Quebec sentiment]] in Canada targeting people who speak the French language. Commonly, the preferred language is just another attribute of separate [[ethnic group]]s.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} Discrimination exists if there is prejudicial treatment against a person or a group of people who either do or do not speak a particular language or languages.

Another noteworthy example of linguistic discrimination is the backdrop to the [[Bengali language movement|Bengali Language Movement]] in erstwhile Pakistan, a political campaign that played a key role in the creation of [[Bangladesh]]. In 1948, [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] declared [[Urdu]] as the national language of [[Pakistan]] and branded those supporting the use of [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the most widely spoken language in the state, as enemies of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[1971 Bangladesh genocide#CITEREFHossainTollefson2006|Hossain &amp; Tollefson 2006]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language discrimination is suggested to be labeled '''[[linguicism]]''' or '''logocism'''.{{by whom|date=January 2012}} Anti-discriminatory and inclusive efforts to accommodate persons who speak different languages or cannot have fluency in the country's predominant or "official" language, is [[bilingualism]] such as official documents in two languages, and [[multiculturalism]] in more than two languages.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Name===
Discrimination based on a person's name may also occur, with research suggesting the presence of discrimination based on name meaning, pronunciation, uniqueness, gender affiliation, and racial affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Silberzhan | first1 =Raphael | title =It Pays to be Herr Kaiser | journal =Psychological Science | volume =24 | issue =12 | pages =2437–2444 | date =May 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Laham | first =Simon | title =The name-pronunciation effect: Why people like Mr. Smith more than Mr. Colquhoun | journal =Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume=48 | issue =2012 | pages =752–756 | date =December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Cotton | first =John  | title =The "name game": affective and hiring reactions to first names | journal =Journal of Managerial Psychology | volume =23 | issue =1 | pages =18–39 | date =July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Bertrand | first =Marianne | title =Are Emily and Brendan More Employable than Lakisha and Jamaal? | journal =The American Economic Review | volume =94 | issue =4 | pages =991–1013 |  date =September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Easton | first=Stephen | title=Blind recruiting study suggests positive discrimination common in the APS | newspaper=The Mandarin | publisher=The Mandarin | date=June 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has further shown that real world recruiters spend an average of just six seconds reviewing each résumé before making their initial "fit/no fit" screen-out decision and that a person's name is one of the six things they focus on most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first =Jacquelyn | title =Here's What Recruiters Look At In The 6 Seconds They Spend On Your Résumé | newspaper =Business Insider | publisher =Business Insider | date =November 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  France has made it illegal to view a person's name on a résumé when screening for the initial list of most qualified candidates. Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands have also experimented with name-blind résumé processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =No names, no bias | newspaper =The Economist | publisher =The Economist | date =October 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some apparent discrimination may be explained by other factors such as name frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Silberzhan | first1=Raphael | last2=Simonsohn | first2=Uri | last3=Uhlmann| first3=Eric| title =Matched-Names Analysis Reveals No Evidence of Name-Meaning Effects: A Collaborative Commentary on Silberzahn and Uhlmann | journal = Psychological Science | volume =25 | issue =7 | pages =1504–1505 | date =February 4, 2014|url=http://www.socialjudgments.com/docs/Silberzahn_Simonsohn_Uhlmann_2014_Collaborative_Commentary_and_Online_Supplement.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of name discrimination based on name fluency is subtle, small and subject significantly to changing norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =The Power of Names | newspaper =The New York Times | publisher=The New York Times | date =May 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationality===
Discrimination on the basis of [[nationality]] is usually included in [[Employment discrimination|employment laws]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/discrimination_civil_rights/publication_erd_14009_pweb.htm Race, Color, National Origin and Ancestry], State of Wisconsin {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024061935/http://dwd.wisconsin.gov/er/discrimination_civil_rights/publication_erd_14009_pweb.htm |date=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see above [[Discrimination#Employment|section for employment discrimination]] specifically). It is sometimes referred to as bound together with racial discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race and National Origin Discrimination|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/frontpage/faq/race-origin.html|website=Office for Civil Rights|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be separate. It may vary from laws that stop refusals of hiring based on nationality, asking questions regarding origin, to prohibitions of firing, forced retirement, compensation and pay, etc., based on nationality.

Discrimination on the basis of nationality may show as a "level of acceptance" in a sport or work team regarding new team members and employees who differ from the nationality of the majority of team members.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Schwieren, [http://sgr.sagepub.com/content/39/6/643.abstract Mechanisms Underlying Nationality-Based Discrimination in Teams.

In the [[UAE]] and other [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|GCC]] states, for instance, nationality is not frequently given to residents and expatriates. In the workplace, preferential treatment is given to full citizens, even though many of them lack experience or motivation to do the job. State benefits are also generally available for citizens only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/emiratisation-wont-work-if-people-dont-want-to-learn|title=Emiratisation won't work if people don't want to learn|author=Ayesha Almazroui|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] found that in England and Wales {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, a black person was five times more likely to be imprisoned than a white person. The discrepancy was attributed to "decades of racial prejudice in the criminal justice system".&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh, Randeep.

===Region===
{{see also|Regional discrimination in China}}
Regional or geographic discrimination is discrimination based on the region in which a person lives or was born. It differs from national discrimination in that it may not be based on national borders or the country the victim lives in, but is instead based on prejudices against a specific region of one or more countries. Examples include discrimination against Chinese born in countryside far from city within China, and discrimination against [[Americans]] from the [[Southern United States|southern]] or [[Northern United States|northern]] regions of the United States. It is often accompanied by discrimination based on accent, dialect, or cultural differences.&lt;ref name="Accent"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/a/accent-discrimination/ | title=Accent Discrimination Law and Legal Definition|publisher=USLegal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
{{Main|Religious discrimination}}

{{Status of religious freedom}}
[[File:Lotshampa refugees in Beldangi Camp.jpg|thumb|In the 1990s, [[Bhutan]] [[Bhutanese refugees|expelled or forced to leave]] its Hindu population in the name of preserving its Buddhist culture and identity.]]
Religious discrimination is valuing or treating a person or group differently because of what they do or do not believe or because of their feelings towards a given religion. For instance, the indigenous Christian population of the [[Balkans]], known as the "rayah" or the "protected flock", was discriminated against under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Kanun–i–Rayah. The word is sometimes translated as 'cattle' rather than 'flock' or 'subjects' in order to emphasize the Christian population's inferior status to that of the Muslim rayah.&lt;ref&gt;Maan Z. Madina, ''Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|Was this "discrimination" only expressed by the meaning of a single word? If so, this can hardly be an illustrative example of religious discrimination and should be replaced with a better example.|date=November 2015}}

Restrictions upon [[Jew]]ish occupations were imposed by Christian authorities. Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to religious Jews, pushing them into marginal roles considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], occupations only tolerated as a "necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/07/0718_050718_ashkenazim.html Did Discrimination Enhance Intelligence of Jews?]". National Geographic News. July 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghetto]]s and were not allowed to own land.

In a 1979 consultation on the issue, the United States commission on civil rights defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].  Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for [[Freedom of Religion]] (in the United States secured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied "the equal protection of the laws, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom".&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: ''Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington. D.C., April 9–10, 1979''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex, sex characteristics, gender, and gender identity===
{{Main|Sexism}}
{{See also|Misogyny|Misandry|Discrimination against intersex people|Transphobia||Discrimination towards non-binary gender persons}}

Though gender discrimination and sexism refer to beliefs and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] in relation to the [[gender]] of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. '''Sex discrimination''', on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would not have occurred had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of [[prejudice]] and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.

Sexual discrimination can arise in different contexts. For instance, an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an [[employer]] not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee based on their gender. [[Image:OECD gender wage gap.svg|thumb|350px|The gender gap in median earnings of full-time employees according to the [[OECD]] 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[OECD]]|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|title=OECD Employment Outlook 2008 – Statistical Annex OECD, Paris|year=2008|page=358|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206221033/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/57/40846335.pdf|archivedate= December 6, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Sexual discrimination can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group. One such example is Wikipedia. In the Wikipedian community, around 13 percent of registered users are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Glott, R., Schmidt, P., &amp; Ghosh, R. A.|date=March 2010|title=Wikipedia survey—Overview of results|work=UNI-MERIT| url=http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414165445/http://wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf|archivedate=April 14, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates gender imbalances, and leaves room for [[systemic bias]]. Women are not only more harshly scrutinized, but the representation of women authors are also overlooked. Relative to men, across all source lists, women have a 2.6 greater odds of omission in Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Reagle, J., &amp; Rhue, L.|year=2011|title=Gender Bias in Wikipedia and Britannica|url=http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/777/631|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=5|pages=1138–1158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an educational setting, there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship because of their gender. In the housing setting, there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on their gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one's gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilson, F.|year=2003|title=Organizational Behaviour and Gender|edition=2nd|location=Aldershot|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9780754609001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with other forms of unlawful discrimination, there are two types of sex discrimination – direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct sex discrimination is fairly easy to spot – 'Barmaid wanted', but indirect sex discrimination, where an unnecessary requirement puts one sex at a disproportionate disadvantage compared to the opposite sex, is sometimes less easy to spot, although some are obvious – 'Bar person wanted – must look good in a mini skirt'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citation.co.uk/employment-law/sex-discrimination|title=Sex Discrimination|website=Citation.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend their credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on one's gender.

Socially, sexual differences have been used to justify [[gender role|different roles for men and women]], in some cases giving rise to claims of primary and secondary roles. While there are alleged non-physical differences between men and women, major reviews of the academic literature on gender difference find only a tiny minority of characteristics where there are consistent psychological differences between men and women, and these relate directly to experiences grounded in biological difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyde | first1 = J.

Gregory, ''Women and Workplace Discrimination: Overcoming Barriers to Gender Equality,'' Piscataway, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] had concluded that women often experience a "[[glass ceiling]]" and that there are no societies in which women enjoy the same opportunities as men.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, ''Glass Ceilings and Open Doors,'' Fordham Law Review,  64.2, 1995, pp.291-449; Carol Hymowitz and Timothy Schellhardt, ''The Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can’t Seem to Break the Invisible Barrier that Blocks them from the Top Jobs,'' The Wall Street Journal, 4, March 24, 1986, pp.10-40&lt;/ref&gt; The term "glass ceiling" is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement in employment based on discrimination, especially sex discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bolton, Joe R. Feagin ''Black in Blue: African-American Police Officers and Racism,'' Routledge, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States in 1995, the Glass Ceiling Commission, a government-funded group, stated: "Over half of all Master's degrees are now awarded to women, yet 95% of senior-level managers, of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies are men. Of them, 97% are white." In its report, it recommended [[affirmative action]], which is the consideration of an employee's gender and race in hiring and promotion decisions, as a means to end this form of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Glass Ceiling Commission"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010}}, women accounted for 51% of workers in high-paying management, professional, and related occupations. They outnumbered men in such occupations as public relations managers, financial managers, and human resource managers.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/QS-womenwork2010.htm Quick Stats on Women Workers, 2010]". [[U.S. Department of Labor]], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], ''Employment and Earnings, 2010 Annual Averages and the Monthly Labor Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, women are found to experience a [[sticky floor]]. While a glass ceiling implies that women are less like to reach the top of the job ladder, a sticky floor is defined as the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. A sticky floor is related to gender differences at the bottom of the wage distribution. It might be explained by both employer discrimination and gender differences in career aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Baert, S., De Pauw, A.-S., Deschacht, N. (Forthcoming) [Do Employer Preferences Contribute to Sticky Floors?] Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intersex]] persons experience [[Discrimination against intersex people|discrimination]] due to innate, atypical [[sex characteristics]]. Multiple jurisdictions now protect individuals on grounds of ''intersex status'' or ''[[sex characteristics]]''. South Africa was the first country to explicitly add intersex to legislation, as part of the attribute of 'sex'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2005-022.pdf Judicial Matters Amendment Act, No. 22 of 2005], Republic of South Africa, Vol. 487, Cape Town, 11 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia was the first country to add an independent attribute, of 'intersex status'.&lt;ref name="expmem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22legislation%2Fems%2Fr5026_ems_1fcd9245-33ff-4b3a-81b9-7fdc7eb91b9b%22 |title=Australian Parliament, Explanatory Memorandum to the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Bill 2013 |publisher= |accessdate=6 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219231017/http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p%3Bquery%3DId%3A%22legislation/ems/r5026_ems_1fcd9245-33ff-4b3a-81b9-7fdc7eb91b9b%22 |archivedate=19 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/21774/welcome-senate-inquiry-anti-discrimination/ We welcome the Senate Inquiry report on the Exposure Draft of the Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill 2012], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 21 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Malta was the first to adopt a broader framework of 'sex characteristics', through legislation that also ended modifications to the sex characteristics of minors undertaken for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref name="gate-malta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transactivists.org/2015/04/08/making-depathologization-a-matter-of-law-a-comment-from-gate-on-the-maltese-act-on-gender-identity-gender-expression-and-sex-characteristics/ |title=Making depathologization a matter of law.

[[Transgender]] individuals, whether male-to-female, female-to-male, or [[genderqueer]], often experience [[transphobia|transphobic]] problems that often lead to dismissals, underachievement, difficulty in finding a job, social isolation, and, occasionally, violent attacks against them. 

Nevertheless, the problem of gender discrimination does not stop at transgender individuals or with women. Men are often the victim in certain areas of employment as men begin to seek work in office and childcare settings traditionally perceived as "women's jobs". One such situation seems to be evident in a recent case concerning alleged YMCA discrimination and a Federal Court Case in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;''Noack v YMCA of Greater Houston Area'', 132, S. Ct.425 (US, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The case actually involves alleged discrimination against both men and black people in childcare, even when they pass the same strict background tests and other standards of employment. It is currently being contended in federal court, as of fall 2009.{{Update inline|date=October 2018|reason=The case mentioned has most likely been decided.|?=yes}}

Discrimination in slasher films is relevant. Gloria Cowan had a research group study on 57 different slasher films. Their results showed that the non-surviving females were more frequently sexual than the surviving females and the non-surviving males. Surviving as a female slasher victim was strongly associated with the absence of sexual behavior. In slasher films, the message appears to be that sexual women get killed and only the pure women survive, thus reinforcing the idea that female sexuality can be costly.&lt;ref name=Cowan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=Glora|author2=O'Brien, Margaret|title=Gender and Survival vs. Death in Slasher Films: A Content Analysis|journal=Sex Roles|year=1990|volume=23|pages=187–196|doi=10.1007/BF00289865|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One's sexual orientation is a "predilection for homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality".&lt;ref&gt;''World English Dictionary'', [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+orientation "Sexual Orientation"]&lt;/ref&gt; Like most minority groups, homosexuals and bisexuals are vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexual preferences; a term for such hatred based upon one's sexual orientation is often called [[homophobia]]. Many continue to hold negative feelings towards those with non-heterosexual orientations and will discriminate against people who have them or are thought to have them. People of other uncommon sexual orientations also experience discrimination. One study found its sample of heterosexuals to be more prejudiced against [[asexuality|asexuals]] than to homosexuals or bisexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Intergroup bias toward "Group X": Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals |first1=Cara C. |last1=MacInnis |first2=Gordon |last2=Hodson |journal=Group Processes Intergroup Relations |doi=10.1177/1368430212442419 |volume=15 |number=6 |pages=725–743 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employment discrimination based on sexual orientation varies by country.

{{further|LGBT rights by country or territory}}
A number of countries, especially those in the [[Western world]], have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay hate crimes and workplace discrimination. Some have also legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the [[United Nations]] passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights.

In the US, a government policy known as [[affirmative action]] was instituted to encourage employers and universities to seek out and accept groups such as [[African Americans]] and women, who have been subject to discrimination for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography on Race, Gender and Affirmative Action|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~eandersn/biblio.htm |work=Race, Gender, and Affirmative Action|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some attempts at antidiscrimination have been criticized as reverse discrimination. In particular, minority quotas (for example, [[affirmative action]]) may discriminate against members of a dominant or majority group or other minority groups. In its opposition to race preferences, the American Civil Rights Institute's [[Ward Connerly]] stated, "There is nothing positive, affirmative, or equal about 'affirmative action' programs that give preference to some groups based on race."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acri.org/pr_7_25_07.html American Civil Rights Institute | Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214072218/http://www.acri.org/pr_7_25_07.html |date=December 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations documents===
Important UN documents addressing discrimination include:
* The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] is a declaration adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 December 1948. It states that:" ''Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html The Universal Declaration of Human Rights&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208080853/http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html |date=December 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD) is a United Nations convention. The Convention commits its members to the elimination of [[racial discrimination]]. The convention was adopted and opened for signature by the United Nations General Assembly on 21 December 1965, and entered into force on 4 January 1969.
* The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW) is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly. Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, it came into force on 3 September 1981.
* The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] is an international human rights instrument treaty of the United Nations. Parties to the Convention are required to promote, protect, and ensure the full enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities and ensure that they enjoy full equality under the law. The text was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 December 2006, and opened for signature on 30 March 2007. Following ratification by the 20th party, it came into force on 3 May 2008.

==Theories==
[[Social theories]] such as [[egalitarianism]] assert that [[social equality]] should prevail. In some societies, including most developed countries, each individual's civil rights include the right to be free from government sponsored social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weblocator.com/attorney/mn/law/concivrig.html#30 |title=Civil rights |accessdate=2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a belief in the capacity to perceive pain or suffering shared by all animals, "abolitionist" or "vegan" egalitarianism maintains that the interests of every individual (regardless its species), warrant [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]] with the interests of humans, and that not doing so is "[[speciesist]]".&lt;ref name="singerethics-sentience"&gt;{{cite book |title=Practical Ethics |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |origyear=1993 |year=1999 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-43971-8 |edition=Second |pages=57–58 |chapter=Equality for Animals? |quote=If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. ... This is why the limit of sentience&amp;nbsp;... is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others. ... Similarly those I would call 'speciesists' give greater weight to their own species when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of other species.|title-link=Practical Ethics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labeling theory===
Discrimination, in [[labeling theory]], takes form as mental categorization of minorities and the use of [[stereotype]]. This theory describes difference as deviance from the norm, which results in internal devaluation and [[social stigma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Slattery| first=M. | year=2002 | title=Key Ideas in Sociology | publisher=Nelson Thornes| isbn=978-0-7487-6565-2 | pages=134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be seen as discrimination. It is started by describing a "natural" social order. It is distinguished between the fundamental principle of fascism and social democracy.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} The [[Nazis]] in 1930s-era Germany and the pre-1990 [[Apartheid]] government of South Africa used racially discriminatory agendas for their political ends. This practice continues with some present day governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adam|first1=Heribert|title=Anti-Semitism and Anti-Black Racism: Nazi Germany and Apartheid South Africa|journal=Telos|date=1 July 1996|volume=1996|issue=108|pages=25–46|doi=10.3817/0696108025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game theory===
Economist [[Yanis Varoufakis]] (2013) argues that "discrimination based on utterly arbitrary characteristics
evolves quickly and systematically in the experimental laboratory", and that neither classical [[game theory]] nor [[neoclassical economics]] can explain this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 11: Evolving domination in the laboratory

|title=Economic Indeterminacy: A personal encounter with the economists' peculiar nemesis
|series=Routledge Frontiers of Political Economy
|isbn=978-0415668491
|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Varoufakis and Shaun Hargreaves-Heap (2002) ran an experiment where volunteers played a computer-mediated, multiround [[hawk-dove game]] (HD game).  At the start of each session, each participant was assigned a color at random, either red or blue.  At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent.  Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players' behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a [[Nash equilibrium]] where players of one color (the "advantaged" color) [[pure strategy|consistently]] played the aggressive "hawk" strategy against players of the other, "disadvantaged" color, who played the acquiescent "dove" strategy against the advantaged color.  Players of both colors used a [[mixed strategy]] when playing against players assigned the same color as their own.

The experimenters then added a [[prisoners' dilemma|cooperation]] option to the game, and found that disadvantaged players usually cooperated with each other, while advantaged players usually did not.  They state that while the equilibria reached in the original HD game are predicted by [[evolutionary game theory]], game theory does not explain the emergence of cooperation in the disadvantaged group.  Citing earlier psychological work of [[Matthew Rabin]], they hypothesize that a norm of differing entitlements emerges across the two groups, and that this norm could define a "fairness" equilibrium within the disadvantaged group.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[The Economic Journal]]

==State vs. free market==

It is debated as to whether or not [[market (economics)|markets]] discourage discrimination brought about by the state. One argument is that since discrimination restricts access to customers and incurs additional expense, market logic will punish discrimination. Opposition by companies to "Jim Crow" segregation laws is an example of this.&lt;ref name=roback&gt;Jennifer Roback, "The Political Economy of Segregation: The Case of Segregated Streetcars." Journal of Economic History 56, no. 4 (December 1986): 893–917.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative argument is that markets don't necessarily undermine discrimination, as it is argued that if discrimination is profitable by catering to the "tastes" of individuals (which is the point of the market), then the market will not punish discrimination. It is argued that microeconomic analysis of discrimination uses unusual methods to determine its effects (using explicit treatment of production functions) and that the very existence of discrimination in employment (defined as wages which differ from marginal product of the discriminated employees) in the long run contradicts claims that the market will function well and punish discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Toikka, The Welfare Implications of Becker’s Discrimination Coefficient, 13 J. ECON. THEORY 472, 472 (1976);  Glen G. Cain, The Economic Analysis of Labor Market Discrimination: A Survey, in 1 HANDBOOK OF LABOR ECONOMICS 693, 774 (Orley Ashenfelter &amp; Richard Layard eds., 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For review of the literature in regard to the last two points see [http://www.glima.info/pdf/Employment-Discrimination-Paper-final.pdf Menahem Pasternak, Employment Discrimination: Some Economic Definitions, Critique and Legal Implications, 33 N.
