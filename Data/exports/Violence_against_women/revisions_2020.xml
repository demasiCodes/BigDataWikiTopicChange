VAW has a very long history, though the incidents and intensity of such violence have varied over time and even today vary between societies. Such violence is often seen as a mechanism for the subjugation of women, whether in society in general or in an [[interpersonal relationship]]. Such violence may arise from a sense of [[entitlement]], [[Superior (hierarchy)|superiority]], [[misogyny]] or similar attitudes in the perpetrator or his violent nature, especially against women.

The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women" and "violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm |title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kofi Annan]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], declared in a 2006 report posted on the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) website:&lt;blockquote&gt;Violence against women and girls is a problem of [[pandemic]] proportions.

==Types of violence==
Violence against women can fit into several broad categories. These include violence carried out by individuals as well as states. Some of the forms of violence perpetrated by individuals are: [[rape]], [[domestic violence]], [[sexual harassment]], [[acid throwing]], [[reproductive coercion]], [[female infanticide]], [[sex selective abortion|prenatal sex selection]], [[obstetric violence]], [[Online Gender-Based Violence|online gender-based violence]] and [[mob violence]]; as well as harmful customary or traditional practices such as [[honor killings]], [[dowry death|dowry violence]], [[female genital mutilation]], [[marriage by abduction]] and [[forced marriage]]. There are forms of violence which may be perpetrated or condoned by the government, such as [[war rape]]; [[sexual violence]] and [[sexual slavery]] during conflict; [[forced sterilization]]; [[forced abortion]]; violence by the police and authoritative personnel; [[stoning]] and [[flogging]]. Many forms of VAW, such as [[trafficking in women]] and [[forced prostitution]] are often perpetrated by organized criminal networks.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last = Prügl | first = Elisabeth (Director) | title = Violence Against Women. Gender and International Affairs Class 2013. Lecture conducted from The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies (IHEID) | location = Geneva, Switzerland | date = 25 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Histrorically, there have been forms of organized WAV, such as the [[Witch trials in the early modern period]] or the [[sexual slavery]] of the [[Comfort women]].

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in its research on VAW, has analyzed and categorized the different forms of VAW occurring through all stages of life from before birth to old age.&lt;ref name="WHO_VAW"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Violence against women: Definition and scope of the problem, 1, 1-3 | url =https://www.who.int/gender/violence/v4.pdf | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | date = July 1997 | access-date = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been a trend of approaching VAW at an international level through means such as conventions or, in the [[European Union]], through [[Directive (European Union)|directive]]s (such as the directive against [[sexual harassment]], and the directive against [[human trafficking]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF| date = September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF|title= Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JH |work=Official Journal of the European Union |accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A number of international instruments that aim to eliminate violence against women and domestic violence have been enacted by various international bodies. These generally start with a definition of what such violence is, with a view to combating such practices. The Istanbul Convention ([[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]]) of the [[Council of Europe]] describes VAW "as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women" and defines VAW as "all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.&lt;ref name="COE 210"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/210 |title=Details of Treaty No.210: Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] makes recommendations relating to VAW,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |title=General recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/recomm.htm#recom1 |website=www.un.org |accessdate=2015-05-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510132556/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/recomm.htm#recom1 |archivedate=10 May 2015}}, General Recommendations 12 and 19&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] mentions VAW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=12 July 1993 |url=http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=459d17822&amp;toid=459b17a82&amp;docid=3ae6b39ec&amp;skip=O |title=Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action |publisher=UN General Assembly |accessdate=3 April 2016}}, paragraph 18&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1993 [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution on the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] was the first international instrument to explicitly define VAW and elaborate on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/global-norms-and-standards |title=What We Do: Ending Violence against Women: Global Norms and Standards |publisher=UN Women |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions of VAW are set out in the 1994 ''Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html |title=Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment And Eradication of Violence Against Women "Convention of Belem Do Para" |publisher=Organization of American States |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 2003 [[Maputo Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/files/instruments/women-protocol/achpr_instr_proto_women_eng.pdf |title=Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa |publisher=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the term ''gender-based violence'' refers to "any acts or threats of acts intended to hurt or make women suffer physically, sexually or psychologically, and which affect women because they are women or affect women disproportionately".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Richters | first = J.M. Annemiek | title = Women, culture and violence: a development, health and human rights issue | publisher = Women and Autonomy Centre (VENA), Leiden University | location = Leiden, The Netherlands | year = 1994 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KvbtAAAAMAAJ | oclc = 905570045 | isbn = 9789072631374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of gender-based violence is most often "used interchangeably with violence against women",&lt;ref name="Krantz"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krantz | first1 = Gunilla | last2 = Garcia-Moreno | first2 = Claudia | title = Violence against women | journal = [[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]] | volume = 59 | issue = 10 | pages = 818&amp;ndash;821 | publisher = [[BMJ Group]] | doi = 10.1136/jech.2004.022756 | jstor = 25570854 | pmid = 16166351 | pmc = 1732916 | date = October 2005 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some articles on VAW reiterate these conceptions by stating that men are the main perpetrators of this violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sen | first = Purna | title = Development practice and violence against women | journal = Gender &amp; Development | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 7&amp;ndash;16 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] and [[Oxfam]] | doi = 10.1080/741922827 | pmid = 12294415 | jstor = 4030497 | date = November 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the definition stated by the 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women also supported the notion that violence is rooted in the inequality between men and women when the term violence is used together with the term 'gender-based.'&lt;ref name="Krantz"/&gt;

In ''Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence'', the Council of Europe stipulated that VAW "includes, but is not limited to, the following":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=30 April 2002 |url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383|title=Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence |publisher=Council of Europe Committee of Ministers |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:a. violence occurring in the family or domestic unit, including, ''inter alia'', physical and mental aggression, emotional and psychological abuse, rape and sexual abuse, incest, rape between spouses, regular or occasional partners and cohabitants, crimes committed in the name of honour, female genital and sexual mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, such as forced marriages;

:b. violence occurring within the general community, including, ''inter alia'', rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in institutions or elsewhere trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation and economic exploitation and sex tourism;

:c. violence perpetrated or condoned by the state or its officials;

:d. violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict, in particular the taking of hostages, forced displacement, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and economic exploitation.

These definitions of VAW as being gender-based are seen by some to be unsatisfactory and problematic. These definitions are conceptualized in an understanding of society as patriarchal, signifying unequal relations between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ertürk | first = Yakin | title = Towards a post-patriarchal gender order: confronting the universality and the particularity of violence against women | journal = Sociologisk Forskning | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 61&amp;ndash;70 | publisher = Sveriges Sociologförbund [Swedish Sociological Association] | jstor = 20853687 | date = 2009 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of such definitions argue that the definitions disregard violence against men and that the term ''[[gender]]'', as used in ''gender based violence'', only refers to women. Other critics argue that employing the term ''gender'' in this particular way may introduce notions of inferiority and subordination for femininity and superiority for masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Visaria | first = Leela | title = Violence against women: a field study | journal = [[Economic and Political Weekly]] | volume = 35 | issue = 20 | pages = 1742&amp;ndash;1751 | publisher = Sameeksha Trust, Mumbai, India | jstor = 4409296 | date = 13 May 2000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Michau | first = Lori | title = Approaching old problems in new ways: community mobilisation as a primary prevention strategy to combat violence against women | journal = Gender &amp; Development | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 95&amp;ndash;109 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] and [[Oxfam]] | doi = 10.1080/13552070601179144 | jstor = 20461184 | date = March 2007 | s2cid = 73218820 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no widely accepted current definition that covers all the dimensions of gender-based violence rather than the one for women that tends to reproduce the concept of binary oppositions: masculinity versus femininity.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. 2013"/&gt;

The history of violence against women remains vague in scientific literature. This is in part because many kinds of violence against women (specifically rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence) are under-reported, often due to societal norms, taboos, stigma, and the sensitive nature of the subject.&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watts | first1 = Charlotte | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Cathy | title = Violence against women: global scope and magnitude | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9313 | pages = 1232&amp;ndash;1237 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | pmid = 11955557 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08221-1 | date = 6 April 2002 | s2cid = 38436965 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely recognized that even today, a lack of reliable and continuous data is an obstacle to forming a clear picture of violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women"&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations |title=In-depth study on all forms of violence against women.

Although the history of violence against women is difficult to track, it is clear that much of the violence was accepted, condoned and even legally sanctioned.&lt;ref name="Film script"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ireland|first=Patricia | title=No Safe Place: Violence Against Women (script) |url=https://www.pbs.org/kued/nosafeplace/script/script.html|publisher=[[PBS]] documentary |date =1996|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include that Roman law gave men the right to chastise their wives, even to the point of death,&lt;ref name="Roman Law"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Stedman | first = Berne | title = Right of husband to chastise wife | journal = [[Virginia Law Review|The Virginia Law Register]] | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 241&amp;ndash;248 | publisher = [[University of Virginia School of Law]] | doi = 10.2307/1106112 | jstor = 1106112 | date = August 1917 | ref = harv }} Also available at [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/valrgn3&amp;div=35&amp;id=&amp;page= HeinOnline].

The history of violence against women is closely related to the historical view of women as property and a gender role of subservience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Toren | first = Christina | chapter = Transforming love: representing Fijian hierarchy | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=KGXezlZnjF8C&amp;pg=PA36 | editor-last1 = Harvey | editor-first1 = Penelope | editor-last2= Gow | editor-first2 = Peter  | title = Sex and violence: issues in representation and experience | pages = 18&amp;ndash;39 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780415057349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations of [[patriarchy]] and an overall world system or status quo in which gender inequalities exist and are perpetuated are cited to explain the scope and history of violence against women.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993) states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations | title = Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women | id = A/RES/48/104 | url = https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm | publisher = United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UNFPA | author-link = United Nations Population Fund | title = Addressing gender-based violence: advancing human rights | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141021001255/http://www.unfpa.org/rights/violence.htm | archive-date = 21 October 2014 | url = http://www.unfpa.org/rights/violence.htm | publisher = [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN, "there is no region of the world, no country and no culture in which women's freedom from violence has been secured."&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; Several forms of violence are more prevalent in certain parts of the world, often in [[developing countries]]. For example, [[dowry death|dowry violence]] and [[bride burning]] is associated with [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Nepal]]. [[Acid throwing]] is also associated with these countries, as well as in [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Cambodia]]. [[Honor killing]] is associated with the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]]. [[Female genital mutilation]] is found mostly in [[Africa]], and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and some other parts of Asia. [[Marriage by abduction]] is found in [[Ethiopia]], [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]. Abuse related to payment of [[bride price]] (such as violence, trafficking and forced marriage) is linked to parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania.

Certain regions are no longer associated with a specific form of violence, but such violence was common until quite recently in those places; this is true of honor-based crimes in Southern/Mediterranean Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirti | first1 = Anand | last2 = Kumar | first2 = Prateek | last3 = Yadav | first3 = Rachana | title = The face of honour based crimes: global concerns and solutions | journal = International Journal of Criminal Justice Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 343&amp;ndash;357 | publisher = South Asian Society of Criminology &amp; Victimology (SASCV) | date = 2011 | url = http://www.sascv.org/ijcjs/pdfs/kirtietalicjs2011i&amp;iind.pdf | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[Italy]], before 1981, the Criminal Code provided for mitigating circumstances in case of a killing of a woman or her sexual partner for reasons related to honor, providing for a reduced sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barazzetti | first1 = Donatella | last2 = Garreffa | first2 = Franca | last3 = Marsico | first3 = Rosaria | title = Daphne Project "Proposing new indicators: measuring violence's effects, GVEI (Gender Violence Effects Indicators)" | url = http://www.surt.org/gvei/docs/national_report_italy.pdf | publisher = Centre Women’s Studies "Milly Villa", [[University of Calabria]] | location = Rende, Italy | date = July 2007 | quote = Before 1981, Art. 587 read: He who causes the death of a spouse, daughter, or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the offence to his honour or that of his family will be sentenced to three to seven years. The same sentence shall apply to whom, in the above circumstances, causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse, daughter, or sister.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invoking culture to explain particular forms of violence against women risks appearing to legitimize them. There is also debate and controversy about the ways in which cultural traditions, local customs and social expectations, as well as various interpretations of religion, interact with abusive practices.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Narayan | first = Uma | chapter = Cross‐cultural connections, border‐crossings, and "Death by Culture": thinking about dowry-murders in India and domestic‐violence murders in the United States | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=lzQ49LnmL_cC&amp;pg=PA81 | editor-last = Narayan | editor-first = Uma | title = Dislocating cultures: identities, traditions, and Third-World feminism | pages = 81&amp;ndash;118 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415914192 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, cultural justifications for certain violent acts against women are asserted by some states and social groups within many countries claiming to defend their traditions. These justifications are questionable precisely because the defenses are generally voiced by political leaders or traditional authorities, not by those actually affected.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; The need for sensitivity and respect of culture is an element that cannot be ignored either; thus a sensitive debate has ensued and is ongoing.

There has also been a history of recognizing the harmful effects of this violence. In the 1870s, courts in the United States stopped recognizing the common-law principle that a husband had the right to "physically chastise an errant wife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Calvert | first = Robert | chapter = Criminal and civil liability in husband-wife assaults | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=fCpHAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Steinmetz | editor-first1 = Suzanne | editor-last2 = Straus | editor-first2 = Murray A. | author-link2 = Murray A.

Jackson [1891]. 1 Q.B. 671&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Corporal punishment | title = Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition | edition = 11th | year = 1911 | title-link = Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th and 21st centuries, and in particular since the 1990s, there has been increased activity on both the national and international levels to research, raise awareness and advocate for the prevention of all kinds of violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; Most often, violence against women has been framed as a health issue, and also as a violation of human rights. A study in 2002 estimated that at least one in five women in the world had been physically or sexually abused by a man sometime in their lives, and "gender-based violence accounts for as much death and ill-health in women aged 15–44 years as cancer, and is a greater cause of ill-health than malaria and traffic accidents combined."&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt;

Certain characteristics of violence against women have emerged from the research. For example, acts of violence against women are often not unique episodes, but are ongoing over time. More often than not, the violence is perpetrated by someone the woman knows, not by a stranger.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt; The research seems to provide convincing evidence that violence against women is a severe and pervasive problem the world over, with devastating effects on the health and well-being of women and children.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;

===Milestones===
Some of the most important milestones on the international level for the prevention of violence against women include:

*The 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), which recognizes violence as a part of discrimination against women in recommendations 12 and 19.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global norms and standards: Ending violence against women|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/global-norms-and-standards|publisher=[[UN Women]]|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1993 [[World Conference on Human Rights]], which recognized violence against women as a human rights violation, and which contributed to the following UN declaration.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards" /&gt;
*The 1993 UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] was the first international instrument explicitly defining and addressing violence against women. This document specifically refers to the historically forever-present nature of gender inequalities in understanding violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt; (Include current 2nd paragraph here). This Declaration, as well as the World Conference of the same year, is often viewed as a "turning point" at which the consideration of violence against women by the international community began to be taken much more seriously, and after which more countries mobilized around this problem.&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Venis | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Horton | first2 = Richard | title = Violence against women: a global burden | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9313 | page = 1172 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | pmid = 11955533 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08251-X | date = 6 April 2002 | s2cid = 41832376 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO Multicountry Study"&gt;{{cite book | last = Garcia-Moreno | first = Claudia | title = WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women: initial results on prevalence, health outcomes and women's responses | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2005 | url = https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/violence/24159358X/en/ | isbn = 9789241593588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]], linking violence against women to reproductive health and rights, and also providing recommendations to governments on how to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt;
*In 1996, the [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) declared violence a major public health issue, and included in the subtypes recognized were intimate partner violence and sexual violence, two kinds of violence often perpetrated as violence against women. This was followed by a WHO report in 2002 (see below).&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Krug | first1 = Etienne G. | last2 = Dahlberg | first2 = Linda L. | last3 = Mercy | first3 = James A. | last4 = Zwi | first4 = Anthony B. | last5 = Lozano | first5 = Rafael | title = World report on violence and health | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2002 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=db9OHpk-TksC | isbn = 9789241545617 }}

*In 1999, the UN adopted the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] and designated 25 November as the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt; 
*In 2002, as a follow-up of the WHA declaration in 1996 of violence as a major public health issue, the [[World Health Organization]] published the first World Report on Violence and Health, which addressed many types of violence and their effect on public health, including forms of violence affecting women particularly strongly. The report specifically noted the sharp rise in civil society organizations and activities directed at responding to gender-based violence against women from the 1970s to the 1990s.&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health" /&gt; 
*In 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] published its "Multi-country study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women", a study of women's health and [[domestic violence]] by surveying over 24,000 women in 10 countries from all regions of the world, which assessed the prevalence and extent of violence against women, particularly violence by intimate partners, and linked this with health outcomes to women as well as documenting strategies and services that women use to cope with intimate-partner violence.&lt;ref name="WHO Multicountry Study" /&gt;

*Also in 2013, the [[UN General Assembly]] passed its first resolution calling for the protection of [[human rights defender|defenders]] of women's human rights.&lt;ref name="Norway Post"&gt;{{cite news | last = NRK |title=Protection of women human rights defenders | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131213142536/http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/news/latest-news/29260-protection-of-women-human-rights-defenders | archive-date = 13 December 2013 |url=http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/news/latest-news/29260-protection-of-women-human-rights-defenders |work=The Norway Post |date=30 November 2013 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution urges states to put in place gender-specific laws and policies for the protection of women's [[human rights defender]]s and to ensure that defenders themselves are involved in the design and implementation of these measures, and calls on states to protect women's human rights defenders from reprisals for cooperating with the UN and to ensure their unhindered access to and communication with international human rights bodies and mechanisms.&lt;ref name="awid.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-adopts-landmark-resolution-on-Protecting-Women-Human-Rights-Defenders |title=UN adopts landmark resolution on Protecting Women Human Rights Defenders |publisher=[[Association for Women's Rights in Development]] (AWID) |date=28 November 2013 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819203819/http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-adopts-landmark-resolution-on-Protecting-Women-Human-Rights-Defenders |archivedate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, on the national level, individual countries have also organized efforts (legally, politically, socially) to prevent, reduce and punish violence against women. As a particular case study, here are some developments since the 1960s in the United States to oppose and treat violence against women:&lt;ref name="USDOJ-History of VAWA"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Violence Against Women (OVM)|title=The History of the Violence Against Women Act|url=http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/history-vawa.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=2 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017204719/http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/history-vawa.pdf|archivedate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1967: One of the country's first domestic violence shelters opened in Maine.
*1972: The country's first rape help hotline opened in Washington, D.C.
*1978: Two national coalitions, the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault and the [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]], were formed, to raise awareness of these two forms of violence against women.
*1984: The U.S. Attorney General created the Department of Justice Task Force on Family Violence, to address ways in which the criminal justice system and community response to domestic violence should be improved.
*1994: Passage of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] or VAWA, legislation included in the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] of 1994, sponsored by then-Senator Joseph Biden, which required a strengthened community response to crimes of domestic violence and sexual assault, strengthened federal penalties for repeat sex offenders and strengthened legislative protection of victims, among many other provisions.
*2000: President Clinton signed into law the VAWA of 2000, further strengthening federal laws, and emphasizing assistance of immigrant victims, elderly victims, victims with disabilities, and victims of dating violence.
*2006: President Bush signed into law the VAWA of 2006, with an emphasis on programs to address violence against youth victims, and establishing programs for Engaging Men and Youth, and Culturally and Linguistically Specific Services.
*2007: The National Teen Dating Abuse Hotline opened.
*2009: President Obama declared April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
*2013: President Obama signed into law the VAWA of 2015, which granted Native American tribes the ability to prosecute non-Native offenders, and regulated reports of sexual assault on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kohlman | first = Cindy | title = Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) New Reporting Requirements Effective July 1, 2015 – Are You Ready? | url = https://www.inceptia.org | publisher = Inceptia Institute | date = 9 June 2015 }}

Other countries have also enacted comparable legislative, political and social instruments to address violence against women. Experts in the international community generally believe, however, that solely enacting punitive legislation for prevention and punishment of violence against women is not sufficient to address the problem. For example, although much stricter laws on violence against women have been passed in Bangladesh, violence against women is still rising.&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt; Instead, it is thought that wide societal changes to address gender inequalities and women's empowerment will be the way to reduce violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigeria-Female Hawkers-Interventions"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fawole | first1 = Olufunmilayo I. | last2 = Ajuwon | first2 = Ademola J. | last3 = Osungbade | first3 = Kayode O. | last4 = Faweya | first4 = Olufemi C. | title = Interventions for violence prevention among young female hawkers in motor parks in South-Western Nigeria: a review of effectiveness | journal = African Journal of Reproductive Health [La Revue Africaine de la Santé Reproductive] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 71&amp;ndash;82 | publisher = Women's Health and Action Research Centre (WHARC) | doi = 10.2307/3583347 | jstor = 3583347 | date = April 2003 | ref = harv | hdl = 1807/2587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO VAM Factsheet"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Violence against women|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]| date = 1 September 2011|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on society==
According to an article in the [[Health and Human Rights (journal)|Health and Human Rights Journal]],&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt; regardless of many years of advocacy and involvement of many feminist activist organizations, the issue of violence against women still "remains one of the most pervasive forms of human rights violations worldwide".&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}} The violence against women can occur in both public and private spheres of life and at any time of their life span. Violence against women often keeps women from wholly contributing to social, economic, and political development of their communities.&lt;ref name="Fried"/&gt; Many women are terrified by these threats of violence and this essentially influences their lives so that they are impeded to exercise their human rights; for instance, they fear contributing to the development of their communities socially, economically and politically. Apart from that, the causes that trigger VAW or gender-based violence can go beyond just the issue of gender and into the issues of age, class, culture, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and specific geographical area of their origins.

Importantly, other than the issue of social divisions, violence can also extend into the realm of health issues and become a direct concern of the public health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Colarossi | first = Lisa | title = A response to Danis &amp; Lockhart: What guides social work knowledge about violence against women? | journal = Journal of Social Work Education | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 147&amp;ndash;159 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] on behalf of the [[Council on Social Work Education]] (CSWE) |doi=10.5175/JSWE.2005.200400418 | jstor = 23044038 | date = Winter 2005 | s2cid = 143655449 | ref = harv}}

Women who have HIV/AIDS infection are also among the targets of the violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}} The [[World Health Organization]] reports that violence against women puts an undue burden on health care services, as women who have suffered violence are more likely to need health services and at higher cost, compared to women who have not suffered violence.&lt;ref name="WHO VAM Factsheet" /&gt; Another statement that confirms an understanding of VAW as being a significant health issue is apparent in the recommendation adopted by the Council of Europe, violence against women in private sphere, at home or [[domestic violence]], is the main reason of "death and disability" among the women who encountered violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}}

In addition, several studies have shown a link between poor treatment of women and international violence. These studies show that one of the best predictors of inter- and intranational violence is the maltreatment of women in the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Maffly | first = Brian | title = BYU study links women's safety, nation's peace | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100202080318/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11967564 | archive-date = 2 February 2010 | url = http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11967564 | work = [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date = 21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Strearmer | first1 = Matthew | last2 = Emmett | first2 = Chad F.|url=http://www.womanstats.org/images/StearmerEmmettAPSA07.pdf |title=The great divide: Revealing differences in the Islamic world regarding the status of women and its impact on international peace |publisher= [[WomanStats Project]] |date=2007 |accessdate=6 August 2014}} Paper prepared for presentation at the annual meeting of the [[American Political Science Association]], Chicago, Illinois, 29 August – 1 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typology ==
Violence against women may be classified according to different approaches.

=== WHO's life cycle typology ===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has developed a typology of violence against women based on their cultural life cycles. 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Phase''' || '''Type of violence'''
|- style="vertical-align: top;"
| Pre-birth || Sex-selective abortion; effects of battering during pregnancy on birth outcomes
|- style="vertical-align: top;"
| Infancy || Female infanticide; physical, sexual and psychological abuse
|- style="vertical-align: top;"
| Girlhood || Child marriage; female genital mutilation; physical, sexual and psychological abuse; incest; child prostitution and pornography
|- style="vertical-align: top;"
| Adolescence and adulthood || Dating and courtship violence (e.g. acid throwing and date rape); economically coerced sex (e.g. school girls having sex with "sugar daddies" in return for school fees); incest; sexual abuse in the workplace; rape; sexual harassment; forced prostitution and pornography; trafficking in women; partner violence; marital rape; dowry abuse and murders; partner homicide; psychological abuse; abuse of women with disabilities; forced pregnancy
|- style="vertical-align: top;"
| Elderly || Forced "suicide" or homicide of widows for economic reasons; sexual, physical and psychological abuse&lt;ref name="WHO_VAW" /&gt;
|}

Significant progress towards the protection of women from violence has been made on international level as a product of collective effort of lobbying by many women's rights movements; international organizations to civil society groups. As a result, worldwide governments and international as well as civil society organizations actively work to combat violence against women through a variety of programs. Among the major achievements of the women's rights movements against violence on girls and women, the landmark accomplishments are the "[[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]]" that implies "political will towards addressing VAW " and the legal binding agreement, "the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]])".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rosche | first1 = Daniela | last2 = Dawe | first2 = Alexandra | title = Oxfam Briefing Note: Ending violence against women the case for a comprehensive international action plan | page = 2 | publisher = [[Oxfam|Oxfam GB]] | location = Oxford | year = 2013 | url = http://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/bn-ending-violence-against-women-action-plan-220213-en.pdf | isbn = 9781780772639 | access-date = 2 December 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170925212852/https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/bn-ending-violence-against-women-action-plan-220213-en.pdf | archive-date = 25 September 2017 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the UN General Assembly resolution also designated 25 November as [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations | title = International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women | url = https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/news/vawd.html | website = un.org | publisher = [[United Nations]] |date= 17 December 1999|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Lancet'''s over time typology ===
[[File:Typology of Violence Against Women over Time.png|thumbnail|300 px|A diagram of typology of violence against women over time, as conceived by authors [[Charlotte Watts]] &amp; Cathy Zimmerman.]]

A typology similar to the WHO's from an article on violence against women published in the academic journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' shows the different types of violence perpetrated against women according to what time period in a women's life the violence takes place.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt; However, it also classifies the types of violence according to the perpetrator. One important point to note is that more of the types of violence inflicted on women are perpetrated by someone the woman knows, either a family member or intimate partner, rather than a stranger.

=== Council of Europe's nine forms of violence ===
The Gender Equality Commission of the [[Council of Europe]] identifies nine forms of violence against women based on subject and context rather than life cycle or time period:&lt;ref name="Hagemann-White"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://rm.coe.int/16805915e9 |title=Analytical study of the results of the 4th round of monitoring the implementation of Recommendation Rec(2002)5 on the protection of women against violence in Council of Europe member states |author=Carol Hagemann-White |pages=7, 8, 11 |publisher=Council of Europe Equality Division |date=February 2014 |accessdate=5 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://edoc.coe.int/en/fundamental-freedoms/5949-state-of-democracy-human-rights-and-the-rule-of-law-in-europe.html |title=State of democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Europe (2014) |author=[[Thorbjørn Jagland]] |work=Report by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe |page=48 |publisher=Council of Europe |date=May 2014 |accessdate=5 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is especially the case in cultures where female [[virginity]] is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]].

===Marital rape===
{{Main|Marital rape|domestic violence}}
Marital or spousal rape was once widely condoned or ignored by law, and is now widely considered an unacceptable violence against women and repudiated by international conventions and increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative. The criminalization of spousal rape is recent, having occurred during the past few decades. Traditional understanding and views of [[marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexuality]], [[gender roles]] and [[self determination]] have started to be challenged in most Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s, which has led to the subsequent criminalization of marital rape during the following decades. With a few notable exceptions, it was during the past 30 years when most laws against marital rape have been enacted. Some countries in Scandinavia and in the former Communist Bloc of Europe made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but most Western countries criminalized it only in the 1980s and 1990s. In many parts of the world the laws against marital rape are very new, having been enacted in the 2000s.

In [[Canada]], marital rape was made illegal in 1983, when several legal changes were made, including changing the rape statute to ''sexual assault'', and making the laws gender neutral.&lt;ref name=grady&gt;{{cite book | last = Grady | first = William | title = Crime in Canadian context: debates and controversies | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Don Mills, Ontario | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780195433784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brennan | first1 = Shannon| last2 = Taylor-Butts | first2 = Andrea | title = Sexual assault in Canada, 2004 | publisher = Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics | location = Ottawa | year = 2008 |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85f0033m/85f0033m2008019-eng.pdf | isbn = 9781100111636 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = SIECCAN |title=Sexual assault in Canada: what do we know? |publisher=The Sex Information and Education Council of Canada (SIECCAN) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140722071229/http://sexualityandu.ca/uploads/files/SexualAssault-OCT2011-ENG.pdf | archive-date = 22 July 2014 |url=http://sexualityandu.ca/uploads/files/SexualAssault-OCT2011-ENG.pdf | date = October 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] spousal rape was outlawed in 1990.&lt;ref name="Temkin86"&gt;{{cite book | last = Temkin | first = Jennifer | chapter = Defining and redefining rape | editor-last = Temkin | editor-first = Jennifer | title = Rape and the legal process | page = 86 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2002 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780198763543 }}

In [[England and Wales]], marital rape was made illegal in 1991. The views of Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century jurist, published in ''The History of the Pleas of the Crown'' (1736), stated that a husband cannot be guilty of the rape of his wife because the wife "hath given up herself in this kind to her husband, which she cannot retract"; in England and Wales this would remain law for more than 250 years, until it was abolished by the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]], in the case of ''R v R'' in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html |title=R v R [1991&amp;#93; UKHL 12 (23 October 1991) |publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Netherlands]] marital rape was also made illegal in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zeegers | first = Nicolle | title = What epistemology would serve criminal law best in finding the truth about rape? | journal = Law and Method | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 60&amp;ndash;71 | date = January 2012 | ref = harv | doi = 10.5553/ReM/221225082012002001005 }} [https://www.bjutijdschriften.nl/tijdschrift/lawandmethod/2012/1/ReM_2212-2508_2012_002_001_005.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the last Western countries to criminalize marital rape was [[Germany]], in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Kieler|first=Marita|date=2003|title=Tatbestandsprobleme der sexuellen Nötigung, Vergewaltigung sowie des sexuellen Mißbrauchs widerstandsunfähiger Personen|publisher=[[University of Osnabrück]] via Tenea|url=http://www.jurawelt.com/dissertationen/werke/8821|oclc=758907108}} [http://www.jurawelt.com/sunrise/media/mediafiles/13792/tenea_juraweltbd52_kieler.pdf Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020164804/http://www.jurawelt.com/sunrise/media/mediafiles/13792/tenea_juraweltbd52_kieler.pdf |date=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between some religions ([[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]) and marital rape is controversial. The [[Bible]] at 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 explains that one has a "conjugal duty" to have sexual relations with one's spouse (in sharp opposition to [[sex outside marriage]], which is considered a [[sin]]) and states, "The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does.

Women are more likely to be [[victimized]] by someone that they are intimate with, commonly called "[[intimate partner violence]]" (IPV).

International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937, but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 – making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995. Only in 1997 did victims of sexual offences and domestic violence in Finland become entitled to government-funded counselling and support services for the duration of their court cases. | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diagnosis planning====
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] planning and research committees for the forthcoming [[DSM-5]] (2013) have canvassed a series of new [[Relational disorder]]s, which include ''Marital Conflict Disorder Without Violence'' or ''Marital Abuse Disorder (Marital Conflict Disorder With Violence)''.&lt;ref name="Personality"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = First | first1 = Michael B. | last2 = Bell | first2 = Carl C. | last3 = Cuthbert | first3 = Bruce | last4 = Krystal | first4 = John H. | last5 = Malison | first5 = Robert | last6 = Offord | first6 = David R. | last7 = Reiss | first7 = David | last8 = Shea | first8 = M. Tracie | last9 = Widger | first9 = Tom | last10 = Wisner | first10 = Katherine L. | chapter = Personality disorders and relational disorders: a research agenda for addressing crucial gaps in DSM | chapterurl = https://contextualscience.org/system/files/Kupfer,2002.pdf | editor-last1 = Kupfer | editor-first1 = David J. | editor-last2 = First | editor-first2 = Michael B. | editor-last3 = Regier | editor-first3 = Darrel A. | title = A research agenda for DSM-V | publisher = [[American Psychiatric Association]] | location = Washington, D.C. | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780890422922 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|164, 166}} Couples with marital disorders sometimes come to clinical attention because the couple recognize long-standing dissatisfaction with their marriage and come to the [[clinician]] on their own initiative or are referred by an astute health care professional. Secondly, there is serious violence in the marriage that is -"usually the husband battering the wife".&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|163}} In these cases the emergency room or a legal authority often is the first to notify the [[clinician]]. Most importantly, marital violence "is a major risk factor for serious injury and even death and women in violent marriages are at much greater risk of being seriously injured or killed ([[National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women]] 2000)".&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}} The authors of this study add, "There is current considerable controversy over whether male-to-female marital violence is best regarded as a reflection of male [[psychopathology]] and control or whether there is an empirical base and clinical utility for conceptualizing these patterns as relational."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}}

Recommendations for clinicians making a diagnosis of ''Marital Relational Disorder'' should include the assessment of actual or "potential" male violence as regularly as they assess the potential for suicide in depressed patients. Further, "clinicians should not relax their vigilance after a battered wife leaves her husband, because some data suggest that the period immediately following a marital separation is the period of greatest risk for the women. Many men will [[stalking|stalk]] and [[battery (crime)|batter]] their wives in an effort to get them to return or punish them for leaving. Initial assessments of the potential for violence in a marriage can be supplemented by standardized interviews and questionnaires, which have been reliable and valid aids in exploring marital violence more systematically."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|166}}
 
The authors conclude with what they call "very recent information"&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}} on the course of violent marriages, which suggests that "over time a husband's battering may abate somewhat, but perhaps because he has successfully [[intimidate]]d his wife. The risk of violence remains strong in a marriage in which it has been a feature in the past. Thus, treatment is essential here; the clinician cannot just wait and watch."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}} The most urgent clinical priority is the protection of the wife because she is the one most frequently at risk, and clinicians must be aware that supporting assertiveness by a battered wife may lead to more beatings or even death.&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}}

====Honor killings====
[[Honor killings]] are a common form of violence against women in certain parts of the world. Honor killings are perpetrated by family members (usually husbands, fathers, uncles or brothers) against women in the family who are believed to have placed dishonor to the family. The death of the dishonorable woman is believed to restore honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/womenscourage/communitybasedsolutions/the_role_of_community_in_combating_honor_killings.html|title=the role of community in combating honor killings|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; These killings are a traditional practice,{{where?|date=January 2019}} believed to have originated from tribal customs where an allegation against a woman can be enough to defile a family's reputation.&lt;ref name="BBC_ethics"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Ethics guide – Honour crimes | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml | work = [[BBC]] | access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Definition of honor killing | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honor%20killing | website = merriam-webster.com | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are killed for reasons such as refusing to enter an [[arranged marriage]], being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, attempting to leave a marriage, having sex outside marriage, becoming the victim of rape, dressing in ways that are deemed inappropriate.&lt;ref name="BBC_ethics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | last = Harter | first = Pascale | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895 | work= BBC News | title=Libya rape victims 'face honour killings' | date=14 June 2011| access-date = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dowry violence====
[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]

The custom of [[dowry]], which is common in South Asia, especially in India, is the trigger of many forms of violence against women. [[Bride burning]] is a form of violence against women in which a bride is killed at home by her husband or husband's family due to his dissatisfaction over the dowry provided by her family. [[Dowry death]] refers to the phenomenon of women and girls being killed or committing [[suicide]] due to disputes regarding dowry. Dowry violence is common in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. In India, in 2011 alone, the National Crime Records Bureau reported 8,618 dowry deaths, while unofficial figures suggest the numbers to be at least three times higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Confronting dowry-related violence in India: women at the center of justice | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | publisher = [[UN Women]] | date = 24 December 2012 | access-date = 18 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage in which one or both of the parties is married against their will. Forced marriages are common in South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The customs of [[bride price]] and [[dowry]], that exist in many parts of the world, contribute to this practice. A forced marriage is also often the result of a dispute between families, where the dispute is 'resolved' by giving a female from one family to the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

The custom of [[bride kidnapping]] continues to exist in some Central Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and the Caucasus, or parts of Africa, especially Ethiopia. A girl or a woman is abducted by the would be groom, who is often helped by his friends. The victim is often raped by the would be groom, after which he may try to negotiate a bride price with the village elders to legitimize the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''News articles'':

Forced and child marriages are practiced by some inhabitants in Tanzania. Girls are sold by their families to older men for financial benefits and often girls are married off as soon as they hit puberty, which can be as young as seven years old.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/10/29/tanzania-child-marriage-harms-girls|title=Tanzania: Child Marriage Harms Girls|date=2014-10-29|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the older men, these young brides act as symbols of masculinity and accomplishment.

====Force-feeding====
In some countries, notably Mauritania, young girls are forcibly fattened to prepare them for marriage, because obesity is seen as desirable. This practice of [[force-feeding]] is known as ''[[leblouh]]'' or ''gavage''.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

''Son preference'' is a custom rooted in gender inequality that is prevalent in many countries and found across religions and classes.&lt;ref name="StopVAW_son"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Son preference | url =http://www.stopvaw.org/harmful_practices_son_preference | website = stopvaw.org | publisher = Stop Violence Against Women | date = June 2010 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although preference for a specific sex of the child may be common in an abstract way in many cultures, when such preference is so strong as to lead to the rejection of the child or to violence against the mother, this crosses the line into [[domestic violence]], [[child abuse]] and violence against women. Such forms of son preference are common especially in parts of [[South Asia]], [[East Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]. Manifestations of such practices include [[sex selective abortion]], [[female infanticide]], [[child abandonment|female child abandonment]], as well as favoring sons with regard to allocating of family resources.&lt;ref name="StopVAW_son" /&gt;

[[China]] and [[India]] have a very strong son preference. In China, the [[one child policy]] was largely responsible for an unbalanced sex ratio. Sex-selective abortion, as well as rejection of girl children is common. [[The Dying Rooms]] is a 1995 [[television]] [[documentary film]] about Chinese state orphanages, which documented how parents abandoned their newborn girls into [[orphanages]], where the staff would leave the children in rooms to die of thirst, or starvation.
Another manifestation of son preference is the violence inflicted against mothers who give birth to girls.&lt;ref&gt;''News articles'':

Forced pregnancy is the practice of forcing a woman or girl to become [[pregnant]], often as part of a [[forced marriage]], including by means of [[bride kidnapping]], through rape (including [[marital rape]], [[war rape]] and [[genocidal rape]]) or as part of a program of breeding [[slave]]s (see [[Slave breeding in the United States]]). In the 20th century, state mandated forced marriage with the aim of increasing the population was practiced by some authoritarian governments, notably during the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]], which systematically forced people into marriages ordering them to have children, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Natalae | title = Memorandum: Charging forced marriage as a crime against humanity | url = http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf | publisher = Documentation Center of Cambodia | date = 22 September 2010 | access-date = 8 October 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171020153617/http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf | archive-date = 20 October 2017 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced pregnancy is strongly connected to the custom of [[bride price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women's fears and men's anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;66 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] on behalf of the [[Population Council]] | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.1999.00054.x| pmid = 10216896 | hdl = 2027.42/73927 }} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the discourse on reproductive rights, the issue of [[abortion]] is often debated. [[Abortion law]] falls within the jurisdiction of each country, although [[forced abortion]] is prohibited by international law. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits forced abortion and [[forced sterilization]] (Article 39).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CoE | author-link = Council of Europe | title = Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence | url = https://rm.coe.int/168046031c | publisher = [[Council of Europe]] | date = 12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of ''forced continuation of pregnancy'' (i.e. denying a woman safe and legal abortion) is also seen by some organizations as a violation of women's rights, although there are no binding international obligations on this issue. However, the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women's sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states, "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, ''criminalisation of abortion'', ''denial or delay of safe abortion and post abortion care'', ''forced continuation of pregnancy'', abuse and mistreatment of women and girls seeking sexual and reproductive health information, goods and services, are forms of gender based violence that, depending on the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | author-link = Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women#Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | title = General recommendation No. 35 on gender-based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19 | url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf | publisher = [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) | id = CEDAW/C/GC/35 | date = 14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mob violence===
There have been [[Hassi Messaoud mob attacks against women|mob attacks against single women]] in [[Hassi Messaoud]], [[Algeria]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="Amnesty"&gt;{{cite web|title=Algerian authorities must investigate and stop attacks against women |url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/22931/ |publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=13 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903140432/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/22931/|archivedate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 95 women had been attacked by mobs of men, with at least six fatalities, although the authorities denied this.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grozelle|first=Renee S.|date=2015|title=Mob Violence Against Women in Algeria: A Historical Case Analysis|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1016/mob-violence-against-women-in-algeria-a-historical-case-analysis|journal=Inquiries Journal|language=en|volume=7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, similar mob attacks against women were continuing in [[Hassi Messaoud]] and elsewhere in Algeria, notably [[M'Sila, Algeria|M'sila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop renewed attacks on women |url=http://www.wluml.org/node/7420|publisher=Women Living Under Muslim Laws|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algerian authorities must investigate and stop attacks against women|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/22931/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=13 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903140432/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/22931/|archivedate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mob violence against women in the country dates back decades, and increased specifically after gaining independence from France in 1962, which was followed by return to stricter religious norms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], "some women have been sexually abused" and were targeted "not just because they are women, but because they are living alone and are economically independent".&lt;ref name="Amnesty" /&gt;

=== Dating abuse ===
{{See|Dating abuse|Teen dating violence}}
Dating abuse or dating violence is the perpetration of coercion, intimidation or assault in the context of [[dating]] or [[courtship]]. It is also when one partner tries to maintain [[abusive power and control]]. Dating violence is defined by the CDC as "the physical, sexual, psychological, or emotional violence within a dating relationship, including stalking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Intimate partner violence: teen dating violence | url = https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html | website = cdc.gov | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = 2016 | accessdate = 21 October 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181230230859/https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/intimatepartnerviolence/teen_dating_violence.html | archive-date = 30 December 2018 | url-status = dead }} [https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/teen-dating-violence-factsheet-a.pdf Fact sheet pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries it is common for older men to engage in "compensated dating" with underage girls. Such relationships are called [[enjo kōsai]] in Japan, and are also common in Asian countries such as Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong. The WHO condemned "economically coerced sex (e.g. school girls having sex with "sugar daddies" ([[Sugar baby]] in return for school fees)" as a form of violence against women.&lt;ref name="WHO_VAW" /&gt;

===Sexual violence on college campuses===
{{See|Campus sexual assault}}
Sexual violence on college campuses is considered a major problem in the United States. According to the conclusion of a major Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study: "The CSA Study data suggest women at universities are at considerable risk for experiencing sexual assault."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Krebs | first1 = Christopher P. | last2 =Lindquist | first2 = Christine H. | last3 =Warner | first3 = Tara D. | last4 =Fisher | first4 = Bonnie S. | last5 =Martin | first5 = Sandra L. | title = Campus sexual assault (CSA) study: final report | publisher = [[RTI International]] | url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=243011 | date = October 2007 }} {{NCJ|243011}} [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence on campus has been researched in other countries too, such as Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeKeseredy | first1 = Walter | last2 = Kelly|  first2 = Katharine | title = The incidence and prevalence of woman abuse in Canadian university and college dating relationships | journal = [[Canadian Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 137&amp;ndash;159 | publisher = [[University of Alberta]] | jstor = 3341255 | doi = 10.2307/3341255 | date = 1993 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = NUS | author-link = National Union of Students (United Kingdom) |title=Hidden Marks: A study of women student's experiences of harassment, stalking, violence, and sexual assault | url = http://www.nus.org.uk/Global/NUS_hidden_marks_report_2nd_edition_web.pdf | publisher = [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] | location = London, UK | date = 2011| edition = 2nd|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gavey | authorlink=Nicola Gavey|first = Nicola | title = Sexual victimization prevalence among New Zealand university students | journal = [[Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 464&amp;ndash;466 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-006X.59.3.464 | date = June 1991 | pmid=2071732| ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restrictions on freedom of movement===
Women are, in many parts of the world, severely restricted in their [[freedom of movement]].
Freedom of movement is an essential right, recognized by international instruments, including Article 15 (4) of [[CEDAW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  UN General Assembly | author-link =  UN General Assembly | title = The convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (CEDAW) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140326154350/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm | archive-date = 26 March 2014 | url = http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm | publisher = [[UN Women|UN Women, Division for the Advancement of Women]] | date = 1979 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in some countries, women are not legally allowed to leave home without a [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|male guardian]] (male relative or husband).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lee | first = Dave | title = Saudi Arabian woman challenges male guardianship laws | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13932287 | work = [[BBC World Service]] | date = 29 June 2011 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in countries where there are no laws against women traveling alone, there are strong social norms, such as [[purdah]] - a religious and social practice of female [[seclusion]] prevalent especially among some [[Muslim]] and [[Hindu]] communities in [[South Asia]]. Many countries have laws on what type of clothing women may or may not wear in public (see [[Hijab by country]]). Women in some cultures are forced into [[social isolation]] during their [[menstruation|menstrual period]]s. In parts of Nepal for instance, they are forced to live in sheds, are forbidden to touch men or even to enter the courtyard of their own homes, and are barred from consuming milk, yogurt, butter, meat, and various other foods, for fear they will contaminate those goods. (see [[Chhaupadi]]). Women have died during this period because of starvation, bad weather, or bites by snakes.&lt;ref&gt;''Articles'':

===Denial of medical care===
[[File:Maternal mortality rate worldwide.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Maternal Mortality Rate]] worldwide, as defined by the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management, excluding accidental or incidental causes.&lt;ref name=CIA2010&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html?countryName=Australia&amp;countryCode=as&amp;regionCode=aus&amp;rank=156#as Country Comparison: Maternal Mortality Rate] in [[:en:The World Factbook|The CIA World Factbook]]. Date of Information: 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Women in many parts of the world are often denied medical care. Denial of access to 
health assistance, along with denial of access to other services, is a form of socioeconomic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womensrefugeecommission.org/images/zdocs/gl_sgbv03_01.pdf|title=chapter1: Overview of sexual and gender-based violence|access-date=2020-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the WHO, "Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-06-2017-joint-united-nations-statement-on-ending-discrimination-in-health-care-settings|title=Joint United Nations statement on ending discrimination in health care settings|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women may be denied medical care for numerous reasons, including lack of necessary [[freedom of movement]] allowing women to leave home so they can go to a medical facility, lack of financial resources, the need (in law or in practice) for a male relative or husband to consent to the medical care of the woman. A common consequence of denial of women's medical care is [[maternal mortality]]. Globally, there are more than 300.000 cases of maternal mortality yearly, with 99% of all maternal deaths occurring in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|title=Maternal mortality|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denial of medical care often occurs with regard to reproductive and sexual health. Sometimes women themselves avoid the medical system for fear of being reported to the police or facing family violence due to having [[premarital sex]] or being the victims of [[sexual violence]]. In some parts of Latin America, with very strict anti-abortion laws, pregnant women avoid the medical system due to fear of being investigated by the authorities if they have a miscarriage, or a stillbirth, or other problems with the pregnancy. Prosecuting such women is quite common in places such as [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/el-salvador-rape-survivor-sentenced-to-30-years-in-jail-under-extreme-anti-abortion-law/|title=El Salvador: Rape survivor sentenced to 30 years in jail under extreme anti-abortion law|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-32491838/el-salvador-women-jailed-for-miscarriages|title=Jailed for a miscarriage|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Prügl, E.

In developed societies, women face medial discrimination in that female health concerns are often dismissed or downplayed, especially when reproductive health is concerned. Research since 2001 has consistently shown that medical practitioners have been "dismissing, misdiagnosing, or cluelessly shrugging" at women seeking medical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/08/womens-health-care-gaslighting/567149/|title=The Doctor Doesn't Listen to Her.

Denial of medical care for women has led to the exclusion of female needs in medical research and diagnosis, leading to a male bias in medical trials at the expense of women's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jackson|first=Gabrielle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/13/the-female-problem-male-bias-in-medical-trials|title=The female problem: how male bias in medical trials ruined women's health|date=2019-11-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-24|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stalking===
{{Main|Stalking}}
Stalking is unwanted or obsessive attention by an individual or group toward another person, often manifested through persistent [[harassment]], [[intimidation]], or following/monitoring of the victim. Stalking is often understood as "course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/stalking-resource-center/stalking-information |title=Stalking information |website =victimsofcrime.org | publisher = Stalking Resource Center |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although stalkers are frequently portrayed as being strangers, they are most often known people, such as former or current partners, friends, colleagues or acquaintances.

===Sexual harassment===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is abusive, uninvited and unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature, typically in the work/studying place, which may include [[intimidation]], [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature, or the inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors. It can be verbal or physical, and it is often perpetrated by a person in a position of authority against a subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/whatissh.pdf |title=What is sexual harassment |publisher=[[UN Women]] |accessdate=3 April 2016}}

The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] defines sexual harassment as: "any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment".&lt;ref name="COE 210" /&gt;

A widow is a woman whose spouse has died. In some parts of the world, widows are subjected to serious forms of abuse, often fueled by traditional practices such as [[widow inheritance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Owen | first = Margaret | chapter = Human rights, equality and legal protection | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Bh8sGfNKUTEC&amp;pg=PA181 | editor-last = Owen | editor-first = Margaret | title = A world of widows | publisher = Zed Books | location = London Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey | year = 1996 | isbn = 9781856494205 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/worldofwidows0000owen }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifice of widows (such as [[Sati (practice)|sati]]) has been prevalent historically in various cultures (especially in [[India]]).

This often requires having sex with someone. Those refusing to be cleansed risk getting beaten by superstitious villagers, who may also harm the woman's children. It is argued that this notion arose from the idea that if a husband dies, the woman may have performed witchcraft against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-10-23/these-kenyan-widows-are-fighting-against-sexual-cleansing|title=These Kenyan widows are fighting against sexual 'cleansing'|publisher=pri.org|accessdate=7 November 2018|date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widow inheritance (also known as bride inheritance) is a cultural and social practice whereby a widow is required to marry a male relative of her late husband, often his brother.

[[Witch trials in the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries) were common in Europe and in the European colonies in North America.

War rapes are rapes committed by soldiers, other combatants or civilians during armed conflict or war, or during military occupation, distinguished from sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service. It also covers the situation where women are forced into prostitution or [[sexual slavery]] by an occupying power. During World War II the Japanese military established brothels filled with "[[comfort women]]", girls and women who were forced into sexual slavery for soldiers, exploiting women for the purpose of creating access and entitlement for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benedict |first=Helen |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/ |title=Why soldiers rape |work=[[In These Times]] |date=14 August 2008 | access-date = 10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Morris-Suzuki | first = Tessa | title = Japan's 'Comfort Women': It's time for the truth (in the ordinary, everyday sense of the word) | journal = Japan Focus (The Asia-Pacific Journal) | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | date = 1 March 2007 | url = http://www.japanfocus.org/-Tessa-Morris_Suzuki/2373  |accessdate=4 August 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape was committed during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] by members of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistani military]] and the [[militia]]s that supported them. Over a period of nine months, hundreds of thousands of women were raped. [[Susan Brownmiller]], in her report on the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|atrocities]], said that girls from the age of eight to grandmothers of seventy-five suffered attacks. {{See also|Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War}}

Rape used as a weapon of war was practiced during the [[Bosnian War]] where rape was used as a highly systematized instrument of war by Serb armed forces predominantly targeting women and girls of the Bosniak ethnic group for physical and moral destruction. Estimates of the number of women raped during the war range from 50,000 to 60,000; as of 2010 only 12 cases have been prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UNSC | author-link = United Nations Security Council | title = Report of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia Since 1991 | id = A/52/375{{spaces|2}}S/1997/729 | publisher = [[United Nations Security Council]] |url=http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/AnnualReports/annual_report_1997_en.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804004034/http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/AnnualReports/annual_report_1997_en.pdf |archivedate=4 August 2012 | date = 18 September 1997 | access-date = 10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{See also|Rape during the Bosnian War}}

====Stoning and flogging====
[[Stoning]], or lapidation, refers to a form of [[capital punishment]] whereby an organized group throws stones at an individual until the person dies. Stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws of several countries, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria, as punishment for [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Batha | first = Emma | title = FACTBOX: Stoning - where does it happen? | work = [[Thomson Reuters Foundation News]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160125051613/http://news.trust.org//item/20130927165059-w9g0i | archive-date = 25 January 2016 | url = http://news.trust.org//item/20130927165059-w9g0i | publisher = [[Thomson Reuters Foundation]] | date = 29 September 2013 | access-date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flogging]] or flagellation is the act of methodically beating or whipping the human body. It is a judicial punishment in various countries for specific crimes, including [[sex outside marriage]]. These punishments employed for sexual relations outside marriage, apart from constituting a form of violence in themselves, can also deter victims of [[sexual violence]] from reporting the crime, because the victims may themselves be punished (if they cannot prove their case, if they are deemed to have been in the company of an unrelated male, or if they were unmarried and not virgins at the time of the rape).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lang | first = Olivia | title=Maldives girl to get 100 lashes for pre-marital sex | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21595814 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=26 February 2013 | access-date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jamali |first=Hasan |url=http://www.today.com/id/15836746/ns/today-today_news/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/#.UolafidedO6 |title=Rape case brings Saudi laws into focus |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |publisher=[[NBC]] |accessdate=19 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JdMstMvl?url=http://www.today.com/id/15836746/ns/today-today_news/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/ |archivedate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female genital mutilation (FGM) is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons".&lt;ref name="WHO FGM"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Female genital mutilation (factsheet) |url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date= June 2000 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 125 million women and girls in Africa and the Middle East have experienced FGM.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;{{cite book | last = UNICEF | author-link = UNICEF | title = Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical overview and exploration of the dynamics of change | url = http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf | publisher = [[UNICEF]] | date = 22 July 2013 | accessdate = 18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO states: "The procedure has no health benefits for girls and women" and "Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn deaths" and "FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women."&lt;ref name="WHO FGM"/&gt; According to a UNICEF report, the top rates for FGM are in Somalia (with 98 percent of women affected), Guinea (96 percent), Djibouti (93 percent), Egypt (91 percent), Eritrea (89 percent), Mali (89 percent), Sierra Leone (88 percent), Sudan (88 percent), Gambia (76 percent), Burkina Faso (76 percent), Ethiopia (74 percent), Mauritania (69 percent), Liberia (66 percent), and Guinea-Bissau (50 percent).&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

FGM is linked to cultural rites and customs, including traditional practices. It continues to take place in different communities of Africa and the Middle East, including in places where it is banned by national legislation. FGM is defined as a "harmful traditional practice"&lt;ref name="Shell-Duncan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shell-Duncan | first = Bettina | title = From health to human rights: female genital cutting and the politics of intervention | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 110 | issue = 2 | pages = 225&amp;ndash;236 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2008.00028.x | date = June 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance to the Inter-African Committee.

Due to globalization and immigration, FGM is spreading beyond the borders of Africa and Middle East, to countries such as Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, the U.S., and UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | chapter = Judging other cultures: the case of genital mutilation | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=43U8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 | editor-last = Nussbaum | editor-first = Martha | editor-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = Sex &amp; social justice | pages = [https://archive.org/details/sexsocialjustice00nuss/page/120 120–121] | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0195110326 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/sexsocialjustice00nuss/page/120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although FGM is today associated with developing countries, this practice was common until the 1970s in parts of the Western world, too. FGM was considered a standard medical procedure in the United States for most of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Webber|first1=Sara|last2=Schonfeld|first2=Toby L.|date=2003-06-27|title=Cutting History, Cutting Culture: Female Circumcision in the United States|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/44151|journal=The American Journal of Bioethics|volume=3|issue=2|pages=65–66|issn=1536-0075|doi=10.1162/152651603766436324|pmid=12859826|s2cid=13202773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians performed surgeries of varying invasiveness to treat a number of diagnoses, including [[hysteria]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[nymphomania]], and [[frigidity]]. The medicalization of FGM in the United States allowed these practices to continue until the second part of the 20th century, with some procedures covered by [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance]] until 1977.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LViJROLfEGQC&amp;q=Watson,+M.+(2005).+Female+circumcision+from+Africa+to+the+Americas:+Slavery+to+the+present.+The+Social+Sciences+Journal,+42,+421-437.&amp;pg=PA106|title=Women in Developing Countries: A Reference Handbook|last=Kinnear|first=Karen L.|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598844252|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits female genital mutilation (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence | url = https://rm.coe.int/168046031c | date = 12 April 2011 | access-date = 8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, in [[Africa]], FGM has been legally banned in Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

There exist several approaches that were set up by international health organizations and civil societies (for example, [[Tostan]]) aimed at eliminating the practice of FGM in implemented countries: 
# FGM as a Health issue (also known as health risks approach)
# FGM as a Human Rights issue (also known as Human Rights-based approach)

Some scholars suggests that, when dealing with FGM, it is necessary to take lessons from history, particularly 19th-century campaign against [[foot-binding]] in China,&lt;ref name="Kwame Appiah"&gt;{{cite news | last = Appiah | first = Kwame Anthony | author-link = Kwame Anthony Appiah | title = The art of social change | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24FOB-Footbinding-t.html?pagewanted=all |work = [[The New York Times]] |date=22 October 2010 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was successful.

Breast ironing (also known as "breast flattening") is the practice of pounding and massaging the [[breasts]] of a [[puberty|pubescent girl]], using hard or heated objects, in an attempt to try to make them stop developing or disappear.&lt;ref name="west-info.eu"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tapscott | first = Rebecca |title=Understanding breast "ironing": a study of the methods, motivations, and outcomes of breast flattening practices in Cameroon | url = http://www.west-info.eu/files/Feinstein-International-Center-Understanding-breast-ironing-a-study-of-the-methods-motivations-and-outcomes-of-breast-flattening-practices-in-Cameroon-20121.pdf | publisher= [[Feinstein International Center]] | date = 14 May 2012 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Cameroon Breast Ironing"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sa'ah | first = Randy Joe | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5107360.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Cameroon girls battle 'breast ironing' | date=23 June 2006 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Penney | first = Joe | url= https://widerimage.reuters.com/story/breast-ironing | work=[[Reuters]] |title= Breast ironing | date = 27 January 2014 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically carried out by the girl's mother, with the aim of making the girl less sexually attractive to men and boys, so that her virginity is preserved and she can continue her education.&lt;ref name="BBC Cameroon Breast Ironing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ngunshi | first = Rosaline | title = Breast ironing: a harmful practice that has been silenced for too long | url = http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cedaw/docs/cedaw_crc_contributions/GenderEmpowermentandDevelopment.pdf | publisher = Gender Empowerment and Development (GeED) | date = 24 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is practiced primarily in [[Cameroon]], but has also been reported across other areas in [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref name="west-info.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Cameroon Breast Ironing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Mabuse | first = Nkepile | title = Breast ironing tradition targeted in Cameroon | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/07/27/cameroon.breast.ironing/ | work=[[CNN]] | date=28 July 2011 | access-date = 25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breast ironing is very painful and can have negative emotional and physical consequences.&lt;ref name="west-info.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Cameroon Breast Ironing"/&gt;

===Obstetric violence===
{{See|Abuse during childbirth}}
"Obstetric violence" refers to acts categorized as physically or psychologically violent in the context of labor and birth. In most developed and many [[developing countries]], birth takes place in an increasingly medicalized environment; with numerous surgical interventions that the pregnant woman can sometimes be coerced into accepting, or which are done without her consent, or which are unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Habek | first1 = Dubravko | last2 = Vuković Bobić | first2 = Mirna | last3 = Hrgović | first3 = Zlatko | title = Possible feto-maternal clinical risk of the Kristeller's expression | journal = [[Central European Journal of Medicine]] | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 3&amp;ndash;6 | publisher = [[Walter de Gruyter]] | doi = 10.2478/s11536-008-0008-z | date = 2008 | s2cid = 57243548 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO_Normal"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Care in normal birth: a practical guide | id = WHO/FRH/MSM/96.24 | url =https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/who_frh_msm_9624/en/ | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | series = Safe Motherhood Practical Guide | year = 1996 | access-date = 2 December 2013}} [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/63167/1/WHO_FRH_MSM_96.24.pdf Pdf.]

Many such practices originate in patriarchal ideologies. The WHO stated: "in normal birth, there should be a valid reason to interfere with the natural process. The aim of care is to achieve a healthy mother and child with the least possible level of intervention compatible with safety."&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dobbeleir | first1 = Julie M.L.C.L. | last2 = Landuyt | first2 = Koenraad Van | last3 = Monstrey | first3 = Stan J. | title = Aesthetic surgery of the female genitalia | journal = Seminars in Plastic Surgery | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 130&amp;ndash;141 | publisher = [[Thieme Medical Publishers|Thieme]] | doi = 10.1055/s-0031-1281482 | pmc = 3312147 | date = May 2011 | ref = harv | pmid=22547970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO_Normal" /&gt;

=== Violence against indigenous women ===
Indigenous women around the world are often targets of sexual assault or physical violence. Many indigenous communities are rural, with few resources and little help from the government or non-state actors. These groups also often have strained relationships with law enforcement, making prosecution difficult. Many indigenous societies also find themselves at the center of land disputes between nations and ethnic groups, often resulting in these communities bearing the brunt of national and ethnic conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = UNFPA | last2 = UNICEF | last3 = UN Women | last4 = ILO | last5 = Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children (OSRSG/VAC) | author-link1 = United Nations Population Fund | author-link2 = UNICEF | author-link3 = UN Women | author-link4 = International Labour Organization | title = Breaking the silence on violence against indigenous girls, adolescents and young women: A call to action based on an overview of existing evidence from Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America | url = http://www.unfpa.org/resources/breaking-silence-violence-against-indigenous-girls-adolescents-and-young-women | publisher = [[UNICEF]] | date = May 2013 | access-date = 10 May 2016}} [https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/resource-pdf/VAIWG_FINAL.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence against indigenous women is often perpetrated by the state, such as in [[Peru]], in the 1990s. President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a [[forced sterilization]] program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 24 July 2002 | access-date = 30 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented 28 July 1995.

[[Guatemala]]n indigenous women have also faced extensive violence. Throughout over three decades of conflict, [[Maya civilization|Maya]] women and girls have continued to be targeted. The Commission for Historical Clarification found that 88% of women affected by state-sponsored rape and sexual violence against women were indigenous.

The concept of white dominion over indigenous women's bodies has been rooted in American history since the beginning of colonization. The theory of manifest destiny went beyond simple land extension and into the belief that European settlers had the right to exploit Native women's bodies as a method of taming and "humanizing" them.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roe | first1 = Bubar | last2 = Jumper Thurman | first2 = Pamela | title = Violence against native women | journal = Social Justice | volume = 31 | issue = 4 [98] | pages = 70&amp;ndash;86 | jstor = 29768276 | date = 2004 | url = http://www.socialjusticejournal.org/?product=roe-bubar-and-pamela-jumper-thurman-2 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ramirez | first = Renya | title = Healing, violence, and Native American women | journal = Social Justice | volume = 31 | issue = 4 [98] | pages = 103&amp;ndash;116 | jstor = 29768279 | date = 2004 | url = http://www.socialjusticejournal.org/?product=renya-ramirez-2 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canada]] has an extensive problem with violence against indigenous women, by both indigenous men and non-aboriginals.

Many of the issues facing indigenous women in Canada have been addressed via the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women (MMIW) initiatives. Thousands of Native Canadian women have gone missing or been killed in the past 30 years, with little representation or attention from the government. Efforts to make the Canadian public aware of these women's disappearances have mostly been led by Aboriginal communities, who often reached across provinces to support one another. In 2015, prime minister [[Stephen Harper]] commented that the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women was "not high on our radar",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Full Text of Peter Mansbridge's interview with Stephen Harper | work = [[CBC News]] | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2105-full-text-of-peter-mansbridge-s-interview-with-stephen-harper-1.3218399 | date = 7 September 2015 | access-date = 9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting outrage in already frustrated indigenous communities. A few months later, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] launched an official inquiry into the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women.

In the United States, Native American women are more than twice as likely to experience violence than any other demographic.&lt;ref name="Bubar, Roe 2004"/&gt; One in three Native women is sexually assaulted during her life, and 67% of these assaults are perpetrated by non-Natives,&lt;ref name="ncai"&gt;{{cite book |title=Policy Insights - Brief Statistics on Violence Against Native Women |date=2013 |publisher=NCAI Policy Research Center |page=4 |url=http://www.ncai.org/attachments/PolicyPaper_tWAjznFslemhAffZgNGzHUqIWMRPkCDjpFtxeKEUVKjubxfpGYK_Policy%20Insights%20Brief_VAWA_020613.pdf |quote= A previously reported statistic that, "Among [American Indian and Alaska Native] victims of rape or sexual assault, 86 percent described the offender as non‐Indian" is accurate according to Perry’s analysis (2004) in American Indians and Crime: A BJS Statistical Profile, 1992-2002.

===Violence against immigrant and refugee women===
Immigrant and refugee women often face violence, both in the private sphere (by partners and other family members) and in the public sphere (by the police and other authorities). These women are often in a vulnerable position: they do not speak the language of the country they are in, they do not know its laws, and sometimes they are in a legal position where they may be deported if they make contact with the authorities. Women who seek protection from armed conflict in their countries of origin often face more violence while travelling to the destination country or when they arrive there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Freedman | first = Jane | title = Sexual and gender-based violence against refugee women: a hidden aspect of the refugee "crisis" | journal = Reproductive Health Matters | volume = 24 | issue = 47 | pages = 18&amp;ndash;26 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1016/j.rhm.2016.05.003 | pmid = 27578335 | date = 2017 | s2cid = 21202414 | ref = harv | url = https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01441147/file/Sexual%20and%20gender%20based%20violence%20against%20refugee%20women%20a%20hidden%20aspect%20of%20the%20refugee%20crisis.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robbers | first1 = Gianna | last2 = Gunta | first2 = Lazdane | last3 = Dinesh | first3 = Sethi | title = Sexual violence against refugee women on the move to and within Europe | journal = Entre Nous | volume = 84 | pages = 26&amp;ndash;29 | publisher = [[WHO]]/Europe | date = 2016 | url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous/together-for-a-better-sexual-and-reproductive-health.-entre-nous-no-84,-2016 | ref = harv }} [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/319301/Entre-Nous-84-full-book.pdf?ua=1 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport-related===

Sport-related violence against women refers to any physical, sexual, mental acts that are "perpetrated by both male athletes and by male fans or consumers of sport and sporting events, as well as by coaches of female athletes".&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Catherine|title=Violence against women and sport: Literature review|year=2011|publisher=Durham University|location=London|pages=2–5|url=http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/22/violence-against-women-and-sport-a-literature-review-by-dr-catherine-palmer|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106162130/http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/22/violence-against-women-and-sport-a-literature-review-by-dr-catherine-palmer|archivedate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documenting reports and literature suggest that there are obvious connections between contemporary sport and violence against women. Such events as the [[2010 World Cup]], the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] "have highlighted the connections between sports spectatorship and intimate partner violence, and the need for police, authorities and services to be aware of this when planning sporting events".&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer" /&gt;

Sport-related violence can occur in various contexts and places, including homes, pubs, clubs, hotel rooms, the streets.&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer" /&gt;

====Sport-related violence by male college athletes====

Violence against women is a topic of concern in the United States' collegiate athletic community. From the 2010 UVA lacrosse murder, in which a male athlete was charged guilty with second degree murder of his girlfriend, to the 2004 University of Colorado Football Scandal when players were charged with nine alleged sexual assaults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vaughan|first=Kevin|title=Colorado woman seeks justice in alleged sexual assault Read more: Colorado woman seeks justice in alleged sexual assault|url=http://www.denverpost.com/firstinthepost/ci_12557039|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=9 June 2009|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies suggest that athletes are at higher risk for committing sexual assault against women than the average student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brady|first=Jeff|author-link=Jeff Brady (reporter)|title=Scandal Returns to University of Colorado Football|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105381707|work=[[Weekend Edition]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chandler1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandler|first1=Steve B.|last2=Johnson|first2=Dewayne J.|last3=Carroll|first3=Pamela S.|title=Abusive behaviors of college athletes | journal = [[College Student Journal]] | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 638&amp;ndash;645 | publisher = [[University of South Alabama]] | date = 1 December 1999 | ref = harv |oclc=193500507}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that one in three college assaults are committed by athletes.&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mak|first=Stephanie|title=Are athletes more abusive than the rest of the student population?|url=http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/hurj/issue3/spotlight-mak.html|journal=Hopkins Undergraduate Research Journal Online|accessdate=12 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229044851/http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/hurj/issue3/spotlight-mak.html|archivedate=29 February 2012|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys suggest that male student athletes who represent 3.3% of the college population, commit 19% of reported sexual assaults and 35% of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff writer|title=Game stats|publisher=The National Coalition Against Violent Athletes (NCVA)|accessdate=27 December 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117092517/http://www.ncava.org/statistics.html|archivedate=17 November 2016|url=http://www.ncava.org:80/statistics.html}}

====Controversy over contributing factors====

Sociologist Timothy Curry, after conducting an observational analysis of two big time sports' locker room conversations, deduced that the high risk of male student athletes for gender abuse is a result of the team's subculture.&lt;ref name=Curry1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Timothy Jon|title=Fraternal Bonding in the Locker Room: A Profeminist Analysis of Talk About Competition And Women|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|year=1991|volume=8|issue=2|pages=119–135 |url=http://www.umt.edu/sociology/faculty_staff/ellestad/documents/275_Curry1991fraternalbondinginthelockerroom_s10.pdf |accessdate=12 March 2012|doi=10.1123/ssj.8.2.119}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states, "Their locker room talk generally treated women as objects, encouraged sexist attitudes toward women and, in its extreme, promoted rape culture."&lt;ref name=Curry1991/&gt; He proposes that this objectification is a way for the male to reaffirm his heterosexual status and hyper-masculinity. Claims have been made that the atmosphere changes when an outsider (especially women) intrude in the locker room. In the wake of the reporter [[Lisa Olson]] being harassed by a Patriots player in the locker room in 1990, she reflected, "We are taught to think we must have done something wrong and it took me a while to realize I hadn't done anything wrong."&lt;ref name="Disch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Disch|first=Lisa|author2=Kane, Mary Jo |title=When a Looker is Really a Bitch: Lisa Olson, Sport, and the Heterosexual Matrix|journal=Signs|date=Winter 1996|volume=21|issue=2|pages=278–308|jstor=3175065|doi=10.1086/495067|s2cid=145061857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other female sports reporters (college and professional) have claimed that they often brush off the players' comments, which leads to further objectification.&lt;ref name="Disch" /&gt; Other sociologists challenge this claim. Steve Chandler notes that because of their celebrity status on campus, "athletes are more likely to be scrutinized or falsely accused than non-athletes."&lt;ref name="chandler1999"/&gt; Another contender, Stephanie Mak, notes that, "if one considers the 1998 estimates that about three million women were battered and almost one million raped, the proportion of incidences that involve athletes in comparison to the regular population is relatively small."&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1"/&gt;

====Response to violence by male college athletes====

In response to the proposed link between college athletes and gender-based violence, and media coverage holding Universities as responsible for these scandals more universities are requiring athletes to attend workshops that promote awareness. For example, St. John's University holds sexual assault awareness classes in the fall for its incoming student athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsom|first=John|title=Share on emailShare on redditMore Sharing Services Few Colleges Tackle Issue of Athlete Sex Assaults|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-22/news/mn-7249_1_sexual-assault|publisher=Los Angeles Times Online |date=22 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups, such as the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes, have formed to provide support for the victims as their mission statement reads, "The NCAVA works to eliminate off the field violence by athletes through the implementation of prevention methods that recognize and promote the positive leadership potential of athletes within their communities. In order to eliminate violence, the NCAVA is dedicated to empowering individuals affected by athlete violence through comprehensive services including advocacy, education and counseling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.ncava.org/Mission.html|publisher=National Coalition Against Violent Athletes|accessdate=12 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416074831/http://www.ncava.org/Mission.html|archivedate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyberbullying===
[[Cyberbullying]] is a form of intimidation using electronic forms of contact. In the 21st century, cyberbullying has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers in Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Peter K. |last2=Mahdavi |first2=Jess |last3=Carvalho |first3=Manuel |last4=Fisher |first4=Sonja |last5=Russell |first5=Shanette |last6=Tippett |first6=Neil | title = Cyberbullying: its nature and impact in secondary school pupils | journal = [[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 376&amp;ndash;385 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01846.x |pmid=18363945 | date = 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 2015, the [[United Nations Broadband Commission]] released a report that claimed that almost 75% percent of women [[online]] have encountered harassment and threats of violence, otherwise known as [[cyber violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/9/cyber-violence-report-press-release |title=cyber violence report press release |publisher=UN Women |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misogynistic rhetoric is prevalent online, and the public debate over gender-based attacks has increased significantly, leading to calls for policy interventions and better responses by social networks like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Jane |first= Emma Alice | title = 'Back to the kitchen, cunt': speaking the unspeakable about online misogyny  | journal = [[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]] | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 558&amp;ndash;570 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/10304312.2014.924479 | date = 2014 |s2cid= 144492709 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Filipovic |first= Jill | title = Blogging while female: how internet misogyny parallels real-world harassment | journal = [[Yale Journal of Law and Feminism]] | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 295&amp;ndash;303 | publisher = [[Yale Law School]] | date = 2007 | url = http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjlf/vol19/iss1/10/ | ref = harv }} [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1268&amp;context=yjlf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some specialists have argued that gendered online attacks should be given particular attention within the wider category of hate speech.&lt;ref&gt;M.

Abusers quickly identified opportunities online to humiliate their victims, destroy their careers, reputations and relationships, and even drive them to suicide or "trigger so-called 'honor' violence in societies where sex outside of marriage is seen as bringing shame on a family".&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite web |title=Internet Bringing New Forms of Violence Against Women |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/10/28/internet-bringing-new-forms-violence-against-women |website=Human Rights Watch |language=en |date=28 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a poll conducted by Amnesty International in 2018 across 8 countries, 23% of women have experienced online abuse of harassment. These are often sexist or misogynistic in nature and include direct of indirect threats of physical or sexual violence, abuse targeting aspects of their personality and privacy violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Read about violence against women online in 2018 |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/12/rights-today-2018-violence-against-women-online/ |website=www.amnesty.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Human Rights Watch, 90% of those who experienced sexual violence online in 2019 were women and girls.&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt;

===Background and history===
Activism refers to "a doctrine or practice that emphasizes direct vigorous action especially in support of or opposition to one side of a controversial issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/activism |title=Activism (definition) | website = merriam-webster.com |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the activism for violence against women, the objectives are to address and draw public attention on the issues of VAW as well as seek and recommend measures to prevent and eliminate this violence.&lt;ref name="Youngs_368325"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Youngs | first = Gillian | title = Private pain/public peace: women's rights as human rights and Amnesty International's report on violence against women | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs]] | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 1209&amp;ndash;1229 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | doi = 10.1086/368325 | jstor = 10.1086/368325 | date = Summer 2003 | s2cid = 144980514 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholarly articles suggest that the VAW is considered as a violation of human rights&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Htun | first1 = Mala | last2 = Weldon | first2 = S.

In order to better comprehend the anti-violence movements against VAW, there is a need to also understand the generic historical background of [[feminist movements]] in a holistic manner. Talking about the international women's movement, many feminist scholars have categorized these movements into three waves&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kroløkke | first1 = Charlotte | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = Ann Scott | chapter = Three waves of feminism: from suffragettes to grrls | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=IEhqiWR1Rt0C&amp;pg=PA1 | editor-last1 = Kroløkke | editor-first1 = Charlotte | editor-last2 = Sørensen | editor-first2 = Ann Scott | title = Gender communication theories &amp; analyses: from silence to performance | pages = 1&amp;ndash;23 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780761929185 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to their different beliefs, strategies and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rupp | first1 = Leila J. |author1-link=Leila J.

The emergence of the first women's movements, or so called the [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] of feminism, dated back in the years the late 19th Century and early 20th Century in the United States and Europe. During this period, feminist movements developed from the context of industrialization and liberal politics that triggered the rise of feminist groups concerned with gaining equal access and opportunity for women.&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|1}} This wave marks a period of "[[Women's suffrage|suffrage]], independence, rights to nationality, work and [[Gender pay gap|equal pay]]" for women.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last = Prügl | first = Elisabeth (Lecturer) | title = Violence Against Women.

The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] of feminist movements was the series of movements from the period of the late 1960s to early 1970s. It was noted by feminist scholars that this wave could be characterized as a period of [[Women's liberation movement|women's liberation]] and the rise of a branch of feminism known as [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|7–8}} This wave of feminism emerged in the context of the postwar period&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|8}} in society where other mainstream movements also played a large role; for instance, the [[civil rights movements]],&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013" /&gt; which meant to condemn [[capitalism]], [[imperialism]] and the oppression of people based on the notions of [[Racism|race]], ethnicity, [[gender identity]] and [[LGBT social movements|sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|9}} This wave marks a period of equal rights at home and workplace as well as rights to development&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013" /&gt; for the purposes of people of different races, ethnicities, economic statuses and gender identities.

The [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] of feminism is the newest wave of feminism led by young feminists whose understanding and context are of the [[Globalization|globalized]] world order and the technological advances that have come with it. Also, this wave is a transition of the fall communism&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|17}} to more complex issues of new kinds of 'warfare'{{Clarify|reason=What does this mean by "warfare"?  Also, this whole sentence is oddly worded but I don't understand what it's trying to say well enough to rewrite it.|date=November 2018}}, threats and violence. This new wave also "embraces ambiguity"&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|16}} and introduced a feminist approach of '[[intersectionality]]' that includes the issues of race, gender, age, and class.&lt;ref name="Kroløkke&amp;Sørensen" /&gt;{{rp|17}} Other than that, the third wave marks a period of feminism dealing with [[identity politics]], body politics as well as the issues of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lind | first = Amy (Lecturer) | title = Gender and International Affairs 2013: International Feminist Movements | url = http://graduateinstitute.ch/directory?detail=people/faculty/lind | location = Geneva, Switzerland | publisher = Lecture conducted from [[The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] (IHEID) | date = 2 December 2013 | access-date = 29 March 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181113125400/http://graduateinstitute.ch/directory?detail=people%2Ffaculty%2Flind | archive-date = 13 November 2018 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the VAW movement was initiated in the 1970s where some feminist movements started to bring the discussion on the issue of violence into the feminist discourse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eng | first = Phoebe | author-link = Phoebe Eng | title = Stopping the violence against women: the movement from intervention to prevention | url = http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Ms_StoppingVAWTheMovementFromInterventionToPrevention_Aug2005.pdf | page = 2 | publisher = [[Ms. Foundation for Women]] | location = New York | date = August 2005 | series = A Safety Program Report | access-date = 3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that many other groups, on the national as well as international levels, had attempted to push for the betterment of women through lobbying of the state officials and delegates, demanding the conferences on 'gender issues'&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. Dec. 2013" /&gt; and thus made the VAW known to a wider range of population. Therefore, to put this into the theoretical context, VAW can be categorized along with the second and third waves of feminism which share a focus on violence.

VAW activist movements come in many forms, operating at international, national, and local levels&lt;ref name="Youngs_368325" /&gt; and utilizing different approaches based on health and human rights frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Alice M. | title = Sexuality, violence against women, and human rights: women make demands and ladies get protection | journal = [[Health and Human Rights]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 16&amp;ndash;47 | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/4065347 | jstor = 4065347 | date = 2004 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movements stemmed mostly from social movements and groups of women who see the need to create organizations to 'lobby' their governments to establish "sanctuaries, shelters" and provision of services that help protecting these victims, also called "battered women", from acts of violence. The term "battered women" was used in a number of VAW movements and had its root in the early stage of organizing efforts to tackle the problem of violence against women in many regions of the world such as Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin American and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|94}} The activist organizations against VAW, some with and the others without the support of their governments, attempted to develop "innovative efforts" to assist battered women by providing them services such as shelters and centers; drafting and lobbying governments to include the recognition and language of VAW into national legislations and [[international human rights instruments]]; advocating to raise the awareness of people via education and training sessions; forming national, regional as well as international networks to empower the movements; organizing demonstrations and gathering more efforts to end violent acts against women.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|88–89}} In addition, many women's rights activist groups see the issue of violence against women as a central focus of their movements. Many of these groups take a human rights approach as the integral framework of their activism. These VAW movements also employ the idea that "women's rights are human rights", transform the concepts and ideas of human rights, which are mostly reckoned to be "[[Western world|Western]] concepts" and '[[Vernacularization|vernacularize]] them into the concepts that can be understood in their local institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Merry | first = Sally Engle | title = Transnational human rights and local activism: mapping the middle | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 108 | issue = 1 | pages = 38&amp;ndash;51 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1525/aa.2006.108.1.38 | date = March 2006 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}}

=== Levels of activist movements ===

On the local or national level, the VAW movements are diverse and differ in their strategic program of intervention. The strategies used in a number of the movements focus on the individual level with the emphases on individuals, relationships and family. Also, many of them take the 'preventive' as an approach to tackle the issues on the ground by encouraging people to "reexamine their attitudes and beliefs" in order to trigger and create fundamental changes in these "deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors".&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 95–109"/&gt; Despite the fact that these strategies can be life changing, helpful to those who participate and feasible over a long time frame, the effects on societal level seem to be restricted and of minimal effects. In order to achieve the objectives of the movement, many activists and scholars argue that they have to initiate changes in cultural attitudes and norms on a communal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heise | first1 = L. | last2 = Gottemoeller | first2 = M. | title = Ending violence against women | journal = Population Reports | volume = L | issue = 11 | page = 38 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Population and Information Program | url = https://vawnet.org/sites/default/files/assets/files/2016-10/PopulationReports.pdf | date = December 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of activism on the local level can be seen in South Africa. The movements of VAW in this context employ a strategy that is based on the 'prevention' approach, which is applicable on individual and societal levels: in families and communities. This movement encourages the individuals and small populations to rethink their attitudes and beliefs in order to create a possibility to alter these deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors, which lead to the acts of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"/&gt; Another example is the local level movement in East Africa that employs the prevention approach, which is applicable on a communal level. They call this a "raising voices" approach. This approach employs an 'ad hoc' framework that can be used alongside the individual approach where the strategy is to aggravate the status quo issues onto the individuals' and communities' perception and establish a common ground of interests for them to push for the movement, all in a short time period.&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"/&gt; In addition, on the domestic level, there seems to be many 'autonomous movements.'&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt; feminist movements (for VAW) can be understood as "a form of women's mobilization that is devoted to promoting women's status and well-being independently of political parties and other associations that do not have the status of women as their main concern".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

A number of regions of the world have come together to address violence against women. In South America, the Southern Cone Network Against Domestic Violence has worked extensively to address sexual and domestic violence since 1989. The Latin American and Caribbean Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, formed in 1990, includes representation from twenty-one different countries and has been instrumental in increasing the visibility of VAW.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|88}} In September 1999, the Heads of States of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) met and drafted the "Prevention and Eradication of Violence Against Women and Children", a document condemning violence against women and children, and resolved a set of 13 methods of addressing it, reaching into the legal; social, economic, cultural, and political; social service; and education, training, and awareness building sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = SADC| title = The prevention and eradication of violence against women and children | journal = Review of African Political Economy | volume = 26 | issue = 81 | pages = 415&amp;ndash;417 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/03056249908704404 | jstor = 4006468 | date = September 1999 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the transnational or regional level, the anti-violence movements also deploy different strategies based on the specificities of their cultures and beliefs in their particular regions. On this level, the activist movements are known as "transnational feminist networks" or TFNs.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}} The TFNs have a significant effect, like the autonomous movements on the national level, in shaping sets of policies as well pushing for the recognition and inclusion of language of VAW in the United Nations human rights mechanisms: the international human rights agreements.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt; Their activities are ranging from lobbying the policy makers; organizing demonstrations on the local and regional levels; to creating institutional pressure that could push for changes in the international institutional measures.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

On an international level, the movements that advocate for women's rights and against VAW are the mixture of (civil society) actors from domestic and regional levels. The objectives of these VAW movements focus on "creating shared expectations" within the domestic and regional levels as well as "mobilizing numbers of domestic civil society" to create "standards in global civil society".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}} The global women's movement works to transform numbers of international conventions and conferences to "a conference on women's rights" by pushing for a "stronger language and clearer recognition" of the VAW issues. In addition, the United Nations also plays a vital role in promoting and campaigning for the VAW movements on the international level. For instance, in 2008 UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]] initiated and launched a campaign called "[[UNiTE to End Violence against Women]]". This campaign "calls on governments, civil society, women's organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire UN system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls".&lt;ref name="UNiTE_Orange"&gt;{{cite web | last = UNiTE | author-link = UNiTE to End Violence against Women | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131220093826/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action | archive-date = 20 December 2013 |url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action |title=Take action to Orange your day |publisher=[[UN Women]] |date= 2013 | accessdate = 20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this campaign also announces every 25th of the month to be "Orange Day" or "a day to take action to raise awareness and prevent violence against women and girls".&lt;ref name="UNiTE_Orange" /&gt;

In conclusion, each level of activism is intertwined and has the common purpose to end violence against women. Activism on local levels can significantly affect national, transnational, and international levels as well. In a scholarly article on ''Combating Violence Against Women'', the authors illustrated from their research analysis on how the norms of international society can shape and influence policy making on the domestic or national level and vice versa. They argue that there are three mechanisms which have effects on the making of national policies as well as global agreements and conventions: "1) the influence of global treaties and documents such as [[CEDAW]] on women's rights" - on the national policies "2) the influence of regional agreements on VAW (particularly after certain tipping points are reached)" - on both domestic policies and international conventions and "3) regional demonstration effects or pressure for conformity captured as diffusion within regions" - on the international norms and agreements.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

=== Achievements of the VAW movements ===
On the global level:
* The first major document that highlights the recognition of violence against women as a human rights violation: the United Nations [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in Vienna, 1993.&lt;ref name="Brown Thompson 2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown Thompson | first = Karen | chapter = Women's rights are human rights | editor-last1 = Khagram | editor-first1 = Sanjeev | editor-last2 = Riker | editor-first2 = James V. | editor-last3 = Sikkink | editor-first3 = Kathryn | title = Restructuring world politics: transnational social movements, networks, and norms | url = https://archive.org/details/restructuringwor00khag | url-access = limited | pages = [https://archive.org/details/restructuringwor00khag/page/n110 96]&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780816639076 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Elman | first = R.

As before the other human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch did not focus on the issue of VAW and did not consider rape and domestic violence as violations of human rights despite of the fact that they also have agenda on women's rights.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;
* The 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN | author-link = United Nations |title=Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/pdf/BDPfA%20E.pdf |publisher=United Nations | date = 1995 |accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 4th Women Conference, VAW was emphasized and named as a critical concern. Also, the spillover effect was that this push highlighted the need for the development of "new international norms" that have often been used by activists and governments the proposition of legislation that provide other action to redress the acts of violence.&lt;ref name="Brown Thompson 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weldon, S.L 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Fábián | editor-first = Katalin | title = Domestic violence in postcommunist states: local activism, national policies, and global forces | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington, Indiana| year = 2010 | isbn = 9780253222183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subsequently, the push from the global feminist movement also push for the fully incorporation of the VAW issues into the "Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women" or [[CEDAW]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CEDAW | author-link = CEDAW |title=Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/committee.htm |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=31 December 2003 |accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the "original text of [[CEDAW]] in 1979 did not explicitly mention violence against women".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}}

On the regional level:
* ''Americas'': the Inter-American Convention on Violence Against Women, which was formally announced and adopted by the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1994, immediately after the Vienna Conference&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|557}}
* ''Europe'': The [[European Union]] (EU)'s initiatives to combat violence against women after the 1990s: the 1997 resolution calling for a zero tolerance: specifically on UN human rights instruments of [[CEDAW]] and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action|Vienna Declaration]].
** The [[Council of Europe]] also developed "a series of initiatives" related to the issue of VAW: "the 2000 resolution on trafficking, the 2003 resolution on domestic violence, and the 2004 resolution on honor crimes" as well as promoted "the 2002 recommendation on the protection of women against violence and established its monitoring framework".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|557}}
* ''Africa'': 
** There emerged a series of regional meetings and agreements, which was triggered by the UN processes on the international level such as Third World Conference on Women in Nairobi, 1985; the 1993 Kampala Prep Com; the 1994 Africa-wide UN women's conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tripp | first1 = Aili Mari | author1-link = Aili M.

==Access to justice for female victims of violence==

===International and regional instruments===
Efforts to fight violence against women can take many forms and access to justice, or lack thereof, for such violence varies greatly depending on the justice system. International and regional instruments are increasingly used as the basis for national legislation and policies to eradicate violence against women.

The Inter-American Convention to Prevent, Eradicate and Punish Violence Against Women – also known as the Belém do Parà Convention, for instance, has been applied by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in its first case of domestic violence to condemn Brazil in the Maria da Penha case. This led the Brazilian government to enact in 2006 the Maria da Penha Law, the country's first law against domestic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spieler | first = Paula | title = The Maria da Penha Case and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights: contributions to the debate on domestic violence against women in Brazil | journal = [[Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 121&amp;ndash;143 | publisher = [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law]] | date = Winter 2011 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/445824 | ref = harv | doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121| s2cid = 154383871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also, for instance, the South Asian Agreement on Regional Cooperation's (SAARC) Protocol to End Trafficking in Women and Children.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

===Examples of measures put in place===
As violence is often committed by a family member, women first started by lobbying their governments to set up shelters for domestic violence survivors. The Julia Burgos Protected House established in Puerto Rico in 1979 was the first shelter in Latin America and the Caribbean for "battered women". In 2003, 18 out of the 20 countries in the region had legislation on domestic or family violence, and 11 countries addressed sexual violence in their laws. Legislative measures to protect victims can include restraining orders, which can be found in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Venezuela, Turkey, the United States and many western European countries for instance.

Courts can also be allowed by law (Germany, 2001) to order the perpetrator to leave the home so that victims do not have to seek shelter. Countries were urged to repeal discriminatory legislation by 2005 following the review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2000. Egypt, for instance, abolished a law that exempted men from rape charges when marrying their victims. However, the goal of antiviolence legislation is often to keep the families together, regardless of the best interests of women, which perpetuate domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

Innovative measures have been pioneered in a number of countries to end violence against women. In Brazil and Jordan, [[women's police stations]] have been introduced, and one-stop [[women's shelter]]s were created in Malaysia and Nicaragua.

[[Marital rape]] has been illegal in every American state and the District of Columbia since 1993, but is rarely prosecuted in America.&lt;ref name="rainn.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Marital rape | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131201082952/http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape | archive-date = 1 December 2013 |url=http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape |website=rainn.org | publisher = [[Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network]] (RAINN) |accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[UN General Assembly]] passed its first resolution calling for the protection of defenders of women's human rights.&lt;ref name="Norway Post" /&gt; The resolution urges states to put in place gender-specific laws and policies for the protection of women's human rights defenders and to ensure that defenders themselves are involved in the design and implementation of these measures, and calls on states to protect women's human rights defenders from reprisals for cooperating with the UN and to ensure their unhindered access to and communication with international human rights bodies and mechanisms.&lt;ref name="awid.org"/&gt; The United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal 5]] is also a global initiative with a target to eliminate all forms of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender equality|url=https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-and-the-sdgs/sdg-5-gender-equality|access-date=2020-09-23|website=UN Women|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges faced by women in accessing justice and limitations of measures ===
There can be a de jure or de facto acceptance of violent behaviors and lack of remedies for victims.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

*'''Lack of criminalization:''' in many places, acts of abuse, especially acts such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[marital rape]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]], are not criminalized, or are illegal but widely tolerated, with the laws against them being rarely enforced. There are instances where crimes against women are also categorized as minor offenses.
*'''Lack of awareness of the existing laws:''' in many places, although there are laws against violence on the books, many women do not know of their existence. This is especially the case with marital rape - its criminalization being very recent in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

*'''Challenges in making a case in court:''' the burden of proof can be placed on the victim. For instance in the Philippines, before a change in law in 1997, rape used to be described as a crime against chastity; and virginity played an important role in court. In various countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], a woman's past sexual experience continues to be very important in a case of rape. Bangladesh has received criticism for its employment of the "two-finger test" in rape investigations. This test consists in a physical examination of women who report rape during which a doctor inserts two fingers in the woman's vagina to determine whether the woman is "habituated to sex". This examination has its origin in the country's British colonial-era laws dating back to 1872. This deters many women from reporting rape. More than 100 experts, including doctors, lawyers, police, and women's rights activists had signed a joint statement in 2013 asking for the test, which they called "demeaning", to be abolished, as it "does not provide any evidence that is relevant to proving the offence". This test is also performed in several other countries in the region, including India.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

On the other hand, there are measures, such as the 2012 law in Brazil, that allow for cases to be filed even without the representation of the victim.
*'''Existing laws are insufficient, conflicting, and have no effect in practice:''' some laws on domestic violence, for instance, conflict with other provisions and ultimately contradict their goals. Legal frameworks can also be flawed when laws that integrate protection do so in isolation, notably in relation to immigration laws. Undocumented women in countries where they would have, in theory, access to justice, don't in practice for fear of being denounced and deported. The CEDAW Committee recommends that a State authority's obligation to report undocumented persons be repealed in national legislation.
*'''The attitude of the police:''' women who report acts of violence most often come into contact first with police workers. Therefore, police attitudes are crucial in facilitating a sense of safety and comfort for women who have been victimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Logan | first1 = T.

Measures to address violence against women range from access to legal-aid to the provision of shelters and hotlines for victims. Despite advances in legislation and policies, the lack of implementation of the measures put in place prevents significant progress in eradicating violence against women globally. This failure to apply existing laws and procedures is often due to the persisting issue of gender stereotyping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CEDAW | author-link = CEDAW | title = General discussion on women and access to justice | url = http://wilpf.org/cedaw-general-discussion-on-women-and-access-to-justice/ | publisher = [[United Nations]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | date = 18 February 2013 | accessdate = 12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, is the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of domestic violence and violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bureau des Traités |url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG |title=Liste complète |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Countries which ratify it must ensure that the forms of violence defined in its text are outlawed. In its Preamble, the Convention states that "the realisation of ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' equality between women and men is a key element in the prevention of violence against women". The Convention also provides a definition of [[domestic violence]] as "all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim".&lt;ref name="Istanbul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe – Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is a Convention of the [[Council of Europe]], it is open to accession by any country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221131635/http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/convention-violence/thematic_factsheets/IC%20Global%20Tool_EN.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
