{{Violence against women}}
'''Violence against women''' (VAW) is, collectively, violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against [[woman|women]]. Sometimes considered a [[hate crime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2YdCbgXjr-EC&amp;pg=PA405 |chapter=Hate Crime Statutes: A Promising Tool for Fighting Violence Against Women |first=Marguerite |last=Angelari |title=Pornography, sex work, and hate speech |editor=Karen J.

This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women expressly because they are women. The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] states that:
:"violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women" and that "violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm |title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kofi Annan]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], declared in a 2006 report posted on the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) website that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Violence against women and girls is a problem of [[pandemic]] proportions. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime with the abuser usually someone known to her.&lt;ref name="Moradian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tolerancy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=176:2009-09-15-08-37-55&amp;catid=43:events-a-reports&amp;Itemid=90 |title=Domestic Violence against Single and Married Women in Iranian Society |last=Moradian |first=Azad |work=Tolerancy.org |publisher=[[The Chicago School of Professional Psychology]] |date= 2010-09-10|deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120425230632/http://en.tolerancy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=176:2009-09-15-08-37-55&amp;catid=43:events-a-reports&amp;Itemid=90 |archivedate=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2015-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Violence against women can fit into several broad categories. These include violence carried out by "individuals" as well as "states". Some of the forms of violence perpetrated by individuals are [[rape]]; [[domestic violence]]; [[sexual harassment]]; coercive use of contraceptives; [[female infanticide]]; [[sex selective abortion|prenatal sex selection]]; obstetric violence and [[mob violence]]; as well as harmful customary or traditional practices such as [[honor killings]], [[dowry death|dowry violence]], [[female genital mutilation]], [[marriage by abduction]] and [[forced marriage]]. Some forms of violence are perpetrated or condoned by the state such as [[war rape]]; [[sexual violence]] and [[sexual slavery]] during conflict; [[forced sterilization]]; [[forced abortion]]; violence by the police and authoritative personnel; [[stoning]] and [[flogging]]. Many forms of VAW, such as [[trafficking in women]] and [[forced prostitution]] are often perpetrated by organized criminal networks.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. 2013"&gt;Prügl, E. (Director) (November 25, 2013). Violence Against Women. Gender and International Affairs Class 2013. Lecture conducted from The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies (IHEID), Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in its research on VAW, categorized it as occurring through five stages of the life cycle: “1) pre-birth, 2) infancy, 3) girlhood, 4) adolescence and adulthood and 5) elderly”&lt;ref&gt;(1997). [http://www.who.int/gender/violence/v4.pdf Violence against women: Definition and scope of the problem.] World Health Organization, 1, 1-3. Retrieved November 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been a trend of approaching VAW at an international level, through instruments such as conventions; or, in the [[European Union]], through [[Directive (European Union)|directive]]s, such as the directive against [[sexual harassment]],&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; and the directive against [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF "DIRECTIVE 2011/36/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JH"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]], also known as the Istanbul Convention, provides the following definition of violence against women:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|“violence against women” is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women and shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life}}

Although the 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) includes VAW in its General Recommendations 12 and 19,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] mentions VAW at paragraph 18,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=459d17822&amp;toid=459b17a82&amp;docid=3ae6b39ec&amp;skip=O&lt;/ref&gt; it was the 1993 [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution on the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] which became the first international instrument to explicitly define VAW and elaborate on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/global-norms-and-standards&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions of VAW are provided by the 1994 ''Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 2003 [[Maputo Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.achpr.org/files/instruments/women-protocol/achpr_instr_proto_women_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the term ''gender-based violence'' refers to "any acts or threats of acts intended to hurt or make women suffer physically, sexually or psychologically, and which affect women because they are women or affect women disproportionately."&lt;ref&gt;Richters, J. M. (1994). Women, Culture and Violence; a Development, Health and Human Rights Issue.Women Autonomy Centre (VENA), 1, 1-205.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of gender-based violence is most often "used interchangeably with violence against women",&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Krantz, G., &amp; Garcia-Moreno, C. (2005). Violence against Women" ''Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health'' 59(10), 818-821. Retrieved November 29, 2013, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/25570854, pp.818&lt;/ref&gt; and some articles on VAW reiterate these conceptions by suggesting that men are the main perpetrators of this violence.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, P. (1998). Development Practice and Violence against Women. Gender and Development, 6(3), 7-16. Retrieved December 1, 2013, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/4030497, pp.7&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the definition stated by the 1993 Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women also supported the notion that violence is rooted in the inequality between men and women when the term violence is used together with the term 'gender-based.'&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

In  ''Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence'', the Council of Europe stipulated that VAW "includes, but is not limited to, the following":&lt;ref&gt;https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383&lt;/ref&gt;

a. violence occurring in the family or domestic unit, including, ''inter alia'', physical and mental aggression, emotional and psychological abuse, rape and sexual abuse, incest, rape between spouses, regular or occasional partners and cohabitants, crimes committed in the name of honour, female genital and sexual mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, such as forced marriages;

b. violence occurring within the general community, including, ''inter alia'', rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in institutions or elsewhere trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation and economic exploitation and sex tourism;

c. violence perpetrated or condoned by the state or its officials;

d. violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict, in particular the taking of hostages, forced displacement, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and economic exploitation.

These definitions of VAW as being gender-based are seen by some to be unsatisfactory and problematic. These definitions are conceptualized in an understanding of society as patriarchal, signifying unequal relations between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Ertürk, Y. (2009).

Retrieved December 1, 2013, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/20853687, pp.61&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of such definitions argue that the definitions disregard violence against men and that the term ''[[gender]]'', as used in ''gender based violence'', only refers to women. Other critics argue that employing the term ''gender'' in this particular way may introduce notions of inferiority and subordination for femininity and superiority for masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Visaria, L.

The history of violence against women remains vague in scientific literature. This is in part due to the fact that many kinds of violence against women (specifically rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence) often go unreported or under-reported, often due to societal norms, taboos, stigma, and the sensitive nature of the subject.&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt; It is widely recognized that even today, a lack of reliable and continuous data is an obstacle in having a clear picture of violence against women,&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; so a historical picture of violence against women becomes even more difficult to capture. Although the history of violence against women is difficult to track, some claim that violence against women has been accepted, and even condoned and legally sanctioned throughout history.&lt;ref name="Film script"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ireland|first=Patricia|title=Script|url=http://www.pbs.org/kued/nosafeplace/script/script.html|work=No Safe Place: Violence Against Women|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the fact that Roman law gave men the right to chastise their wives, even to the point of death,&lt;ref name="Roman Law"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stedman|first=Berne|title=Right of Husband to Chastise Wife|journal=Virginia Law Register|date=August 1917|volume=3|issue=4|page=241|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/valrgn3&amp;div=35&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the burning of witches, which was condoned by both the church and the state,&lt;ref name="Film script" /&gt;  and an 18th-century English common law allowing a man to punish his wife using a stick "no wider than his thumb." This rule for punishment of wives prevailed in England and America until the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Film script" /&gt; Some historians believe that the history of violence against women is tied to the history of women being viewed as property and a gender role assigned to be subservient to men and also other women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Penelope Harvey &amp; Peter Gow ''Sex and violence : issues in representation and experience'' (1994)  pg 36 Routledge ISBN 0-415-05734-5&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, explanations of [[patriarchy]] and an overall world system or status quo in which gender inequalities exist and are perpetuated, are cited to explain the scope and history of violence against women.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watts|first=Charlotte|author2=Zimmerman, Cathy |title=Violence against women: global scope and magnitude|journal=The Lancet|date=April 2002|volume=359|issue=9313|pages=1232–1237|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08221-1|pmid=11955557}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;  The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993) states that "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm A/RES/48/104.

UNFPA.&lt;/ref&gt; To the modern day, it is recognized that violence against women exists everywhere, and that "there is no region of the world, no country and no culture in which women’s freedom from violence has been secured."&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;  Attention is often drawn to the fact that some forms of violence are particularly more prevalent in some countries/parts of the world, often in developing countries or the Third-World; for example, the associations of [[dowry death|dowry violence]] and [[bride burning]]  with countries such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Nepal]]; [[acid throwing]] also with these countries, as well as some places in [[Southeast Asia]], such as [[Cambodia]]; [[honor killing]]s with the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]]; [[female genital mutilation]] with particular regions in [[Africa]], and to a lesser extent the Middle East and some other parts of Asia; [[marriage by abduction]] with [[Ethiopia]], [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]; abuse related to payment of [[bride price]] (such as violence, trafficking and forced marriage) to certain parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania.

The same sentence shall apply to whom, in the above circumstances, causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse, daughter, or sister.[http://www.surt.org/gvei/docs/national_report_italy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, using any explanation based on culture to justify specific forms of violence against women may legitimize such acts. There is also debate and controversy about the ways in which cultural traditions, local customs and social expectations, and various interpretations of religion can interact with certain abusive practices.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uma Narayan, Cross‐Cultural Connections, Border‐Crossings, and "Death

 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, cultural justifications for certain violent acts against women are asserted by some States and by social groups within many countries claiming to defend cultural tradition (also historical tradition), but these justifications are questionable precisely because these defenses are generally voiced by political leaders or traditional authorities, not by those actually affected.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;  But the need for sensitivity and respect of culture is an element which cannot be ignored either, thus a sensitive debate has ensued and is still ongoing.

However, there has also been a history of recognizing of the harmful and wrongful effects of this violence, and actions have been taken to classify it as unjust. In the 1870s, courts in the United States stopped recognizing the common-law principle that a husband had the right to "physically chastise an errant wife".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Calvert R |year=1974 |chapter=Criminal and civil liability in husband-wife assaults |title=Violence in the family |pages=88–91 |editor=Steinmetz S, Straus M |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the first state to rescind this right was Alabama in 1871.&lt;ref name="USDOJ-History of VAWA" /&gt; In the UK the traditional right of a husband to inflict moderate [[corporal punishment]] on his wife in order to keep her "within the bounds of duty" was removed in 1891.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;R. v. Jackson [1891]. 1 Q.B. 671&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], 1911. Article ''Corporal punishment''&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in the 20th and 21st centuries, and in particular since the 1990s, there has been a large increase in activity on both the national and international levels to research, raise awareness and advocate for the prevention of all kinds of violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; Most often, violence against women has been framed as a health issue, and also as a violation of human rights. As for current information, a study from 2002 estimated that at least one in five women in the world had been physically or sexually abused by a man sometime in their lifetime, and that "gender-based violence accounts for as much death and ill-health in women aged 15–44 years as cancer, and is a greater cause of ill-health than malaria and traffic accidents combined."&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt; Although there are many different forms, certain characteristics of violence against women have emerged from the research, for example, quite often acts of violence against women are not unique episodes, but are ongoing over time, and that more often than not, the violence is perpetrated by someone the woman knows, not a stranger.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt; However, all of the research seems to provide convincing evidence that violence against women is a severe and pervasive problem the world over, with devastating effects on the health and well-being of women and children.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;

Some of the largest milestones on the  international level for the prevention of violence against women include:
*The 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), which recognizes violence as a part of discrimination against women in recommendations 12 and 19.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"&gt;{{cite web|last=UN Women|title=Global Norms and Standards: Ending Violence against Women|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/global-norms-and-standards|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*The 1993 [[World Conference on Human Rights]], which recognized violence against women as a human rights violation, and which contributed to the following UN declaration.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards" /&gt; 
*The 1993 UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] was the first international instrument explicitly defining and addressing violence against women. This document specifically refers to the historically forever-present nature of gender inequalities in understanding violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt; (Include current 2nd paragraph here). This Declaration, as well as the World Conference of the same year, is often viewed as a "turning point" at which the consideration of violence against women by the international community began to be taken much more seriously, and after which more countries mobilized around this problem.&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO Multicountry Study"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garcia-Moreno|first=Claudia|title=WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women|year=2005|publisher=WHO|location=Switzerland|isbn=924159358X|url=http://cdrwww.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/Introduction-Chapter1-Chapter2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*The 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]], linking violence against women to reproductive health and rights, and also providing recommendations to governments on how to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.&lt;ref name="UN Women: Global Norms &amp; Standards"/&gt;
*In 1996, the [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) declared violence a major public health issue, and included in the subtypes recognized were intimate partner violence and sexual violence, two kinds of violence which are often perpetrated as violence against women. This was followed by a WHO report in 2002 (see below).&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krug|first=Etienne G|author2=Mercy, James A |author3=Dahlberg, Linda L |author4= Zwi, Anthony B |title=The world report on violence and health|journal=The Lancet|date=October 2002|volume=360|issue=9339|pages=1083–1088|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11133-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In 1999,the UN adopted the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] and designated [[November 25]] as the [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]].&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Venis|first=Sarah|author2=Horton, Richard |title=Violence against women: a global burden|journal=The Lancet|date=April 2002|volume=359|issue=9313|page=1172|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08251-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In 2002, as a follow-up of the WHA declaration in 1996 of violence as a major public health issue, the [[World Health Organization]] published the first World Report on Violence and Health, which addressed many types of violence and their impact on public health, including forms of violence affecting women particularly strongly. The report specifically noted the sharp rise in civil society organizations and activities directed at responding to gender-based violence against women from the 1970s to the 1990s.&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health" /&gt; 
*In 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] published its "Multi-country study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women," a study of women's health and [[domestic violence]] by surveying over 24,000 women in 10 countries from all regions of the world, which assessed the prevalence and extent of violence against women, particularly violence by intimate partners, and linked this with health outcomes to women as well as documenting strategies and services which women use to cope with intimate-partner violence.&lt;ref name="WHO Multicountry Study" /&gt;
*The 2006 UN Secretary General's "In-depth study on all forms of violence against women," the first comprehensive international document on the issue.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women"&gt;{{cite web|last=UN General Assembly|title=In-depth study on all forms of violence against women.

Additionally, on the national level, individual countries have also organized efforts (legally, politically, socially) to prevent, reduce and punish violence against women. As a particular case study, here are some developments since the 1960s in the United States to oppose and treat violence against women:&lt;ref name="USDOJ-History of VAWA"&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Violence Against Women (OVM)|title=The History of the Violence Against Women Act|url=http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/docs/history-vawa.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1967: One of the country's first domestic violence shelters opened in Maine.
*1972: The country's first rape help hotline opened in Washington, D.C.
*1978: Two national coalitions, the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault and the [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]], were formed, to raise awareness of these two forms of violence against women.
*1984: The US Attorney General created the Department of Justice Task Force on Family Violence, to address ways in which the criminal justice system and community response to domestic violence should be improved.
*1994: Passage of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] or VAWA, legislation included in the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] of 1994, sponsored by then-Senator Joseph Biden, which required a strengthened community response to crimes of domestic violence and sexual assault, strengthened federal penalties for repeat sex offenders and strengthened legislative protection of victims, among many other provisions.
*2000: President Clinton signed into law the VAWA of 2000, further strengthening federal laws, and emphasizing assistance of immigrant victims, elderly victims, victims with disabilities, and victims of dating violence.
*2006: President Bush signed into law the VAWA of 2006, with an emphasis on programs to address violence against Indian women, sexual assault, and youth victims, and establishing programs for Engaging Men and Youth, and Culturally and Linguistically Specific Services.
*2007: The National Teen Dating Abuse Hotline opened.
*2009: President Obama declared April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month.

Other countries have also enacted comparable legislative, political and social instruments to address violence against women. Experts in the international community generally believe, however, that solely enacting punitive legislation for prevention and punishment of violence against women is not sufficient to address the problem. For example, although much stricter laws on violence against women have been passed in Bangladesh, violence against women is still rising.&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt; Instead, it is thought that wide societal changes to address gender inequalities and women's empowerment will be the way to reduce violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigeria-Female Hawkers-Interventions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fawole|title=Interventions for Violence Prevention among Young Female Hawkers in Motor Parks in South-Western Nigeria: A Review of Effectiveness|journal=African Journal of Reproductive Health|year=2003|pages=71–82|jstor=3583347|volume=7|doi=10.2307/3583347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO VAM Factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|last=WHO|title=Violence against women|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/|publisher=WHO|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on society==
[[File:Map3.1NEW Womens Physical Security 2011 compressed.jpg|thumb|A map of the world showing countries by level of women's physical security, 2011]]
According to an article in the [[Health and Human Rights (journal)|Health and Human Rights Journal]],&lt;ref&gt;Fried, S. T. (2003). Violence against Women. Health and Human Rights, 6(2), 88-111. Retrieved December 1, 2013, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/4065431&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of many years of advocacy and involvement of many feminist activist organizations, the issue of violence against women still "remains one of the most pervasive forms of human rights violations worldwide."&lt;ref name="Fried, S. T. 2003 pp.91"&gt;Fried, S. T. (2003). Violence against Women. Health and Human Rights, 6(2), 88-111. Retrieved December 1, 2013, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/4065431, pp.91&lt;/ref&gt; The violence against women can occur in both public and private spheres of life and at any time of their life span. Many women are terrified by these threats of violence and this essentially has an impact on their lives that they are impeded to exercise their human rights, for instance, the fear for contribution to the development of their communities socially, economically and politically. Apart from that, the causes that trigger VAW or gender-based violence can go beyond just the issue of gender and into the issues of age, class, culture, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and specific geographical area of their origins.

Importantly, other than the issue of social divisions, violence can also extend into the realm of health issues and become a direct concern of the public health sector.&lt;ref&gt;Colarossi, L. (2005). A RESPONSE TO DANIS &amp;LOCKHART: WHAT GUIDES SOCIAL WORK KNOWLEDGE ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN?. Journal of Social Work Education, 41(1), 147-159. Retrieved November 30, 2013, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/23044038, pp.148&lt;/ref&gt; A health issue such as [[HIV/AIDS]] is another cause that also leads to violence. Women who have HIV/AIDS infection are also among the targets of the violence.&lt;ref name="Fried, S. T. 2003 pp.91"/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] reports that violence against women puts an undue burden on health care services, as women who have suffered violence are more likely to need health services and at higher cost, compared to women who have not suffered violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html WHO Factsheet '&amp;#39;Violence against women'&amp;#39;]. World Health Organization (1 September 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Another statement that confirms an understanding of VAW as being a significant health issue is apparent in the recommendation adopted by the Council of Europe, violence against women in private sphere, at home or [[domestic violence]], is the main reason of "death and disability" among the women who encountered violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, S. T. (2003). Violence against Women. Health and Human Rights, 6(2), 88-111, pp. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, several studies have shown a link between poor treatment of women and international violence.  These studies show that one of the best predictors of inter- and intranational violence is the maltreatment of women in the society.&lt;ref&gt;Maffly, Brian (21 March 2009).

Significant progress towards the protection of women from violence has been made on international level as a product of collective effort of lobbying by many women’s rights movements; international organizations to civil society groups. As a result, worldwide governments and international as well as civil society organizations actively work to combat violence against women through a variety of programs. Among the major achievements of the women’s rights movements against violence on girls and women, the landmark accomplishments are the "[[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]]” that implies “political will towards addressing VAW ” and the legal binding agreement, “the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]]).”&lt;ref&gt;Rosche, D., &amp; Dawe, A.

=== Another typology: over time&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt; ===
[[File:Typology of Violence Against Women over Time.png|thumbnail|300 px|A diagram of typology of violence against women over time, as conceived by authors Charlotte Watts &amp; Cathy Zimmerman.]]

This similar typology from an academic journal article on violence against women shows similarly the different types of violence perpetrated against women according to what time period in a women's life the violence takes place. However, it also classifies the types of violence according to the perpetrator. One important point to note is that more of the types of violence inflicted on women are perpetrated by someone the woman knows, either a family member or intimate partner, rather than a stranger.

==Types==
Violence against women can take a number of forms:

===Rape===
{{main|Rape}}
Rape is a type of [[sexual assault]], usually involving [[sexual intercourse]]. Though a rape may also be perpetrated against men, women are disproportionately the victims of rape, most commonly at the hands of men.

Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 varied between 0.1 in [[Egypt]] per 100,000 people and 91.6 per 100,000 people in [[Lesotho]] with 4.9 per 100,000 people in [[Lithuania]] as the [[median]].&lt;ref name="unodc1"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Sexual_violence_sv_against_children_and_rape.xls "Rape at the National Level, number of police recorded offenses".] [[United Nations]].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Medical Association]] (1995), sexual violence, and rape in particular, is considered the most underreported violent crime.&lt;ref&gt;American Medical Association (1995) Sexual Assault in America.

Attrition in reported rape cases|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of reporting, prosecution and convictions for rape varies considerably in different jurisdictions. Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by persons the victim knows.&lt;ref name="Abbey"&gt;Abbey, A., BeShears, R., Clinton-Sherrod, A. M., &amp; McAuslan, P. (2004).

Victims of rape can be severely [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] and may suffer from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]];&lt;ref name="aaets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaets.org/article178.htm |title=Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in Rape Survivors |publisher=The American Academy of Experts in Traumatic Stress |year=1995 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to psychological harm resulting from the act, rape may cause physical injury, or have additional effects on the victim, such as acquiring of a [[sexually transmitted infection]] or becoming [[pregnant]].

====Violence against victims====
Following a rape, a victim may face violence or threats of violence from the rapist, and, in some cultures, from the victim's own family and relatives. Violence or intimidation of the victim may be perpetrated by the rapist or by friends and relatives of the rapist, as a way of preventing the victims from reporting the rape, of punishing them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint; or it may be perpetrated by the relatives of the victim as a punishment for "bringing shame" to the family. This is especially the case in cultures where female [[virginity]] is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]]. Victims may also be forced by their families to marry the rapist in order to restore the family's "honor".&lt;ref name="zeenews.india"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/uttar-pradesh/rape-victim-threatened-to-withdraw-case-in-up_694364.html |title=Rape victim threatened to withdraw case in UP |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date=2011-03-19 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wisemuslimwomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisemuslimwomen.org/currentissues/stigmitizationofrape/ |title=Stigmatization of Rape &amp; Honor Killings |publisher=WISE Muslim Women |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harter |first=Pascale |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895 |title=BBC News - Libya rape victims 'face honour killings' |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-06-14 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17379721 | work=BBC News | title=Morocco protest after raped Amina Filali kills herself | date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marital rape===
{{Main|Marital rape}}
Marital rape, also known as spousal rape, is non-consensual sex perpetrated by the victim's spouse. Once widely condoned or ignored by law, spousal rape is now repudiated by international conventions and increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative. The criminalization of marital rape is recent, having occurred during the past few decades. Traditional understanding and views of [[marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexuality]], [[gender roles]] and [[self determination]] have started to be challenged in most Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s, which has led to the subsequent criminalization of marital rape during the following decades. With a few notable exceptions, it was during the past 30 years when most laws against marital rape have been enacted. Some countries in Scandinavia and in the former Communist Bloc of Europe made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but most Western countries criminalized it only in the 1980s and 1990s. In many parts of the world the laws against marital rape are very new, having been enacted in the 2000s.

In [[Canada]], marital rape was made illegal in 1983, when several legal changes were made, including changing the rape statute to ''sexual assault'', and making the laws gender neutral.&lt;ref name=grady&gt;O'Grady William (2011). Crime in Canadian Context: debates and controversies.

In the US, the criminalization of marital rape started in the mid-1970s and in 1993 North Carolina became the last state to make marital rape illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=19930702&amp;id=_xYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UOEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6288,228462 |title=N.C. the last state to outlaw marital rape |publisher=The Daily Gazette |date=July 2, 1993 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[England and Wales]], marital rape was made illegal in 1991. The views of Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century jurist, published in ''The History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736)'', stated that a husband cannot be guilty of the rape of his wife because the wife "hath given up herself in this kind to her husband, which she cannot retract"; in England and Wales this would remain law for more than 250 years, until it was abolished by the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]], in the case of ''R v R'' in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1991/12.html |title=R v R [1991&amp;#93; UKHL 12 (23 October 1991) |publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Netherlands]] marital rape was also made illegal in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeegers |first=Nicolle |url=http://www.bjutijdschriften.nl/tijdschrift/rem/2012/1/ReM_2212-2508_2012_002_001_005.pdf |title=What Epistemology Would Serve Criminal Law Best in Finding the Truth about Rape? |publisher= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the last Western countries to criminalize marital rape was [[Germany]], in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kieler |first=Marita |url=http://www.jurawelt.com/sunrise/media/mediafiles/13792/tenea_juraweltbd52_kieler.pdf |title=Tatbestandsprobleme der sexuellen Nötigung, Vergewaltigung sowie des sexuellen Mißbrauchs widerstandsunfähiger Personen |publisher=Tenea |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between some religions ([[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]) and marital rape is controversial.  The [[Bible]] at 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 explains that one has a "conjugal duty" to have sexual relations with one's spouse (in sharp opposition to [[sex outside marriage]] which is considered a [[sin]]) and states that "The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians%207:3-7:5&amp;version=NKJV |title=1 corinthians 7:3-7:5 NKJV |publisher=Bible Gateway |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some conservative religious figures interpret this as rejecting to possibility of marital rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/2011/07/22/1980301/readers-blast-valley-paper-over.html |title=Valley paper criticized over pastor's column on spousal rape |publisher=Alaska Dispatch |date=2011-07-22 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam makes reference to sexual relations in marriage too, notably: "Allah's Apostle said, 'If a husband calls his wife to his bed (i.e. to have sexual relation) and she refuses and causes him to sleep in anger, the angels will curse her till morning';"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/bukhari/bh4/bh4_464.htm |title=Hadith 4:460 |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several comments on the issue of marital rape made by Muslim religious leaders have been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josh Halliday |url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/nov/08/islam-channel-ofcom |title=Islam Channel censured by Ofcom |publisher=The Guardian |date=8 November 2010 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7843909.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cleric 'must deny' views on rape | date=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence===
{{main|Domestic violence}}
[[File:Girl in Ethiopia (5762561619).jpg|thumb|Girl in [[Ethiopia]].

Women are more likely to be [[victimized]] by someone that they are intimate with, commonly called "[[intimate partner violence]]" or (IPV).

In Western Europe, a country which has received major international criticism for the way it has dealt legally with the issue of violence against women is [[Finland]]; with authors pointing that a high level of equality for women in the public sphere (as in Finland) should never be equated with equality in all other aspects of women's lives.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke |first=Kris |url=http://www.academia.edu/992154/The_Paradoxical_Approach_to_Intimate_Partner_Violence_in_Finland |title=The Paradoxical Approach to Intimate Partner Violence in Finland |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scottishaffairs.org"&gt;http://www.scottishaffairs.org/backiss/pdfs/sa48/sa48_McKie_and_Hearn.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to a report by Amnesty International: "Finland is repeatedly reminded of its widespread problem of violence against women and recommended to take more efficient measures to deal with the situation.

women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such
violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937, but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 – making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995. Only in 1997 did victims of sexual offences and domestic violence in Finland become entitled to government-funded counselling and support services for the duration of their court cases."

A study by [[Pan American Health Organization]] conducted in 12 [[Latin American]] countries found the highest prevalence of domestic violence against women to be in [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.paho.org/hq/dmdocuments/violence-against-women-lac.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this form of violence is often portrayed as an issue within the context of heterosexual relationships, it also occurs in lesbian relationships,&lt;ref name="Girshick"&gt;Girshick, Lori B., "No Sugar, No Spice: Reflections on Research on Woman-to-Woman Sexual Violence."

====Diagnosis planning====
The [[American Psychiatric Association]] planning and research committees for the forthcoming [[DSM-5]] (2013) have canvassed a series of new [[Relational disorder]]s which include ''Marital Conflict Disorder Without Violence'' or ''Marital Abuse Disorder (Marital Conflict Disorder With Violence)''.&lt;ref&gt;First, M.B., Bell, C.C., Cuthbert, B., Krystal, J.H., Malison, R., Offord, D.R., Riess, D., Shea, T., Widiger, T., Wisner, K.L., Personality Disorders and Relational Disorders, pp.164,166 Chapter 4 of Kupfer, D.J., First, M.B., &amp; Regier, D.A. [http://appi.org/book.cfm?id=2292 A Research Agenda For DSM-V]. Published by American Psychiatric Association (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Couples with marital disorders sometimes come to clinical attention because the couple recognize long-standing dissatisfaction with their marriage and come to the [[clinician]] on their own initiative or are referred by an astute health care professional. Secondly, there is serious violence in the marriage which is -"usually the husband battering the wife".&lt;ref&gt;First, M.B., Bell, C.C., Cuthbert, B., Krystal, J.H., Malison, R., Offord, D.R., Riess, D., Shea, T., Widiger, T., Wisner, K.L., Personality Disorders and Relational Disorders, p.163, Chapter 4 of Kupfer, D.J., First, M.B., &amp; Regier, D.A.  [http://appi.org/book.cfm?id=2292 A Research Agenda For DSM-V]. Published by American Psychiatric Association (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases the emergency room or a legal authority often is the first to notify the [[clinician]]. Most importantly, marital violence "is a major risk factor for serious injury and even death and women in violent marriages are at much greater risk of being seriously injured or killed ([[National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women]] 2000)."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;First, M.B., Bell, C.C., Cuthbert, B., Krystal, J.H., Malison, R., Offord, D.R., Riess, D., Shea, T., Widiger, T., Wisner, K.L., Personality Disorders and Relational Disorders, p.166, Chapter 4 of Kupfer, D.J., First, M.B., &amp; Regier, D.A. [http://appi.org/book.cfm?id=2292 A Research Agenda For DSM-V]. Published by American Psychiatric Association (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of this study add that "There is current considerable controversy over whether male-to-female marital violence is best regarded as a reflection of male [[psychopathology]] and control or whether there is an empirical base and clinical utility for conceptualizing these patterns as relational."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Recommendations for clinicians making a diagnosis of ''Marital Relational Disorder'' should include the assessment of actual or "potential" male violence as regularly as they assess the potential for suicide in depressed patients. Further, "clinicians should not relax their vigilance after a battered wife leaves her husband, because some data suggest that the period immediately following a marital separation is the period of greatest risk for the women. Many men will [[stalking|stalk]] and [[battery (crime)|batter]] their wives in an effort to get them to return or punish them for leaving. Initial assessments of the potential for violence in a marriage can be supplemented by standardized interviews and questionnaires, which have been reliable and valid aids in exploring marital violence more systematically."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
 
The authors conclude with what they call "very recent information"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;First, M.B., Bell, C.C., Cuthbert, B., Krystal, J.H., Malison, R., Offord, D.R., Riess, D., Shea, T., Widiger, T., Wisner, K.L., Personality Disorders and Relational Disorders, p.167,168 Chapter 4 of Kupfer, D.J., First, M.B., &amp; Regier, D.A. [http://appi.org/book.cfm?id=2292 A Research Agenda For DSM-V]. Published by American Psychiatric Association (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; on the course of violent marriages which suggests that "over time a husband's battering may abate somewhat, but perhaps because he has successfully [[intimidate]]d his wife. The risk of violence remains strong in a marriage in which it has been a feature in the past. Thus, treatment is essential here; the clinician cannot just wait and watch."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The most urgent clinical priority is the protection of the wife because she is the one most frequently at risk, and clinicians must be aware that supporting assertiveness by a battered wife may lead to more beatings or even death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Honor killings====
[[Honor killings]] are a common form of violence against women in certain parts of the world. In honor killings, women and girls are killed by family members (usually husbands, fathers, uncles or brothers) because the women are believed to have brought shame or dishonor upon the family. These killings are a traditional practice, believed to have originated from tribal customs where an allegation against a woman can be enough to defile a family's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml BBC - Ethics - Honour crimes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honor%20killing Honor killing - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/honor+killing?s=t Honor killing | Define Honor killing at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Women are killed for reasons such as refusing to enter an [[arranged marriage]], being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, attempting to leave a marriage, having sex outside marriage, becoming the victim of rape, dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml#h1 BBC - Ethics - Honour crimes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895 | work=BBC News | title=Libya rape victims 'face honour killings' | date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dowry violence====
[[Image:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]

The custom of [[dowry]], which is common in South Asia, especially in India, is the trigger of many forms of violence against women. [[Bride burning]] is a form of violence against women in which a bride is killed at home by her husband or husband's family due to his dissatisfaction over the dowry provided by her family. [[Dowry death]] refers to the phenomenon of women and girls being killed or committing [[suicide]] due to disputes regarding dowry. Dowry violence is common in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. In India, in 2011 alone, the National Crime Records Bureau reported 8,618 dowry deaths, while unofficial figures suggest the numbers to be at least three times higher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acid throwing====
[[File:Acid attack victim.jpg|Acid attack victim in [[Cambodia]]|thumb|250px]]

====Forced marriage====
A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage in which one or both of the parties is married against their will. Forced marriages are common in South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The customs of [[bride price]] and [[dowry]], that exist in many parts of the world, contribute to this practice. A forced marriage is also often the result of a dispute between families, where the dispute is 'resolved' by giving a female from one family to the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/slavery/modern/modern_1.shtml#section_2 Ethics – Slavery: Modern slavery].

The custom of [[bride kidnapping]] continues to exist in some Central Asian countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and the Caucasus, or parts of Africa, especially Ethiopia. A girl or a woman is abducted by the would be groom, who is often helped by his friends. The victim is often raped by the would be groom, after which he may try to negotiate a bride price with the village elders to legitimize the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/371944.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ethiopia: Revenge of the abducted bride | date=18 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report/69993/ethiopia-surviving-forced-marriage IRIN Africa | ETHIOPIA: Surviving forced marriage | Ethiopia | Children | Gender Issues&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pathfinder.org/publications-tools/pdfs/Causes-and-Consequesnces-of-Early-Marriage-in-the-Amhara-Region-of-Ethiopia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mob violence===

===Stalking===
{{Main|Stalking}}
Stalking is unwanted or obsessive attention by an individual or group toward another person, often manifested through persistent [[harassment]], [[intimidation]], or following/monitoring of the victim. Stalking is often understood as "course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/stalking-resource-center/stalking-information Stalking Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although stalkers are frequently portrayed as being strangers, they are most often known people, such as former or current partners, friends, colleagues or acquaintances. In the US, a survey by NVAW found that only 23% of female victims were stalked by strangers.&lt;ref name="victimsofcrime.org"&gt;http://www.victimsofcrime.org/docs/src/mcfarlane-j-m-campbell-j-c-wilt-s-sachs-c-j-ulrich-y-xu-x-1999.pdf?sfvrsn=0&lt;/ref&gt; Stalking by partners can be very dangerous, as sometimes it can escalate into severe violence, including murder.&lt;ref name="victimsofcrime.org"/&gt; Police statistics from the 1990s in Australia indicated that 87.7% of stalking offenders were male and 82.4% of stalking victims were female.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/conferences/stalking/dussuyer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is abusive, uninvited and unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature, typically in the work/studying place, which may include [[intimidation]], [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature, or the inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors. It can be verbal or physical, and it is often perpetrated by a person in a position of authority against a subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/whatissh.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, sexual harassment is a form of discrimination which violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] defines sexual harassment as: "any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person, in particular when creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm Council of Europe - Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human trafficking and forced prostitution===
[[File:Map3.3Trafficking compressed.jpg|thumb|230px|right|A world map showing countries by prevalence of female trafficking]]
{{Main|Human trafficking|Forced prostitution}}
Human trafficking refers to the acquisition of persons by improper means such as force, fraud or deception, with the aim of [[exploiting]] them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/human-trafficking/index.html?ref=menuside UNODC - Human Trafficking&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] states that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/odihr/19223 U.N. Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organize...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

: "Trafficking in persons" shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs".

Because of the illegal nature of trafficking, reliable data on its extent is very limited.&lt;ref name="apps.who.int"&gt;http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/77394/1/WHO_RHR_12.42_eng.pdf?ua=1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World health organization|WHO]] states that: "Current evidence strongly suggests that those who are trafficked into the [[sex industry]] and as domestic servants are more likely to be women and children."&lt;ref name="apps.who.int"/&gt;
A 2006 study in Europe on trafficked women found that the women were subjected to serious forms of abuse, such as physical or sexual violence, which affected their  physical and mental health.&lt;ref name="apps.who.int"/&gt;

[[Forced prostitution]] is [[prostitution]] which takes place as a result of [[coercion]] by a third party. In forced prostitution, the party/parties who force the victim to be subjected to unwanted sexual acts exercise control over the victim.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/0/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument#Bsl&lt;/ref&gt;

A widow is a woman whose spouse has died. In some parts of the world, widows are subjected to serious forms of abuse, often fueled by traditional practices such as [[widow inheritance]].&lt;ref name="World of Widows"&gt;Owen, Margaret.

===Accused of witchcraft===
[[Witch trials in the early modern period]] (between the 15th and 18th centuries) were common in Europe and in the European colonies in North America. Today, there remain regions of the world (such as parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, rural North India, and Papua New Guinea) where belief in [[witchcraft]] is held by many people, and women accused of being witches are subjected to serious violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&amp;context=djcil#H2N1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrc.ac.za/crime/witchhunts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21363894 | work=BBC News | title=Woman burned alive for 'sorcery' in Papua New Guinea | date=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are also countries which have criminal legislation against the practice of witchcraft.

Militarism produces special environments that allow for increased violence against women. [[War rapes]] have accompanied warfare in virtually every known historical era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levinson |first=Bernard M |title= Gender and Law in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2rZnXQwPX8gC&amp;dq=rape+in+warfare+ancient |page= 203 |year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-567-08098-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rape in the course of war is mentioned multiple times in the Bible: "For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses plundered and the women raped..." {{bibleref|Zechariah|14:2|ESV}} "Their little children will be dashed to death before their eyes. Their homes will be sacked, and their wives will be raped."{{bibleref|Isaiah|13:16|NLT}}

War rapes are rapes committed by soldiers, other combatants or civilians during armed conflict or war, or during military occupation, distinguished from sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service. It also covers the situation where women are forced into prostitution or [[sexual slavery]] by an occupying power. During World War II the Japanese military established brothels filled with "[[comfort women]]", girls and women who were forced into sexual slavery for soldiers, exploiting women for the purpose of creating access and entitlement for men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/ "Why Soldiers Rape – Culture of misogyny, illegal occupation, fuel sexual violence in military"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of violence against women incited by militarism during war took place in the [[Kaunas Ghetto|Kovno Ghetto]]. Jewish male prisoners had access to (and used) Jewish women forced into camp brothels by the Nazis, who also used them.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Andrea: ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation.'' pg. 316.

Rape was committed during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] by members of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistani military]] and the [[militia]]s that supported them. Over a period of nine months, hundreds of thousands of women were raped. [[Susan Brownmiller]], in her report on the [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|atrocities]], said that girls from the age of eight to grandmothers of seventy-five suffered attacks.  (See also: [[Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War]])

Rape used as a weapon of war was practiced during the [[Bosnian War]] where rape was used as a highly systematized instrument of war by Serb armed forces predominantly targeting women and girls of the Bosniak ethnic group for physical and moral destruction.  Estimates of the number of women raped during the war range from 50,000 to 60,000;  as of 2010 only 12 cases have been prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/AnnualReports/annual_report_1997_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  (See also [[Rape during the Bosnian War]]).

The 1998 [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] recognized rape as a war crime.  Presiding judge [[Navanethem Pillay]] said in a statement after the verdict: "From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as spoils of war. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in citation for honorary doctorate, Rhodes University, April 2005 accessed at [http://www.ru.ac.za/academic/graduation/addresses_and_citations/2005/Judge_Pillay_citation.doc] March 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  (See also: [[Rwandan Genocide]])

In 2006, five [[United States Army|U.S. troops]] from a six-man unit [[gang rape]]d and killed a 14-year-old girl in a village near the town of [[Mahmoudiyah, Iraq|Al-Mahmudiyah]], Iraq. After the rape the girl was shot in her head and the lower part of her body, from her stomach down to her feet, was set on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/08/iraq.mahmoudiya/index.html |title=Soldier: 'Death walk' drives troops 'nuts' - Aug 8, 2006 |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greenNews"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-05-07|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8039257.stm|title=US ex-soldier guilty of Iraq rape}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[Mahmudiyah killings]])

A 1995 study of female war veterans found that 90 percent had been sexually harassed. A 2003 survey found that 30 percent of female vets said they were raped in the military and a 2004 study of veterans who were seeking help for post-traumatic stress disorder found that 71 percent of the women said they were sexually assaulted or raped while serving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570 "The Nation: The Plight of Women Soldiers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights violations perpetrated by police and military personnel in many countries are correlated with decreased access to public health services and increased practices of risky behavior among members of vulnerable groups, such as women and female sex workers.&lt;ref name="Beletsky L, Martinex G, Gaines T, et al. 2012 403–410"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beletsky L, Martinex G, Gaines T, etal |title=Mexico’s northern border conflict: collateral damage to health and human rights of vulnerable groups|journal=Rev Panam Salud Publica|year=2012|pmid=22767041|volume=31|issue=5|pmc=3660986|pages=403–410|doi=10.1590/s1020-49892012000500008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These practices are especially widespread in settings with a weak rule of law and low levels of police and military management and professionalism.

====Stoning and flogging====
[[Stoning]], or lapidation, refers to a form of [[capital punishment]] whereby an organized group throws stones at an individual until the person dies. Stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws of several countries, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria, as punishment for [[adultery]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ixvYN7oeF8ehN9beAHZ4G_YlfKeA?hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flogging]] or flagellation is the act of methodically beating or whipping the human body. It is a judicial punishment in various countries for specific crimes, including [[sex outside marriage]]. These punishments employed for sexual relations outside marriage, apart from constituting a form of violence in themselves, can also deter victims of [[sexual violence]] from reporting the crime, because the victims may themselves be punished (if they cannot prove their case, if they are deemed to have been in the company of an unrelated male, or if they were unmarried and not virgins at the time of the rape).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21595814 | work=BBC News | title=Maldives girl to get 100 lashes for pre-marital sex | date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.today.com/id/15836746/ns/today-today_news/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/#.UolafidedO6 Rape case brings Saudi laws into focus - TODAY News - TODAY.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female genital mutilation===
{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
[[File:Fgm map.gif|thumb|250px|Map showing the prevalence of FGM in Africa]]
Female genital mutilation (FGM) is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ WHO | Female genital mutilation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 125 million women and girls in Africa and the Middle East have experienced FGM.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO states that: "The procedure has no health benefits for girls and women" and "Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn deaths" and "FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to a UNICEF report, the top rates for FGM are in Somalia (with 98 percent of women affected), Guinea (96 percent), Djibouti (93 percent), Egypt (91 percent), Eritrea (89 percent), Mali (89 percent), Sierra Leone (88 percent), Sudan (88 percent), Gambia (76 percent), Burkina Faso (76 percent), Ethiopia (74 percent), Mauritania (69 percent), Liberia (66 percent), and Guinea-Bissau (50 percent).&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

According to some local practitioners, it is believed that FGM is linked to cultural rites and customs. It is considered to be a traditional practice which continues to take place in different communities/countries of Africa and Middle East, including in places where it is banned by national legislation. FGM is defined as a “harmful traditional practice”&lt;ref name="Shell-Duncan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shell-Duncan|first=Bettina|title=From Health to Human Rights: Female Genital Cutting and the Politics of Intervention|journal=American Anthropologist|date=10 July 2008|volume= 110|issue=2|pages=225–236|doi=10.1111/j.1468-3083.2012.04518.x

Due to globalization and immigration, FGM is spreading beyond the borders of Africa and Middle East, to countries such as Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, US, and UK.&lt;ref name=Nussbaum&gt;{{cite book|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|title=Sex and Social Justice|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|location=USA|isbn=0195112105|pages=120–121|url=http://books.google.ch/books?id=hHY_kjkAYKQC&amp;pg=PT11&amp;lpg=PT11&amp;dq=martha+nussbaum+judging+other+cultures+the+case+of+genital+mutilation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Dct3fEjZzl&amp;sig=yS0Qk9qP6ALyhrf0FHiXkGbv8HA&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d_WZUo2jKceGywO-kYLIAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=martha%20nussbaum%20judging%20other%20cultures%20the%20case%20of%20genital%20mutilation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interventionist approaches====

There exist several approaches that were set up by international health organizations and civil societies (for example, [[Tostan]]) aimed at eliminating the practice of FGM in implemented countries: 
# FGM as a Health issue (also known as health risks approach)
# FGM as a Human Rights issue (also known as Human Rights-based approach)

Some scholars suggests that, when dealing with FGM, it is necessary to take lessons from history, particularly 19th-century campaign against [[foot-binding]] in China&lt;ref name="Kwame Appiah"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kwame Appiah|first=Anthony|title=The art of social change|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24FOB-Footbinding-t.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=2 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was successful.

====As a public health issue====

The existing approaches to eliminate FGM are principally founded on health-based arguments and methods. Supporters of that approach established their arguments on the need to protect women’s health from hazards caused by FGM. It is acknowledged that FGM affects women's health, reproduction, and sexual functioning.  According to the World Health Organization’s ﬁndings &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/fgm/en/index.html WHO | Female genital mutilation (FGM) and harmful practices&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; “women who have had FGM) are signiﬁcantly more likely to experience difﬁculties during childbirth and that their babies are more likely to die as a result of the practice”.&lt;ref name=Shell-Duncan /&gt; Moreover, it can "result in myriad complications, from infections, menstrual difficulties and painful intercourse to...stillbirths and brain-damaged infants, increased risk of HIV infection, and psychological and emotional stress.“&lt;ref name=Rule&gt;{{cite news|last=Rule|first=Sheila|title=FEMALE CIRCUMCISION IS DEBATED IN THIRD WORLD|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/29/style/female-circumcision-is-debated-in-thrid-world.html|accessdate=2 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 29, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, in order to eradicate the procedure, advocates of the health risks approach designed strategies to raise public awareness of negative impacts of FGM to women's bodies and health. The health approach was commonly used and promoted, until it was criticized and, to a certain extent, replaced by the Human rights approach.

====As a human rights issue====

In 1993, at the Vienna [[World Conference on Human Rights]], the issue of FGM was for the first time addressed as a form of violence against women under the framework of International Human Rights. Since then, the elimination of FGM has taken a prominent place in the agenda of the [[international human rights instruments|international human rights discourse]], leaving behind the health risk approach.&lt;ref name=Shell-Duncan /&gt;  
:"The global human rights discourse differs from earlier Western policies, which focused on health in relation to female genital mutilation. It modifies earlier Western feminist arguments that read female genital mutilation as patriarchal control over women’s bodies and sexuality, and as a symbol of women’s subordination".&lt;ref name="Malmström, Dellenborg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maria Malmström|first=Maria|coauthors=Ann Schlyter, Editor Lucy Kondwani Chipeta Lisen Dellenborg Assitan Diallo Margareta Espling Desiree LewisNolwazi Mkhwanazi Mulela Margaret Munalula Patience Mususa Paula Mählck,|title=Body politics and women citizens : African experiences|journal=Sida Studies|year=2009|volume= 24|pages=93–101, 104–112|url=http://www.sida.se/Publications/Import/pdf/sv/Body-Politics-and-Women-Citizens---African-Experiences.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human rights-based arguments are founded principally on a concept of universal human rights. Supporters of that approach emphasize the flagrant violation of fundamental rights, and they consider FGM as a violent violation of woman ‘s and child’s fundamental rights including the right to life, the right to be protected from cruel treatment, the right to physical integrity, and the right to health. According to Shell-Duncan FGM is violence against not only women, but it also constitutes a violation in the rights of child not yet achieved puberty.&lt;ref name="Shell-Duncan" /&gt;

The use of International Human Rights discourse to tackle FGM has, however, faced challenges such as “there are no international human rights instruments that speciﬁcally address female genital cutting”.&lt;ref name="Shell-Duncan" /&gt; Therefore, advocates of FGM's elimination, building their arguments upon the [[UN Declarations]], Conventions, and [[a Theory of Justice]]&lt;ref name="Nussbaum" /&gt;  suggest that the issue of FGM can be addressed under the legal framework of the three legal instruments such as: Violation of Rights of Child, violation of rights of women, and the right to be protected from torture.&lt;ref name="Shell-Duncan" /&gt;

====Debates about best approaches====

There are growing debates about what is the most appropriate approach to tackle FGM. Both the health and the human rights-based approaches have been criticized.

The critique of the health approach is related to the medicalization of FGM,&lt;ref name=Shell-Duncan /&gt; meaning that concentration on health risks neglects the other aspects of FGM practice(for example, legal) and leads not to the banning of practice, but to medically safe performance of FGM.  This critique is defined by Shell-Duncan: 
:"A ﬁnal problematic aspect of the health approach as a rationale for abandoning FGC is that the emphasis on health risks is believed by anti-circumcision advocates to have inadvertently promoted the conceptualization of FGC and obstetrical complications."&lt;ref name=Shell-Duncan /&gt;

The human rights approach notices the lack of legal instruments to address FGM. In addition to that, the usage of universal human rights language might be at a variance with collective identity and cultural understandings of indigenous people. That is why  "the post-colonialist critique as an approach to the politics of female circumcision stresses the need for contextualised understandings of indigenous meanings arguing against the human rights approach."&lt;ref name="Malmström, Dellenborg" /&gt;

===Breast ironing===
{{Main|Breast ironing}}
Breast ironing (also known as "breast flattening") is the practice of pounding and massaging the [[breasts]] of a [[puberty|pubescent girl]], using hard or heated objects, in an attempt to try to make them stop developing or disappear.&lt;ref name="west-info.eu"&gt;http://www.west-info.eu/files/Feinstein-International-Center-Understanding-breast-ironing-a-study-of-the-methods-motivations-and-outcomes-of-breast-flattening-practices-in-Cameroon-20121.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5107360.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cameroon girls battle 'breast ironing' | date=23 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/surviving-breast-ironing-in-cameroon/ | work=CBS News |title= Surviving "breast ironing" in Cameroon |accessdate = August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically carried out by the girl's mother, with the aim of making the girl less sexually attractive to men and boys, so that her virginity is preserved.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; It is practiced primarily in [[Cameroon]], but has also been reported across other areas in [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref name="west-info.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/07/27/cameroon.breast.ironing/ | work=CNN | title=Breast ironing tradition targeted in Cameroon | date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breast ironing is very painful and can have negative emotional and physical consequences.&lt;ref name="west-info.eu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Obstetric violence===

“Obstetric violence” refers to acts categorized as physically or psychologically violent in the context of labor and birth. In most developed and many developing countries, birth takes place in an increasingly medicalized environment; with numerous surgical interventions that women can sometimes be coerced into accepting, or which are done without her consent. Medicalized birthing practices and interventions such as [[Caesarean section]]s, [[Episiotomy|episiotomies]] and hormonal [[Labor induction|birth induction]]; which should normally be restricted to only a minority of cases where risks for the mother are clear, are increasingly being used during births that could otherwise take place naturally. Some organizations and scholars consider this a violent act against the woman and her child.

The concept also includes the unjustified use of instruments and maneuvers that have been recognized as risky to the health of the mother and child, or whose benefits and risks have not been sufficiently examined (use of [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps]], [[:es:Maniobra de Kristeller|Kristeller maneuver]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.2478%2Fs11536-008-0008-z |title=Possible feto-maternal clinical risk of the Kristeller’s expression |authors=Habek, D.|publisher=Central European Journal of Medicine, Volume 3, Issue 2, pp 183-186 |year=2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vacuum birth#Indications for use of vacuum|vacuum extraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1996/WHO_FRH_MSM_96.24.pdf |title=Care in Normal Birth: A Practical Guide |authors=World Health Organization |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[World health organization|World Health Organization]] warns that “the boom in unnecessary surgeries is jeopardizing women’s health”, that Caesarean sections have reached “epidemic proportions” in many countries (46% in [[China]], 25% and above in many Asian, European and Latin American countries), and that sometimes financial incentives for doctors and hospitals have an influence too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/34826186/ |title=C-section rates around the world at "epidemic levels" |authors=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning episiotomies, the World Health Organization informs that they “carry a greater risk of getting infected, and can cause a higher blood loss, than (natural) tears”, and that “Limiting the use of episiotomy to strict indications has a number of benefits: less posterior perineal trauma, less need for suturing and fewer complications”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/rhl/pregnancy_childbirth/childbirth/2nd_stage/jlcom/en/ |title=Episiotomy for Vaginal Birth |authors=World Health Organization Reproductive Health Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; England’s [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] informs that episiotomies may cause pain and discomfort for the woman for many months after their child’s birth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/episiotomy.aspx |title=NHS Choices: Episiotomy |authors=National Health Services, United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] also recommends a restriction on their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2006/ACOG_Recommends_Restricted_Use_of_Episiotomies |title=ACOG Recommends Restricted Use of Episiotomies |authors=The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists |date=March 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources refer to North American obstetricians and gynecologists, especially between the 1950s and 1980s, practicing what was called ''the husband’s stitch'': placing extra stitches in the woman’s vagina after the episiotomy or natural tearing, supposedly to increase the husband’s future sexual pleasure and often causing long-term pain and discomfort to the woman. However, there is no proof that such a practice was widespread in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3312147/#r25130-3 |title=Aesthetic Surgery of the Female Genitalia |authors=Julie M.L.C.L.

The WHO recently stated that “in normal birth, there should be a valid reason to interfere with the natural process. The aim of care is to achieve a healthy mother and child with the least possible level of intervention compatible with safety”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/chd/publications/newslet/dialog/8/keeping_birth_normal.htm |title=Keeping Birth Normal |authors=Rosser, Jilly. World Health Organization Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practices that should be stopped (in normal labor), according to the WHO:
* Shaving the pubic hair
* Giving an enema to empty the bowels
* Electronic fetal monitoring
* Not letting the woman eat or drink
* Telling the woman to hold her breath and push during the second stage of labor (rather than leaving it to do her own way) 
* Stretching and interfering with the entrance to the vagina when the baby is being born
* Episiotomy
* Taking the baby away from its mother at birth
* Getting the woman to lie down on her back during labor and/or delivery

====The fight for a more humane and respectful birth====

In Latin America, with the increasingly medicalized and surgical context of birth, many organizations propose a rediscovery of natural, unmedicated birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimahora.com/proponen-volver-al-parto-natural-el-aumento-las-cesareas-n745614.html |title=Proponen Volver al Parto Natural, ante el Aumento de Cesáreas |authors=Última Hora |date=December 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different scholars such as O. Fernández have analyzed the link between [[PTSD|Post-traumatic Stress Disorder]] and obstetric violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwiferytoday.com/magazine/issue105.asp |title=PTSD and Obstetric Violence |authors=Fernández, I.O. |publisher=Midwifery Today, Volume 105 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iboneolza.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/las-secuelas-de-la-violencia-obstetrica/ |title=(Full text in Spanish of I.O.

====Legal action against obstetric violence====

In [[Venezuela]], as well as in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] states of Veracruz, Chiapas, Guanajuato and Durango, laws have been passed to give women the right to a life free of obstetric violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/4/08-010408/en/ |title=Mexico's Midwives Enter the Mainstream |authors=Bulletin of the World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela’s Organic Law on the Right of Women to a Life Free of Violence, approved November 2006, defines on its Article 51 the following acts as forms of obstetric violence:

* Failing to timely and efficiently take care of obstetric emergencies
* Forcing the woman to give birth in a face-up ([[Lithotomy position|lithotomy]]) position and with legs on stirrups, when the means are available for vertical birth, 
* Blocking the child’s early attachment to the mother without a justified medical cause, denying the mother the possibility of picking up the child and breastfeeding immediately after birth, 
* Altering the natural process of the low-risk birth, by use of induction and acceleration techniques, without obtaining the mother’s voluntary, explicit and informed consent.
* Practicing caesarean sections when the conditions are available for natural birth, without obtaining the mother’s voluntary, explicit and informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venezuela.unfpa.org/doumentos/Ley_mujer.pdf |title=Organic Law on the Right of Women to a Life Free of Violence |authors=Supreme Court of Justice of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico’s GIRE (Group for Information on Planned Reproduction) has issued a report where it also mentions the “normalization of obstetric violence”, as well as psychological and emotional mistreatment by care providers being common during childbirth. It also mentions forced sterilization as a form of severe violence against women; one which might disproportionally affect indigenous women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://informe.gire.org.mx/caps/cap4.pdf |title=Omission and Indifference: Reproductive Rights in Mexico. Part 4: Obstetric Violence |authors=Group for Information on Planned Reproduction, Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological and verbal abuse during childbirth, as well as coercion into accepting surgical intervention, are also documented in Goer’s “Cruelty in Maternity Wards: Fifty Years Later”; published in the Journal of Perinatal Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2920649/ |title=Cruelty in Maternity Wards: Fifty Years Later |authors=Goer, Henci |publisher=The Journal of Perinatal Education, Vol. 19(3), pp. 33-42 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport-related violence against women===

Sport-related violence against women refers to any physical, sexual, mental acts that are “perpetrated by both male athletes and by male fans or consumers of sport and sporting events, as well as by coaches of female athletes”.&lt;ref name="Catherint Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Catherine|title=Violence against women and sport: Literature review|year=2011|publisher=Durham University|location=London|pages=2–5|url=http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/22/violence-against-women-and-sport-a-literature-review-by-dr-catherine-palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documenting reports and literature suggest that there are obvious connections between contemporary sport and violence against women. Such events as the [[2010 World Cup]], the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]]  “have highlighted the connections between sports spectatorship and intimate partner violence, and the need for police, authorities and services to be aware of this when planning sporting events”.&lt;ref name="Catherint Palmer" /&gt;

Sport-related violence can occur in various contexts and places, including homes, pubs, clubs, hotel rooms, the streets.&lt;ref name="Catherint Palmer" /&gt;

====Sport-related violence by male college athletes====

Violence against women is a topic of concern in the United States' collegiate athletic community. From the 2010 UVA lacrosse murder, in which a male athlete was charged guilty with second degree murder of his girlfriend, to the 2004 University of Colorado Football Scandal when players were charged with nine alleged sexual assaults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vaughan|first=Kevin|title=Colorado woman seeks justice in alleged sexual assault Read more: Colorado woman seeks justice in alleged sexual assault|url=http://www.denverpost.com/firstinthepost/ci_12557039|work=denver Post|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies suggest that athletes are at higher risk for committing sexual assault against women than the average student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brady|first=Jeff|title=Scandal Returns to University of Colorado Football|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105381707|work=NPR weekend edition|publisher=NPR|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chandler1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chandler|first=Steve B|coauthors=JOHNSON, DEWAYNE J. CARROLL, PAMELA S.|title=Abusive Behaviors of College Athletes|journal=College Student Journal|date=1 December 1999|volume=33|issue=4|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that one in three college assaults are committed by athletes.&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mak|first=Stephanie|title=Are Athletes More Abusive Than the Rest of the Student Population?|url=http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/hurj/issue3/spotlight-mak.html|publisher=Hopkins Undergraduate Research Journal Online|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Surveys suggest that male student athletes who represent 3.3% of the college population, commit 19% of reported sexual assaults and 35% of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics|url=http://www.ncava.org/Statistics.html|publisher=The National Coalition Against Violent Athletes|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theories that surround these statistics range from misrepresentation of the student-athlete to an unhealthy mentality towards women within the team itself.&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1"/&gt;

====Controversy over contributing factors====

Sociologist Timothy Curry, after conducting an observational analysis of two big time sports’ locker room conversations, deduced that the high risk of male student athletes for gender abuse is a result of the team’s subculture.&lt;ref name=Curry1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Timothy Jon|title=Fraternal Bonding in the Locker Room: A Profeminist Analysis Of Talk About Competition And Women|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|year=1991|volume=8|issue=2|pages=119–135|accessdate=12 March 2012|url=http://www.umt.edu/sociology/faculty_staff/ellestad/documents/275_Curry1991fraternalbondinginthelockerroom_s10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states, "Their locker room talk generally treated women as objects, encouraged sexist attitudes toward women and, in its extreme, promoted rape culture."&lt;ref name=Curry1991/&gt; He proposes that this objectification is a way for the male to reaffirm his heterosexual status and hyper-masculinity. Claims have been made that the atmosphere changes when an outsider (especially women) intrude in the locker room. In the wake of the reporter [[Lisa Olson]] being harassed by a Patriots player in the locker room in 1990, she reflected, "We are taught to think we must have done something wrong and it took me a while to realize I hadn't done anything wrong."&lt;ref name=lisa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Disch|first=Lisa|author2=Kane, Mary Jo |title=When a Looker is Really a Bitch: Lisa Olson, Sport, and the Heterosexual Matrix|journal=Signs|date=Winter 1996|volume=21|issue=2|pages=278–308|jstor=3175065|doi=10.1086/495067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other female sports reporters (college and professional) have claimed that they often brush off the players' comments which leads to further objectification.&lt;ref name=lisa /&gt;  Other sociologists challenge this claim. Steve Chandler notes that because of their celebrity status on campus, “athletes are more likely to be scrutinized or falsely accused than non-athletes.”&lt;ref name="chandler1999"/&gt;  Another contender, Stephanie Mak, notes that, “if one considers the 1998 estimates that about three million women were battered and almost one million raped, the proportion of incidences that involve athletes in comparison to the regular population is relatively small."&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1"/&gt;

====Response to violence by male college athletes====

In response to the proposed link between college athletes and gender-based violence, and media coverage holding Universities as responsible for these scandals more universities are requiring athletes to attend workshops that promote awareness. For example, St. John's University holds sexual assault awareness classes in the fall for its incoming student athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newsom|first=John|title=Share on emailShare on redditMore Sharing Services Few Colleges Tackle Issue of Athlete Sex Assaults|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-22/news/mn-7249_1_sexual-assault|publisher=Los Angeles Times Online|accessdate=12 March 2012|date=22 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other groups, such as the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes, have formed to provide support for the victims as their mission statement reads, "The NCAVA works to eliminate off the field violence by athletes through the implementation of prevention methods that recognize and promote the positive leadership potential of athletes within their communities.  In order to eliminate violence, the NCAVA is dedicated to empowering individuals affected by athlete violence through comprehensive services including advocacy, education and counseling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission|url=http://www.ncava.org/Mission.html|publisher=National Coalition Against Violent Athletes|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online violence against women===
On September 24, 2015, the [[United Nations Broadband Commission]] released a report that claimed that almost 75% percent of women [[online]] have encountered [[cyber violence]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/9/cyber-violence-report-press-release&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to better comprehend the anti-violence movements against VAW, there is a need to also understand the generic historical background of [[feminist movements]] in a holistic manner. Talking about the international women’s movement, many feminist scholars have categorized these movements into three waves&lt;ref&gt;Kroløkke, C., &amp; Sørensen, A. S. (2006). Chapter 1: Three Waves of Feminism: From Suffragettes to Grrls. Gender communication theories &amp; analyses: from silence to performance (pp. 1-23). Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; according to their different beliefs, strategies and goals.&lt;ref&gt;Rupp, L. J., &amp; Taylor, V. (1999). Forging Feminist Identity in an International Movement: A Collective Identity Approach to Twentieth-Century Feminism. Signs, 24(2), 363-386. Retrieved December 1, 2013, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/3175646&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the first women’s movements, or so called the first wave of feminism, dated back in the years the late 19th Century and early 20th Century in the United States and Europe. During this period, the first series of feminist movements developed from the context of “industrial society and liberal politics” that trigger the ‘feminist groups’ with the concern of equal access and opportunity for women.&lt;ref&gt;Kroløkke, C., &amp; Sørensen, A. S. (2006). Chapter 1: Three Waves of Feminism: From Suffragettes to Grrls. Gender communication theories &amp; analyses: from silence to performance (pp. 1-23). Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications, pp. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This wave marks a period of “suffrage, independence, rights to nationality, work and equal pay” for women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Prügl, E. (Lecturer) (2013, December 2). Gender and International Affairs 2013. INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST MOVEMENTS. Lecture conducted from The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies (IHEID), Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave of feminist movements was the series of movements from the period of the “late 1960s to early 1970s.” It was noted by feminist scholars that this wave could be characterized as a period of women’s liberation and the rise of a branch of feminism known as ‘radical feminism.’&lt;ref&gt;Kroløkke, C., &amp; Sørensen, A. S. (2006). Chapter 1: Three Waves of Feminism: From Suffragettes to Grrls. Gender communication theories &amp; analyses: from silence to performance (pp. 1-23). Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; This wave of feminism emerged in the context of postwar period&lt;ref&gt;Kroløkke, C., &amp; Sørensen, A. S. (2006).

Nonetheless, the VAW movement was initiated in the 1970s where some feminist movements started to bring the discussion on the issue of violence into the feminist discourse&lt;ref&gt;(2005).

Retrieved December 2, 2013, from http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Ms_StoppingVAWTheMovementFromInterventionToPrevention_Aug2005.pdf, pp.2&lt;/ref&gt; and that many other groups, on the national as well as international levels, had attempted to push for the betterment of women through lobbying of the state officials and delegates, demanding the conferences on ‘gender issues'&lt;ref&gt;Prügl, E. (Lecturer) (2013, December 2). Gender and International Affairs 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus made the VAW known to a wider range of population. Therefore, to put this into the theoretical context, VAW can be categorized along with the third wave of feminism whose one of its focuses is on ‘violence.’

VAW activist movements come in many forms and operate through different levels at "local, national and international levels"&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, G. (2003).

Retrieved December 2, 2013, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/4065347, pp. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The movements stemmed mostly from social movements and groups of women who see the need to create organizations to 'lobby' their governments to establish "sanctuaries, shelters" and provision of services that help protecting these victims or so-called ''battered women'' from acts of violence. The term ''battered women '' was used in a number of VAW movements and had its root in the early stage of organizing efforts to tackle the problem of violence against women in many regions of the world such as Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin American and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Susana T.. "Violence Against Women." ''Health and Human Rights'' 6, no. 2 (2003): 88-111, pp. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The activist organizations against VAW, some with and the others without the support of their governments, attempted to develop "innovative efforts" to assist the ''battered women'' by providing services such as shelters and centers for these women; drafting and lobbying the governments to include the recognition and language of VAW into national legislations and [[international human rights instruments]]; advocating to raise the awareness of people via education and training sessions; forming national, regional as well as international networks to empower the movements; organizing demonstration and gathering more efforts to end violence acts against women.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, pp. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many women’s rights activist groups see the issue of violence against women as a central focus of their movements. Many of these groups take ‘human rights’ approach as the integral framework of their activism. These VAW movements also employ the idea of ‘women’s rights are human rights,’ transform the concepts and ideas of ‘human rights,’ which are mostly reckoned to be ‘Western concepts’ and '[[Vernacularization|vernacularize]] ''them into the concepts that can be understood in their local institutions.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Helvetica;

=== Levels of activist movements ===
On the local or national level, the VAW movements are diverse and differ in their strategic program of intervention. The strategies used in a number of the movements focus on the individual level with the emphases on individuals, relationships and family. Also, many of them take the 'preventive' as an approach to tackle the issues on the ground by encouraging people to "reexamine their attitudes and beliefs" in order to trigger and create fundamental changes in these "deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;Michau, L. (2007). Approaching Old Problems in New Ways: Community Mobilisation as a Primary Prevention Strategy to Combat Violence against Women. ''Gender and Development'', ''15''(1), 95-109. Retrieved December 2, 2013, from http://www.jstor.org/stable/20461184, pp.96&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that these strategies can be life changing, helpful to those who participate and feasible over a long time frame, the impacts on societal level seem to be restricted and of minimal effects. In order to achieve the objectives of the movement, ending the violence against women, many activists and scholar seem to argue that they have to initiate the changes on the communal level in the norms and cultural attitudes, which were the sources that permit the abusive behavior of men toward women.&lt;ref&gt;Heise, L., M. Ellsberg and M. Gottemoeller (1999). Ending Violence Against Women, ''Population Reports '', Series L, No.11, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Population and Information Program, pp.38&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of activism on the local level can be seen in South Africa. The movements of VAW in this context employ a strategy that is based on the ‘prevention’ approach, which is applicable on individual and societal levels: in families and communities. This movement encourages the individuals and small populations to rethink about their attitudes and beliefs in order to create a possibility to alter these deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors, which lead to the act of violence against women.&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"/&gt; Another example is the local level movement in East Africa that employs the prevention approach, which is applicable on the communal level. They call this approach a ‘raising voices’ approach. This approach employs an ‘ad hoc’ framework that can be used complementarily with the individual approach where the strategy is to aggravate the status quo issues onto the individuals’ and communities’ perception and establish a common ground of interests for them to push for the movement, but in a short time of period.&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"/&gt; In addition, on the domestic level, there seems to be many 'autonomous movements.'&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Helvetica;

&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas autonomous feminist movements (for VAW) can be understood as "a form of women's mobilization that is devoted to promoting women's status and well-being independently of political parties and other associations that do not have the status of women as their main concern."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Helvetica;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On the transnational or regional level, the anti-violence movements also deploy different strategies based on the specificities of their cultures and beliefs in their particular regions. On this level, the activist movements are known as "transnational feminist networks" or TFNs.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Helvetica;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On the international level, the movements that advocate for women's rights and against VAW are the mixture of (civil society) actors from the domestic and regional levels. On this level, the objectives of VAW movements focus on "creating shared expectations" within the domestic and regional levels as well as "mobilizing numbers of domestic civil society" to create "standards in global civil society."&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt; The global women's movement determine to transform numbers of international conventions and conferences to "a conference on women's rights" by pushing for a "stronger language and clearer recognition" of the VAW issues. In addition, the United Nations also plays a vital role in promoting and campaigning for the VAW movements on the international level. For instance, in 2008, Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary General has initiated and launched the campaign called "UniTE To End Violence Against Women." This campaign "calls on governments, civil society, women’s organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire UN system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls."&lt;ref&gt;Take action Say NO UNiTE | UN Women - Headquarters.

&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this campaign also announces every 25th of the month to be "Orange Day" or "a day to take action to raise awareness and prevent violence against women and girls."&lt;ref&gt;Take action Say NO UNiTE | UN Women - Headquarters. (n.d.).
&lt;/ref&gt;

In conclusion, each level of activism is intertwined and has the common purpose to end violence against women. The activism on the local level can significantly affect the movements on the other levels: transnational and international levels. All in all, the effort on different levels lead to change that can perpetrate to all levels. In a scholarly article on C''ombating Violence Against Women'', the authors illustrated from their research analysis on how the norms of international society can shape and influence the policy making on the domestic or national level and vice versa. They argue that there are ‘three’ mechanisms, which have effects on the making of national policies as well as global agreements and conventions. Three of which are “1) the influence of global treaties and documents such as [[CEDAW]] on women’s rights" - on the national policies "2) the influence of regional agreements on VAW (particularly after certain tipping points are reached)" - on both domestic policies and international conventions and "3) regional demonstration effects or pressure for conformity captured as diffusion within regions” - on the international norms and agreements.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Helvetica;mso-bidi-font-family:Helvetica"&gt;Htun, M., &amp; Weldon, S.

=== Achievements of the VAW movements ===
On the Global level:
* The first major document that highlights the recognition of violence against women as a human rights violation: the United Nations [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in Vienna, 1993.&lt;ref name="Brown Thompson 2002"&gt;Brown Thompson, Karen. 2002.

"Inclusion, Solidarity and Social Movements: The Global Movement on Gender Violence." Perspectives on Politics 4 (1): 55–74.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a result of collective effort of global feminist movement to transform the Vienna conference from a general and mainstream human rights conference into the conference on women's rights. As before the other human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch did not focus on the issue of VAW and did not consider rape and domestic violence as violations of human rights despite of the fact that they also have agenda on women's rights.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; During the 4th Women Conference, VAW was emphasized and named as a critical concern. Also, the spillover effect was that this push highlighted the need for the development of "new international norms" that have often been used by activists and governments the proposition of legislation that provide other action to redress the acts of violence.&lt;ref name="Brown Thompson 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weldon, S.L 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fábián, Katalin, ed. 2010.

* Subsequently, the push from the global feminist movement also push for the fully incorporation of the VAW issues into the "Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women" or [[CEDAW]]&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. (n.d.). ''UN News Center''. Retrieved December 19, 2013, from http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/committee.htm

On the regional level:
* ''Americas'': the Inter-American Convention on Violence Against Women, which was formally announced and adopted by the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1994, immediately after the Vienna Conference&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Helvetica;

* ''Europe'': The [[European Union]] (EU)’s initiatives to combat violence against women after the 1990s: the 1997 resolution calling for a zero tolerance: specifically on UN human rights instruments of [[CEDAW]] and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action|Vienna Declaration]]. 
** The [[Council of Europe]] also developed "a series of initiatives" related to the issue of VAW:  "the 2000 resolution on trafficking, the 2003 resolution on domestic violence, and the 2004 resolution on honor crimes" as well as promoted "the 2002 recommendation on the protection of women against violence and established its monitoring framework." &lt;ref&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Helvetica;

==Access to justice for women victims of violence==

===International and regional instruments===
Efforts to fight violence against women can take many forms and access to justice, or lack thereof, for such violence varies greatly depending on the justice system. International and regional instruments are increasingly used as the basis for national legislation and policies to eradicate violence against women.

The Inter-American Convention to Prevent, Eradicate and Punish Violence Against Women – also known as the Belém do Parà Convention, for instance, has been applied by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in its first case of domestic violence to condemn Brazil in the Maria da Penha case. This led the Brazilian government to enact in 2006 the Maria da Penha Law, the country’s first law against domestic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;SPIELER, Paula, 'Inter-American Commission on Human Rights : Contributions to the Debate on Domestic Violence Against Women in Brazil'. ''Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies,'' Vol. 18#1, Indiana University Press (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; There is also, for instance, the South Asian Agreement on Regional Cooperation’s (SAARC) Protocol to End Trafficking in Women and Children.&lt;ref&gt;FRIED, Susana T, 'Violence against Women'. ''Health and Human Rights'', Vol. 6, No.2, Violence, Health, and Human Rights (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of measures put in place===
As violence is often committed by a family member,  women first started by lobbying their governments to set up shelters for domestic violence survivors. The Julia Burgos Protected House established in Puerto Rico in 1979 was the first shelter in Latin America and the Caribbean for « battered women ». In 2003, 18 out of the 20 countries in the region had legislation on domestic or family violence, and 11 countries addressed sexual violence in their laws. Legislative measures to protect victims can include restraining orders, which can be found in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Venezuela, Turkey, the United States and many western European countries for instance.

Courts can also be allowed by law (Germany, 2001) to order the perpetrator to leave the home so that victims do not have to seek shelter. Countries were urged to repeal discriminatory legislation by 2005 following the review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2000. Egypt, for instance, abolished a law that exempted men from rape charges when marrying their victims. However, the goal of antiviolence legislation is often to keep the families together, regardless of the best interests of women, which perpetuate domestic violence.&lt;ref name="FRIED, Susana T 2003"&gt;FRIED, Susana T, 'Violence against Women'. Health and Human Rights, Vol. 6, No.2, Violence, Health, and Human Rights (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovative measures have been pioneered in a number of countries to end violence against women. In Brazil and Jordan, [[women’s police stations]] have been introduced, and one-stop [[women's shelter]]s were created in Malaysia and Nicaragua.

[[Marital rape]] has been illegal in every American state and the District of Columbia since 1993, but is rarely prosecuted in America.&lt;ref name="rainn.org"&gt;[http://www.rainn.org/public-policy/sexual-assault-issues/marital-rape Marital Rape | RAINN | Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[UN General Assembly]] passed its first resolution calling for the protection of defenders of women's human rights.&lt;ref name="norwaypost.no"/&gt; The resolution urges states to put in place gender-specific laws and policies for the protection of women's human rights defenders and to ensure that defenders themselves are involved in the design and implementation of these measures, and calls on states to protect women's human rights defenders from reprisals for cooperating with the UN and to ensure their unhindered access to and communication with international human rights bodies and mechanisms.&lt;ref name="awid.org"/&gt;

=== Challenges faced by women in accessing justice and limitations of measures ===
There can be a de jure or de facto acceptance of violent behaviors and lack of remedies for victims.&lt;ref name="FRIED, Susana T 2003"/&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''Lack of criminalization'''. In many places, acts of abuse, especially acts such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[marital rape]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]], are not criminalized, or are illegal but widely tolerated, with the laws against them being rarely enforced. There are instances where crimes against women are also categorized as minor offenses.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Lack of awareness of the existing laws'''. In many places, although there are laws against violence on the books, many women do not know of their existence. This is especially the case with marital rape - its criminalization being very recent in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR27/002/2007/en/71da229c-d39d-11dd-a329-2f46302a8cc6/eur270022007en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6643727.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hungary law 'fails rape victims' | date=10 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.is/Jxnwm Article: Publicity urged for law on marital rape. | AccessMyLibrary - Promoting library advocacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''Challenges in making a case in court'''. The burden of proof can be placed on the victim. For instance in the Philippines, before a change in law in 1997, rape used to be described as a crime against chastity; and virginity played an important role in court. In various countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], a woman's past sexual experience continues to be very important in a case of rape.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bangladesh]] has received criticism for its employment of the "two-finger test" in rape investigations. This test consists in a physical examination of women who report rape during which a doctor inserts two fingers in the woman's vagina to determine whether the woman is "habituated to sex". This examination has its origin in the country's British colonial-era laws dating back to 1872. This deters many women from reporting rape. More than 100 experts, including doctors, lawyers, police, and women's rights activists had signed a joint statement in 2013 asking for the test, which they called "demeaning", to be abolished, as it "does not provide any evidence that is relevant to proving the offence." This test is also performed in several other countries in the region, including India. 
[http://www.blast.org.bd/content/pressrelease/press-release-nc-2-2-2013.pdf][http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/bangladesh-activists-urge-ban-on-rape-victim-finger-test-326175][http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/05/world/asia/rape-exam-india/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
It can also be difficult to make a case of sexual assault in court, when members of the judiciary expect evidence of severe struggle and injury as determinative evidence of non-consent. On the other hand, there are measures like the 2012 law in Brazil that allow for cases to be filed even without the representation of the victim.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; '''Existing laws are insufficient, conflicting, and have no effect in practice'''. Some laws on domestic violence, for instance, conflict with other provisions and ultimately contradict their goals. In Ukraine, a law on domestic violence also provides that the police can arrest the victim for « provocation ».&lt;ref name="FRIED, Susana T 2003"/&gt; Legal frameworks can also be flawed when laws that integrate protection do so in isolation, notably in relation to immigration laws. Undocumented women in countries where they would have, in theory, access to justice, don’t in practice for fear of being denounced and deported. The CEDAW Committee recommends that a State authority’s obligation to report undocumented persons be repealed in national legislation.

Measures to address violence against women range from access to legal-aid to the provision of shelters and hotlines for victims. Despite advances in legislation and policies, the lack of implementation of the measures put in place prevents significant progress in eradicating violence against women globally. This failure to apply existing laws and procedures is often due to the persisting issue of gender stereotyping.&lt;ref&gt;CEDAW, ''General discussion on women and access to justice'', UNOG, February 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The barriers that women face in participating in the justice system as lawyers, law enforcement officers etc. also play an important role in perpetuating a lack of concern for women victims of violence. In war and post-conflict times, women are often denied a seat at the negotiation table despite the role they may have played in peacebuilding processes, thus preventing issues such as sexual violence to be pushed forward on the agenda.

Measurement of the impact of these measures is also difficult due to a lack of data and coordination of efforts between policy-makers and implementing partners.

The relation between violence against women and marriage laws, regulations and traditions has also been discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/4/1/2/5/p41259_index.html?phpsessid=f010300715dd72dcad0107c9ca4fd030 Recognizing Marriage as a Symbolic Institution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.ro/books?id=9mlFgjEBYWYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+industrial+vagina&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BVQ7UqTUN-Tl4gTIoYGADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20industrial%20vagina&amp;f=false The Industrial Vagina: The Political Economy of the Global Sex Trade - Sheila Jeffreys - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The US and English law subscribed until the 20th century to the system of [[coverture]], that is, a legal doctrine under which, upon marriage, a woman's legal rights were subsumed by those of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-115.htm William Blackstone: Of Husband And Wife&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, outside the West, many countries severely restrict the rights of married women: for example, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Iraq]] husbands have a legal right to "punish" their wives. The criminal code states at Paragraph 41 that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right; examples of legal rights include: "The punishment of a wife by her husband, the disciplining by parents and teachers of children under their authority within certain limits prescribed by law or by custom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.case.edu/saddamtrial/documents/Iraqi_Penal_Code_1969.pdf Grotian Moment Blog &gt; Frederick K.

Claudia Card, professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, writes that:&lt;ref&gt;http://pol285.blog.gustavus.edu/files/2009/08/Card_Against_Marriage.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The legal rights of access that married partners have to each other’s persons, property, and lives makes it all but impossible for a spouse to defend herself (or himself), or to be protected against torture, rape, battery, stalking, mayhem, or murder by the other spouse... Legal marriage thus enlists state support for conditions conducive to murder and mayhem."
