VAW has a very long history, though the incidents and intensity of such violence have varied over time and between societies. Such violence is often seen as a mechanism for the subjugation of women, whether in society in general or in an [[interpersonal relationship]].{{sfnp|Brownmiller|1975|p=15-17}}{{sfnp|Miles|1988|p=1-14}}

The UN [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] states, "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women" and "violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm |title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women |publisher=United Nations General Assembly |access-date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kofi Annan]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], declared in a 2006 report posted on the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) website:&lt;blockquote&gt;Violence against women and girls is a problem of [[pandemic]] proportions.

==Definition==
A number of international instruments that aim to eliminate violence against women and domestic violence have been enacted by various international bodies. These generally start with a definition of what such violence is, and a proposal to combat it. The Istanbul Convention ([[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]]) of the [[Council of Europe]] describes VAW as "a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women" and defines VAW as "all acts of gender-based violence that result in or are likely to result in physical, sexual, psychological, or economic harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion, or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life".&lt;ref name="COE 210"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/210 |title=Details of Treaty No.210: Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence |publisher=Council of Europe |access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] makes recommendations relating to VAW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=General recommendations made by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/recomm.htm#recom1 |website=www.un.org |access-date=2015-05-08 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510132556/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/recommendations/recomm.htm#recom1 |archive-date=10 May 2015}}, General Recommendations 12 and 19&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] mentions VAW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=12 July 1993 |url=http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=topic&amp;tocid=459d17822&amp;toid=459b17a82&amp;docid=3ae6b39ec&amp;skip=O |title=Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action |publisher=UN General Assembly |access-date=3 April 2016}}, paragraph 18&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1993 United Nations General Assembly resolution on the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] was the first international instrument to explicitly define VAW and elaborate on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/global-norms-and-standards |title=What We Do: Ending Violence against Women: Global Norms and Standards |publisher=UN Women |access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions of VAW are set out in the 1994 ''Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence Against Women''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-61.html |title=Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment And Eradication of Violence Against Women "Convention of Belem Do Para" |publisher=Organization of American States |access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 2003 [[Maputo Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.achpr.org/files/instruments/women-protocol/achpr_instr_proto_women_eng.pdf |title=Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa |publisher=African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights |access-date=3 April 2016 |archive-date=2 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220302101029/http://www.achpr.org/files/instruments/women-protocol/achpr_instr_proto_women_eng.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the term ''gender-based violence'' refers to "any acts or threats of acts intended to hurt or make women suffer physically, sexually, or psychologically, and which affect women because they are women or affect women disproportionately".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Richters | first = J.M.

In ''Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence'', the Council of Europe stipulated that VAW "includes, but is not limited to, the following":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=30 April 2002 |url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383|title=Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence |publisher=Council of Europe Committee of Ministers |access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:a. violence occurring in the family or domestic unit, including, ''inter alia'', physical and mental aggression, emotional and psychological abuse, rape and sexual abuse, incest, rape between spouses, regular or occasional partners and cohabitants, crimes committed in the name of honour, female genital and sexual mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women such as forced marriages;

:b. violence occurring within the general community, including, ''inter alia'', rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in institutions or elsewhere; trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and economic exploitation and sex tourism;

:c. violence perpetrated or condoned by the state or its officials;

:d. violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict, in particular the taking of hostages, forced displacement, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation and economic exploitation.

These definitions of VAW as being gender-based are seen by some to be unsatisfactory. These definitions understand society as patriarchal, signifying unequal relations between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ertürk | first = Yakin | title = Towards a post-patriarchal gender order: confronting the universality and the particularity of violence against women | journal = Sociologisk Forskning | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 61&amp;ndash;70 | publisher = Sveriges Sociologförbund [Swedish Sociological Association] | jstor = 20853687 | date = 2009 | doi = 10.37062/sf.46.19221 | s2cid = 248629521 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of such definitions argue that the definitions disregard violence against men and that the term ''[[gender]]'', as used in ''gender-based violence'', only refers to women. Other critics argue that employing the term ''gender'' in this particular way introduces notions of inferiority and subordination for femininity and superiority for masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Visaria | first = Leela | title = Violence against women: a field study | journal = [[Economic and Political Weekly]] | volume = 35 | issue = 20 | pages = 1742&amp;ndash;1751 | publisher = Sameeksha Trust, Mumbai, India | jstor = 4409296 | date = 13 May 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 pp.96"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Michau | first = Lori | title = Approaching old problems in new ways: community mobilisation as a primary prevention strategy to combat violence against women | journal = Gender &amp; Development | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 95&amp;ndash;109 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] and [[Oxfam]] | doi = 10.1080/13552070601179144 | jstor = 20461184 | date = March 2007 | s2cid = 73218820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no widely accepted current definition that covers all the dimensions of gender-based violence.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Prügl |first=Elisabeth (Director) |title=Violence Against Women.

=== Forms of violence ===
Violence against women can fit into several broad categories. These include violence carried out by individuals as well as by states. Some of the forms of violence perpetrated by individuals are: [[rape]], [[domestic violence]], [[sexual harassment]], [[acid throwing]], [[reproductive coercion]], [[female infanticide]], [[sex-selective abortion|prenatal sex selection]], [[obstetric violence]], [[Online Gender-Based Violence|online gender-based violence]] and [[mob violence]]; as well as harmful customary or traditional practices such as [[honor killings]], [[dowry death|dowry violence]], [[female genital mutilation]], [[marriage by abduction]] and [[forced marriage]]. There are forms of violence that may be perpetrated or condoned by the government, such as [[war rape]]; [[sexual violence]] and [[sexual slavery]] during conflict, [[forced sterilization]]; [[forced abortion]]; violence by the police and authoritative personnel; [[stoning]] and [[flogging]]. Many forms of VAW, such as [[trafficking in women]] and [[forced prostitution]] are often perpetrated by organized criminal networks.&lt;ref name="Prügl, E. 2013" /&gt; Historically, there have been forms of organized WAV, such as the [[Witch trials in the early modern period]] or the [[sexual slavery]] of the [[comfort women]].
The Gender Equality Commission of the [[Council of Europe]] identifies nine forms of violence against women based on subject and context rather than life cycle or time period:&lt;ref name="Hagemann-White"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Carol Hagemann-White |date=February 2014 |title=Analytical study of the results of the fourth round of monitoring the implementation of Recommendation Rec(2002)5 on the protection of women against violence in Council of Europe member states |url=https://rm.coe.int/16805915e9 |access-date=5 April 2020 |publisher=Council of Europe Equality Division |pages=7, 8, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=[[Thorbjørn Jagland]] |date=May 2014 |title=State of democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Europe (2014) |url=https://edoc.coe.int/en/fundamental-freedoms/5949-state-of-democracy-human-rights-and-the-rule-of-law-in-europe.html |access-date=5 April 2020 |work=Report by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe |publisher=Council of Europe |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual harassment]] includes a range of actions with unwelcome sexual overtones, including verbal transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;Dziech, Billie Wright; Weiner, Linda.

===Survival sex===
{{See also|Survival sex|Violence against prostitutes}}
Women who are sex workers end up in the profession for several reasons. Some were victims of sexual and domestic abuse. Many women have said they were raped as working girls. They may be apprehensive about coming forward and reporting their attacks. When reported, many women have said that the stigma was too great and that the police told them they deserved it and were reluctant to follow police policy. Decriminalizing sex work is argued to help sex workers in this aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Violence Against Women in Prostitution in San Francisco. San Francisco: San Francisco, CA.

In some countries, it is common for older men to engage in "compensated dating" with underage girls. Such relationships are called [[enjo kōsai]] in Japan and are also common in Asian countries such as Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. The WHO condemned "economically coerced sex (e.g. school girls having sex with "sugar daddies" ([[Sugar baby]] in return for school fees)" as a form of violence against women.&lt;ref name="WHO_VAW"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Violence against women: Definition and scope of the problem, 1, 1-3 | url =https://www.who.int/gender/violence/v4.pdf | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | date = July 1997 | access-date = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women from certain lower castes have been involved in prostitution as part of a tradition, called [[Caste in the sex industry|Intergenerational prostitution]]. In pre-modern Korea, women from the [[Caste system in Korea|lower caste]] [[Cheonmin]], known as [[Kisaeng]], were trained to provide entertainment, conversation, and sexual services to men of the upper class.&lt;ref name="Cho103"&gt;{{cite book |last= Cho |first= Grace |title= Haunting the Korean Diaspora: Shame, Secrecy, and the Forgotten War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VagzEDjnZpcC&amp;pg=PA103 |publisher= [[University of Minnesota Press]] |year=2008 |isbn= 978-0816652754 |page= 103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women with illegal resident status are disproportionately involved with prostitution. For example, in 1997, ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' stated that 80% of prostitutes in [[Amsterdam]] were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |title=Netherlands – Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution |publisher=Uri.edu |access-date=26 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002222727/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/netherl.htm |archive-date=2 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage in which one or both parties are married against their will. Forced marriages are common in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The customs of [[bride price]] and [[dowry]], which exist in many parts of the world, contribute to this practice. A forced marriage is also often the result of a dispute between families, where the dispute is 'resolved' by giving a female from one family to the other.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

The custom of [[bride kidnapping]] continues to exist in some Central Asian countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and the Caucasus, or in parts of Africa, especially Ethiopia. A girl or woman is abducted by the would-be groom, who is often helped by his friends. The victim is often raped by the would be groom, after which he may try to negotiate a bride price with the village elders to legitimize the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''News articles'':

====Dowry violence====

[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|upright|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]

The custom of [[dowry]], which is common in South Asia, especially in India, is the trigger of many forms of violence against women. [[Bride burning]] is a form of violence against women in which a bride is killed at home by her husband or husband's family due to his dissatisfaction over the dowry provided by her family. [[Dowry death]] refers to the phenomenon of women and girls being killed or committing [[suicide]] due to disputes regarding dowry. Dowry violence is common in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. In India, in 2011 alone, the National Crime Records Bureau reported 8,618 dowry deaths, while unofficial figures suggest the numbers to be at least three times higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Confronting dowry-related violence in India: women at the center of justice | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | publisher = [[UN Women]] | date = 24 December 2012 | access-date = 18 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The legal rights of access that married partners have to each other's persons, property, and lives makes it all but impossible for a spouse to defend herself (or himself), or to be protected against torture, rape, battery, stalking, mayhem, or murder by the other spouse... Legal marriage thus enlists state support for conditions conducive to murder and mayhem.

International criticism concentrates on the lack of measures to combat violence against women in general and in particular on the lack of a national action plan to combat such violence and on the lack of legislation on domestic violence. (...) Compared to Sweden, Finland has been slower to reform legislation on violence against women. In Sweden, domestic violence was already illegal in 1864, while in Finland such violence was not outlawed until 1970, over a hundred years later. In Sweden the punishment of victims of incest was abolished in 1937, but not until 1971 in Finland. Rape within marriage was criminalised in Sweden in 1962, but the equivalent Finnish legislation only came into force in 1994 – making Finland one of the last European countries to criminalise marital rape. In addition, assaults taking place on private property did not become impeachable offences in Finland until 1995. Only in 1997 did victims of sexual offences and domestic violence in Finland become entitled to government-funded counselling and support services for the duration of their court cases. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] planning and research committees for the forthcoming [[DSM-5]] (2013) have canvassed a series of new [[Relational disorder]]s, which include ''Marital Conflict Disorder Without Violence'' or ''Marital Abuse Disorder (Marital Conflict Disorder With Violence)''.&lt;ref name="Personality"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = First | first1 = Michael B. | last2 = Bell | first2 = Carl C. | last3 = Cuthbert | first3 = Bruce | last4 = Krystal | first4 = John H. | last5 = Malison | first5 = Robert | last6 = Offord | first6 = David R. | last7 = Reiss | first7 = David | last8 = Shea | first8 = M.

Secondly, there is serious violence in the marriage that is "usually the husband battering the wife".&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|163}} In these cases the emergency room or a legal authority often is the first to notify the [[clinician]].

The authors conclude with what they call "very recent information"&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}} on the course of violent marriages, which suggests that "over time a husband's battering may abate somewhat, but perhaps because he has successfully [[intimidate]]d his wife. The risk of violence remains strong in a marriage in which it has been a feature in the past. Thus, treatment is essential here; the clinician cannot just wait and watch."&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}} The most urgent clinical priority is the protection of the wife because she is the one most frequently at risk, and clinicians must be aware that supporting assertiveness by a battered wife may lead to more beatings or even death.&lt;ref name="Personality" /&gt;{{rp|167, 168}}

Marital or spousal rape was once widely condoned or ignored by law and is now widely considered unacceptable violence against women, repudiated by international conventions, and increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal or is illegal but is widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative. The criminalization of spousal rape is recent, having occurred during the past few decades. Traditional understanding and views of [[marriage]], [[rape]], [[sexuality]], [[gender roles]] and [[self determination]] have started to be challenged in most Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s, which led to the criminalization of marital rape during the following decades. With a few notable exceptions, it was during the past 30 years that most laws against marital rape have been enacted. Some countries in Scandinavia and in the former Communist Bloc of Europe made spousal rape illegal before 1970, but most Western countries criminalized it only in the 1980s and 1990s. In many parts of the world the laws against marital rape are very new, having been enacted in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Anderson |first=Michelle J. |title=Marital Rape Laws Globally |date=2016-06-06 |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190238360.003.0012 |work=Marital Rape |pages=177–186 |access-date=2024-01-10 |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190238360.003.0012|isbn=978-0-19-023836-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], marital rape was made illegal in 1991. The views of Sir Matthew Hale, a 17th-century jurist, published in ''The History of the Pleas of the Crown'' (1736), stated that a husband cannot be guilty of the rape of his wife because the wife "hath given up herself in this kind to her husband, which she cannot retract"; in England and Wales, this would remain law for more than 250 years, until it was abolished by the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]], in the case of ''R v.

The relationship between some religions ([[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]) and marital rape is controversial. The [[Bible]] at 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 explains that one has a "conjugal duty" to have sexual relations with one's spouse (in sharp opposition to [[sex outside marriage]], which is considered a [[sin]]) and states, "The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+corinthians%207:3-7:5&amp;version=NKJV |title=1 corinthians 7:3-7:5 NKJV | website = biblegateway.com |publisher=[[BibleGateway.com|Bible Gateway]] |access-date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some conservative religious figures interpret this as rejecting to possibility of marital rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adn.com/2011/07/22/1980301/readers-blast-valley-paper-over.html |title=Valley paper criticized over pastor's column on spousal rape |work=[[Alaska Dispatch]] |date=22 July 2011 |access-date=6 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203959/http://www.adn.com/2011/07/22/1980301/readers-blast-valley-paper-over.html |archive-date=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam makes reference to sexual relations in marriage too, notably: "Allah's Apostle said, 'If a husband calls his wife to his bed (i.e. to have sexual relation) and she refuses and causes him to sleep in anger, the angels will curse her till morning';"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/bukhari/bh4/bh4_464.htm |title=Hadith 4:460 | website = Sacred-texts.com |publisher=[[Internet Sacred Text Archive]] |access-date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several comments on the issue of marital rape made by Muslim religious leaders have been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Halliday | first =Josh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/nov/08/islam-channel-ofcom |title=Islam Channel censured by Ofcom |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 November 2010 |access-date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7843909.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Cleric 'must deny' views on rape | date=22 January 2009 | access-date = 11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dating abuse, or dating violence, is the perpetration of coercion, intimidation, or assault in the context of [[dating]] or [[courtship]]. It is also when one partner tries to maintain [[abusive power and control]].

Female genital mutilation (FGM) is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as "all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons".&lt;ref name="WHO FGM"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Female genital mutilation (factsheet) |url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date= June 2000 |access-date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO states: "The procedure has no health benefits for girls and women" and "Procedures can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility, and complications in childbirth increase the risk of newborn deaths".&lt;ref name="WHO FGM"/&gt;

According to a 2016 UNICEF report, the top rates for FGM are in Somalia (with 98 percent of women affected), Guinea (97 percent), Djibouti (93 percent), Egypt (87 percent), Eritrea (83 percent), Mali (89 percent), Sierra Leone (90 percent), Sudan (87 percent), Gambia (75 percent), Burkina Faso (76 percent), Ethiopia (74 percent), Mauritania (69 percent), Liberia (50 percent), and Guinea-Bissau (45 percent).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |last=UNICEF |date=2016 |title=Female Genital Mutilation: A global concern |url=https://data.unicef.org/resources/female-genital-mutilationcutting-global-concern/ |website=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of the cases documented by Unicef are concentrated in just three countries (Indonesia,  Egypt  and  Ethiopia).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021224539/http://data.unicef.org/corecode/uploads/document6/uploaded_pdfs/corecode/FGM-C-Brochure-7_15-Final-LR_167.pdf | title=Female genital mutilation/cutting: What might the future hold? | url=http://data.unicef.org/corecode/uploads/document6/uploaded_pdfs/corecode/FGM-C-Brochure-7_15-Final-LR_167.pdf | archive-date=2014-10-21 | website=data.unicef.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

FGM is linked to cultural rites and customs, including traditional practices, and religion. It continues to take place in different communities in Africa and the Middle East, including in places where it is banned by national legislation. According to a 2016 UNICEF report, at least 200  million of women and girls in Africa and the Middle East have experienced FGM.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Due to globalization and immigration, FGM is spreading beyond the borders of Africa and the Middle East to countries such as Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, the U.S., and UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | chapter = Judging other cultures: the case of genital mutilation | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=43U8DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120 | editor-last = Nussbaum | editor-first = Martha | editor-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = Sex &amp; social justice | pages = [https://archive.org/details/sexsocialjustice00nuss/page/120 120–121] | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0195110326 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/sexsocialjustice00nuss/page/120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although FGM is today associated with developing countries, this practice was common until the 1970s in parts of the Western world, too.

===Honor killings===
[[Honor killings]] are a common form of violence against women in certain parts of the world.

===Restrictions around menstruation===
[[File:Mass-Community Health Teaching.JPG|thumb|Awareness raising through education is taking place among young girls to modify or eliminate the practice of chhaupadi in Nepal.]]
{{see also|Chhaupadi}}
Women in some cultures are forced into [[social isolation]] during their [[menstruation|menstrual period]]s. In parts of Nepal, for instance, they are forced to live in sheds, are forbidden to touch men or even to enter the courtyard of their own homes, and are barred from consuming milk, yogurt, butter, meat, and various other foods for fear they will contaminate those goods. Women have died during this period because of starvation, bad weather, or bites by snakes.&lt;ref&gt;''Articles'':

===Forced pregnancy===
{{Main|Forced pregnancy}}
[[Forced pregnancy]] is the practice of forcing a woman or girl to become [[pregnant]]. A common motivation for this is to help establish a [[forced marriage]], including by means of [[bride kidnapping]]. This was also used as part of a program of breeding [[slave]]s (see [[Slave breeding in the United States]]). In the 20th century, state mandated forced marriage with the aim of increasing the population was practiced by some authoritarian governments, notably during the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]], which systematically forced people into marriages ordering them to have children, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Natalae | title = Memorandum: Charging forced marriage as a crime against humanity | url = http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf | publisher = Documentation Center of Cambodia | date = 22 September 2010 | access-date = 8 October 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171020153617/http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf | archive-date = 20 October 2017 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of ''forced continuation of pregnancy'' (i.e. denying a woman safe and legal abortion) is also seen by some organizations as a violation of women's rights. For example, the [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women's sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | author-link = Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women#Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women | title = General recommendation No. 35 on gender-based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19 | url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf | publisher = [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) | id = CEDAW/C/GC/35 | date = 14 July 2017 | quote = "Violations of women's sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, ''criminalisation of abortion'', ''denial or delay of safe abortion and post abortion care'', ''forced continuation of pregnancy'', abuse and mistreatment of women and girls seeking sexual and reproductive health information, goods and services, are forms of gender based violence that, depending on the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment]]." | access-date = 8 October 2017 | archive-date = 20 February 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190220225958/https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, in some parts of Latin America, with very strict anti-abortion laws, pregnant women avoid the medical system due to fear of being investigated by the authorities if they have a miscarriage, or a stillbirth, or other problems with the pregnancy. Prosecuting such women is quite common in places such as [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/07/el-salvador-rape-survivor-sentenced-to-30-years-in-jail-under-extreme-anti-abortion-law/|title=El Salvador: Rape survivor sentenced to 30 years in jail under extreme anti-abortion law|website=www.amnesty.org|date=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-32491838/el-salvador-women-jailed-for-miscarriages|title=Jailed for a miscarriage|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Prügl, E.

Women are, in many parts of the world, severely restricted in their [[freedom of movement]].
Freedom of movement is an essential right, recognized by international instruments, including Article 15 (4) of [[CEDAW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =  UN General Assembly | author-link =  UN General Assembly | title = The convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women (CEDAW) | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140326154350/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm | archive-date = 26 March 2014 | url = http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm | publisher = [[UN Women|UN Women, Division for the Advancement of Women]] | date = 1979 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in some countries, women are not legally allowed to leave home without a [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|male guardian]] (male relative or husband).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lee | first = Dave | title = Saudi Arabian woman challenges male guardianship laws | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13932287 | work = [[BBC World Service]] | date = 29 June 2011 | access-date = 3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia was the only country in the world where women were [[Women to drive movement|forbidden to drive]] motor vehicles until June 2018.&lt;ref name=bashraheel&gt;{{cite news|title=Women's transport: Solutions needed|author=Laura Bashraheel|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/325728|newspaper=[[Arab News]]|date=27 June 2009|access-date=6 October 2012|archive-date=7 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407203350/http://www.arabnews.com/node/325728|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
Sex crimes such as adultery and [[sex outside marriage]] are disproportionately levelled against women and the punishment is often [[stoning]] and [[flogging]]. This has been seen in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Batha | first = Emma | title = FACTBOX: Stoning - where does it happen? | work = [[Thomson Reuters Foundation News]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160125051613/http://news.trust.org//item/20130927165059-w9g0i | archive-date = 25 January 2016 | url = http://news.trust.org//item/20130927165059-w9g0i | publisher = [[Thomson Reuters Foundation]] | date = 29 September 2013 | access-date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally this can deter victims of [[sexual violence]] from reporting the crime, because the victims may themselves be punished (if they cannot prove their case, if they are deemed to have been in the company of an unrelated male, or if they were unmarried and not virgins at the time of the rape).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lang | first = Olivia | title=Maldives girl to get 100 lashes for pre-marital sex | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21595814 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=26 February 2013 | access-date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jamali |first=Hasan |url=http://www.today.com/id/15836746/ns/today-today_news/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/ |title=Rape case brings Saudi laws into focus |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] |publisher=[[NBC]] |agency=Associated Press |date=Nov 21, 2006 |access-date=19 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019125957/http://www.today.com/id/15836746/ns/today-today_news/t/rape-case-calls-saudi-legal-system-question/ |archive-date=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another aspect is the denial of medical care often occurs with regard to reproductive and sexual health. Sometimes women themselves avoid the medical system for fear of being reported to the police or facing family violence due to having [[premarital sex]] or being the victims of [[sexual violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=katharina.kiener-manu |title=Crime Prevention &amp; Criminal Justice Module 9 Key Issues: Topic 1 - Gender-based discrimination and women in conflict with the law |url=https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/crime-prevention-criminal-justice/module-9/key-issues/1--gender-based-discrimination-and-women-in-conflict-with-the-law.html |access-date=2024-01-10 |website=www.unodc.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Politics ====
Violence Against Women in Politics (VAWP) is the act or threat of physical, emotional or psychological violence against female politicians on the basis of their [[gender]], most often with the intent of discouraging the victims and other female politicians from participating in the political process. VAWP has been growing in significance among the fields of gendered political science and feminist political theory studies. The main intent behind creating a separate category that is distinct from Violence Against Women, is to highlight the barriers faced by women who work in politics, or wish to pursue a career in the political realm. VAWP is unique from Violence Against Women in three important ways: victims are targeted because of their gender; the violence itself can be gendered (i.e., sexism, sexual violence); the primary goal is to deter women from participating in politics (including but not limited to voting, running for office, campaigning, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2016 |title=Sexism, harassment, and violence against women parliamentarians |url=https://www.ipu.org/resources/publications/issue-briefs/2016-10/sexism-harassment-and-violence-against-women-parliamentarians |journal=Inter-Parliamentary Union Issues Brief |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230920191211/https://www.ipu.org/resources/publications/issue-briefs/2016-10/sexism-harassment-and-violence-against-women-parliamentarians |archive-date= Sep 20, 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to distinguish VAWP from [[political violence]], which is defined by the use or threats of force to reach political ends, and can be experienced by all politicians.&lt;ref name="Krook-2020"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Krook |first1=Mona Lena |last2=Sanín |first2=Juliana Restrepo |date=September 2020 |title=The Cost of Doing Politics? Analyzing Violence and Harassment against Female Politicians |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=740–755 |doi=10.1017/S1537592719001397 |s2cid=198599058 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While women's participation in national parliaments has been increasing, rising from 11% in 1995 to 26.5% in 2023, there is still a large disparity between male and female [[Representation (politics)|representation]] in governmental politics.&lt;ref name="UN Women"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Facts and figures: Women's leadership and political participation |url=https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-political-participation/facts-and-figures|access-date=2021-02-26|website=UN Women|language=en |date=18 September 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding [[Women in government|women's participation in government]] is a crucial goal for many countries, as female politicians have proven invaluable with respect to bringing certain issues to the forefront, such as elimination of gender-based violence, parental leave and childcare, pensions, gender-equality laws, electoral reform, and providing fresh perspectives on numerous policy areas that have typically remained a male-dominated realm.&lt;ref name="UN Women" /&gt; In order to increase women's participation in an effective manner, the importance of recognizing the issues related to VAWP and making every effort to provide the necessary resources to victims and condemn any and all hostile behaviour in political institutions cannot be understated. Experiencing VAWP can dissuade women from remaining in politics (and lead to an early exit from their career or from aspiring higher political office. Witnessing women in politics experience VAWP can serve as one of many deterrents for aspirants to run for office and for candidates to continue campaigning.&lt;ref name="Krook-2020" /&gt;

Acts of [[violence]] or [[harassment]] are often not deemed to be gendered when they are reported, if they are reported at all. VAWP is often dismissed as "the cost of doing politics" and reporting can be seen as "political suicide", which contributes to the normalization of VAWP.&lt;ref name="Krook-2020" /&gt; This ambiguity results in a lack of information regarding attacks and makes the issue appear to be relatively commonplace. While it is reported that [[Women in government|women in politics]] are more often targeted by violence than their male counterparts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Schneider|first1=Paige|title=Conceptualizing more inclusive elections: violence against women in elections and gendered electoral violence|date=2020-11-25|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003051954-4|work=Building Inclusive Elections|pages=60–77|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-003-05195-4|access-date=2021-02-26|last2=Carroll|first2=David|doi=10.4324/9781003051954-4|s2cid=241638877}}&lt;/ref&gt; the specific cause is often not reported as a gendered crime. This makes it more difficult to pinpoint where the links between gender-specific violence and political violence really are. In many countries, the practice of electoral politics is traditionally considered to be a [[Masculinity|masculine]] domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garnett |first1=Holly Ann |last2=James |first2=Toby S. |title=Measuring electoral integrity: using practitioner knowledge to assess elections |journal=Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties |date=3 July 2021 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=348–367 |doi=10.1080/17457289.2020.1824186 |s2cid=224924792 |url=https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/76913/1/Garnett_and_James_Manuscript_R2_8000_words_single_file.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of male dominated politics has allowed some male politicians to believe they have a right to participate in politics while women should not, since women's participation is a threat to the social order. Women in positions of power are thus more likely than their male counterparts to receive threats and experience violence. As one professor of sociology, Marie E. Berry, wrote: "as women are trained and encouraged to vie for these seats, they risk taking power (and resources) that male politicians see as rightfully theirs, opening them up to the risk of violence and other efforts to limit the effectiveness of their campaigns."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Violence Against Female Politicians |url=https://www.cfr.org/article/violence-against-female-politicians |access-date=2024-01-10 |website=Council on Foreign Relations |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-09-21 |title=Violence against female politicians |url=https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/violence-against-female-politicians |access-date=2024-01-10 |website=CEPR |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

48% of [[Political violence|electoral violence]] against women is against supporters, this is most likely the largest percentage as it has the largest amount of the public participating. 9% of electoral violence against women is targeting candidates, while 22% targets female voters. This means that women who are directly acting in politics are likely to face some form of violence, whether physical or emotional.&lt;ref name="Bardall-2011"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bardall |first=Gabrielle |title=Breaking the Mold: Understanding Gender and Electoral Violence |publisher=International Foundation for Electoral Systems |year=2011 |location=United States |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding violence against female politicians, younger women and those with [[Intersectionality|intersecting identities]], particularly racial and ethnic minorities, are more likely to be targets. Female politicians who outwardly express and act from feminist perspectives are also more likely to be victimized.&lt;ref name="Krook-2020" /&gt;

===== Sub-types =====
Gabrielle Bardell's 2011 report "Breaking the mold: Understanding Gender and Electoral Violence" was one of the first documents published that showed examples and figures for how women are intimidated and attacked in politics.&lt;ref name="Bardall-2011" /&gt; Since Bardall's report, other scholars have conducted further research on the topic. Notably, Mona Lena Krook's work on VAWP introduced 5 forms of violence and harassment: physical, sexual, psychological, economic, and semiotic/symbolic. Physical violence encompasses inflicting, or attempting to inflict, bodily harm and injury.&lt;ref name="Krook-2020" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal of Democracy"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Violence Against Women in Politics |url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/violence-against-women-in-politics/ |access-date=2023-03-26 |website=Journal of Democracy |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While physical violence is the most easily identified form, it is actually the least common type.&lt;ref name="Krook-2020" /&gt; Sexual violence involves (attempts at) sexual acts through coercion, including unwanted sexual comments, advances, and harassment.&lt;ref name="Krook-2020" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal of Democracy" /&gt; Psychological violence includes causing emotional and mental damage through means of death/rape threats, stalking, etc.&lt;ref name="Krook-2020" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal of Democracy" /&gt; Economic violence involves denying, withholding, and controlling female politicians' access to financial resources, particularly regarding campaigns.&lt;ref name="Krook-2020" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal of Democracy" /&gt; Semiotic or symbolic violence, the most abstract subtype of VAWP, refers to the erasure of female politicians through degrading images and sexist language.&lt;ref name="Krook-2020" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal of Democracy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Krook-2022"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krook |first1=Mona Lena |title=Semiotic Violence against Women: Theorizing Harms against Female Politicians |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |date=2022 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=371–397 |doi=10.1086/716642 |s2cid=244923072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Krook theorizes that semiotic violence against women in politics works in two related ways: rendering women invisible and rendering women incompetent. By symbolically removing women from the public political sphere, semiotic violence renders women invisible. Examples include using masculine grammar when speaking about and to political women, interrupting female politicians, and not portraying political women in the media. By highlighting the role incongruity between stereotypically feminine attributes (e.g., warm, polite, submissive), and traits typically ascribed to good leaders (e.g., strong, powerful, assertive), semiotic violence emphasizes that women are incompetent to be political actors.&lt;ref name="Krook-2022" /&gt; This form of semiotic violence can manifest through denying and minimizing women's political qualifications, sexual objectification, and labeling political women as emotional, among other actions.&lt;ref name="Krook-2022" /&gt;

==== Higher education ====
{{Further|Campus sexual assault}}
Sexual violence on college campuses is considered a major problem in the United States. According to the conclusion of a major Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study: "The CSA Study data suggest women at universities are at considerable risk for experiencing sexual assault."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Krebs | first1 = Christopher P. | last2 =Lindquist | first2 = Christine H. | last3 =Warner | first3 = Tara D. | last4 =Fisher | first4 = Bonnie S. | last5 =Martin | first5 = Sandra L. | title = Campus sexual assault (CSA) study: final report | publisher = [[RTI International]] | url = https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=243011 | date = October 2007 }} {{NCJ|243011}} [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sports ====
Sport-related violence against women is any physical, sexual, mental acts that are "perpetrated by both male athletes and by male fans or consumers of sport and sporting events, as well as by coaches of female athletes".&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Catherine|title=Violence against women and sport: Literature review|year=2011|publisher=Durham University|location=London|pages=2–5|url=http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/22/violence-against-women-and-sport-a-literature-review-by-dr-catherine-palmer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106162130/http://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/resources/22/violence-against-women-and-sport-a-literature-review-by-dr-catherine-palmer|archive-date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documenting reports and literature suggest that there are obvious connections between contemporary sport and violence against women. Such events as the [[2010 World Cup]], the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] "have highlighted the connections between sports spectatorship and intimate partner violence, and the need for police, authorities and services to be aware of this when planning sporting events".&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer" /&gt; Sport-related violence occurs in various contexts and places, including homes, pubs, clubs, hotel rooms, the streets.&lt;ref name="Catherine Palmer" /&gt;

Violence against women is a topic of concern in the United States' collegiate athletic community. From the 2010 UVA lacrosse murder, in which a male athlete was charged guilty with second degree murder of his girlfriend, to the 2004 University of Colorado Football Scandal when players were charged with nine alleged sexual assaults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vaughan|first=Kevin|title=Colorado woman seeks justice in alleged sexual assault Read more: Colorado woman seeks justice in alleged sexual assault|url=http://www.denverpost.com/firstinthepost/ci_12557039|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=9 June 2009|access-date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies suggest that athletes are at higher risk for committing sexual assault against women than the average student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brady|first=Jeff|author-link=Jeff Brady (reporter)|title=Scandal Returns to University of Colorado Football|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105381707|work=[[Weekend Edition]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|access-date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chandler1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandler|first1=Steve B.|last2=Johnson|first2=Dewayne J.|last3=Carroll|first3=Pamela S.|title=Abusive behaviors of college athletes | journal = [[College Student Journal]] | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 638&amp;ndash;645 | publisher = [[University of South Alabama]] | date = 1 December 1999 |oclc=193500507}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that one in three college assaults are committed by athletes.&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mak|first=Stephanie|title=Are athletes more abusive than the rest of the student population?|url=http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/hurj/issue3/spotlight-mak.html|journal=Hopkins Undergraduate Research Journal Online|access-date=12 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229044851/http://web1.johnshopkins.edu/hurj/issue3/spotlight-mak.html|archive-date=29 February 2012|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys suggest that male student athletes who represent 3.3% of the college population, commit 19% of reported sexual assaults and 35% of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|title=Game stats|publisher=The National Coalition Against Violent Athletes (NCVA)|access-date=27 December 2017|url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117092517/http://www.ncava.org/statistics.html|archive-date=17 November 2016|url=http://www.ncava.org:80/statistics.html}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The theories that surround these statistics range from misrepresentation of the student-athlete to an unhealthy mentality towards women within the team itself.&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1" /&gt; Sociologist Timothy Curry, after conducting an observational analysis of two big time sports' locker room conversations, deduced that the high risk of male student athletes for gender abuse is a result of the team's subculture.&lt;ref name="Curry1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curry|first=Timothy Jon|title=Fraternal Bonding in the Locker Room: A Profeminist Analysis of Talk About Competition And Women|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|year=1991|volume=8|issue=2|pages=119–135 |url=http://www.umt.edu/sociology/faculty_staff/ellestad/documents/275_Curry1991fraternalbondinginthelockerroom_s10.pdf |access-date=12 March 2012|doi=10.1123/ssj.8.2.119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curry states, "Their locker room talk generally treated women as objects, encouraged sexist attitudes toward women and, in its extreme, promoted rape culture."&lt;ref name="Curry1991" /&gt; He proposes that this objectification is a way for the male to reaffirm his heterosexual status and hyper-masculinity. Claims have been made that the atmosphere changes when an outsider (especially women) intrude in the locker room.&lt;ref name="Disch" /&gt;

In the wake of the reporter [[Lisa Olson]] being harassed by a Patriots player in the locker room in 1990, she said, "We are taught to think we must have done something wrong and it took me a while to realize I hadn't done anything wrong."&lt;ref name="Disch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Disch|first=Lisa|author2=Kane, Mary Jo |title=When a Looker is Really a Bitch: Lisa Olson, Sport, and the Heterosexual Matrix|journal=Signs|date=Winter 1996|volume=21|issue=2|pages=278–308|jstor=3175065|doi=10.1086/495067|s2cid=145061857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other female sports reporters (college and professional) have said that they often brush off the players' comments, which leads to further objectification.&lt;ref name="Disch" /&gt; Some sociologists challenge this assertion. Steve Chandler says that because of their celebrity status on campus, "athletes are more likely to be scrutinized or falsely accused than non-athletes."&lt;ref name="chandler1999" /&gt; Stephanie Mak says that "if one considers the 1998 estimates that about three million women were battered and almost one million raped, the proportion of incidences{{verify spelling|date=September 2022|reason=''incidence'' is normally used only in the singular form, perhaps ''incidence'', ''incidents'',  or ''instances'' was intended}} that involve athletes in comparison to the regular population is relatively small."&lt;ref name="johnshopkins1" /&gt;

==== Military ====
A 1995 study of female war veterans found that 90 percent had been sexually harassed. A 2003 survey found that 30 percent of female vets said they were raped in the military and a 2004 study of veterans who were seeking help for post-traumatic stress disorder found that 71 percent of the women said they were sexually assaulted or raped while serving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Benedict | first = Helen | title = The plight of women soldiers |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570 |work=The Nation |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=6 May 2009 |access-date= 10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cyberbullying ====
[[Cyberbullying]] is a form of intimidation using electronic forms of contact. In the 21st century, cyberbullying has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers in Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Peter K. |last2=Mahdavi |first2=Jess |last3=Carvalho |first3=Manuel |last4=Fisher |first4=Sonja |last5=Russell |first5=Shanette |last6=Tippett |first6=Neil | title = Cyberbullying: its nature and impact in secondary school pupils | journal = [[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 376&amp;ndash;385 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01846.x |pmid=18363945 | date = 2008 |s2cid=28942016 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 75% of women have encountered harassment and threats of violence online, known as [[cyber violence]], as reported by the [[United Nations Broadband Commission]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/9/cyber-violence-report-press-release |title=cyber violence report press release |date=24 September 2015 |publisher=UN Women |access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misogynistic rhetoric is prevalent online, and the public debate over gender-based attacks has increased significantly, leading to calls for policy interventions and better responses by social networks like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Jane |first= Emma Alice | title = 'Back to the kitchen, cunt': speaking the unspeakable about online misogyny  | journal = [[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]] | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 558&amp;ndash;570 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/10304312.2014.924479 | date = 2014 |s2cid= 144492709 | hdl = 1959.4/unsworks_81563 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Filipovic |first= Jill | title = Blogging while female: how internet misogyny parallels real-world harassment | journal = [[Yale Journal of Law and Feminism]] | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 295&amp;ndash;303 | publisher = [[Yale Law School]] | date = 2007 | url = http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yjlf/vol19/iss1/10/ }} [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1268&amp;context=yjlf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some specialists have argued that gendered online attacks should be given particular attention within the wider category of hate speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=KhosraviNik |first1=Majid |last2=Esposito |first2=Eleonora |title=Online hate, digital discourse and critique: Exploring digitally-mediated discursive practices of gender-based hostility |journal=Lodz Papers in Pragmatics |date=26 June 2018 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=45–68 |doi=10.1515/lpp-2018-0003 |s2cid=149965889 |url=https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/fulltext.aspx?url=251602/322E5DAA-E68C-486D-8EBC-FD98202D4745.pdf&amp;pub_id=251602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abusers quickly identified opportunities online to humiliate their victims, destroy their careers, reputations and relationships, and even drive them to suicide or "trigger so-called 'honor' violence in societies where sex outside of marriage is seen as bringing shame on a family".&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{cite web |title=Internet Bringing New Forms of Violence Against Women |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/10/28/internet-bringing-new-forms-violence-against-women |website=Human Rights Watch |language=en |date=28 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a poll conducted by Amnesty International in 2018 across 8 countries, 23% of women have experienced online abuse of harassment.

According to Human Rights Watch, 90% of those who experienced sexual violence online in 2019 were women and girls.&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt;

==== Journalists ====
According to [[UNESCO]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dr. Rumman Chowdhury |title=Technology-Facilitated Gender-Based Violence in an Era of Generative AI |date=2023 |publisher=UNESCO |isbn=978-92-3-100631-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; women journalists in prominent and visible positions tend to attract more virulent abuse. In their survey of 901 journalists, nearly three quarters (73%) said they had experienced online violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=UNESCO |date=2021 |title=The Chilling: global trends in online violence against women journalists; research discussion paper |url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000377223.locale=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another survey by [[The Guardian]] that looked at comments received on articles,  women writers were 4 times more likely to be abused  compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Gardiner |first1=Becky |last2=Mansfield |first2=Mahana |last3=Anderson |first3=Ian |last4=Holder |first4=Josh |last5=Louter |first5=Daan |last6=Ulmanu |first6=Monica |date=2016-04-12 |title=The dark side of Guardian comments |url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments |access-date=2024-02-07 |work=the Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a trend that is persistent across geography - in the Netherlands, 82% of the 300 female journalists surveyed in 2022 said they encountered abuse online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=International Press Institute |date=2023-03-24 |title=Netherlands: Women journalists facing widespread online harassment |url=https://ipi.media/netherlands-women-journalists-facing-widespread-online-harassment/ |access-date=2024-02-07 |website=International Press Institute |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Generative AI ====
[[Generative AI]] can lead to an increase in the number of attackers, the creation of sustained and automated attacks and the generation of content such as posts, texts, and emails that are written convincingly from multiple ‘voices’. This makes existing harms such as [[hate speech]], [[cyber harassment]], [[misinformation]], and [[Impersonator|impersonation]] - all of which rank in the top five most common vectors of technology-facilitated gender-based violence - have a much wider reach and be more dangerous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Video games====

Video games with graphically sexual content have been criticized by scholars for promoting the indecent portrayal of women.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Imran |first=Mohd |date=2021-08-19 |title=Sexual Violence Depicted Against Women in Video Games: The Effect of Virtual World on the Real World |url=https://www.academia.edu/75793127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games like now banned [[RapeLay]], [[Custer's Revenge]], and [[Grand Theft Auto]] incorporate the objectification of women within their plot lines to attract more players, majority of whom are male, but perpetuate a culture of exaggerated gender stereotypes and [[toxic masculinity]].&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; A study found that 21% of video games feature violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alias |first=Dilla |date=1998-01-01 |title=An examination of violence and gender role portrayals in video games: Implications for gender socialization and aggressive behavior |url=https://www.academia.edu/830776 |journal=Sex Roles}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional study has shown that players of these violent and sexual video games often have more accepting attitudes to rape, also known as [[Rape myth|rape myth acceptance]],&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=Victoria Simpson |last2=Boys |first2=Stephanie |last3=Rose |first3=Christopher |last4=Beck |first4=Eric |date=October 2012 |title=Violence Against Women in Video Games: A Prequel or Sequel to Rape Myth Acceptance? |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260512441078 |journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence |language=en |volume=27 |issue=15 |pages=3016–3031 |doi=10.1177/0886260512441078 |pmid=22550147 |issn=0886-2605}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the hyperrealism when playing these video games results in a difficult differentiation between the digital and real world.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Effect on society==
According to an article published in the ''[[Health and Human Rights (journal)|Health and Human Rights]]'' journal,&lt;ref name="Fried"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fried |first=Susana T. |date=2003 |title=Violence against women |journal=[[Health and Human Rights]] |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=88&amp;ndash;111 |doi=10.2307/4065431 |jstor=4065431}} [https://cdn2.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/125/2014/04/6-Fried.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of many years of advocacy and involvement of many feminist activist organizations, the issue of violence against women still "remains one of the most pervasive forms of human rights violations worldwide".&lt;ref name="Fried"/&gt;{{rp|91}} The violence against women can occur in both public and private spheres of life and at any time of their life span. Violence against women often keeps women from wholly contributing to social, economic, and political development of their communities.&lt;ref name="Fried"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Political Stud."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bardall |first1=Gabrielle |last2=Bjarnegård |first2=Elin |last3=Piscopo |first3=Jennifer M |title=How is Political Violence Gendered?

Most often, violence against women has been framed as a health issue, and also as a [[violation of human rights]]. The research seems to provide convincing evidence that violence against women is a severe and pervasive problem the world over, with devastating effects on the health and well-being of women and children.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women"&gt;{{cite book |last=UN |url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/violenceagainstwomenstudydoc.pdf1 |title=In-depth study on all forms of violence against women.

Importantly, other than the issue of social divisions, gendered violence can also extend into the realm of health issues and become a direct concern of the [[public health]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Colarossi | first = Lisa | title = A response to Danis &amp; Lockhart: What guides social work knowledge about violence against women? | journal = Journal of Social Work Education | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 147&amp;ndash;159 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] on behalf of the [[Council on Social Work Education]] (CSWE) |doi=10.5175/JSWE.2005.200400418 | jstor = 23044038 | date = Winter 2005 | s2cid = 143655449 }}

Women who have HIV/AIDS infection are also among the targets of the violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}} The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that violence against women puts an undue burden on health care services, as women who have suffered violence are more likely to need health services and at higher cost, compared to women who have not suffered violence.&lt;ref name="WHO VAM Factsheet" /&gt; The Council of Europe describes violence against women in private sphere, at home or [[domestic violence]], as the main reason of "death and disability" among the women who encountered violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;{{rp|91}}

In addition, several studies have shown a link between poor treatment of women and international violence. These studies show that one of the best predictors of inter- and intranational violence is the maltreatment of women in the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Maffly | first = Brian | title = BYU study links women's safety, nation's peace | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100202080318/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11967564 | archive-date = 2 February 2010 | url = http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11967564 | work = [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] | date = 21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Strearmer | first1 = Matthew | last2 = Emmett | first2 = Chad F.|url=http://www.womanstats.org/images/StearmerEmmettAPSA07.pdf |title=The great divide: Revealing differences in the Islamic world regarding the status of women and its impact on international peace |publisher= [[WomanStats Project]] |date=2007 |access-date=6 August 2014}} Paper prepared for presentation at the annual meeting of the [[American Political Science Association]], Chicago, Illinois, 29 August – 1 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence and extent==
According to the UN, "there is no region of the world, no country and no culture in which women's freedom from violence has been secured."&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt; Several forms of violence are more prevalent in certain parts of the world, often in [[developing countries]]. For example, [[dowry death|dowry violence]] and [[bride burning]] is associated with India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. [[Acid throwing]] is also associated with these countries, as well as in Southeast Asia, including Cambodia. [[Honor killing]] is associated with the Middle East and South Asia. [[Female genital mutilation]] is found mostly in Africa, and to a lesser extent in the Middle East and some other parts of Asia. [[Marriage by abduction]] is found in [[Ethiopia]], [[Central Asia]], and the [[Caucasus]]. Abuse related to payment of [[bride price]] (such as violence, trafficking, and forced marriage) is linked to parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania (also see [[Lobolo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Papua New Guinea: police cite bride price major factor in marital violence | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150218182845/http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/News-and-Views/papua-new-guinea-police-cite-bride-price-major-factor-marital-violence | archive-date = 18 February 2015 |url= http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/News-and-Views/papua-new-guinea-police-cite-bride-price-major-factor-marital-violence | work = Island Business |via=Violence is not our Culture |date=21 November 2011 |access-date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An exploratory study of bride price and domestic violence in Bundibugyo District, Uganda |url=http://www.mrc.ac.za/gender/Bridepricedomesticviolence.pdf |publisher=Centre for Human Rights Advancement (CEHURA) and [[South African Medical Research Council]] |date=April 2012 |access-date=6 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717105205/http://www.mrc.ac.za/gender/Bridepricedomesticviolence.pdf |archive-date=17 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2002 estimated that at least one in five women in the world had been physically or sexually abused by a man sometime in their lives, and "gender-based violence accounts for as much death and ill-health in women aged 15–44 years as cancer, and is a greater cause of ill-health than malaria and traffic accidents combined."&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Venis |first1=Sarah |last2=Horton |first2=Richard |date=6 April 2002 |title=Violence against women: a global burden |journal=[[The Lancet]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=359 |issue=9313 |page=1172 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08251-X |pmid=11955533 |s2cid=41832376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 survey by the [[National Institute of Justice]] found that 19.0% of college women and 6.1% of college men experienced either sexual assault or attempted sexual assault since entering college.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krebs |first1=Christopher P. |last2=Lindquist |first2=Christine H. |last3=Warner |first3=Tara D. |last4=Fisher |first4=Bonnie S. |last5=Martin |first5=Sandra L. |date=December 2007 |title=The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) Study |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf |publisher=National Institute of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'' in 2017, D. Tuerkheimer reviewed the literature on rape allegations, and reported on the problems surrounding the credibility of rape victims, and how that relates to false rape accusations. She pointed to national survey data from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] that indicates 1 in every 5 women (and 1 in 71 men) will be raped during their lifetime. Despite the prevalence of rape and the fact that false rape allegations are rare, Tuerkheimer reported that law enforcement officers often default to disbelief about an alleged rape. This documented prejudice leads to reduced investigation and criminal justice outcomes that are faulty compared to other crimes. Tuerkheimer says that women face "credibility discounts" at all stages of the justice system, including from police, jurors, judges, and prosecutors. These credibility discounts are especially pronounced when the victim is acquainted with the accuser, and the vast majority of rapes fall into this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Deborah |first=Tuerkheimer |date=2017 |title=Incredible Women: Sexual Violence and the Credibility Discount |url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol166/iss1/1/ |journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review |language=en |volume=166 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] estimated from 2005 to 2007 that about 2% of victims who were raped while incapacitated (from drugs, alcohol, or other reasons) reported the rape to the police, compared to 13% of victims who experienced physically forced sexual assault.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Many kinds of violence against women (specifically rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence) are under-reported, often due to societal norms, taboos, stigma, and the sensitive nature of the subject.&lt;ref name="WHO World Report on violence and health"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krug |first1=Etienne G. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=db9OHpk-TksC |title=World report on violence and health |last2=Dahlberg |first2=Linda L. |last3=Mercy |first3=James A. |last4=Zwi |first4=Anthony B. |last5=Lozano |first5=Rafael |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2002 |isbn=9789241545617 |location=Geneva, Switzerland}}

Acts of violence against women are often not unique episodes, but are ongoing over time. More often than not, the violence is perpetrated by someone the woman knows, not by a stranger.&lt;ref name="VAM: Global scope &amp; magnitude" /&gt;

===High risk groups===
==== Indigenous people ====
Indigenous women are often targets of physical violence, including sexual assault. Many Indigenous communities are rural, with few resources and little help from the government or non-state actors. They often have strained relationships with law enforcement, making prosecution difficult. Many Indigenous societies find themselves at the center of land disputes between nations and ethnic groups, resulting in these communities sometimes bearing the brunt of national and ethnic conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = UNFPA | last2 = UNICEF | last3 = UN Women | last4 = ILO | last5 = Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children (OSRSG/VAC) | author-link1 = United Nations Population Fund | author-link2 = UNICEF | author-link3 = UN Women | author-link4 = International Labour Organization | title = Breaking the silence on violence against indigenous girls, adolescents and young women: A call to action based on an overview of existing evidence from Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America | url = http://www.unfpa.org/resources/breaking-silence-violence-against-indigenous-girls-adolescents-and-young-women | publisher = [[UNICEF]] | date = May 2013 | access-date = 10 May 2016}} [https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/resource-pdf/VAIWG_FINAL.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Immigrants and refugees====
Immigrant and refugee women often face violence, both in the private sphere (by partners and other family members) and in the public sphere (by the police and other authorities). These women are often in a vulnerable position: they do not speak the language of the country they are in, they do not know its laws, and sometimes they are in a legal position where they may be deported if they make contact with the authorities. Women who seek protection from armed conflict in their countries of origin often face more violence while travelling to the destination country or when they arrive there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Freedman | first = Jane | title = Sexual and gender-based violence against refugee women: a hidden aspect of the refugee "crisis" | journal = Reproductive Health Matters | volume = 24 | issue = 47 | pages = 18&amp;ndash;26 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1016/j.rhm.2016.05.003 | pmid = 27578335 | date = 2017 | s2cid = 21202414 | url = https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01441147/file/Sexual%20and%20gender%20based%20violence%20against%20refugee%20women%20a%20hidden%20aspect%20of%20the%20refugee%20crisis.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robbers | first1 = Gianna | last2 = Gunta | first2 = Lazdane | last3 = Dinesh | first3 = Sethi | title = Sexual violence against refugee women on the move to and within Europe | journal = Entre Nous | volume = 84 | pages = 26&amp;ndash;29 | publisher = [[WHO]]/Europe | date = 2016 | url = http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous/together-for-a-better-sexual-and-reproductive-health.-entre-nous-no-84,-2016 | access-date = 27 December 2017 | archive-date = 27 November 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201127162915/https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous/together-for-a-better-sexual-and-reproductive-health.-entre-nous-no-84,-2016 | url-status = dead }} [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/319301/Entre-Nous-84-full-book.pdf?ua=1 Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519004549/http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/publications/entre-nous/entre-nous/together-for-a-better-sexual-and-reproductive-health.-entre-nous-no-84,-2016 |date=19 May 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women refugees face violence from both the journey facilitator and the detention center guards.

On the local or national level, the VAW movements are diverse and differ in their strategic program of intervention. The strategies used in a number of the movements focus on the individual level with the emphases on individuals, relationships and family. Also, many of them take the 'preventive' as an approach to tackle the issues on the ground by encouraging people to "reexamine their attitudes and beliefs" in order to trigger and create fundamental changes in these "deep-rooted beliefs and behaviors".&lt;ref name="Michau, L. 2007 95–109"/&gt; To achieve the objectives of the movement, many activists and scholars argue that they have to initiate changes in cultural attitudes and norms on a communal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heise | first1 = L. | last2 = Gottemoeller | first2 = M. | title = Ending violence against women | journal = Population Reports | volume = L | issue = 11 | page = 38 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Population and Information Program | url = https://vawnet.org/sites/default/files/assets/files/2016-10/PopulationReports.pdf | date = December 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the transnational or regional level, the anti-violence movements also deploy different strategies based on the specificities of their cultures and beliefs in their particular regions. On this level, the activist movements are known as "transnational feminist networks" or TFNs.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}} The TFNs have a significant effect, like the autonomous movements on the national level, in shaping sets of policies as well pushing for the recognition and inclusion of language of VAW in the United Nations human rights mechanisms: the international human rights agreements.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt; Their activities are ranging from lobbying the policy makers; organizing demonstrations on the local and regional levels; to creating institutional pressure that could push for changes in the international institutional measures.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;

On an international level, the movements that advocate for women's rights and against VAW are the mixture of (civil society) actors from domestic and regional levels. The objectives of these VAW movements focus on "creating shared expectations" within the domestic and regional levels as well as "mobilizing numbers of domestic civil society" to create "standards in global civil society".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|556}} The global women's movement works to transform numbers of international conventions and conferences to "a conference on women's rights" by pushing for a "stronger language and clearer recognition" of the VAW issues. In addition, the United Nations also plays a vital role in promoting and campaigning for the VAW movements on the international level.&lt;ref name="UNiTE_Orange"&gt;{{cite web | last = UNiTE | author-link = UNiTE to End Violence against Women | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131220093826/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action | archive-date = 20 December 2013 |url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/take-action |title=Take action to Orange your day |publisher=[[UN Women]] |date= 2013 | access-date = 20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal 5]] is also a global initiative with a target to eliminate all forms of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender equality |url=https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-and-the-sdgs/sdg-5-gender-equality |access-date=2020-09-23 |website=UN Women |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a trend of approaching VAW at an international level through means such as conventions or, in the [[European Union]], through [[Directive (European Union)|directive]]s (such as the directive against [[sexual harassment]], and the directive against [[human trafficking]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 2002 |title=Directive 2002/73/EC - equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1976L0207:20021005:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JH |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:0001:0011:EN:PDF |access-date=4 April 2016 |work=Official Journal of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second order sexual harassment (SOSH)===
Second-order sexual harassment (SOSH) is the [[harassment]] suffered by those who stand with and support victims of violence against women (VAW).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1177/1077801220975495|title = Second-Order Sexual Harassment: Violence Against the Silence Breakers Who Support the Victims|year = 2021|last1 = Flecha|first1 = Ramón|journal = Violence Against Women|volume = 27|issue = 11|pages = 1980–1999|pmid = 33635745|pmc = 8343204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the [[UN General Assembly]] passed its first resolution calling for the protection of defenders of women's human rights.&lt;ref name="Norway Post"&gt;{{cite news |last=NRK |date=30 November 2013 |title=Protection of women human rights defenders |work=The Norway Post |url=http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/news/latest-news/29260-protection-of-women-human-rights-defenders |access-date=6 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213142536/http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/news/latest-news/29260-protection-of-women-human-rights-defenders |archive-date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution urges states to put in place gender-specific laws and policies for the protection of women's human rights defenders and to ensure that defenders themselves are involved in the design and implementation of these measures, and calls on states to protect women's human rights defenders from reprisals for cooperating with the UN and to ensure their unhindered access to and communication with international human rights bodies and mechanisms.&lt;ref name="awid.org"&gt;{{cite web |date=28 November 2013 |title=UN adopts landmark resolution on Protecting Women Human Rights Defenders |url=http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-adopts-landmark-resolution-on-Protecting-Women-Human-Rights-Defenders |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819203819/http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-adopts-landmark-resolution-on-Protecting-Women-Human-Rights-Defenders |archive-date=19 August 2014 |access-date=6 August 2014 |publisher=[[Association for Women's Rights in Development]] (AWID)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal enforcement==
As violence is often committed by a family member, women first started by lobbying their governments to set up shelters for domestic violence survivors. The Julia Burgos Protected House established in Puerto Rico in 1979 was the first shelter in Latin America and the Caribbean for "battered women".{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}} In 2003, 18 out of the 20 countries in the region had legislation on domestic or family violence, and 11 countries addressed sexual violence in their laws. Legislative measures to protect victims can include restraining orders, which can be found in Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Paraguay, Venezuela, Turkey, the United States and many western European countries for instance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}

Courts can also be allowed by law (Germany, 2001) to order the perpetrator to leave the home so that victims do not have to seek shelter. Countries were urged to repeal discriminatory legislation by 2005 following the review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 2000. Egypt, for instance, abolished a law that exempted men from rape charges when marrying their victims. However, the goal of antiviolence legislation is often to keep the families together, regardless of the best interests of women, which perpetuate domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

=== Challenges faced by women in accessing justice and limitations of measures ===
There can be a de jure or de facto acceptance of violent behaviors and lack of remedies for victims.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

*'''Lack of criminalization:''' in many places, acts of abuse, especially acts such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[marital rape]], [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]], are not criminalized, or are illegal but widely tolerated, with the laws against them being rarely enforced. There are instances where crimes against women are also categorized as minor offenses.
*'''Lack of awareness of the existing laws:''' in many places, although there are laws against violence on the books, many women do not know of their existence. This is especially the case with marital rape&amp;nbsp;– its criminalization being very recent in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

*'''Challenges in making a case in court:''' the burden of proof can be placed on the victim. For instance in the Philippines, before a change in law in 1997, rape used to be described as a crime against chastity; and virginity played an important role in court. In various countries, such as [[Bangladesh]], a woman's past sexual experience continues to be very important in a case of rape. Bangladesh has received criticism for its employment of the "two-finger test" in rape investigations. This test consists in a physical examination of women who report rape during which a doctor inserts two fingers in the woman's vagina to determine whether the woman is "habituated to sex". This examination has its origin in the country's colonial-era laws dating to 1872. The test deters many women from reporting incidents of rape. More than 100 experts, including doctors, lawyers, police, and women's rights activists had signed a joint statement in 2013 asking for the test, which they called "demeaning", to be abolished, as it "does not provide any evidence that is relevant to proving the offence". This test is also performed in several other countries in the region, including India.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

On the other hand, there are measures, such as the 2012 law in Brazil, that allow for cases to be filed even without the representation of the victim.
*'''Existing laws are insufficient, conflicting, and have no effect in practice:''' some laws on domestic violence, for instance, conflict with other provisions and ultimately contradict their goals. Legal frameworks can also be flawed when laws that integrate protection do so in isolation, notably in relation to immigration laws.{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}} Undocumented women in countries where they would have, in theory, access to justice, do not in practice for fear of being denounced and deported.

Invoking culture to explain particular forms of violence against women risks appearing to legitimize them. There is also debate and controversy about the ways in which cultural traditions, local customs and social expectations, as well as various interpretations of religion, interact with abusive practices.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Narayan | first = Uma | chapter = Cross-cultural connections, border-crossings, and "Death by Culture": thinking about dowry-murders in India and domestic-violence murders in the United States | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lzQ49LnmL_cC&amp;pg=PA81 | editor-last = Narayan | editor-first = Uma | title = Dislocating cultures: identities, traditions, and Third-World feminism | pages = 81&amp;ndash;118 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415914192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, cultural justifications for certain violent acts against women are asserted by some states and social groups within many countries claiming to defend their traditions. These justifications are questionable precisely because the defenses are generally voiced by political leaders or traditional authorities, not by those actually affected.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;

Measures to address violence against women range from access to legal-aid to the provision of shelters and hotlines for victims. Despite advances in legislation and policies, the lack of implementation of the measures put in place prevents significant progress in eradicating violence against women globally. This failure to apply existing laws and procedures is often due to the persisting issue of [[Gender role#Gender stereotypes|gender stereotyping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = CEDAW | author-link = CEDAW | title = General discussion on women and access to justice | url = http://wilpf.org/cedaw-general-discussion-on-women-and-access-to-justice/ | publisher = [[United Nations]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | date = 18 February 2013 | access-date = 12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International protection regimes==
{{Further|History of violence against women}}
Efforts to fight violence against women can take many forms and access to justice, or lack thereof, for such violence varies greatly depending on the justice system. International and regional instruments are increasingly used as the basis for national legislation and policies to eradicate violence against women. Experts in the international community generally believe that solely enacting punitive legislation for prevention and punishment of violence against women is not sufficient to address the problem. For example, although much stricter laws on violence against women have been passed in Bangladesh, violence against women is still rising.&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt; And violence against women has risen dramatically around the world since the late 2010s despite similar measures being taken in many regions as well as increased awareness and discussion of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-games/201909/the-number-women-murdered-partner-is-rising|title = The Number of Women Murdered by a Partner is Rising &amp;#124; Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/domestic-violence-international.html|title = Across the Globe, a 'Serious Backlash Against Women's Rights'|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 4 December 2019|last1 = Gupta|first1 = Alisha Haridasani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/09/813699719/mexican-women-stay-home-to-protest-femicides-in-a-day-without-us|title=Mexican Women Stay Home to Protest Femicides in 'A Day Without Us'|newspaper=NPR|date=9 March 2020|last1=Doubek|first1=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is thought that wide societal changes to address gender inequalities and women's empowerment will be the way to reduce violence against women.&lt;ref name="UN In-depth Study on all Forms of Violence Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VAW: A Global Burden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigeria-Female Hawkers-Interventions"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fawole | first1 = Olufunmilayo I. | last2 = Ajuwon | first2 = Ademola J. | last3 = Osungbade | first3 = Kayode O. | last4 = Faweya | first4 = Olufemi C. | title = Interventions for violence prevention among young female hawkers in motor parks in South-Western Nigeria: a review of effectiveness | journal = African Journal of Reproductive Health | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 71&amp;ndash;82 | publisher = Women's Health and Action Research Centre (WHARC) | doi = 10.2307/3583347 | jstor = 3583347 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12816315 | hdl = 1807/2587 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO VAM Factsheet"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Violence against women|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]| date = 1 September 2011|access-date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
In Africa, there emerged a series of regional meetings and agreements, which was triggered by the UN processes on the international level such as Third World Conference on Women in Nairobi, 1985; the 1993 Kampala Prep Com; the 1994 Africa-wide UN women's conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tripp | first1 = Aili Mari | author1-link = Aili M.

In the Americas, the Inter-American Convention on Violence Against Women was formally announced and adopted by the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) in 1994, immediately after the Vienna Conference.&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|557}} The Inter-American Convention to Prevent, Eradicate and Punish Violence Against Women (the Belém do Parà Convention) has been applied by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in its first case of domestic violence to condemn Brazil in the Maria da Penha case. This led the Brazilian government to enact in 2006 the Maria da Penha Law, the country's first law against domestic violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spieler | first = Paula | title = The Maria da Penha Case and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights: contributions to the debate on domestic violence against women in Brazil | journal = [[Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 121&amp;ndash;143 | publisher = [[Indiana University Maurer School of Law]] | date = Winter 2011 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/445824 | doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.18.1.121| s2cid = 154383871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, there is the South Asian Agreement on Regional Cooperation's (SAARC) Protocol to End Trafficking in Women and Children.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

===Europe===
{{see also|Istanbul Convention}}
In Europe, the [[European Union]] (EU)'s initiatives to combat violence against women include a 1997 resolution calling for zero tolerance, specifically on UN human rights instruments of CEDAW and the [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action|Vienna Declaration]]. The [[Council of Europe]] also developed "a series of initiatives" related to the issue of VAW: "the 2000 resolution on trafficking, the 2003 resolution on domestic violence, and the 2004 resolution on honor crimes" as well as promoted "the 2002 recommendation on the protection of women against violence and established its monitoring framework".&lt;ref name="Htun&amp;Weldon" /&gt;{{rp|557}} The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] (the Istanbul Convention) is the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of domestic violence and violence against women,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Convention of Belém do Pará and the Istanbul Convention: A response to violence against women worldwide|url=https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf|access-date=2021-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bureau des Traités |url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=210&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG |title=Liste complète |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |access-date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Countries which ratify it must ensure that the forms of violence defined in its text are outlawed. In its Preamble, the Convention states that "the realisation of ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' equality between women and men is a key element in the prevention of violence against women". The convention also provides a definition of [[domestic violence]] as "all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that occur within the family or domestic unit or between former or current spouses or partners, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim".&lt;ref name="Istanbul"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe – Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|work=coe.int|access-date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
