{{Violence against women}}
'''Violence against women''' is a [[Technical terminology|technical term]] used to collectively refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against [[woman|women]].  Similar to a [[hate crime]], this type of [[violence]] targets a specific group with the victim's [[gender]] as a primary motive.

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] defines "violence against women" as ''"any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]] or [[emotional abuse|mental]] harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of [[liberty]], whether occurring in public or in private life."'' The 1993 [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] noted that this violence could be perpetrated by assailants of either gender, family members and even the "State" itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/A.RES.48.104.En?Opendocument United Nations General Assembly ''Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women'' (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide governments and organizations actively work to combat violence against women through a variety of programs. A [[UN resolution]] designated November 25 as ''[[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/news/vawd.html UN Resolution 54/134-''International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of violence against women==
Some historians believe that the history of violence against women is tied to the history of women being viewed as property and a gender role assigned to be subservient to men and also other women.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Harvey &amp; Peter Gow ''Sex and violence : issues in representation and experience'' (1994)  pg 36 Routledge ISBN 0-415-05734-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993) states that "violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/rights/violence.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s courts in the United States stopped recognizing the common-law principle that a husband had the right to "physically chastise an errant wife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Calvert R |year=1974 |chapter=Criminal and civil liability in husband-wife assaults |title=Violence in the family |pages=88–91 |editor=Steinmetz S, Straus M |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the traditional right of a husband to inflict moderate [[corporal punishment]] on his wife in order to keep her "within the bounds of duty" was removed in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Jackson [1891]. 1 Q.B. 671&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], 1911. Article ''Corporal punishment''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on society==
The [[World Health Organization]] reports that violence against women puts an undue burden on [[health care]] services with women who have suffered violence being more likely to need health services and at higher cost, compared to women who have not suffered violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html WHO Factsheet ''Violence against women'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Several studies have shown a link between poor treatment of women and international violence.  These studies show that one of the best predictors of inter- and intranational violence is the maltreatment of women in the society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11967564&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womanstats.org/images/StearmerEmmettAPSA07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of violence==
===Domestic violence===
{{main|Domestic violence}}

Women are more likely to be [[victimized]] by someone that they are intimate with, commonly called "Intimate Partner Violence" or (IPV). The impact of domestic violence in the sphere of total violence against women can be understood through the example that 40-70% of murders of women are committed by their husband or boyfriend.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web

Instances of IPV tend not to be reported to police and thus many experts believe that the true magnitude of the problem is hard to estimate.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are much more likely than men to be [[murdered]] by an intimate partner. In the [[US]], in 2005, 1181 women, in comparison with 329 men, were killed by their intimate partners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdc.gov/violencePrevention/intimatepartnerviolence/consequences.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theduluthmodel.org/wheelgallery.php&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[England and Wales]] about 100 women are killed by partners or former partners each year while 21 men were killed in 2010.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13058300 |title=All domestic abuse deaths to have multi-agency review |author= |date=13 April 2011 |work= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, in [[France]], 156 women in comparison with 27 men were killed by their intimate partner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/aide_aux_victimes/violence-couple/downloadFile/attachedFile/morts_violentes_au_sein_couples.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this form of violence is often portrayed as an issue within the context of heterosexual relationships, it also occurs in [[lesbian]] relationships,&lt;ref name="Girshick"&gt;Girshick, Lori B., "No Sugar, No Spice: Reflections on Research on Woman-to-Woman Sexual Violence." ''Violence Against Women'' Vol. 8 No. 12, December 2002, pgs. 1500-1520.&lt;/ref&gt; daughter-mother relationships, [[roommate]] relationships and other domestic relationships involving two women. Violence against women in lesbian relationships is about as common as violence against women in heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musc.edu/vawprevention/lesbianrx/factsheet.shtml Fact Sheet: Lesbian Partner Violence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Diagnosis planning====

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] planning and research committees for the forthcoming [[DSM-5]] (2013) have canvassed a series of new [[Relational disorder]]s which include ''Marital Conflict Disorder Without Violence'' or ''Marital Abuse Disorder (Marital Conflict Disorder With Violence)''.&lt;ref&gt;First, M.B., Bell, C.C., Cuthbert, B., Krystal, J.H., Malison, R., Offord, D.R., Riess, D., Shea, T., Widiger, T., Wisner, K.L., Personality Disorders and Relational Disorders, pp.164,166 Chapter 4 of Kupfer, D.J., First, M.B., &amp; Regier, D.A. [http://appi.org/book.cfm?id=2292 A Research Agenda For DSM-V]. Published by American Psychiatric Association (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Couples with marital disorders sometimes come to clinical attention because the couple recognize long-standing dissatisfaction with their [[marriage]] and come to the [[clinician]] on their own initiative or are referred by an astute health care professional. Secondly, there is serious [[violence]] in the marriage which is -"usually the husband battering the wife".&lt;ref&gt;First, M.B., Bell, C.C., Cuthbert, B., Krystal, J.H., Malison, R., Offord, D.R., Riess, D., Shea, T., Widiger, T., Wisner, K.L., Personality Disorders and Relational Disorders, p.163, Chapter 4 of Kupfer, D.J., First, M.B., &amp; Regier, D.A.  [http://appi.org/book.cfm?id=2292 A Research Agenda For DSM-V]. Published by American Psychiatric Association (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases the emergency room or a legal authority often is the first to notify the [[clinician]]. Most importantly, marital violence "is a major risk factor for serious injury and even death and women in violent marriages are at much greater risk of being seriously injured or killed ([[National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women]] 2000)."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;First, M.B., Bell, C.C., Cuthbert, B., Krystal, J.H., Malison, R., Offord, D.R., Riess, D., Shea, T., Widiger, T., Wisner, K.L., Personality Disorders and Relational Disorders, p.166, Chapter 4 of Kupfer, D.J., First, M.B., &amp; Regier, D.A. [http://appi.org/book.cfm?id=2292 A Research Agenda For DSM-V]. Published by American Psychiatric Association (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of this study add that "There is current considerable controversy over whether male-to-female marital violence is best regarded as a reflection of male [[psychopathology]] and control or whether there is an empirical base and clinical utility for conceptualizing these patterns as relational."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; 

Recommendations for clinicians making a diagnosis of ''Marital Relational Disorder'' should include the assessment of actual or "potential" male violence as regularly as they assess the potential for [[suicide]] in depressed patients. Further, "clinicians should not relax their vigilance after a battered [[wife]] leaves her [[husband]], because some data suggest that the period immediately following a marital separation is the period of greatest risk for the women. Many men will [[stalk]] and [[batter]] their wives in an effort to get them to return or punish them for leaving. Initial assessments of the potential for violence in a marriage can be supplemented by standardized interviews and questionnaires, which have been reliable and valid aids in exploring marital violence more systematically."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
 
The authors conclude with what they call "very recent information"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;First, M.B., Bell, C.C., Cuthbert, B., Krystal, J.H., Malison, R., Offord, D.R., Riess, D., Shea, T., Widiger, T., Wisner, K.L., Personality Disorders and Relational Disorders, p.167,168 Chapter 4 of Kupfer, D.J., First, M.B., &amp; Regier, D.A. [http://appi.org/book.cfm?id=2292 A Research Agenda For DSM-V]. Published by American Psychiatric Association (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; on the course of violent marriages which suggests that "over time a husband's battering may abate somewhat, but perhaps because he has successfully [[intimidate]]d his wife. The risk of violence remains strong in a marriage in which it has been a feature in the past. Thus, treatment is essential here; the clinician cannot just wait and watch."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The most urgent clinical priority is the protection of the wife because she is the one most frequently at risk, and clinicians must be aware that supporting assertiveness by a battered wife may lead to more beatings or even death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Mob violence===

In 2010 [[Amnesty International]] reported that [[Hassi Messaoud mob attacks against women|mob attacks]] against single women were taking place in [[Hassi Messaoud]].&lt;ref name=Amnesty&gt;{{cite web|title=Algerian authorities must investigate and stop attacks against women|url=http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/22931/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=August 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amnesty International,  "some women have been sexually abused" and were targeted "not just because they are women, but because they are living alone and are economically independent."&lt;ref name=Amnesty/&gt;
 

===State violence===

====Labor camps====
Many women underwent [[extrajudicial punishment]] in [[labor camps]] of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Their suffering was described in memories of former [[Gulag]] women prisoners [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]], [[Eufrosinia Kersnovskaya]] and others.{{fact|date=October 2011}}

====War and militarism====
Militarism produces special environments that allow for increased violence against women. {{fact|date=October 2011}}For example, during World War II, the Japanese military established brothels for soldiers, exploiting women for the purpose of creating access and entitlement for men (see [[Comfort women]]). {{fact|date=October 2011}}Another example of violence against women incited by militarism during war took place in the [[Kaunas Ghetto|Kovno Ghetto]]. Jewish male prisoners had access to (and used) Jewish women forced into camp brothels by the Nazis, who also used them.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Andrea: ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation.'' pg. 316. Free Press, 2000. ISBN 0-684-83612-2&lt;/ref&gt; The 1998 United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda recognized rape as a war crime.

====Violence in empowerment systems====
When police officers misuse their power as agents of the state to physically and [[sexual harassment|sexually harass]] and assault victims, the survivors, including women, feel much less able to report the violence.&lt;ref name=FreshAir&gt;{{Cite episode

''The Color of Violence: INCITE! Anthology.'' Cambridge, Mass.: South End Press, 2006. ISBN 0-89608-762-X&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Many activists believe that working towards the elimination of domestic violence means working to eliminate a societal hierarchy enforced through sexism. [[INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence]] cited [[racism]] within the anti-violence movement and suggest that violence against women will not end until the anti-violence movement re-directs its goal from "ending violence against women" to "ending violence against women of color."&lt;ref&gt;[[INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence]]: ''Color of Violence: The INCITE! Anthology.'' pg 4. South End Press, 2006. ISBN 0-89608-762-X&lt;/ref&gt; The same conclusion can be drawn for other systems of oppression.
