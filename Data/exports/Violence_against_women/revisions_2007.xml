Similar to a [[hate crime]], this type of [[violence]] targets a specific group with the victim's [[gender]] as a primary motive. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] defines "violence against women" as ''"any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]] or [[emotional abuse|mental]] harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of [[liberty]], whether occurring in public or in private life."'' The 1993 ''Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women'' noted that this violence could be perpetrated by assailants of either gender, family members and even the "State" itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/A.RES.48.104.En?Opendocument United Nations General Assembly ''Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women'' (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide governments and organizations actively work to combat violence against women through a variety of programs. A [[UN resolution]] designated November 25th as ''International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/news/vawd.html UN Resolution 54/134-''International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of violence against women==
Some experts believe that the history of violence against women is tied to the history of women being viewed as property and a gender role assigned to be subservient to men and also other women.&lt;ref&gt; Penelope Harvey &amp; Peter Gow ''Sex and violence : issues in representation and experience'' (1994)  pg 36 Routledge ISBN 0-415-05734-5 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on society==
The [[World Health Organization]] reports that violence against women put an undue burden on [[health care]] services with women who have suffered violence being more likely to need health services and at higher costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/index.html WHO Factsheet ''Violence against women'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of violence==
===Domestic violence===
{{main|Domestic violence}}

Women are more likely to be victimized by someone that they are intimate with, commonly called "Intimate Partner Violence" or (IPV).  The impact of domestic violence in the sphere of total violence against women can be understood through the example that 40-70% of murders of women are committed by their husband or boyfriend.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web

Instances of IPV tend not to be reported to police and thus many experts believe that the true magnitude of the problem is hard to estimate.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web

Though this form of violence is often portrayed as an issue within the context of heterosexual relationships, it also occurs in [[lesbian]] relationships,&lt;ref name="Girshick"&gt;Girshick, Lori B., "No Sugar, No Spice: Reflections on Research on Woman-to-Woman Sexual Violence." ''Violence Against Women'' Vol. 8 No. 12, December 2002, pgs. 1500-1520.&lt;/ref&gt; daughter-mother relationships, [[roommate]] relationships and other domestic relationships involving two women. Very little research has been done on lesbian relationship violence, so reliable source information is hard to come by.&lt;ref name="Girshick"/&gt; Violence against women by women also exists outside the sphere of relationship violence, probably even less research has been done on this subject.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

===State violence===

====Labor camps====
Many women underwent [[extrajudicial punishment]] in [[labor camps]] of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Their suffering was described in memories of former [[Gulag]] women prisoners [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]], [[Eufrosinia Kersnovskaya]] and others.

====War and militarism====
Militarism produces special environments that allow for increased violence against women. For example, during World War II, the Japanese military established brothels for soldiers, exploiting women for the purpose of creating access and entitlement for men (see [[Comfort women]]). Another example of violence against women incited by militarism during war took place in the [[Kaunas Ghetto|Kovno ghetto]]. Jewish male prisoners had access to (and used) Jewish women forced into camp brothels by the Nazis, who also used them.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Andrea: ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation.'' pg. 316. Free Press, 2000. ISBN 0-684-83612-2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violence in empowerment systems====
[[Women's shelter|Shelter]] workers are often reduced themselves to contributing to violence against women by exploiting their vulnerability in exchange for a paying job.&lt;ref&gt;Koyama, Emi "Disloyal to feminism: Abuse of survivors within the domestic violence shelter system." in Smith A, Richie BE, Sudbury J, eds. ''The Color of Violence: INCITE! Anthology.'' Cambridge, Mass.: South End Press, 2006. ISBN 0-89608-762-X&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Many activists believe that working towards the elimination of domestic violence means working to eliminate a societal hierarchy enforced through sexism. Women of color have long cited [[racism]] within the antiviolence movement and suggest that violence against women will not end until the antiviolence movement re-directs its goal from "ending violence against women" to "ending violence against women of color."&lt;ref&gt;[[INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence]]: ''Color of Violence: The INCITE! Anthology.'' pg 4. South End Press, 2006. ISBN 0-89608-762-X&lt;/ref&gt; The same conclusion can be drawn for other systems of oppression.
