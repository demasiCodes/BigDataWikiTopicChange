The '''fat acceptance movement''' (also known as the '''size acceptance''', '''fat liberation''', '''fat activism''', or '''fat power''' movement) is an effort to change societal attitudes towards [[obesity|fat]] people.

== Background ==
Activism concerning the societal acceptance of fat people covers numerous fronts but generally can be described as attempting to alter societal, personal, and medical attitudes.

The movement argues that overweight people are targets of [[hatred]] and [[discrimination]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enoughdiscrimination.com/ |title=Enoughdiscrimination.com |publisher=Enoughdiscrimination.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that obese women are subjected to more social pressure than obese men.&lt;ref name="ifonly" /&gt;&lt;ref name=naafapolicies&gt;[http://www.naafaonline.com/dev2/about/docs.html Official Policies &amp; Newsletters], [[National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cswd.org/docs/faq.html |title=Council on Size and Weight Discrimination – Discrimination FAQ |publisher=Cswd.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hatred and disrespect towards fat people are seen in multiple places, including media outlets, where fat people are often ridiculed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health24.com/dietnfood/Weight_Centre/15-51-89,14715.asp |title=Diet, Weight loss – Related |publisher=Health 24 |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cswd.org/docs/media.html |title=Council on Size and Weight Discrimination – Weight Discrimination on Television |publisher=Cswd.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg BS, Eastin M, Hofschire L, Lachlan K, Brownell KD (2003).

Proponents argue that anti-fat stigma and aggressive diet promotion have led to an increase in psychological and physiological problems among fat people.&lt;ref name="ifonly" /&gt; Proponents of fat acceptance maintain that people of all shapes and sizes can strive for fitness and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda JP, Hayes D, Satter E, Parham ES, Kratina K, Woolsey M, Lowey M, Tribole E (1999). "A commentary on the new obesity guidelines from NIH." J Am Diet Assoc. Aug;99(8):918-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naafa.org/documents/policies/fitness.html Naafa Policy On Physical Fitness&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;], naafa.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.size-acceptance.org/rfh/ |title=ISAA's Respect &amp;#124; Fitness &amp;#124; Health Initiative |publisher=Size-acceptance.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizediversityandhealth.org/home Sizediversityandhealth.org – Home – Mission]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe health to be independent of, not dependent on, body weight. Thus, proponents promote "[[Health at Every Size|health at every size]]", the philosophy that one can pursue mental and physical health regardless of their physical appearance or size.

Through the works of authors such as [[Paul Campos]] and [[Sandy Szwarc]], the fat acceptance movement has argued that doctors should treat the health problems of people of all sizes, believing that health issues are not defined by weight and are shared by people of all sizes, fat and thin. Some in the movement have argued that the health risks of [[overweight]] and [[obesity]] have been exaggerated or misrepresented, and used as cover for cultural and aesthetic prejudices against fat.

Fat activism remains a marginal movement.{{date missing}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitchmagazine.org/article/big-trouble Big Trouble | Bitch Magazine&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;], bitchmagazine.org&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as the [[National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance]] (NAAFA) and the [[International Size Acceptance Association]] (ISAA) have relatively low memberships, and people interested in the movement tend to be clustered in larger cities and spread across medium- to small-sized web communities.

== History ==
During the early part of the 20th century, obesity was seen as detrimental to the community, by means of decreasing human efficiency, and that obese people interfere with labor productivity in the coastal areas of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/1467-9566.00289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of history and visibility gave rise to the Fat Acceptance movement which originated in the late 1960s, although its grassroots nature makes it difficult to precisely chart its milestones.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Like other social movements from this time period, the fat acceptance movement, initially known as "Fat Pride," "Fat Power," or "Fat Liberation," often consisted of people acting in an impromptu fashion. A "Fat-in" was staged in New York's Central Park in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;"Curves Have Their Day in Park; 500 at a 'Fat-in' Call for Obesity," New York Times. June 5, 1967, pg. 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Called by a radio personality, Steve Post, the "Fat-in" consisted of a group of 500 people eating, carrying signs and photographs of [[Sophia Loren]] (an actress famous for her figure), and burning diet books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1913858,00.html | work=Time | title=The Fat-Acceptance Movement | first=Dan | last=Fletcher | date=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups formed during this period to promote a fat acceptance agenda.  In 1969, William Fabrey founded a social club promoting "Fat Pride" called the National Association to Aid Fat Americans, subsequently renamed the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance ([[NAAFA]]) [http://naafa.blogspot.com/ NAAFA]. In 1973, a radical NAAFA chapter spun off to become an independent group, the Fat Underground, promoting a stronger activist philosophy. They were inspired by the philosophy of the Radical Therapy Collective, a feminist group that believed that many psychological problems were caused by oppressive social institutions and practices.  The Fat Underground, founded by Sara Fishman (then Sara Aldebaran) and Judy Freespirit, took issue with what they saw as growing bias against obesity in the scientific community. They coined the saying, "a diet is a cure that doesn't work for a disease that doesn't exist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.largesse.net/Archives/FU/index.html The Fat Underground&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;], largesse.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, Fishman moved to [[New Haven]], CT, where she, along with Karen Scott-Jones, founded the New Haven Fat Liberation Front, an organization similar to the Fat Underground in its scope and focus. In 1983, they collaborated to publish a seminal book in the field of Fat Activism, ''Shadow on a Tightrope.''&lt;ref&gt;Shadow on a Tightrope:   is Writings by Women on Fat Oppression, eds. Lisa Schoenfielder and Barb Wieser.  Iowa City, IA:  Aunt Lute Books, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The book collected several fat activist position papers initially distributed by the Fat Underground, as well as poems and essays from other writers.

The 1980s and 1990s witnessed an increase in activist organizations, publications, and conferences.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiancemagazine.com/issues/1998/winter_98/fat_underground.html |title=Life In The Fat Underground by Sara Fishman |publisher=Radiancemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/bigastexas/2001event/keynote2001.html Big As Texas 2001 Event-Keynote Address&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;], members.tripod.com&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, new anti-dieting programs and models began to appear in the research literature in response to new information dispelling common myths about obesity.&lt;ref name="ifonly"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0735-7028.27.2.175|title=The "If Only I Were Thin..."

== Modern movement ==
Members of the contemporary movement perceive negative societal attitudes as persistent, and as being based on the presumption that fatness reflects negatively on a person's character.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Murray, S (2005). "(Un/Be)Coming Out? Rethinking Fat Politics" Social Semiotics Vol. 15 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|11743063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the fat acceptance movement continues to strive for change in societal, personal, and medical attitudes toward fat people. Proponents engage in public education about what they describe as myths concerning fat and fat people.&lt;ref&gt;NAAFA [http://naafa.blogspot.com/ NAAFA] has a brochure titled [http://www.naafa.org/documents/brochures/myths.html Dispelling common myths about fat people]&lt;/ref&gt;  Organizations hold conferences and conventions: including "NAAFA",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naafaonline.com/dev2/community/events.html |title=NAAFAonline.com |publisher=NAAFAonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "Association for Size Diversity and Health",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sizediversityandhealth.org/ |title=SizeDiversityAndHealth.org |publisher=SizeDiversityAndHealth.org |date=2003-02-01 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "No Lose Annual Conference",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nolose.org/ |title=NoLose.org |publisher=NoLose.org |date=2011-09-16 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "FatGirl Speaks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatgirlspeaks.com |title=FatGirlSpeaks.com |publisher=FatGirlSpeaks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several books have been written on the topic, including ''Fat!So?

In recent years, more writers have written to promote fat acceptance: related online [[zine]]s include ''Fat!So''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatso.com/ |title=Fatso.com |publisher=Fatso.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Figure 8'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/ponyboypress/figure8zine.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:40:07 |title=Geocities.com |publisher=Webcitation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; related [[blog]]s include ''Kate Harding's Shapely Prose'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harding |first=Kate |url=http://www.kateharding.net/ |title=KateHarding.net |publisher=KateHarding.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Big Fat Blog'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfatblog.com |title=BigFlatBlog.com |publisher=Bigfatblog.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The F Word'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-f-word.org/blog/ |title=The-F-Word.org |publisher=The-F-Word.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Body Love Wellness Blog'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodylovewellness.com/blog/ |title=BodyLoveWellness.com |publisher=BodyLoveWellness.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''PeopleOfSize.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=What part of the new website do you like the most? |url=http://www.peopleofsize.com |title=PeopleOfSize.com |publisher=PeopleOfSize.com |date=2012-10-17 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several websites have sprung up to help connect fat people with fat-friendly service providers and products.  Many books have been published challenging the medical claim that fat produces ill health and highlighting the issue of weight-based discrimination that fat people are subjected to by medical professionals and society at large.&lt;ref&gt;The Obesity Myth (2004) by Paul Campos republished as The Diet Myth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Szwarc’s in depth examination of obesity research in the online magazine [http://www.tcsdaily.com/Authors.aspx?id=238 “Tech Central Station”]&lt;/ref&gt; Size discrimination has been increasingly addressed in the arts, as well. Performance art groups such as [[Padded lilies|The Padded Lilies]], Big Burlesque and the Fat Bottom Revue, among others, intentionally feature fat people in their shows.

There has also been an emerging body of fat political and sociological studies, some with a fat activist agenda, developing within the academy.  The American Popular Culture Association has an area in fat studies and regularly includes panels on the subject.  In addition, student groups with a fat activist agenda have emerged in a number of colleges including Hampshire, Smith, and Antioch colleges. 'Fat studies' is available as a course to study at some colleges, similar to other minority studies such as transgender studies and [[African American studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Fat Studies' Go to College|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/11/03/fat-studies-colleges-hot-new-course.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to what the movement is doing to raise public awareness, there have been a surge in studies both for and against fatness in scientific journals. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

=== Issues within the movement ===
{{weasel|date=July 2012}}
{{wikinews|Obesity and the Fat Acceptance Movement: Kira Nerusskaya speaks}}
[[File:Kira Nerusskaya 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|left|thumb|Self-described fat activist&lt;ref name=AJC&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/health/content/health/stories/2008/03/26/SIZE_BIAS_web.html State weighs law against size discrimination], Dan Ring, [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', March 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/dating-in-nyc/71544/fetish-finder/10.html Dating in NYC], ''[[Time Out New York]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Kira Nerusskaya feels that how people describe themselves depends upon their comfort level with their bodies. &lt;ref name=WN&gt;[[n:Obesity and the Fat Acceptance Movement: Kira Nerusskaya speaks|Wikinews interview]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

One point of contention in the movement is found between those fat people who are attempting to lose weight and those who are not. Diet critics the high failure rate of all permanent weight loss attempts, and the many dangers of "[[Yo-yo dieting|yo-yo weight fluctuations]]" and [[Bariatrics#Surgical procedures|weight loss surgeries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=21745 |title=Weight Cycling...Facts About Yo-Yo Dieting – Weight Loss and Weight Management Information Including Popular Diet Plans on |publisher=Medicinenet.com |date=2003-08-27 |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to intrinsic linguistic misunderstandings and differing definitions of the word "acceptance," some fat activists believe the phrase refers to any fat person fighting for equal rights and opportunities, regardless of whether or not that person believes that the pursuit of reduction in a person's body mass is feasible. Other fat activists define fat acceptance more strictly, applying that phrase only to fat people who are not pursuing a reduction in their body mass, and use phrases such as "fat activist" to describe fat people and allies working more generally on civil rights issues pertaining to fat people.

In practice, the only way to know the position of any particular individual member of the group on weight loss attempts is to ask, or read specific position papers on the issue. To some, "fat activism" requires active opposition to the concept of weight-loss, and to a mainstream culture that promotes dieting. In this case, the acronym of the movement, "FA" (''Fat Acceptance''), may also be interpreted to encompass "''Fat Appreciation''", which seeks to find beauty in fatness. This, in turn, may or may not be co-extensive with [[fat fetish]]ism or [[Feeder (fetish)#Feederism|feeder fetishism]].

Another common division in the fat acceptance community is the differing attitudes towards general society, specifically thin people. The fat acceptance community generally divides into two categories.  One is those who feel discrimination towards thin people hinders their cause.  The other side views thin people as at least a partial cause of their social stigma; some cater to this group with mockery of thin people.

== Related law ==
[[Michigan]] has passed a law against weight discrimination. The cities of [[Washington D.C.]], [[San Francisco]], [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]], and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] have also passed laws prohibiting weight discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weight Discrimination Laws|url=http://www.naafaonline.com/dev2/education/laws.html|work=NAAFA Online|publisher=NAAFA|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The fat acceptance movement has been criticized for adding no value to the debate over human health, with some critics going so far as to accuse the movement of "promoting a lifestyle that can have dire health consequences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=7823614&amp;page=1#.UA2vrSOVthE |title=Fat Acceptance: 'Young, Fat and Fabulous' Say No to Yo-Yo Diets |publisher=ABC |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/22/health/22fblogs.html |title=In the Fatosphere, Big Is In, or at Least Accepted |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-01-06/health/fat.acceptance_1_heart-health-metabolic-syndrome-obesity?_s=PM:HEALTH |title=Is the fat acceptance movement bad for our health? |publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of fat acceptance in response often point to studies which show that being fat in and of itself is not a health problem and that long-term weight-loss is not possible in the majority of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kateharding.net/faq/but-dont-you-realize-fat-is-unhealthy/ |title=Don’t You Realize Fat Is Unhealthy? |author=Kate Harding |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also point out that fat shaming does not lead to better health, rather it leads to psychological issues like [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://danceswithfat.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/deeply-disappointed-in-disney/ |title=Deeply Disappointed in Disney |author=Ragen Chastain |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that the criticism cuts to the heart of the debate. Whether or not modern culture's concern with healthy weight loss has a foundation in scientific research, or whether science is used as an medium to control [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]], it is a part of society's attempt to deal with something within it that it finds disturbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/5815206/disney-fatphobia--the-pooh-sized-debate |title=Updates |publisher=Jezebel.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Fat_as_Deviance.html?id=JvgytwAACAAJ |title=Fat as Deviance: Fat Phobia and the Social Control of Women's Bodies – Abigail B.
