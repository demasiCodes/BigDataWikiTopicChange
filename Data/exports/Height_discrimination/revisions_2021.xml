'''Height discrimination''' (also known as '''heightism''') is [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] against individuals based on [[Human height|height]]. In principle, it refers to the discriminatory treatment against individuals whose height is not within the normal acceptable range of height in a population. Various studies have shown it to be a cause of [[bullying]], commonly manifested as unconscious [[microaggression|microaggressions]].&lt;ref name="judgecable"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Judge | first1 = A.

Research indicates that the human brain uses height as one factor in a [[heuristic]] measure of social status and fitness. Studies have observed that [[infant|infants]] as young as 10 months old [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] associate height with leadership potential, power, strength and intelligence. Both the [[cognition|cognitive]] and the unconscious heuristic association between height and the mentioned traits has also been found to be stronger when assessing men than women.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Blaker, Irene Rompa, Inge Dessing, Anne Vriend, Channah Herschberg, Mark van Vugt, (2013) [http://professormarkvanvugt.com/images/files/heighlteadeshipGPIR.pdf "The height leadership advantage in men and women: Testing evolutionary psychology predictions about the perceptions of tall leaders"], DOI: 10.1177/1368430212437211, accessed 05/12/17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stulp G., Buunk A.

==Lexicology==

The term ''heightism'' was coined by sociologist Saul Feldman in a paper titled "The presentation of shortness in everyday life—height and heightism in American society: Toward a sociology of stature", presented at the meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Saul. "The presentation of shortness in everyday life—height and heightism in American society: Toward a sociology of stature

September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heightism'' was included in the ''[[Second Barnhart Dictionary of New English]]'' (1971)&lt;ref name="Shapiro 3–16"&gt;{{cite journal

The term ''heightism'' can also be seen as an example of the increase in popular usage of phrases, particularly those relating to prejudice and discrimination, patterned after that of the word ''[[sexism]].''&lt;ref name="Shapiro 3–16"/&gt; Height discrimination can also come in the form of pejorative slang terms such as ''manlet'' for short men, or ''lanklet'' for tall people.&lt;ref&gt;The Tall Book: A Celebration of Life from on High, Arianne Cohen - 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Height and social discrimination==

===Employment wage and social experience discrimination===

A research paper published in the Journal of Applied Psychology showed that height is strongly related to success for men. It showed that increase in height for men corresponds to increase in income after controlling for other social psychological variables like age and weight.&lt;ref name="judgecable"/&gt; Economists [[Nicola Persico]], Andrew Postlewaite and Dan Silverman conjectured a "height premium" and found that "a 1.8-percent increase in wages accompanies every additional inch of height". They also found that men's wages as adults could be linked to their height at age 16. The researchers found that on an average an increase in height by one inch at age 16 increased male adult wages by 2.6 percent. This is equal to increase of approximately $850 in 1996 annual earnings. In other words, the height and corresponding social experiences of taller male adolescent at age 16 would likely translate to higher wage in later adulthood as compared to shorter male adolescent.&lt;ref name="PPS"/&gt;

Recent findings suggest that height discrimination occurs most often against racial minorities. A 2007 study found that African-Americans reported higher weight and height related discrimination. This discrimination was even higher in female employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Roehling|first1=Mark V.|last2=Roehling|first2=Patricia V.|last3=Pichler|first3=Shaun|date=2007-10-01|title=The relationship between body weight and perceived weight-related employment discrimination: The role of sex and race|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=71|issue=2|pages=300–318|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2007.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, attorney and author lawyer Tanya Osensky published ''Shortchanged: Height Discrimination and Strategies for Social Change''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shortchanged: Height Discrimination and Strategies for Social Change|last=results|first=search|date=2017-10-03|publisher=ForeEdge|isbn=9781512601435|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book exposes the cultural, medical, and occupational issues that short people face, which are often deemed unimportant and disregarded. Osensky challenges heightism by disclosing some beneficial aspects of shortness and suggesting avenues of activism and change.

===In business===
Some jobs require a minimum height. For example, US Military pilots have to be {{convert|160|to|200|cm|in}} tall with a sitting height of {{convert|86|to|102|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name="AFROTC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrotc.com/admissions/medicalReq.php|title=U.S. Air Force ROTC despite statistical and physical evidence to support the proposition that short people consistently have reduced reaction times.: Admissions requirements|website=afrotc.com|access-date=22 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008211834/http://www.afrotc.com/admissions/medicalReq.php|archive-date=8 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These exceptions noted, in the great majority of cases a person's height would not seem to have an effect on how well they are able to perform their job.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} Nevertheless, studies have shown that short people are paid less than taller people, with disparities similar in magnitude to the race and gender gaps.&lt;ref name="Why tall people make more money"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/Careers/02/02/cb.tall.people/index.html|title=Why tall people make more money - CNN.com|first=By Meg Donohue |last=CareerBuilder.com|website=www.cnn.com|access-date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys have uncovered that less than 3% of [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] were below 1.70 m (5 ft 7 in) in height. 90% of CEOs are of above average height.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Rauch"&gt;[http://www.jonathanrauch.com/jrauch_articles/height_discrimination_short_guys_finish_last/index.html "Short Guys Finish Last" The world's most enduring form of discrimination. The Economist, 23 December 1995].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, market researcher Seth Ulinski published ''Amazing Heights: How Short Guys Stand Tall''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQPLMPR/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_KytSBbADZ5V9Y|title=Amazing Heights: How Short Guys Stand Tall|last=Ulinski|first=Seth|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book highlights that through technology and an entrepreneurial mindset, members of the "short guy fraternity" are able to blaze their own paths, bypassing potential glass ceilings and pay gaps.

===Perceived attractiveness===
It is popularly believed that height is a [[revealed preference]] of [[Physical attractiveness#Height|physical attraction]].

Initial studies indicated that taller men are more likely to be married and to have more children, except in societies with severe sex imbalances caused by war.&lt;ref name="DontWant"&gt;[http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/Research/HumanNatureProgArticles/dontwantnoshortshortmanFI.html Miami University of Ohio: “Don’t Want No Short, Short Man: The Study Of Height, Power, and Mate Selection”].&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent research has drawn this theory into question, finding no correlation between height and offspring count.&lt;ref name="correlate"&gt;[http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP06369385.pdf "Physique Correlates with Reproductive Success in an Archival Sample of Delinquent Youth"].&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, research on leg length and [[Physical attractiveness#Leg-to-body ratio|leg-to-body ratio]] conflicts with the notion that there is a distinct preference for taller mates. A 2008 study found that both extremes, tall and short, reduced attractiveness, and a 2006 study found that a higher leg-to-body ratio in both genders increased aesthetic appeal.&lt;ref name="legLength"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Ez5uazVNELMJ:commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Sorokowski-Adaptive-preferences-for-leg-length-in-a-potential-partner.pdf+height+and+occupational+success+evolutionary&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg6EYN1yttQPQbBwLLz8tPj-mBx6kZUVyHs6o1vPeHRQKqxaJyQI7mlfiw1SQ-gMO1OLj_DI5ldyCJCriyl2qef_gWiJm6OWjaO4s-gCR15YYTbHaigK5jHbzvAHGoqD474ceF-&amp;sig=AHIEtbSIDsqspZnNj5-F3bF5sqoWVnVeTQ&amp;pli=1: "Adaptive Preferences for Leg Length in a Potential Partner"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aAppeal"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Ez5uazVNELMJ:commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Sorokowski-Adaptive-preferences-for-leg-length-in-a-potential-partner.pdf+height+and+occupational+success+evolutionary&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg6EYN1yttQPQbBwLLz8tPj-mBx6kZUVyHs6o1vPeHRQKqxaJyQI7mlfiw1SQ-gMO1OLj_DI5ldyCJCriyl2qef_gWiJm6OWjaO4s-gCR15YYTbHaigK5jHbzvAHGoqD474ceF-&amp;sig=AHIEtbSIDsqspZnNj5-F3bF5sqoWVnVeTQ&amp;pli=1: "The leg-to-body ratio as a human aesthetic criterion"].&lt;/ref&gt;  At the roughest approximation the limb ratio findings are consistent with data relating [[Human height#Height and health|height to human health]]. Conversely, research by [[Dan Ariely]] found that American women exhibit a marked preference for dating taller men, and that for shorter men to be judged attractive by women, they must earn substantially more money than taller men.&lt;ref&gt;"Ariely found that a 5'4" man would need to make $229,000 more than a 6' man to have equal appeal; a 5'6" man would need $183,000 more; a 5'10" man would need $32,000 more." [[Lori Gottlieb]] (2010). ''Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough''. Penguin, {{ISBN|9781101185209}} p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study found that both men and women are willing to excuse height differences by using a trade-off approach. Men may compensate 1.3 BMI units with a 1 percent higher wage than their wife. Women may compensate 2 BMI units with an additional year of higher education.&lt;ref name="Sohn 110–124"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sohn|first=Kitae|date=2015-07-01|title=The value of male height in the marriage market|journal=Economics &amp; Human Biology|volume=18|pages=110–124|doi=10.1016/j.ehb.2015.05.004|pmid=26051039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a 2015 study found that both men and women receive benefits for having a tall spouse.&lt;ref name="Sohn 110–124"/&gt;

Nonetheless, on a cultural level in [[post-industrial society]], a sociological relationship between height and perceived attractiveness exists. For instance, in a 2019 survey performed by [[Ipsos]] in [[Hungary]] with over 500 respondents, the perfect height for men for 53% of participants was between  1.78 m (5 ft 10 in) to 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in), while regarding female ideal height, 60% of respondents stated that it should be between 1.65 m (5 ft 5 in) and 1.75 m (5 ft 9 in), indicating a predominant preference for average to moderately tall height in both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/1062775/public-perception-of-ideal-height-for-men-and-women-hungary/#statisticContainer|title=Height considered ideal for men/women in Hungary 2019 |author = Clark, Daniel| year = 2019|website=statista.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cultural characteristic of conferring relevance to height as an indicator of attractiveness, while applicable to the modernized world, is not a transcendental human quality.&lt;ref name="hadza"&gt;[http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/24375/1/How_universal_are_human_mate_choices_%28LSERO%29.pdf "How universal are human mate choices? Size doesn’t matter when Hadza foragers are choosing a mate"].&lt;/ref&gt; A study produced by the Universities of Groningen and Valencia, has found that men who felt most anxious about attractive, physically dominant, and socially powerful rivals, were less jealous, the taller they were themselves.&lt;ref name="Nature.com"&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2008/03/short_men_are_the_jealous_type.html Short men are the jealous type - March 13, 2008"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the media===
In the [[Mass media|media]], heightism can take the form of making fun of people whose height is out of the normal range. 
Similarly, shorter men are often denied leading roles. Although some famous cinema actors such as [[Alan Ladd]] {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} have been short in real life, in their fictional depictions they have been presented as taller. 

In 1987 the [[BBC]] comedy series ''[[A Small Problem]]'' imagined a totalitarian society in which people under the height of {{convert|5|ft}} were systematically discriminated against. The program attracted considerable criticism and complaints which accused the writers of reinforcing prejudice and of using offensive terms; the writers responded that their intention had been to show all prejudice was stupid and that height was chosen randomly.&lt;ref name="BBC Comedy guide"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/smallproblema_1299002875.shtml A Small Problem] in BBC Comedy Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[S&amp;M Short and Male]]'', a documentary aired in 2008, demonstrated the obstacles and bigotry that short statured men face every day in life, love and work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Reviews/S/S_M_Short_And_Male/2008/05/16/5585311-sun.html |title=CANOE - JAM!

==Legislation==
Currently, there is one state in the United States of America, [[Michigan]], that prohibits height discrimination.&lt;ref name="Michigan"&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/documents/act_453_elliott_larsen_8772_7.pdf Text] of the Elliot Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; There is pending legislation introduced by [[Massachusetts]] Representative [[Byron Rushing]] which would add Massachusetts to the list.&lt;ref name="Massachusetts"&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/house/ht03pdf/ht03752.pdf Text (PDF)] of Massachusetts House bill 3752, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Two municipalities currently prohibit height discrimination: [[Santa Cruz, California]],&lt;ref name="Advocates"&gt;[http://www.genderadvocates.org/policy/Ordinances/Laws/Santa%20Cruz%20Ordinance.htm Chapter 9.83] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105201654/http://www.genderadvocates.org/policy/Ordinances/Laws/Santa%20Cruz%20Ordinance.htm |date=2006-11-05 }} of the City of Santa Cruz code – "Prohibition against Discrimination", 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="NAAFA"&gt;[http://www.naafa.org/fatf/sf_height_weight.html Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114214707/http://www.naafa.org/fatf/sf_height_weight.html |date=2006-11-14 }} of Compliance Guidelines To Prohibit Weight and Height Discrimination; San Francisco Administrative Code Chapters 12A, 12B and 12C and San Francisco Municipal/Police Code Article 33, 26 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[District of Columbia]] prohibits discrimination based on personal appearance.&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;[http://ohr.dc.gov/ohr/cwp/view,a,3,q,491858,ohrNav,%7C30953%7C.asp Text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206202758/http://ohr.dc.gov/ohr/cwp/view%2Ca%2C3%2Cq%2C491858%2CohrNav%2C%7C30953%7C.asp |date=2006-12-06 }} District of Columbia Human Rights Act.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ontario]], Canada, prohibits height discrimination under the human rights code.&lt;ref name="Ontario"&gt;[http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/resources/Policies/PolicyHtWt/view Policy on height and weight requirements] Ontario, Canada Human Rights Code.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria, Australia]], prohibits discrimination based on physical features under the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995.&lt;ref name="Victoria"&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/eoa1995250/index.html Text] Victoria, Australia Equal Opportunity Act of 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of successful legal battles pursued against height discrimination in the workplace include a 2002 case involving highly qualified applicants being turned down for jobs at a bank because they were considered too short;&lt;ref name="Chinese"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/05/31/dorf.height.discrimination/index.html Chinese Height Discrimination Case].&lt;/ref&gt; a 2005 Swedish case involving an unfair height requirement for employment implemented by [[Volvo]] car company;&lt;ref name="Volvo"&gt;[https://archive.today/20120918124449/http://www.eiro.eurofound.eu.int/2005/11/inbrief/se0511102n.html Volvo Car Company Height requirement for employment].&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1999 case involving a [[Kohler Company]] informal practice not to consider women who applied for jobs unless they were at least {{convert|5|ft|4|in|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref name="Kohler"&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/esa/archive/esa99268.htm Kohler Corp.

==Height and suicide in men==
A research report published in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' found a strong inverse association between height and suicide in Swedish men which may signify the importance of childhood exposure in the [[etiology]] of adult mental disorder or reflect stigmatization or discrimination encountered by short men in their adult lives. A record linkage study of the birth, conscription, mortality, family, and census register data of 1,299,177 Swedish men followed from age 18 to a maximum of age 49 was performed and it was found that a 5-cm (2-inch) increase in height was associated with a 9% decrease in suicide risk.&lt;ref name=" Patrik K.E. Magnusson et al. "&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1373 " Strong Inverse Association Between Height and Suicide in a Large Cohort of Swedish Men: Evidence of Early Life Origins of Suicidal Behavior?
