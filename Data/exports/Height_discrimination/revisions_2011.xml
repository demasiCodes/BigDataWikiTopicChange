'''Heightism''' is [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] based on [[Human height|height]]. In principle it can refer to treatment of either unusually tall or short people.

==Origin of the term==

The term ''heightism'' was coined by sociologist Saul Feldman in a paper titled "The presentation of shortness in everyday life—height and heightism in American society: Toward a sociology of stature", presented at the meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Saul. "The presentation of shortness in everyday life—height and heightism in American society: Toward a sociology of stature
Paper". Presented at the meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]]. [[Chicago, Il]]. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;heightism, n." [[OED Online]]. June 2003. [[Oxford University Press]]. September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heightism'' was included in the ''[[Second Barnhart Dictionary of New English]]'' (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although ''Time'' itself objected to the term's inclusion in the 1991 ''Random Webster's College Dictionary'', citing it as an example of the dictionary "straining ... to avoid giving offense, except to good usage" and "[lending] authority to scores of questionable usages, many of them tinged with [[politically correct]] views."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Heightism is one of a proliferation of neologisms relating to prejudice and discrimination that are lexically patterned after ''[[sexism]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==In business==
Some jobs do require or at least favor tall people, including some [[manual labor]] jobs, law enforcement, most [[professional sports]], and fashion modeling. Military pilots have to be {{convert|64|to|77|in|cm}} tall with a sitting height of {{convert|34|to|40|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name="AFROTC"&gt;[http://www.afrotc.com/admissions/medicalReq.php U.S. Air Force ROTC: Admissions requirements]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely certain professions have upper height limits, such as female ballet dancers who are usually required to be under 5'7. These exceptions noted, in the great majority of cases a person’s height would not seem to have an effect on how well they are able to perform their job. Nevertheless, studies have shown that short people are paid less than taller people, with disparities similar in magnitude to the race and gender gaps.&lt;ref name="Why tall people make more money"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/Careers/02/02/cb.tall.people/index.html Why Tall People Make More Money]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blink"&gt;[http://www.gladwell.com/blink/blink_excerpt2.html Why do we love tall men?]&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of [[Fortune 500]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] height in 2005 revealed that they were on average {{height|ft=6}} tall, which is approximately {{convert|2.5|in|cm}} taller than the average American man. 30% were {{height|ft=6|in=2}} tall or more; in comparison only 3.9% of the overall United States population is of this height.&lt;ref name="FedBank"&gt;[http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/re/2005/b/pages/appearances.html Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis: “So Much for That Merit Raise: The Link between Wages and Appearance”]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar surveys have uncovered that less than 3% of CEOs were below {{height|ft=5|in=7}} in height. Ninety percent of CEOs are of above average height.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Rauch"&gt;[http://www.jonathanrauch.com/jrauch_articles/height_discrimination_short_guys_finish_last/index.html "Short Guys Finish Last" The world's most enduring form of discrimination. The Economist, 23 December 1995].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and marriage==
Heightism is also a factor in dating preferences. For some people, height is a [[Physical_attractiveness#Height|noteworthy factor in sexual attractiveness]].

The greater reproductive success of taller men is attested to by studies indicating that taller men are more likely to be married and to have more children, except in societies with severe gender imbalances caused by war.&lt;ref name="DontWant"&gt;[http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/Research/HumanNatureProgArticles/dontwantnoshortshortmanFI.html Miami University of Ohio: “Don’t Want No Short, Short Man: The Study Of Height, Power, and Mate Selection”].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FA"&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1175/is_3_33/ai_62215068 FindArticles.com: “Tall Men Do Get The Girl — Brief Article”].&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent research has drawn this theory into question, finding no correlation between height and offspring count.&lt;ref name="correlate"&gt;[http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP06369385.pdf: "Physique Correlates with Reproductive Success in an Archival Sample of Delinquent Youth"].&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, research on leg length and [[Physical_attractiveness#Leg-to-body_ratio|leg-to-body ratio]] conflict with the notion that there is a distinct preference for taller mates.  A 2008 study found that both extremes, tall and short, reduced attractiveness, and a 2006 study found that a lower leg-to-body ratio in men and higher leg-to-body ratio in women increased aesthetic appeal .&lt;ref name="legLength"&gt;[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Ez5uazVNELMJ:commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Sorokowski-Adaptive-preferences-for-leg-length-in-a-potential-partner.pdf+height+and+occupational+success+evolutionary&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg6EYN1yttQPQbBwLLz8tPj-mBx6kZUVyHs6o1vPeHRQKqxaJyQI7mlfiw1SQ-gMO1OLj_DI5ldyCJCriyl2qef_gWiJm6OWjaO4s-gCR15YYTbHaigK5jHbzvAHGoqD474ceF-&amp;sig=AHIEtbSIDsqspZnNj5-F3bF5sqoWVnVeTQ&amp;pli=1: "Adaptive Preferences for Leg Length in a Potential Partner"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aAppeal"&gt;[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Ez5uazVNELMJ:commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Sorokowski-Adaptive-preferences-for-leg-length-in-a-potential-partner.pdf+height+and+occupational+success+evolutionary&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg6EYN1yttQPQbBwLLz8tPj-mBx6kZUVyHs6o1vPeHRQKqxaJyQI7mlfiw1SQ-gMO1OLj_DI5ldyCJCriyl2qef_gWiJm6OWjaO4s-gCR15YYTbHaigK5jHbzvAHGoqD474ceF-&amp;sig=AHIEtbSIDsqspZnNj5-F3bF5sqoWVnVeTQ&amp;pli=1: "The leg-to-body ratio as a human aesthetic criterion"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologically, from an evolutionary perspective, these findings are consistent with data relating [[Human_height#Height_and_(physiological_and_psychological)_health|height to human health]].  Therefore, a biological or, more specifically, an evolutionary argument for the preference of a taller mate is questionable, lacking definitive evidence.  

Nonetheless, on a cultural level in [[Post-industrial society]], a sociological relationship between height and perceived attractiveness exists.  This cultural characteristic, while applicable to the modernized world, is not a transcendental human quality.&lt;ref name="hadza"&gt;[http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/24375/1/How_universal_are_human_mate_choices_%28LSERO%29.pdf: "How universal are human mate choices? Size doesn’t matter when Hadza foragers are choosing a mate"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Quantitative studies of woman-for-men [[personal advertisement]]s have shown strong preference for tall men, with a large percentage indicating that a man significantly below average height was unacceptable.&lt;ref name="ShortSupport3"&gt;[http://www.shortsupport.org/Research/personals.html Short Persons Support: “Personals Analyzer”].&lt;/ref&gt; A study produced by the Universities of Groningen and Valencia, has found that men, who felt most anxious about attractive, physically dominant, and socially powerful rivals, were less jealous, the taller they were themselves.&lt;ref name="Nature.com"&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2008/03/short_men_are_the_jealous_type.html Short men are the jealous type - March 13, 2008”].&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that women were most jealous of others' physical attractiveness, but women of medium height were the least jealous.&lt;ref name="The New Scientist"&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19726475.200-your-height-dictates-how-jealousy-strikes.html Your height dictates how jealousy strikes”].&lt;/ref&gt; The report, produced by Dutch and Spanish researchers, stated that because average height women tend to be the most fertile and healthy, they would be less likely to feel threatened by women with those similar features.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7291366.stm Short men 'are the most jealous'”].&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, a study has shown that in Britain, short women were the most likely to be married and have children. Some reasons which have been suggested for this situation include the fact that short women start puberty earlier than taller women who experience delayed fertility since they spend more energy growing, and that shorter women have a larger pool of men to choose from if they wish for a taller mate.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2190461.stm BBC News: “Tall men ‘top husband stakes’”].&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Adam Eyre-Walker from the Centre for the Study of Evolution at the University of Sussex, argues that the study was done on British people, and so the choices may actually be a result of the influence of culture.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

It is unclear and debated as to the extent to which such preferences are innate or are the function of a society in which height discrimination impacts on socio-economic status. Certainly, much is always made in newspapers and magazines of celebrity couples with a notable height difference, especially where a man is shorter than his wife (for example, [[Jamie Cullum]], {{convert|7|in|cm}} shorter at {{convert|5|ft|4|in|abbr=on}} than [[Sophie Dahl]], though the difference is often exaggerated).

==In the media==
{{Original research|date=April 2008}}
In the [[Mass media|media]], heightism can take the form of making fun of people whose height is out of the normal range in ways that would be unseemly if directed at [[skin color]] or [[weight]]. The portrayal of short men in the media is in general negative. In general, short statured men are portrayed as unsuccessful in career, romance, etc. (e.g., [[Spence Olchin]], [[Bud Bundy]], and [[George Costanza]]) or they are unlikeable tyrants in need of compensating for "something" (e.g. Lord Farquaad from the [[Shrek]] films or to a lesser degree [[Edward Elric]]). Notable exceptions are roles played by [[Michael J. Fox]] (especially [[Mike Flaherty]] from the TV series ''[[Spin City]]'', where a short man is portrayed as an attractive and likable person, who is successful both in romance and career), and [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]]'s portrayal of Eric "E" Murphy in [[HBO]]'s television series [[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]] (Connolly is {{convert|5|ft|5|in|abbr=on|disp=or}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175305/bio Kevin Connolly (I) - Biography&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, shorter men are often denied leading roles. Although some famous cinema actors such as [[Alan Ladd]] 5&amp;nbsp;ft 5 in and [[Tom Cruise]] 5&amp;nbsp;ft 7 in have been short in real life, in their fictional depictions they have been presented as taller.

When [[Daniel Craig]] was announced as [[James Bond]] in 2005, intense criticism of the casting decision (made by [[EON Productions]]) included the notion that the actor was too short to play 007, even though at {{convert|5|ft|10|in|abbr=on}} Craig is above average height for a white British male.

In 1987 the [[BBC]] comedy series ''[[A Small Problem]]'' imagined a totalitarian society in which people under the height of {{convert|5|ft}} were systematically discriminated against. The program attracted considerable criticism and complaints which accused the writers of reinforcing prejudice and of using offensive terms; the writers responded that their intention had been to show all prejudice was stupid and that height was chosen randomly.&lt;ref name="BBC Comedy guide"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/smallproblema_1299002875.shtml A Small Problem] in BBC Comedy Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jhonen Vasquez's [[Invader Zim]], the Irken hierarchy is based on height, with the tallest being the leader, and the shortest receiving no credit for conquering planets or given the worst assignments, such as Skoodge's case.

The [[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]] episode [[Jones (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent)|Jones]] features a serial killer who preys on shorter women. The detectives theorize that these women are targeted because "they made [the killer] feel powerful, [the killer] could dominate them." Eventually [[Alexandra Eames]] (played by [[Kathryn Erbe]], {{convert|5|ft|2|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) baits herself for the suspect, who shows an attraction to her.

In an episode of [[The Simpsons]] called [[Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy]], Homer criticizes his father for never saying anything nice to him.  In response, Grampa says, "I was always proud that you weren't a short man."

==Legislation==
Currently, there is one state in the United States of America, [[Michigan]], that prohibits height discrimination.&lt;ref name="Michigah"&gt;[http://www.michigan.gov/documents/act_453_elliott_larsen_8772_7.pdf Text] of the Elliot Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; There is pending legislation introduced by [[Massachusetts]] Representative [[Byron Rushing]] which would add Massachusetts to the list.&lt;ref name="Massachusetts"&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/house/ht03pdf/ht03752.pdf Text (PDF)] of Massachusetts House bill 3752, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Two municipalities currently prohibit height discrimination: [[Santa Cruz, California]]&lt;ref name="Advocates"&gt;[http://www.genderadvocates.org/policy/Ordinances/Laws/Santa%20Cruz%20Ordinance.htm Chapter 9.83] of the City of Santa Cruz code – “Prohibition against Discrimination”, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="NAAFA"&gt;[http://www.naafa.org/fatf/sf_height_weight.html Text] of Compliance Guidelines To Prohibit Weight and Height Discrimination; San Francisco Administrative Code Chapters 12A, 12B and 12C and San Francisco Municipal/Police Code Article 33, 26 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[District of Columbia]] prohibits discrimination based on personal appearance.&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;[http://ohr.dc.gov/ohr/cwp/view,a,3,q,491858,ohrNav,%7C30953%7C.asp Text] District of Columbia Human Rights Act.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] prohibits height discrimination under the human rights code.&lt;ref name="Ontario"&gt;[http://www.ohrc.on.ca/english/publications/height-weight-policy.shtml Text] Ontario, Canada Human Rights Code.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria, Australia]] prohibits discrimination based on physical features under the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995.&lt;ref name="Victoria"&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/eoa1995250/index.html Text] Victoria, Australia Equal Opportunity Act of 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of successful legal battles pursued against height discrimination in the workplace include a 2002 case involving highly qualified applicants being turned down for jobs at a bank because they were considered too short;&lt;ref name="Chinese"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/05/31/dorf.height.discrimination/index.html Chinese Height Discrimination Case].&lt;/ref&gt; a 2005 Swedish case involving an unfair height requirement for employment implemented by [[Volvo]] car company;&lt;ref name="Volvo"&gt;[http://www.eiro.eurofound.eu.int/2005/11/inbrief/se0511102n.html Volvo Car Company Height requirement for employment].&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1999 case involving a [[Kohler Company]] informal practice not to consider women who applied for jobs unless they were at least {{convert|5|ft|4|in|abbr=on}} tall.&lt;ref name="Kohler"&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/esa/archive/esa99268.htm Kohler Corp. Gender Discrimination Case].&lt;/ref&gt; Height requirements for employment which are not a [[Bona fide occupational requirement|''bona fide'' occupational requirement]] are becoming more and more uncommon.
