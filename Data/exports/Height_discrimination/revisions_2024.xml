{{Discrimination sidebar|expand-attributes=yes}}
'''Height discrimination''' (also known as '''heightism''') is [[prejudice]] or [[discrimination]] against individuals based on [[Human height|height]]. In principle, it refers to the discriminatory treatment against individuals whose height is not within the normal acceptable range of height in a population. Various studies have shown it to be a cause of [[bullying]], commonly manifested as unconscious [[microaggression]]s.&lt;ref name="judgecable"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Judge | first1 = A.

Research indicates that people often use height as one factor to measure social status and fitness. Both the [[cognition|cognitive]] and the culturally-ingrained unconscious heuristic association between height and the mentioned traits has also been found to be stronger when assessing men than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Blaker |first1=Nancy M. |last2=Rompa |first2=Irene |last3=Dessing |first3=Inge H. |last4=Vriend |first4=Anne F. |last5=Herschberg |first5=Channah |last6=van Vugt |first6=Mark |date=2013 |title=The height leadership advantage in men and women: Testing evolutionary psychology predictions about the perceptions of tall leaders |url=https://professormarkvanvugt.com/images/files/heighlteadeshipGPIR.pdf |journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations |language=en |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=17–27 |doi=10.1177/1368430212437211 |s2cid=4592188 |issn=1368-4302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Stulp |first1=Gert |last2=Buunk |first2=Abraham P. |last3=Verhulst |first3=Simon |last4=Pollet |first4=Thomas V. |date=2015-02-26 |title=Human Height Is Positively Related to Interpersonal Dominance in Dyadic Interactions |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=e0117860 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0117860 |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=4342156 |pmid=25719490 |bibcode=2015PLoSO..1017860S |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Cheng |first1=Joey T. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6sx8BAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=height+and+social+status&amp;pg=PA123 |title=The Psychology of Social Status |last2=Tracy |first2=Jessica L. |last3=Anderson |first3=Cameron |date=2014-09-09 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4939-0867-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicology==

The term ''heightism'' was coined by sociologist Saul Feldman in a paper titled "The presentation of shortness in everyday life—height and heightism in American society: Toward a sociology of stature", presented at the meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Saul. "The presentation of shortness in everyday life—height and heightism in American society: Toward a sociology of stature
Paper". Presented at the meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]]. [[Chicago, Il]]. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;heightism, n." [[OED Online]]. June 2003. [[Oxford University Press]]. September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heightism'' was included in the ''[[Second Barnhart Dictionary of New English]]'' (1971)&lt;ref name="Shapiro 3–16"&gt;{{cite journal

The term ''heightism'' can also be seen as an example of the increase in popular usage of phrases, particularly those relating to prejudice and discrimination, patterned after that of the word ''[[sexism]].''&lt;ref name="Shapiro 3–16"/&gt; Height discrimination can also come in the form of pejorative slang terms.&lt;ref&gt;The Tall Book: A Celebration of Life from on High, Arianne Cohen - 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Height and social discrimination==

===Employment wage and social experience discrimination===

A 2004 study published in the ''[[Journal of Applied Psychology]]'' showed that height is strongly related to success for men. It showed that increase in height for men corresponds to increase in income after controlling for other social psychological variables like age and weight.&lt;ref name="judgecable"/&gt; That same year, a study published in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' conjectured a "height premium" and found that "a 1.8-percent increase in wages accompanies every additional inch of height". They also found that men's wages as adults could be linked to their height at age 16. The researchers found that on an average an increase in height by one inch at age 16 increased male adult wages by 2.6 percent. This is equal to an increase of approximately $850 in 1996 annual earnings (or ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|850|1996|r=-1}}}} today).{{Inflation-fn|US}} In other words, the height and corresponding social experiences of a taller male adolescent at age 16 would likely translate to higher wages in later adulthood as compared to a shorter male adolescent.&lt;ref name="PPS"/&gt;

Recent findings suggest that height discrimination occurs most often against racial minorities. A 2007 study published in the ''[[Journal of Vocational Behavior]]'' found that African-Americans reported higher weight and height related discrimination. This discrimination was even higher in female employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Roehling|first1=Mark V.|last2=Roehling|first2=Patricia V.|last3=Pichler|first3=Shaun|date=1 October 2007|title=The relationship between body weight and perceived weight-related employment discrimination: The role of sex and race|journal=[[Journal of Vocational Behavior]] |volume=71|issue=2|pages=300–318|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2007.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, attorney and author Tanya Osensky published ''Shortchanged: Height Discrimination and Strategies for Social Change''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shortchanged: Height Discrimination and Strategies for Social Change|last=results|first=search|date=3 October 2017|publisher=ForeEdge|isbn=9781512601435|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book examines the cultural, medical, and occupational issues that short people face, which are often deemed unimportant and disregarded. Osensky challenges heightism by disclosing some beneficial aspects of shortness and suggesting avenues of activism and change.

===In business===
Some jobs require a minimum height. For example, [[United States Armed Forces|US Military]] pilots have to be {{convert|160|to|200|cm|in}} tall with a sitting height of {{convert|86|to|102|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name="AFROTC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrotc.com/admissions/medicalReq.php|title=U.S. Air Force ROTC despite statistical and physical evidence to support the proposition that short people consistently have reduced reaction times.: Admissions requirements|website=afrotc.com|access-date=22 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008211834/http://www.afrotc.com/admissions/medicalReq.php|archive-date=8 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other jobs require a maximum height or to be between a certain height range, such as flight attendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Weight &amp; Height Restrictions for Flight Attendants|url=https://work.chron.com/weight-height-restrictions-flight-attendants-27593.html|access-date=2022-02-15|website=Work - Chron.com|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exceptions noted, in the great majority of cases a person's height would not seem to have an effect on how well they are able to perform their job. Nevertheless, studies have shown that short people are paid less than taller people, with disparities similar in magnitude to the race and gender gaps.&lt;ref name="Why tall people make more money"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/Careers/02/02/cb.tall.people/index.html|title=Why tall people make more money|first=Meg|last=Donohue|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys have uncovered that less than 3% of [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] were below 1.70 m (5&amp;nbsp;ft 7 in) in height, and 90% of CEOs are of above average height.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Rauch"&gt;{{Cite news |date=1995-12-23 |title=Short guys finish last |volume=337 |pages=19–22 |newspaper=The Economist |issue=7946 |url=https://www.jonathanrauch.com/jrauch_articles/height_discrimination_short_guys_finish_last/index.html |via=[[ProQuest]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceived attractiveness===

Initial studies indicated that taller men are more likely to be married and to have more children, except in societies with severe sex imbalances caused by war.&lt;ref name="DontWant"&gt;[http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/Research/HumanNatureProgArticles/dontwantnoshortshortmanFI.html Miami University of Ohio: "Don't Want No Short, Short Man: The Study Of Height, Power, and Mate Selection"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150126190008/http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/Research/HumanNatureProgArticles/dontwantnoshortshortmanFI.html |date=2015-01-26 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent research has drawn this theory into question, finding no correlation between height and offspring count, although the sample was 200 and consisted only of delinquent youth.&lt;ref name="correlate"&gt;{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20081205082616/http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/EP06369385.pdf "Physique Correlates with Reproductive Success in an Archival Sample of Delinquent Youth"]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, research on leg length and [[Physical attractiveness#Leg-to-body ratio|leg-to-body ratio]] conflicts with the notion that there is a distinct preference for taller mates. A 2008 study found that both extremes, tall and short, reduced attractiveness, and a 2006 study found that a higher leg-to-body ratio in both genders increased aesthetic appeal.&lt;ref name="legLength"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sorokowski |first1=Piotr |last2=Pawlowski |first2=Boguslaw |date=2008-03-01 |title=Adaptive preferences for leg length in a potential partner |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513807000906 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=86–91 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.09.002 |issn=1090-5138 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126000000/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513807000906 |archive-date=2016-11-26 |access-date=2023-12-18 |url-status=live }} [https://www.academia.edu/download/50550921/Adaptive_preferences_for_leg_length_in_a20161125-29656-16l1de7.pdf Alt URL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aAppeal"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Swami |first1=Viren |last2=Einon |first2=Dorothy |last3=Furnham |first3=Adrian |date=2006-12-01 |title=The leg-to-body ratio as a human aesthetic criterion |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5760025 |journal=Body Image |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=317–323 |doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2006.08.003 |issn=1740-1445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, research by [[Dan Ariely]] found that American women exhibit a marked preference for dating taller men, and that for shorter men to be judged attractive by women, they must earn substantially more money than taller men.&lt;ref&gt;"Ariely found that a 5'4" man would need to make $229,000 more than a 6' man to have equal appeal; a 5'6" man would need $183,000 more; a 5'10" man would need $32,000 more." [[Lori Gottlieb]] (2010). ''Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough''. Penguin, {{ISBN|9781101185209}} p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study found that both men and women are willing to excuse height differences by using a trade-off approach. Men may compensate 1.3 BMI units with a 1 percent higher wage than their wife. Women may compensate 2 BMI units with an additional year of higher education.&lt;ref name="Sohn 110–124"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sohn|first=Kitae|date=1 July 2015|title=The value of male height in the marriage market|journal=[[Economics and Human Biology]] |volume=18|pages=110–124|doi=10.1016/j.ehb.2015.05.004|pmid=26051039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a 2015 study found that both men and women receive economic benefits from having a tall spouse.&lt;ref name="Sohn 110–124"/&gt;

Nonetheless, on a cultural level in [[post-industrial society]], a sociological relationship between height and perceived attractiveness exists. For instance, in a 2019 survey performed by [[Ipsos]] in [[Hungary]] with over 500 respondents, the perfect height for men for 53% of participants was between  1.78 m (5&amp;nbsp;ft 10 in) to 1.85 m (6&amp;nbsp;ft 1 in), while regarding female ideal height, 60% of respondents stated that it should be between 1.65 m (5&amp;nbsp;ft 5 in) and 1.75 m (5&amp;nbsp;ft 9 in), indicating a predominant preference for average to moderately tall height in both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/1062775/public-perception-of-ideal-height-for-men-and-women-hungary/#statisticContainer|title=Height considered ideal for men/women in Hungary 2019 |author = Clark, Daniel| year = 2019|website=statista.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study produced by the Universities of Groningen and Valencia, found that the taller a man was, the less anxious he felt about attractive, physically dominant, and socially powerful rivals.&lt;ref name="Nature.com"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Cressey |first=Daniel |date=2008-03-13 |title=Short men are the jealous type |url=https://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2008/03/short_men_are_the_jealous_type.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225201442/https://blogs.nature.com/news/thegreatbeyond/2008/03/short_men_are_the_jealous_type.html |archive-date=2009-12-25 |website=The Nature blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cultural characteristic of conferring relevance to height as an indicator of attractiveness, while applicable to the modernized world, is not a transcendental human quality.&lt;ref name="hadza"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sear |first1=Rebecca |last2=Marlowe |first2=Frank W. |date=2009-10-23 |title=How universal are human mate choices?

===In the media===

In 1987 the [[BBC]] comedy series ''[[A Small Problem]]'' imagined a totalitarian society in which people under the height of {{convert|5|ft}} were systematically discriminated against. The program attracted considerable criticism and complaints which accused the writers of reinforcing prejudice and of using offensive terms; the writers responded that their intention had been to show all prejudice was stupid and that height was chosen randomly.&lt;ref name="BBC Comedy guide"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/s/smallproblema_1299002875.shtml A Small Problem] in BBC Comedy Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, the teen romantic comedy ''[[Tall Girl]]'' was released. It told the story of a 16 year-old girl who struggled in high school due to her height.

==Height and suicide in men==
{{one source|section|date=September 2022}}
A research report published in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' found a strong inverse association between height and suicide in Swedish men. In other words, the suicide rate was higher for shorter men. This may signify the importance of childhood exposure in the [[etiology]] of adult mental disorder or reflect stigmatization or discrimination encountered by short men in their adult lives. A record linkage study of the birth, conscription, mortality, family, and census register data of 1,299,177 Swedish men followed from age 18 to a maximum of age 49 was performed and it was found that a {{cvt|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} increase in height was associated with a 9% decrease in suicide risk.&lt;ref name="Patrik K.E.
