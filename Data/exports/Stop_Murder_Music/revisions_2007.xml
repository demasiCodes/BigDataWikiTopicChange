Tatchell, and organizations such as [[Human Rights Watch]], have accused [[Beenie Man]], [[Elephant Man]], [[Sizzla]], [[Bounty Killa,]] [[Vybez Kartel]], [[Capleton]],  [[T.O.K.]], [[Buju Banton]] and others of promoting homophobic violence through their music.

Although music has been used to communicate dominance and war and violence in various ways throughout history most cultures have moved beyond violence and calls for murder or the use of inciting violence in music.

Tatchell has called for laws against homophobic music and participated in protests outside concerts. A long-running target of his criticism has been [[reggae]] artists whose lyrics seem to support violence, including murder, of gay men. Tatchell's campaign began in the early 1990s when [[Buju Banton]]'s song "Boom Bye-Bye" was released and has continued to date. He has picketed the [[MOBO Awards]] ceremony to protest at their inviting performers of what he terms "murder music".&lt;ref name="Reggae singers"&gt;[http://www.outrage.org.uk/Tatchell-reggaesingers.asp outrage.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Tatchell received [[death threat]]s and was labelled a [[racism|racist]]. Tatchell defended himself by pointing to a life's work campaigning against racism, and stated that his statements on [[Jamaica]] were in support of terrorised black groups within Jamaica. 

Tatchell has also criticised the [[Hip hop music|rap]]per [[Eminem]], commenting that "it's not hard to imagine Eminem as a woman-hating, self-loathing, repressed gay man" on the basis of his appearance and "obsession" with gay sex.&lt;ref name="Eminem"&gt;[http://www.petertatchell.net/popmusic/iseminemqueer.htm PeterTatchell.net] - Is Eminem Queer?&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of those assertions would go away after Eminem's performance of "Stan" with [[Elton John]].
