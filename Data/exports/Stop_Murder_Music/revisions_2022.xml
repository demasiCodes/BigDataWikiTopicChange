'''Stop Murder Music''' is a campaign to oppose Caribbean artists that produce music with lyrics alleged to glorify murder of [[homosexual men]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemuse.org/sw27728.asp Silencing Jamaican musicians fuels censorship debate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201051543/http://www.freemuse.org/sw27728.asp |date=2012-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/dec/10/gayrights.popandrock Pride and prejudice]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BMCS"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050419120025/http://www.blackmusiccouncil.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1103143546&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=1&amp; Archive copy of "Can music incite murder?"], ''The Black Music Council Site'' at the [[Internet Archive]]. Report Date:15 Dec 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was mainly against [[Jamaica]]n musicians, primarily [[dancehall]] and [[reggae]] artists such as [[Buju Banton]], [[Bounty Killer]], and the [[Bobo Ashanti]] Rastafarians [[Sizzla]] and [[Capleton]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexis Petridis (Friday 10 December 2004).

The campaign accuses these artists of promoting [[violence against LGBT people]] through the [[lyrics]] in their music and attempts to stop this.  Stop Murder Music is jointly run by [[OutRage!]], the [[Black Gay Men's Advisory Group]], and [[J-Flag]].&lt;ref&gt;Burrell, Ian (2005).[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050307/ai_n11857274 "'Murder music' silenced by a tough operator"], ''Independent, The'' (London),  Mar 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by British [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|gay rights]] activist [[Peter Tatchell]] in 1992.

The Reggae Compassionate Act was an agreement signed in 2007 by artists including [[Beenie Man]], [[Capleton]], and [[Sizzla]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin (2007).

==Local campaigns==
===Canada===
Stop Murder Music (Canada) is an independent branch of the organization in [[Canada]], founded by Akim Adé Larcher, after learning at a local [[West Indian]] store about a Canadian Tour by Elephant Man. Larcher, a Canadian/Saint Lucian, brought together over 20 organizations from the African and Caribbean communities in Canada to form the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mygsa.ca/SMMC |title=Stop Murder Music (Canada) (SMMC) &amp;#124; Egale Canada's |publisher=Mygsa.ca |access-date=2012-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425230128/http://www.mygsa.ca/SMMC |archive-date=2012-04-25 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Despite not causing any artists to be denied entry visas, the campaign was able to get concert venues cancelled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Krishna Rau / Toronto / Thursday, October 11, 2007 |url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=3&amp;STORY_ID=3703&amp;PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=1 |title=Koolhaus cancels concerts amid queer outrage |publisher=Xtra.ca |date=2007-10-11 |access-date=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also get iTunes to remove some tracks by Buju Banton, Elephant Man and TOK that they deemed contrary to their standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(Jenna Wakani photo) |url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?STORY_ID=4593&amp;PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=2 |title=iTunes Canada pulls anti-gay dancehall songs |publisher=Xtra.ca |date=2008-04-07 |access-date=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] and [[OutRage!]] campaigned on behalf of the stop murder music campaign, including petitioning the [[United Kingdom]] [[Home Secretary]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Reggae star barred from Britain. |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/pop_music/sizzla.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104071246/http://petertatchell.net/pop_music/sizzla.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-01-04 |title=Sizzla Denied Visa |publisher=Peter Tatchell |access-date=2012-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for and against==
Tatchell has called for laws against homophobic music and the Campaign participated in protests outside concerts. The Campaign has especially objected to lyrics which they allege to support violence, including allegedly murder, towards gay men. Dennis Carney, chair of the Black Gay Men's Advisory Group, argued in 2004 that the [[MOBO Awards]] had a responsibility to exclude anti-gay artists because, "homophobic lyrics in music normalise hatred towards black gay men."&lt;ref&gt;Graver, Mark (2004). [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/13190.php "Why homophobic lyrics in reggae music are a health issue for black gay men"], ''MedicalNewsToday.com''. Article Date: 10 Sep 2004 - 9:00 PDT.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK International Development Minister [[Gareth Thomas (English politician)|Gareth Thomas]] argued in a speech that, "A number of artists [such as Sizzla and Buju Banton] are effectively contributing to the spread of HIV by producing reggae and rap songs actually encouraging discrimination against those who have AIDS and encouraging violence against minority groups such as men who have sex with men...Yes, we believe in free speech, but nobody in a democracy should be able to incite violence against minorities."&lt;ref&gt;(22 November 2004). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4031847.stm "HIV warning over reggae lyrics"], ''BBC News''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boseley, Sarah (22 November 2004). [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/nov/22/health.aids "Reggae stars 'fuel spread of HIV'"], ''Guardian.co.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt; He cited John King and the [[Mighty Gabby]] as examples of musicians who are positive role models against violence and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Thomas. [http://www.caricom.org/jsp/speeches/championsforchange_hivaids_thomas.jsp "Speech"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195534/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/speeches/championsforchange_hivaids_thomas.jsp |date=2013-10-29 }}, ''UK/CARICOM Champions For Change Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Tatchell and the Stop Murder Music campaign have been criticised by The Black Music Council, a British organisation formed in 2004 in response to the campaign by the president of Blacker Dread Records, Blacker Dread, in order "to protect the rights of the eight artists placed on the OutRage! hit list".&lt;ref name="Roache"&gt;Alicia Roache, Staff Reporter.
