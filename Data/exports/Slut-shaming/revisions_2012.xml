'''Slut-shaming''' is the act of making someone, usually a woman, feel guilty or inferior, for engaging in certain sexual behaviors that violate traditional gender expectations, such as, depending on culture,  having "too many" sex partners, having sexual relations outside marriage, having casual sexual relations, or acting or dressing in a way that is deemed excessively sexual, often by calling them a "[[slut]]" or other derogatory terms, sometimes just by implying that a person's sexual "standards" are "too low" (i.e. that they are too sexually available).&lt;ref name=Tekanji&gt;Tekanji, [http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2010/04/04/what-is-slut-shaming/ "FAQ: What is slut-shaming?"] ''Finally Feminism 101'', 4/4/10&lt;/ref&gt;
