The action of slut-shaming can be a form of social punishment and is an aspect of [[sexism]], as well as [[Female intrasexual competition#Slut-shaming|female intrasexual competition]]. Slut-shaming is a form of intrasexual competition because the term "slut" reduces the value of a woman. Being termed a "slut" is against a woman's gender norms.&lt;ref name="s2cid152191641"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Papp |first1=Leanna J. |last2=Erchull |first2=Mindy J. |last3=Liss |first3=Miriam |last4=Waaland-Kreutzer |first4=Lauren |last5=Godfrey |first5=Hester |date=2016-11-25 |title=Slut-shaming on Facebook: Do Social Class or Clothing Affect Perceived Acceptability? |journal=Gender Issues |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=240–257 |doi=10.1007/s12147-016-9180-7 |s2cid=152191641 |issn=1098-092X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There is no documented date of origin for the term ''slut-shaming''; nor the act of it. Rather, although the act of slut-shaming has existed for centuries, discussion of it has grown out of social and cultural relations and the trespassing of boundaries of what is considered normative and acceptable behavior. While the origin is unknown, by the late 2000s, the term was popular enough to merit usage in newspaper articles. American writer [[Katha Pollitt]], in an article published in March 2008, used the term the following way: “the abstinence only, father-knows-best, slut-shaming crabbed misogyny of the Republican right.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-south-bend-tribune-editor-big-winner/137935807/|title=Editor big winner in 'dumb' contest |first=Katha |last=Pollitt |newspaper=[[The South Bend Tribune]] |page=B7 |date=March 12, 2008 |access-date=January 2, 2024 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the late 2000s, the term “slutty” was sometimes used to refer to behavior considered to be unacceptable such as the 2000s trend of showing off one’s [[thong underwear]] to create a [[whale tail]]. In 2005, [[Suzy Menkes]], a veteran journalist covering the fashion industry, considered the act of revealing thongs above one's clothing to be “slutty chic” and hoped that the act would lose popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/evening-standard-cover-up-all-those-thon/137658905/ |title=Cover up all those thongs and bras |first=Lucy |last=Cavendish |newspaper=[[Evening Standard]] |page=A27 |date=February 14, 2005 |access-date=December 29, 2023 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Literary characters who were killed or died by suicide as a result of their sexual choices include [[Ophelia]] of ''[[Hamlet]]'' ({{Circa|1600}}); Little Em'ly of ''[[David Copperfield]]'' (1850); [[Hester Prynne]] of ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850); ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (1856); ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' (1878); ''[[Daisy Miller]]'' (1878); ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891); Lily Bart of ''[[The House of Mirth|House of Mirth]]'' (1905); and Charity Royall in [[Summer (Wharton novel)|''Summer'']] (1917).&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news |last=Triska |first=Zoë |date=7 October 2013 |title=9 Female Book Characters Punished For Having Sex |work=The Huffington Post |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/book-characters-sex_n_3960991.html |access-date=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1892, Canadian writer [[E. Pauline Johnson]] criticized the 1887 novel ''An Algonquin Maiden'' for killing its protagonist and having male characters posthumously label her a "[[squaw]]," a racial and sexual slur that displayed "glaring accusations against her virtue," which Johnson felt was undeserved.&lt;ref name="Johnson1892"&gt;Johnson, Pauline. 1892.

Beginning in the 1960s, [[second-wave feminism]] contributed significantly to the definition and act of slut-shaming. Tracing back to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[Second World War]], men made up a majority of the labor force while women were socialized and taught to embrace the cult of domesticity and homemaking.&lt;ref name="Poole"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Poole |first=Emily |date=2014 |title=Hey Girls, Did You Know?

Slut-Shaming on the Internet Needs to Stop |journal=University of San Francisco Law Review |volume=1 |pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slut-shaming has correlation to an individual's socio-economic status, which is characterized by wealth, education, and occupation. In the 18th century, "slut" was a common term used by men and upper-class women to degrade lower-class female servants.&lt;ref name="s2cid152191641"/&gt; The context behind upper-class women and men calling their servants a "slut" includes when the servants were being sexually assaulted by their male employers.

=== Internet ===
Slut-shaming is prevalent on [[social media]] platforms, including the most commonly used: [[YouTube]], [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]], and [[Facebook]]. Slut-shaming has occurred on Facebook in controversial exchanges between users that have resulted in convictions to menace, harass and cause offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = This Woman Received Rape Threats for Quoting Drake on Tinder|url = http://mic.com/articles/124646/olivia-melville-was-slut-shamed-and-received-rape-threats-for-quoting-drake-on-her-tinder-profile#.I0vMKyLgT|website = Mic| date=31 August 2015 |access-date = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/30/how-facebook-troll-came-undone|author = Elle Hunt|date = 30 July 2016|access-date = 30 July 2016|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|title = 'What law am I breaking?'

In 2014, [[The Pew Research Center]] reported the most common targets of harassment on the Internet are often young women. Citing that 50% of young female respondents have been called offensive names and or shamed online. In particular, those who were 18 to 24 years of age experienced varying amounts of severe harassment at astoundingly high rates. Women who have been stalked online were at 26%, while the targets of online sexual harassment were at 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/online-harassment/|title=Online Harassment|date=2014-10-22|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slut Walk movement has embraced the slut-shame label and has engaged in an act of resignification. Ringrose et al. call the Slut Walk a "collective movement" where the focus goes back to the perpetrator and no longer rests on the victim.&lt;ref name="Ringrose 2012"/&gt; This act of resignification comes from the work of feminist scholar [[Judith Butler]].

Krystal Ball characterized the comments of [[Rush Limbaugh]] during the [[Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy]] as follows: "If you are a woman who stands up for your rights, you are a slut and your parents should be ashamed of you and we should all have the right to view your sex tapes online. This type of despicable behavior is part and parcel of a time-worn tradition of Slut-Shaming. When women step out line [sic], they are demeaned and degraded into silence. If you say Herman Cain sexually harassed you, you are a slut. If you say Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas sexually harassed you, you are a slut."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/krystal-ball/rush-limbaugh-sandra-fluke_b_1315805.html|title=Boycott Rush|last=Ball|first=Krystal|date=3 February 2012|work=HuffPost|access-date=13 December 2012|series=The Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="limbaugh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Legge |first1=Nancy J. |last2=DiSanza |first2=James R. |last3=Gribas |first3=John |last4=Shiffler |first4=Aubrey |title="He sounded like a vile, disgusting pervert..."

Slut-shaming has been used as a form of bullying on social media, with some people using [[revenge porn]]ography tactics to spread intimate photos without consent. In 2012, a teenager from California, [[Suicide of Audrie Pott|Audrie Pott]], was sexually assaulted by three boys at a party. She committed suicide eight days after photos of her being assaulted were distributed among her peer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/30/slut-shaming-teen-girls_n_4178812.html|title = Teen Girls Take A Stand Against Slut Shaming: What It Is, And Why You Should Care|series = Huff Post Teen|newspaper = The Huffington Post|last = Menza|first = Kaitlin|date=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Miller, editor-in-chief of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] of Canada, wrote a controversial article defending slut shaming.&lt;ref name="Why Slut-Shame"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kateandrews/2013/09/03/editorinchief-of-mises-institute-in-canada-advocates-slut-shaming-n1690262 |title=Editor-In-Chief of Mises Institute in Canada Advocates "Slut-Shaming" – Kate Andrews |publisher=Townhall.com |date=3 September 2013 |access-date=11 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326173138/http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kateandrews/2013/09/03/editorinchief-of-mises-institute-in-canada-advocates-slut-shaming-n1690262 |archive-date=26 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was later taken down, but still received criticism from some libertarians, such as Gina Luttrell of ''Thoughts on Liberty'', an all-female [[libertarian]] blog.&lt;ref name="Misogynists Gonna Misogynate"&gt;{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Elizabeth |url=http://thoughtsonliberty.com/misogynists-gonna-misogynate-or-more-issues-with-that-mises-ca-post |title=Misogynists Gonna…Misogynate?

== Activism ==
Activism against slut-shaming takes place worldwide. Participants have covered their bodies in messages reading "Don't Tell Me How to Dress" and "I am not a slut but I like having consensual sex" and march under a giant banner with the word slut on it. Activism has occurred in Vancouver, New York City, Rio, Jerusalem, Hong Kong, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nguyen |first1=Tram |title=From SlutWalks to SuicideGirls: Feminist Resistance in the Third Wave and Postfeminist Era |journal=Women's Studies Quarterly |date=1 January 2013 |volume=41 |issue=3/4 |pages=157–172 |doi=10.1353/wsq.2013.0102 |jstor=23611512|s2cid=85288792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, hundreds of South African women protested at the local taxi rank wearing miniskirts and t-shirts that read, "Pissed-Off Women" after a taxi driver and multiple hawkers confronted a young girl about wearing a short denim miniskirt and penetrated her with their fingers, calling her "slut" repeatedly. Protesters wanted to make their message clear; they wanted men to stop harassing women, no matter how short their skirts were and that no matter how short it may be, it is never an invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wininger |first1=K.

After the [[Steubenville High School rape case|gang rape of an unconscious 16-year-old girl]] in [[Steubenville, Ohio]], August 2012, football players spread videos of the assault to other classmates, some of whom posted the videos to Twitter and Instagram. The pictures and video were later removed by authorities; however, that did not stop people from hash-tagging "Whore status" or "I have no sympathy for whores" in their tweets. Members of the collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] reported names of the rapists and classmates who spread the footage to local authorities. They took to the streets and internet requesting help from the community to bring justice to the [[Jane Doe]] who was raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=978-0-674-36829-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/hatecri_cit_2014_00_5746/page/95 95–119] |jstor=j.ctt7zsws7.7 |chapter=Civil Rights Movements, Past and Present |last1=Citron |first1=Danielle Keats |title=Hate Crimes in Cyberspace |year=2014 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/hatecri_cit_2014_00_5746/page/95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of The Arts Effect All-Girl Theater Company have developed a play, ''[[Slut: The Play]]'', in which they address the damaging impact of slut-shaming and slut culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lauren-hersh/nyc-girls-challenge-weiner_b_3691859.html |title=NYC Girls Challenge Weiner Campaign: Stop Slut-Shaming |first=Lauren |last=Hersh |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date= 2 August 2013 |access-date=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sluttheplay.com/why/ |title=Why Slut — Slut |publisher=Sluttheplay.com |access-date=11 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326180510/http://sluttheplay.com/why/ |archive-date=26 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators state that their play "is a call to action – a reminder" that slut-shaming is happening every day, almost everywhere.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com" /&gt; ''Slut'' is inspired by real-life experiences of 14- to 17-year-old girls from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com" /&gt; The play was shown at the 2013 New York Fringe Festival.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shine.yahoo.com/love-sex/teenage-peta-pinup-speaks-out-205112851.html |title=Meet the Teen Star of PETA's Latest Controversy.

In her statement on the production, and of slut-shaming in general, author of ''Slut! Growing Up Female with a Bad Reputation'', [[Leora Tanenbaum]] writes:
{{blockquote|A teenage girl today is caught in an impossible situation. She has to project a sexy image and embrace, to some extent, a 'slutty' identity. Otherwise, she risks being mocked as an irrelevant prude. But if her peers decide she has crossed an invisible, constantly shifting boundary and has become too 'slutty,' she loses all credibility. Even if she was coerced into sex, her identity and reputation are taken from her. Indeed, the power to tell her own story is wrested from her. The Arts Effect's SLUT written by [[Katie Cappiello]] vividly represents this irrational, harmful, terrible circumstance...This play is the most powerful and authentic representation of the sexual double standard I have ever seen.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com" /&gt;}}

After experiencing slut-shaming firsthand, Olivia Melville, Paloma Brierly Newton and approximately a dozen other Australian women founded the organization, Sexual Violence Won't Be Silenced, on August 25, 2015. The association seeks to raise awareness of cyber-bullying and online sexual violence. The founders also launched a petition to the Australian government, requesting that they better train and educate law enforcement officers on how to prevent and punish violent harassment on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mic.com/articles/124646/olivia-melville-was-slut-shamed-and-received-rape-threats-for-quoting-drake-on-her-tinder-profile#.I0vMKyLgT |title=A Woman Was Slut-Shamed and Received Rape Threats for Quoting Drake on Her Tinder Profile |date=31 August 2015 |publisher=[[Mic.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Among gay and bisexual men ==
Gay and bisexual men are also victimized through slut-shaming because of their sexual activity. There has been research supporting that [[LGBT]] students were more likely to be bullied and called sluts than heterosexual students. Researchers discussed how these negative experiences of victimization by peers, friends and strangers can lead to physical harm, social shaming, and loss of friendships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Unlike heterosexual people, LGBT people are more likely to learn about [[safe sex]] practices from friends.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Gay and bisexual men are at highest risk of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=HIV and Gay and Bisexual Men {{!}} NIH |url=https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-gay-and-bisexual-men |access-date=2022-10-08 |website=hivinfo.nih.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slut-shaming has been cited as an obstacle to men who have sex with men accessing ways to prevent infection by HIV, such as [[Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention|PrEP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubov A, Galbo P, Altice F, Fraenkel L | title = Stigma and Shame Experiences by MSM Who Take PrEP for HIV Prevention: A Qualitative Study | journal = American Journal of Men's Health | date = August 2018 | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1843–1854 | doi = 10.1177/1557988318797437 | pmid = 30160195 | pmc = 6199453 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=PrEP slutshaming is still alive and well – and it's harming us all|date=3 May 2024 |url=https://www.gaytimes.com/life/prep-slutshaming/|access-date=2024-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the education that young gay and bisexual men receive about safe sex practices is learned from friends, the Internet, hearsay or trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Crothers|first1=Laura|last2=Levinson|first2=E.M.|date=2004-09-01|title=Assessment of bullying: A review of methods and instruments|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280786511|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|volume=82|issue=4|pages=496–503|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6678.2004.tb00338.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2018}}

Criticism of [[non-heterosexual]] men's sexual activity can either be said in a humorous context or not. Judgementalism happens when someone mentions gay men's sexual risk behavior or that they have [[multiple sex partners]]. This implies that their behavior is "slutty" and dirty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McDavitt|first1=Bryce|last2=Mutchler|first2=Matt G.|date=April 2014|title="Dude, You're Such a Slut!"

Street harassment includes [[cat-calling]], [[victim blaming]], and slut-shaming.

== Among Black women ==
Though slut-shaming affects women from different racial, cultural, and economic backgrounds, black women are disproportionately affected by the act of slut-shaming. This can be attributed to both [[misogynoir]] and historical myths, which have worked together in dictating much of the public perception of black women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Leora Tanenbaum “When Black Women Challenge Slut-Shaming.” ''When Black Women Challenge Slut-Shaming'', www.leoratanenbaum.com/newsletter/black-women-slut-shaming. Accessed 11 May 2023.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these biases, black women must stand against more prejudice based on an often false perception of their sexual activity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Harris-Perry, Melissa V. ''Sister Citizen Shame, Stereotypes, and Black Women in America''. Yale University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, it is also true that women from low-income backgrounds are at greater risk of being slut-shamed. Black women experience financial disenfranchisement in comparison to their white peers which in turn adds to the unbalanced nature of the slut-shaming they experience.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;“Racial Economic Inequality.” Inequality.Org, 2 Feb. 2023, inequality.org/facts/racial-inequality/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Tarrant Shira “Slut-Shaming Hurts Every Woman-Including Mean Girls.” ''In These Times'', inthesetimes.com/article/slut-shaming-hurts-every-womanincluding-mean-girls. Accessed 11 May 2023.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Myths about black women were established and cultivated during the time of slavery and onward to further oppress black women and justify committing acts of rape and sexual assault against them. One of the myths popularized was the myth of the hyper-sexual black woman or the [[Jezebel]]. This myth, also known as, the myth of promiscuity, popularized the idea that black women were inherently more sexually charged and deviant than their white counterparts. Black women were determined by the Western world to have a wild, promiscuous nature and immoral, loose, and impure practices and values. This myth was then used as a justification for violating black women with no consequence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Furthermore, black women were forced into sexualized positions regularly, for instance during slave actions they were forcefully stripped of all clothes, and required to be paraded around for the masses, nude.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These same involuntary actions would then be spun and used by white society in order to shame black women and reinforce the ideas created by the myth of promiscuity. This forceful sexualization of black women only furthered the ideologies prescribed to them by white society in a process of dehumanization and shaming that would be continued throughout history in new, inventive ways.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Today the myth of promiscuity or the “Jezebel” still permeates the black female experience in a myriad of ways. For instance, hip hop's portrayal of black women is hypersexualized and deeply stereotypes them both in character and in physicality.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The industry not only perpetuated the already existing ideas of the myth of promiscuity but additionally, it directly correlates the physical characteristics often found in black women such as a large behind which is often addressed in hip hop music, with having a sexually promiscuous nature. Although these ideas were not created by the hip hop/rap industry and have been around since the time of enslavement, they are popularized and reinforced by the overwhelming sexualization of specifically black women within the music being created today.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hip hop contributes to the overexposure to slut-shaming experienced by black women, manifest both verbally through lyrics used and visually through imagery in music videos and album covers. The imagery that accompanies overtly sexual lyrics is often of the stereotypical normative black female body often adorned in minimal clothing. This imagery of black femininity is then streamlined into the media to be absorbed by the public, therein altering the public's perception of both the standard black female body and the behaviors of black women in general. The effect of this reinforces the public perception that black women are inherently hypersexual beings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Yet another contributor to the high rates at which black women encounter slut-shaming is because of income inequality. slut-shaming does not permeate high-status circles of women at nearly as high a rate as it does within communities of women that are low-income. As those individuals coming from the powerful position within the already existing ruling class have the ability to dictate what activities, attire, and body standards are deemed respectable they can remove themselves from experiencing slut-shaming much more readily than their marginalized, low-income, BIPOC counterparts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; On the flip side, black women are more likely to face poverty because they are statistically more likely to experience unemployment, have lesser pay when employed, and often less of a chance to rise in position in comparison to their white female counterparts, let alone their white male counterparts. So therein, these systems of [[misogynoir]] place black women into a financially disadvantaged state, and those who are from lesser incomes are more likely to experience slut-shaming, thus black women are further placed in the position to experience slut-shaming at a greater rate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, white and upper-class women are often participators in the shaming of fellow women, especially black women, as this practice allows them to maintain the existing hierarchical dynamics wherein white, high-class women are a symbol of ideals of “true womanhood” and purity and black women are ascribing the characteristics of as deviance and sexually immorality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Although the myth of promiscuity was constructed by white society and spread through all social orders including, political, economic, and educational, today those same ideals can be seen distinctly within the interior social structures of the black community. Black women, in order to gain any social standing, had to do everything in their power to remove themselves from the idea of being promiscuous. For black women distancing themselves from all forms of perceived sensuality allowed them to a rise in social positioning. In turn, they forced themselves into a strict modesty culture in order to assimilate and rise in standing within white social structures. Those same women who conformed to the modesty standards set by white society, and did so in order to shirk their preconceived sexual nature that was also ascribed to them by white society seem to have little to no sympathy for black women within the community that chose not to assimilate into this system of forced modesty. Therein the process of slut-shaming is even perpetuated internally from black female individuals to one another.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Among lesbian and bisexual women ==

Along with gay and bisexual men, [[lesbian]] and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] women are also key victims of slut-shaming and bullying. Bisexual women are mainly bullied by other women due to their “open option” choice of preference for both genders.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miller |first=Sarah A. |date=2016 |title="HOW YOU BULLY A GIRL": Sexual Drama and the Negotiation of Gendered Sexuality in High School |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24756233 |journal=Gender and Society |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=721–744 |doi=10.1177/0891243216664723 |jstor=24756233 |s2cid=151900639 |issn=0891-2432}}&lt;/ref&gt; However on the other hand, bisexual and lesbian women are [[Fetishism|fetishised]] due to the porn industry, and from this fetishisation a group of people would only see them as a “porn category”. Lesbian porn is one of the most searched for categories in the porn industry.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web |date=2017-09-17 |title=Why lesbian porn dominates 10 Years Of Pornhub data |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/09/17/why-does-lesbian-porn-dominate-milf-and-much-more-in-10-years-of-pornhub-data_partner/ |access-date=2023-05-20 |website=Salon |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbian women have struggled with the concept of straight men trying to convert them into a different sexuality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Fetishization of Lesbians and Bisexual Women {{!}} UMKC Women's Center |url=https://info.umkc.edu/womenc/2014/04/18/the-fetishization-of-lesbians-and-bisexual-women/ |access-date=2023-05-20 |website=info.umkc.edu|date=18 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are viewed by that group of men as a porn category or a “sexual object”, this is due how some groups only understand the concept of lesbianism only what they see on media. Women in the porn industry are putting on a show to entertain, so they’re shown as feminine [[Seduction|seductress]] figure that’s very [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]],&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; which of course is false to reality. Linking to that issue, lesbianism is considered to exist outside of the [[male gaze]], therefore there’s this frustration for some men that they are unable to pursue women in these groups. However, there’s also groups of individuals that view any members of the [[LGBT community|LGBTQ+ community]] as predatory. Especially some women towards lesbians, how they assume members of that community will actively pursue them due to their preference and stereotype them as predatory. For bisexual and lesbian women, both genders vent their frustration based on [[homophobia]], false media and their indifference to “societal stereotypes”. However, this does not only apply to lesbian women, but gay men are also stereotyped to be predatory by some groups of heterosexual/straight males.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
