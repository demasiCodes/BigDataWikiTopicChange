'''Slut shaming''' (also hyphenated, as '''slut-shaming''') is a concept in [[human sexuality]]. It is a [[neologism]] used to describe the act of making a person, especially a woman, feel [[Guilt (emotion)|guilty]] or inferior for certain sexual behaviors, circumstances or desires that deviate from traditional or orthodox gender expectations, or that which may be considered to be contrary to natural or religious law. Some examples of circumstances where women are "slut-shamed" include: violating accepted [[dress code]]s by dressing in sexually provocative ways, requesting access to birth control,&lt;ref name="Lamb B14–B15"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lamb | first=Sharon | author-link = Sharon Lamb | title=The 'Right' Sexuality for Girls |date=27 June 2008 | journal=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | volume=54 | issue=42 | pages=B14–B15  | url=https://chronicle.com/article/The-Right-Sexuality-for/13770 | issn=00095982 | subscription = yes | quote=In Dilemmas of Desire: Teenage Girls Talk About Sexuality (Harvard University Press, 2002), Deborah L. Tolman complained that we've "desexualized girls' sexuality, substituting the desire for relationship and emotional connection for sexual feelings in their bodies." Recognizing that fact, theorists have used the concept of desire as a way to undo the double standard that applauds a guy for his lust, calling him a player, and shames a girl for hers, calling her a slut.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Albury |first1=Kath |last2=Crawford |first2=Kate |title=Sexting, consent and young people's ethics: Beyond ''Megan's Story'' |journal=[[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]] |date=18 May 2012 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=463–473 |doi=10.1080/10304312.2012.665840 |quote=Certainly the individualizing admonishment to 'think again' offers no sense of the broader legal and political environment in which sexting might occur, or any critique of a culture that requires young women to preserve their 'reputations' by avoiding overt demonstrations of sexual knowingness and desire.

==Overview==
Slut shaming is defined by many as a process in which women are attacked for their transgression of accepted codes of sexual conduct,&lt;ref name="Ringrose2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jessica Ringrose|title=Postfeminist Education?: Girls and the Sexual Politics of Schooling|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1jbsSXc9rUQC&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=16 May 2013|date=21 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-25971-5|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., of admonishing them for behavior or desires that are more sexual than society finds acceptable.&lt;ref name="FoyDale2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Denise Du Vernay|title=Feminism, Sexism, and the Small Screen|pages=163–182}} in {{cite book|author1=Joseph J.

Calling a girl a slut warns her that there's a line: she can be sexual but not ''too'' sexual."&lt;ref name="Bazelon2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emily Bazelon|title=Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5Z9QxYZ4J1kC&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=16 May 2013|date=19 February 2013|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-679-64400-2|page=95}} Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have stated that slut shaming is used against women by both men and women.&lt;ref name="Psy.D.Eagleson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Belisa Vranich, Psy.D.|author2=Holly Eagleson|title=Boys Lie: How Not to Get Played|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4cToqrySVDAC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=16 May 2013|date=1 July 2010|publisher=HCI|isbn=978-0-7573-1364-6|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessica Ringrose has argued that it functions among women as a way of [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimating]] sexual jealousy "into a socially acceptable form of social critique of girls' sexual expression."&lt;ref name="Ringrose2012"/&gt; Some also use this term to describe what they call [[victim blaming]] for [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]], e.g. by stating that the crime was caused (either in part or in full) by the woman wearing revealing clothing or previously acting in a forward, sexual manner, before not consenting to sex,&lt;ref name="asking" /&gt; and thereby absolving the perpetrator of guilt.

Men and women alike are culprits of "slut-shaming": The study "Birds of a feather? Not when it comes to sexual permissiveness," published in the ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'', notes that sexually lenient individuals are judged more negatively than non-permissive peers, which places those who are more permissive at risk of social isolation.&lt;ref name="spr.sagepub.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vrangalova |first1=Z. |author2=Bukberg, R.

An article in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' described yet another mode of "slut-shaming": in meme form.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/adolescents-memes-cyber-bully-article-1.1235246 |title='Slut-shaming' trend, sweeping Internet, adds meme form to adolescent cyber bullying |publisher=NY Daily News |date=7 January 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young girls, and increasingly boys, have begun to generate memes on Tumblr and Facebook to offer mock – and often insulting – advice to their peers.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"/&gt; For example: "Hey Girls. Did you know? That you spread Nutella...Not your legs," reads one such viral post.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"/&gt;”

[[File:SlutWalk NYC October 2011 Shankbone 4.JPG|thumb|right|Two women protesting about victim-blaming and slut-shaming at New York City's [[SlutWalk]] in October 2011.]]

The [[SlutWalk]] protest march started in [[Toronto]] in response to an incident where a Toronto Police officer told a group of students that they could avoid sexual assault by not dressing like "sluts".&lt;ref name="asking"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCormack |first1=Clare |last2=Prostran |first2=Nevena |title=Asking for It |journal=[[International Feminist Journal of Politics]] |year=2012 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=410–414 |doi=10.1080/14616742.2012.699777}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ringrose |first1=Jessica |last2=Renold |first2=Emma |title=Slut-shaming, girl power and 'sexualisation': thinking through the politics of the international SlutWalks with teen girls |journal=Gender and Education |date=October 2011 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=333–343 |doi=10.1080/09540253.2011.645023 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ964730&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ964730}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/ SlutWalk Toronto]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has since been used when describing the comments of [[Rush Limbaugh]] during the [[Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ball |first=Krystal |title=Boycott Rush |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/krystal-ball/rush-limbaugh-sandra-fluke_b_1315805.html |work=The Blog |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=13 December 2012 |date=3 February 2012 |quote=This type of despicable behavior is part and parcel of a time-worn tradition of Slut-Shaming. When women step out line, they are demeaned and degraded into silence. If you say Herman Cain sexually harassed you, you are a slut.

It may be possible that Limbaugh's insults were so thoroughly condemned that he and others (such as Bill Maher) will have a more difficult time insulting women who are not virgins, or attacking them in other sexist ways.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Miller, editor-in-chief, for the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] of Canada wrote a controversial article defending slut shaming.&lt;ref name="Why Slut-Shame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kateandrews/2013/09/03/editorinchief-of-mises-institute-in-canada-advocates-slut-shaming-n1690262 |title=Editor-In-Chief of Mises Institute in Canada Advocates "Slut-Shaming" – Kate Andrews |publisher=Townhall.com |date=3 September 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was later taken down, but still received criticism from some libertarians, such as Gina Luttrell of ''Thoughts on Liberty'', an all-female [[libertarian]] blog.&lt;ref name="Misogynists Gonna Misogynate"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Elizabeth |url=http://thoughtsonliberty.com/misogynists-gonna-misogynate-or-more-issues-with-that-mises-ca-post |title=Misogynists Gonna…Misogynate? (or, More Issues with That Mises.ca Post) |publisher=Thoughts on Liberty |date=5 September 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the performance apparel and dance-moves of pop-star [[Miley Cyrus]] at the [[2013 VMA Awards]] created "slut-shaming" uproar.&lt;ref name="articles.washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Post Store |url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-26/entertainment/41447063_1_cyrus-is-miley-cyrus-diplo |title=Miley Cyrus and the issues of slut-shaming and racial condescension – The Washington Post |publisher=Articles.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her performance of "[[We Can't Stop]]," which was performed as a duet with [[Robin Thicke]]'s "[[Blurred Lines]]," was called "lewd, grotesque and shameful."&lt;ref name="articles.washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Notably, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted the lack of criticism towards Robin Thicke: "While Cyrus was condemned for grinding on Thicke, very little criticism has been laid on the singer himself for his role in the performance."&lt;ref name="articles.washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

== In literature ==
There are several instances in literature in which women are degraded or admonished for their promiscuity. In these novels, men are largely excluded from the public outrage that their female counterparts endure for engaging in relationships deemed socially inappropriate:

* In [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', [[Hester Prynne]] is forced to wear a scarlet letter "A" to display her adulterous affair for her whole town. &lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/book-characters-sex_n_3960991.html| work= The Huffington Post| last=Triska | first=Zoë| title=9 Female Book Characters Punished For Having Sex | date=7 October 2013| accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' by [[Leo Tolstoy]], the title character has a highly public affair with the affluent Count Vronsky: Anna Karenina is rejected by her friends, while the reputation of Count Vronsky remains more or less untarnished.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

== Attempts to stop the practice ==

Members of The Arts Effect All-Girl Theater Company have developed a play, "Slut," in which they address the damaging impact of slut shaming and slut culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lauren-hersh/nyc-girls-challenge-weiner_b_3691859.html |title=NYC Girls Challenge Weiner Campaign: Stop Slut-Shaming &amp;#124; Lauren Hersh |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sluttheplay.com/why/ |title=Why Slut — Slut |publisher=Sluttheplay.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators note that their play "is a call to action – a reminder" that slut-shaming is happening every day, almost everywhere.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"/&gt; "Slut" is inspired by real-life experiences of 14–17 year-old girls from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"/&gt; The play was shown at the 2013 New York Fringe Festival.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shine.yahoo.com/love-sex/teenage-peta-pinup-speaks-out-205112851.html |title=Meet the Teen Star of PETA's Latest Controversy.

In her statement on the production, and of slut-shaming in general, author of ''Slut! Growing Up Female with a Bad Reputation'', Leora Tanenbaum writes: "A teenage girl today is caught in an impossible situation. She has to project a sexy image and embrace, to some extent, a 'slutty' identity. Otherwise, she risks being mocked as an irrelevant prude. But if her peers decide she has crossed an invisible, constantly shifting boundary and has become too 'slutty,' she loses all credibility. Even if she was coerced into sex, her identity and reputation are taken from her. Indeed, the power to tell her own story is wrested from her. The Arts Effect's SLUT written by Katie Cappiello vividly represents this irrational, harmful, terrible circumstance...This play is the most powerful and authentic representation of the sexual double standard I have ever seen."&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"/&gt;
