In [[human sexuality]], '''slut-shaming''' is a form of [[social stigma]] applied to people, especially women and girls, who are perceived to violate certain traditional expectations for sexual behaviors. Some examples of circumstances where women are "slut-shamed" include violating [[dress code]] policies by dressing in perceived sexually provocative ways, requesting access to [[birth control]],&lt;ref name="Lamb B14–B15"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Lamb | first=Sharon| author-link = Sharon Lamb | title=The 'Right' Sexuality for Girls |date=27 June 2008 | journal=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | volume=54 | issue=42 | pages=B14–B15 | url=https://chronicle.com/article/The-Right-Sexuality-for/13770 | issn=0009-5982 | subscription = yes | quote=In Dilemmas of Desire: Teenage Girls Talk About Sexuality (Harvard University Press, 2002), Deborah L.

Slut-shaming is used against women by both men and women.&lt;ref name="Psy.D.Eagleson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Belisa Vranich]], Psy.D.|author2=Holly Eagleson|title=Boys Lie: How Not to Get Played|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cToqrySVDAC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=16 May 2013|date=1 July 2010|publisher=HCI|isbn=978-0-7573-1364-6|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessica Ringrose has argued that slut-shaming functions among women as a way of [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimating]] sexual jealousy "into a socially acceptable form of social critique of girls' sexual expression".&lt;ref name="Ringrose2012"/&gt; The term ''slut-shaming'' is also used to describe [[victim blaming]] for [[rape]] and other [[sexual assault]]; e.g. by stating that the crime was caused (either in part or in full) by the woman wearing revealing clothing or acting in a sexually provocative manner, before refusing consent to sex,&lt;ref name="asking" /&gt; and thereby absolving the perpetrator of guilt. The study "Birds of a feather?

Kaitlin Menza argues that slut-shaming is a common form of bullying on social media, with some people using [[revenge porn]]ography tactics to spread intimate photos without consent. In 2012, a California teenager, [[Suicide of Audrie Pott|Audrie Pott]], was sexually assaulted by three boys at a party. She committed suicide eight days after photos of her being assaulted were distributed among her peer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/30/slut-shaming-teen-girls_n_4178812.html|title = Teen Girls Take A Stand Against Slut Shaming: What It Is, And Why You Should Care|date = |accessdate = |website = Huff Post Teen|publisher = Huffington Post|last = Menza|first = Kaitlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Miller, editor-in-chief, for the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] of Canada wrote a controversial article defending slut shaming.&lt;ref name="Why Slut-Shame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kateandrews/2013/09/03/editorinchief-of-mises-institute-in-canada-advocates-slut-shaming-n1690262 |title=Editor-In-Chief of Mises Institute in Canada Advocates "Slut-Shaming" – Kate Andrews |publisher=Townhall.com |date=3 September 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was later taken down, but still received criticism from some libertarians, such as Gina Luttrell of ''Thoughts on Liberty'', an all-female [[libertarian]] blog.&lt;ref name="Misogynists Gonna Misogynate"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Elizabeth |url=http://thoughtsonliberty.com/misogynists-gonna-misogynate-or-more-issues-with-that-mises-ca-post |title=Misogynists Gonna…Misogynate?

The comedy duo Sorry About Last Night (composed of Kyrstynna Hutcinson and Corinne Fischer)  have a podcast that is entitled “Guys We F***d, The Anti-slut shaming podcast”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/13/guys-we-fucked-corinne-fisher-krystyna-hutchinson_n_4951770.html|title=This Is The Sexiest Podcast You'll Ever Hear|last=Editor|first=Emma Gray Executive Women's|last2=Post|first2=The Huffington|date=2014-03-13|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women interview previous men that they have slept with along with an array of people like fellow comedians, celebrities like Andy Dick, or sex-workers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/guyswefucked|title=Guys We F****d|website=SoundCloud|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This podcast has over 200,000 listeners on each episode that is on SoundCloud.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This podcast is now available on iTunes as well although it was kept off of iTunes for some time for unknown reasons, according to one interviewer "“iTunes would not comment on whether the show is subject to an official ban”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/18/the-podcast-too-hot-for-itunes.html|title=The Podcast Too Hot for iTunes|last=Goldstein|first=Rich|date=2014-02-18|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the podcast is to de-stigmatize the way we talk about sex so that slut-shaming becomes less of an issue, Hutchinson explains in an interview with ''Huffington Post'': “We want to make people feel more comfortable in their own skin. We just got a message from a girl from New Delhi, India, about how she loves the podcast because it makes her feel like it’s OK to be comfortable with your sexuality and enjoy sex. And that made me so happy.” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In social media ==
With the proliferation in the use of [[social networking]] tools, the practice of slut-shaming is becoming more prevalent among [[social media]] platforms, including [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]].

In the YouTube community, users such as Jenna Mourey (aka [[Jenna Marbles]]) speak out against “sluts” in their videos. In a video released in December 2012 entitled "Things I don’t understand about girls Part 2: Slut edition", Mourey scorns women who engage in [[casual sex]]:

“A slut is someone that has a lot of casual sex. [...] It’s the girl that you’re like, ‘Pyeah [sic], yeah, she’s a slut.’ Yeah, that girl. Those are the group of people that I’m talking about. [...] Help the sluts of the world make less bad slutty decisions. [...] We need to look out for the sluts of the universe together. Because I think they are just a little lonely and sad.”

Lewis Webb, PhD candidate at [[Umeå University]] (Sweden), emphasizes that Mourey’s opinion is one among several in the YouTube community and that “the medium [of YouTube] is increasingly being used to attack and malign female reputations and criticize female sexual behavior.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Shame transfigured: Slut-shaming from Rome to cyberspace|url = http://ojphi.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/5464|journal = First Monday|date = 2015-04-02|issn = 1396-0466|volume = 20|issue = 4|language = en|first = Lewis Mark|last = Webb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slut-shaming is also commonplace on Facebook. In the summer of 2015, twenty-three year old Australia resident, Olivia Melville, was the target of slut-shaming by Chris Hall, a man who took a screenshot of her [[Tinder]] biography and posted it on Facebook. Melville’s biography was a lyric from the song “Only” by the rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and read: “Type of girl that will suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you.” The post spawned a plethora of comments, calling Melville a “bitch” and a “cunt.” Zane Alchin even alluded to the threat of a sexual assault in a series of comments on the photo, including: “You know the best thing about a feminist they don’t get any action so when you rape them it feels 100 times tighter.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = This Woman Received Rape Threats for Quoting Drake on Tinder|url = http://mic.com/articles/124646/olivia-melville-was-slut-shamed-and-received-rape-threats-for-quoting-drake-on-her-tinder-profile#.I0vMKyLgT|website = Mic|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alchin was subsequently convicted of using a [[carriage service]] to menace, harass or cause offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/30/how-facebook-troll-came-undone|author = Elle Hunt|date = 30 July 2016|accessdate = 30 July 2016|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|title = 'What law am I breaking?' How a Facebook troll came undone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature ==
There are several instances in literature in which women are degraded or admonished for their sexual behavior. In these novels, men are largely exempt from the public outrage that their female counterparts endure for engaging in relationships deemed socially inappropriate:

* In [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', [[Hester Prynne]] is forced to wear a scarlet letter "A" to display her adulterous affair to her whole town.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/book-characters-sex_n_3960991.html| work= The Huffington Post| last=Triska | first=Zoë| title=9 Female Book Characters Punished For Having Sex | date=7 October 2013| accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Tess of the D'Urbervilles]]'' by [[Thomas Hardy]], the title character is abandoned by her husband after she tells him how she was coerced into a sexual relationship with her former employer, Alec. He is completely disgusted by the revelation and claims that she is "not the woman he fell in love with."
* In ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' by [[Leo Tolstoy]], the title character has a highly public affair with the affluent Count Vronsky. Anna is rejected by her friends, while the reputation of Count Vronsky remains more or less untarnished.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

==In school dress codes==
{{weasel|section|date=August 2016}}
Some believe that school [[dress codes]] are a form of slut shaming, and are unfair to girls and women.&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Rory|title=Students protest 'slut shaming' high school dress codes with mass walkouts|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/24/us-high-schools-dress-codes-protest-sexism-hemline|website=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that these [[dress codes]] "violate Title IX, the [[federal law]] that ensures non-[[discrimination]] in educational environments."&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; On Monday, September 22, 2014, "about 100 pupils walked out of Bingham high school in South Jordan, Utah."&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Students staged a walkout because more than a dozen [[girls]] were turned away from a [[homecoming dance]] for wearing dresses which violated the dress code rules.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; "School staff allegedly lined up girls against a wall as they arrived and banished about two dozen for having dresses which purportedly showed too much skin and violated the rules." It is believed that this act was awkward and humiliating towards the [[female]] students, which spawned the walkouts.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

Certain dress code restrictions in schools across North America are believed to be perpetuating sexist standards, since they concentrate specifically on females and what they are and are not allowed to wear. There is also an emphasis placed on the effects that girls’ wardrobe choices have on their male classmates, which is seen by some as inappropriate. In March 2014, a group of middle-school girls from Evanston, Illinois protested their school’s dress code, which prohibited them from wearing leggings to school under the pretense that it was “too distracting for boys.” Thirteen-year-old student, Sophie Hasty, was quoted in the Evanston Review saying that “not being able to wear leggings because it’s ‘too distracting for boys’ is giving us the impression we should be guilty for what guys do.” In a Time magazine article covering the incident, Eliana Dockterman argued that teachers and administration in these schools are “walking the fine line between enforcing a dress code and slut shaming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = When Enforcing School Dress Codes Turns Into Slut Shaming|url = http://time.com/36997/when-enforcing-school-dress-codes-turns-into-slut-shaming/|website = TIME.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16|first = Eliana|last = Dockterman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, a similar incident occurred at Tottenville High School in Staten Island, New York. Within the first few days of the semester, two hundred detention slips were handed out to students who violated the school’s dress code. Approximately ninety percent of the slips distributed were given to girls as their clothing was deemed “disruptive to teaching and learning.” Many claim that making girls feel guilty for the actions of boys is similar to telling victims of sexual assault that they were “asking for it” by dressing in a particular manner and has thus been linked to the practice of victim-blaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Schools Are Still Slut-Shaming Girls While Enforcing Dress Code|url = http://time.com/3394549/dress-code-long-island-new-york/|website = TIME.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16|first = Eliana|last = Dockterman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Canadian teenager, Lauren Wiggins, was given detention in May 2015 for wearing a floor-length dress with a halter neckline. The punishment prompted Wiggins to write an open letter to the school’s assistant vice principal at Harrison Trimble High School in Moncton, New Brunswick. In the letter, Wiggins concentrated specifically on the fact that females are often blamed for the behaviour of males, saying that if a boy “will get distracted by my upper back and shoulders then he needs to be sent home and practice self-control.” She was then given a one-day suspension after writing and submitting the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/14/lauren-wiggins-haltar-top_n_7284528.html|title=High Schooler Lauren Wiggins' Letter Nails Exactly What's Wrong With School Dress Codes|date=14 May 2015|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts to stop the practice ==
Members of The Arts Effect All-Girl Theater Company have developed a play, ''[[Slut: The Play]]'', in which they address the damaging impact of slut-shaming and slut culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lauren-hersh/nyc-girls-challenge-weiner_b_3691859.html |title=NYC Girls Challenge Weiner Campaign: Stop Slut-Shaming |first=Lauren|last=Hersh |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date= 2 August 2013|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sluttheplay.com/why/ |title=Why Slut — Slut |publisher=Sluttheplay.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators note that their play "is a call to action – a reminder" that slut-shaming is happening every day, almost everywhere.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"/&gt; "Slut" is inspired by real-life experiences of 14- to 17-year-old girls from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"/&gt; The play was shown at the 2013 New York Fringe Festival.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shine.yahoo.com/love-sex/teenage-peta-pinup-speaks-out-205112851.html |title=Meet the Teen Star of PETA's Latest Controversy.

In her statement on the production, and of slut-shaming in general, author of ''Slut! Growing Up Female with a Bad Reputation'', [[Leora Tanenbaum]] writes: "A teenage girl today is caught in an impossible situation. She has to project a sexy image and embrace, to some extent, a 'slutty' identity. Otherwise, she risks being mocked as an irrelevant prude. But if her peers decide she has crossed an invisible, constantly shifting boundary and has become too 'slutty,' she loses all credibility. Even if she was coerced into sex, her identity and reputation are taken from her. Indeed, the power to tell her own story is wrested from her. The Arts Effect's SLUT written by Katie Cappiello vividly represents this irrational, harmful, terrible circumstance...This play is the most powerful and authentic representation of the sexual double standard I have ever seen."&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"/&gt;

In April 2013, Emily Lindin, founder of the UnSlut Project, created a blog to share her stories on sexual bullying to “provide some perspective to girls who currently feel trapped and ashamed". The blog now consists of entries from members of all ages, ethnicities, and genders. The film, ''UnSlut: A Documentary Film'', coincides with the project and is screened across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unslutproject.com/about.html|title = The UnSlut Project|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Lindin|first = Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After experiencing slut-shaming first-hand, Olivia Melville, Paloma Brierly Newton and approximately a dozen other Australian women founded the organization, Sexual Violence Won’t Be Silenced, on August 25, 2015. The association seeks to raise awareness of cyber-bullying and online sexual violence. The founders also launched a petition to the Australian government, requesting that they better train and educate law enforcement officers on how to prevent and punish violent harassment on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mic.com/articles/124646/olivia-melville-was-slut-shamed-and-received-rape-threats-for-quoting-drake-on-her-tinder-profile#.I0vMKyLgT|title=A Woman Was Slut-Shamed and Received Rape Threats for Quoting Drake on Her Tinder Profile|author=Mic|work=Mic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Among gay men==
Gay men have traditionally been relatively tolerant of promiscuity. However, this changed considerably with the [[AIDS]] epidemic of the 1980s. [[Condom]] use as a [[safe sex]] practice became prominent in the late 1980s as a result of the [[AIDS epidemic]],&lt;ref name="Who"&gt;{{cite web| title = Global strategy for the prevention and control of sexually transmitted infections: 2006–2015.

The drug [[Tenofovir/emtricitabine|Truvada]] has been approved for [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]] for [[prevention of HIV/AIDS]] in some countries, after studies demonstrated it can lower the risk of new HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3079639/|title=Preexposure Chemoprophylaxis for HIV Prevention in Men Who Have Sex with Men|work=PubMed Central (PMC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Public Health Service [5 October 2014]; Preexposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Infection in the United States - 2014 Clinical Practice Guideline http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/PrEPguidelines2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A number of HIV researchers like [[Anthony S.

Some reports indicate that gay men who use Truvada to lower their risk of contracting HIV are shamed for doing so, based on perceptions that Truvada users are more promiscuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/truvada-mircle-pill-prevent-hiv-controversy|title=Truvada has been called the 'miracle' HIV pill – so why is uptake so slow?|author=Amanda Holpuch|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/truvada--the-other-little-blue-pill-20141128-11l1od.html|title=Truvada – the other little blue pill|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gay rights activists have said that environments which have slut-shaming are more likely to lead to gay men engaging in practices which lead to increased rates of HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2014/09/08/op-ed-slut-shaming-cause-hiv |title=Op-ed: Slut-Shaming Is a Cause of HIV |first=Hussain |last=Turk |work=[[The Advocate]] |date=8 September 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--One opinion on slut-shaming in men is that calling a man a "slut" is not as pejorative as it is in using the word against women, and that the term has more of a positive connotation with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.salon.com/2012/02/10/she_called_me_a_manwhore/ |title=She called me a "manwhore" |first=Tracy |last=Clark-Flory |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=9 February 2012 |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some gay males see the behaviors which are said to encourage slut-shaming as actually being positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gmfa.org.uk/Sites/fsmagazine/pages/gay-slut-shaming-stop-it-stop-it-right-now |title=Gay slut shaming – stop it, stop it right now! |first=Saif |last=A |website=GMFA|date=April 2013 |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
