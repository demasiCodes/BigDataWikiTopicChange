==Etymology==
The English word ''caste'' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑː|s|t|,_|k|æ|s|t}}) derives from the Spanish and Portuguese {{lang|es|[[casta]]}}, which, according to the [[John Minsheu]]'s Spanish dictionary (1569), means "race, lineage, tribe or breed".&lt;ref name=oed-caste&gt;{{Cite OED|caste|id=28546}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Spanish colonised the [[New World]], they used the word to mean a 'clan or lineage'. It was, however, the Portuguese who first employed {{lang|pt|casta}} in the primary modern sense of the English word 'caste' when they applied it to the thousands of endogamous, hereditary Indian social groups they encountered upon their arrival in India in 1498.&lt;ref name=oed-caste/&gt;&lt;ref name=pitt-rivers&gt;{{citation|last=Pitt-Rivers|first=Julian|editor=T O Beidelman|title=The translation of culture essays to E.E.

Modern India's caste system is based on the artificial modern superimposition of an old four-fold theoretical classification called the Varna on the natural social groupings called the [[Jāti]]. 
Varna conceptualised a society as consisting of four types [[Varna (Hinduism)|varnas]] or categories: [[Brahmin]], [[Kshatriya]], [[Vaishya]] and [[Shudra]], according to the nature of work of its members. Varna was not an inherited category and the occupation determined the varna. However, a person's [[Jāti|Jati]] is determined at birth and makes them take up that Jati's occupation and members could and did change their occupation based on personal strengths, economic, social  and political factors. Thus both [[Jāti|Jati]] and Varna were fluid categories, subject to change based on occupation.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} Based on [[DNA analysis]], endogamous i.e. non-intermarrying Jatis originated during the [[Gupta Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kalyan |first1=Ray |title=Caste originated during Gupta dynasty: Study |date=27 January 2016 |url=https://www.deccanherald.com/content/525390/caste-originated-during-gupta-dynasty.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Even with a Harvard pedigree, caste follows 'like a shadow'|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-03-05/even-harvard-pedigree-caste-follows-shadow|access-date=2021-09-10|website=The World from PRX|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1901 onwards, for the purposes of the [[Census of India prior to independence|Decennial Census]], the [[British Raj|British colonial authorities]] arbitrarily and incorrectly forced all Jātis into the four ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' categories as described in ancient texts.  [[Herbert Hope Risley]], the Census Commissioner, noted that "The principle suggested as a basis was that of classification by social precedence as recognized by native public opinion at the present day, and manifesting itself in the facts that particular castes are supposed to be the modern representatives of one or other of the castes of the theoretical Indian system."&lt;ref&gt;Crooke, William. "Social Types". Chapter II in Risley, Sir Herbert Hope. ''The People of India'' {{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Varna'', as mentioned in [[Historical Vedic religion|ancient Hindu]] texts, describes society as divided into four categories: [[Brahmin]]s (scholars and yajna priests), [[Kshatriya]]s (rulers and warriors), [[Vaishyas]] (farmers, merchants and artisans) and [[Shudras]] (workmen/service providers). The texts do not mention any hierarchy or a separate, untouchable category in ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' classifications. Scholars believe that the ''Varnas'' system was never truly operational in society and there is no evidence of it ever being a reality in Indian history. The practical division of the society had always been in terms of ''Jatis'' (birth groups), which are not based on any specific religious principle, but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations to geographic areas. The ''Jātis'' have been endogamous social groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political or economic status. Many of India's major empires and dynasties like the Mauryas,&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Kaushik (2012), ''Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia: From Antiquity to the Present'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1-107-01736-8}} {{Page needed|date=June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shalivahanas,&lt;ref&gt;Shalivahana was born in a potter's house, by grace of Adi-Sheshan.

Asiatic Society. pp. 49–55&lt;/ref&gt; Chalukyas,&lt;ref&gt;Bilhana, in his Sanskrit work Vikramanakadevacharitam claims the Chalukyas were born from the feet of Brahma, implying they were Shudras, while some sources claim they were born in the arms of Brahma, and hence were Kshatriyas (Ramesh 1984, p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; Kakatiyas&lt;ref&gt;Most of the Kakatiya records proudly describe them as Shudra.[Talbot, Austin Cynthia (2001), ''Pre-colonial India in Practice: Society, Region, and Identity in Medieval Andhra'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19803-123-9}}] Examples include the Bothpur and Vaddamanu inscriptions of Ganapati's general Malyala Gunda senani. The Kakatiyas also maintained marital relations with other Shudra families, such as the Kotas and the Natavadi chiefs. All these evidences indicate that the Kakatiyas were of Shudra origin.[Sastry, P. V. Parabhrama (1978). N. Ramesan, ed. The Kākatiyas of Warangal. Hyderabad: Government of Andhra Pradesh. {{OCLC|252341228}}, p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt; among many others, were founded by people who would have been classified as Shudras, under the ''Varnas'' system, as interpreted by the British rulers. It is well established that by the 9th century, kings from all the four Varnas, including Brahmins and Vaishyas, had occupied the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India, contrary to the Varna theory.&lt;ref&gt;Notes of Yuan Chwang, Altekar, Anant Sadashiv (1934). ''The Rashtrakutas And Their Times; being a political, administrative, religious, social, economic and literary history of the Deccan during C. 750 A.D. to C. 1000 A.D.'' Poona: Oriental Book Agency. {{OCLC|3793499}}, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, as in Bengal, historically the kings and rulers had been called upon, when required, to mediate on the ranks of ''Jātis'', which might number in thousands all over the subcontinent and vary by region. In practice, the ''jātis'' may or may not fit into the ''Varna'' classes and many prominent ''Jatis'', for example the Jats and Yadavs, straddled two Varnas i.e. Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, and the ''Varna'' status of ''Jātis'' itself was subject to articulation over time. It has been argued that caste is neither varna nor jati though it masquerades as one or the other or both at the same time, depending on the purpose it is meant to serve. And since caste is not the same as the other two, it is, in fact, a new category deployed by the British for imagining the Indian society.

Starting with the [[Census of India prior to independence|1901 Census of India]] led by colonial administrator Herbert Hope Risley, all the ''jātis'' were grouped under the theoretical ''varnas'' categories.&lt;ref name=dirks&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7191.html|author=Nicholas B. Dirks|title=Castes of Mind: Colonialism and the Making of New India|year=2001|isbn=978-0-691-08895-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Lloyd Rudolph]], Risley believed that ''varna'', however ancient, could be applied to all the modern castes found in India, and "[he] meant to identify and place several hundred million Indians within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vnsnma5nW4C |title=The Modernity of Tradition: Political Development in India |first=Lloyd I. |last=Rudolph |author-link=Lloyd I.

"This action virtually removed Indians from the progress of history and condemned them to an unchanging position and place in time. In one sense, it is rather ironic that the British, who continually accused the Indian people of having a static society, should then impose a construct that denied progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/castesystem.htm | title=The British Empire, Imperialism, Colonialism, Colonies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''varna'' (conceptual classification based on occupation) and ''jāti'' (groups) are two distinct concepts: while ''varna'' is a theoretical four-part division, ''jāti'' (community) refers to the thousands of actual endogamous social groups prevalent across the subcontinent. The classical authors scarcely speak of anything other than the ''varnas'', as it provided a convenient shorthand; but a problem arises when colonial Indologists sometimes confuse the two.&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{citation |author=Dumont, Louis |title=Homo hierarchicus: the caste system and its implications |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1980 |pages=66–67 |isbn=978-0-226-16963-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, starting with the 1901 Census, caste as Varna forced upon Jatis, officially became India's essential institution, with an imprimatur from the British authorities, augmenting a discourse that had already dominated Indology. "Despite India's acquisition of formal political independence, it has still not regained the power to know its own past and present apart from that discourse".&lt;ref&gt;Inden, R. (1986).

The socio-economic limitations of the caste system are reduced due to [[Urbanization in India|urbanisation]] and [[Affirmative action in India|affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, the caste system still exists in [[endogamy]] and [[Family patrimony|patrimony]], and thrives in the politics of democracy, where caste provides ready made constituencies to politicians. The globalisation and economic opportunities from foreign businesses has influenced the growth of India's middle-class population. Some members of the Chhattisgarh Potter Caste Community (CPCC) are middle-class urban professionals and no longer potters unlike the remaining majority of traditional rural potter members. There is persistence of caste in Indian politics. Caste associations have evolved into caste-based political parties. Political parties and the state perceive caste as an important factor for mobilisation of people and policy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=Ronojoy.|title=The persistence of caste in indian politics|journal=Pacific Affairs|date=2012|volume=85|issue=2|pages=363–369|doi=10.5509/2012852363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by Bhatt and Beteille have shown changes in status, openness, mobility in the social aspects of Indian society. As a result of modern socio-economic changes in the country, India is experiencing significant changes in the dynamics and the economics of its social sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandhi|first1=Rag S.|title=From Caste to Class in Indian Society |journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations|date=1980|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While arranged marriages are still the most common practice in India, the internet has provided a network for younger Indians to take control of their relationships through the use of dating apps. This remains isolated to informal terms, as marriage is not often achieved through the use of these apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Gandhi|first1=Divya.|title= Running in the family|magazine=The Hindu|date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hypergamy]] is still a common practice in India and Hindu culture. Men are expected to marry within their caste, or one below, with no social repercussions. If a woman marries into a higher caste, then her children will take the status of their father. If she marries down, her family is reduced to the social status of their son in law. In this case, the women are bearers of the egalitarian principle of the marriage. There would be no benefit in marrying a higher caste if the terms of the marriage did not imply equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Kingsley Davis | date=13 June 2013 | title=Intermarriage in Caste Societies | journal=[[AnthroSource]] | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=376–395 | doi=10.1525/aa.1941.43.3.02a00030 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, men are systematically shielded from the negative implications of the agreement.

Geographical factors also determine adherence to the caste system. Many Northern villages are more likely to participate in exogamous marriage, due to a lack of eligible suitors within the same caste. Women in [[North India]] have been found to be less likely to leave or divorce their husbands since they are of a relatively lower caste system, and have higher restrictions on their freedoms. On the other hand, Pahari women, of the northern mountains, have much more freedom to leave their husbands without stigma. This often leads to better husbandry as his actions are not protected by social expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Berreman|first1=Gerald D.|title=Village Exogamy in Northernmost India|journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology|date=1962|volume=18|issue=1|pages=55–58|doi=10.1086/soutjanth.18.1.3629123|jstor=3629123|s2cid=131367161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiefly among the factors influencing the rise of exogamy is the rapid [[urbanisation in India]] experienced over the last century. It is well known that urban centers tend to be less reliant on agriculture and are more progressive as a whole. As India's cities boomed in population, the job market grew to keep pace. Prosperity and stability were now more easily attained by an individual, and the anxiety to marry quickly and effectively was reduced. Thus, younger, more progressive generations of urban Indians are less likely than ever to participate in the antiquated system of arranged endogamy.

India has also implemented a form of Affirmative Action, locally known as "reservation groups". Quota system jobs, as well as placements in publicly funded colleges, hold spots for the 8% of India's minority, and underprivileged groups. As a result, in states such as [[Tamil Nadu]] or those in the [[Northeast India|north-east]], where underprivileged populations predominate, over 80% of government jobs are set aside in quotas. In education, colleges lower the marks necessary for the Dalits to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Delhi A.R | date=13 June 2013 | title=Indian Reservations | url=https://www.economist.com/banyan/2013/06/29/indian-reservations | newspaper=[[The Economist]]| access-date=4 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nepali caste system resembles in some respects the Indian ''jāti'' system, with numerous ''jāti'' divisions with a ''varna'' system superimposed. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] period. [[Jayasthiti Malla]] (1382–1395) categorised Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506–1575). The Hindu social code was later set up in the [[Gorkha Kingdom]] by [[Ram Shah]] (1603–1636).

The caste system in Sri Lanka is a division of society into strata,&lt;ref name="John Rogers 51–77"&gt;{{cite journal|author=John Rogers|date=February 2004|title=Caste as a social category and identity in colonial Lanka|journal=Indian Economic and Social History Review|volume=41|pages=51–77|doi=10.1177/001946460404100104|number=1|s2cid=143883066}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by the textbook ''varnas'' and ''jāti'' system found in India. Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the [[Pujavaliya]], Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandyan-period]] Kadayimpoth – Boundary books as well indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka's monarchy.

[[Bali]]nese caste structure has been described as being based either on three categories—the noble triwangsa (thrice born), the middle class of ''dwijāti'' (twice born), and the lower class of ''ekajāti'' (once born)--or on four castes&lt;ref name=boon&gt;{{cite book|title=The Anthropological Romance of Bali 1597-1972: Dynamic Perspectives in Marriage and Caste, Politics and Religion|author=James Boon|year=1977|isbn=978-0-521-21398-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Brahmin]]as – [[priest]]
*[[Kshatriya|Satrias]] – [[knight]]hood
*[[Vaishya|Wesias]] – [[commerce]]
*[[Shudra|Sudras]] – [[Involuntary servitude|servitude]]

The Brahmana caste was further subdivided by Dutch ethnographers into two: Siwa and Buda. The Siwa caste was subdivided into five: Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher-caste Brahmana men with lower-caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to ''castas'' in [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]] such as [[New Spain|Mexico]], and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.&lt;ref name=boon/&gt;

====Philippines====
[[File:Naturales 3.png|thumb|upright|A [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] royal couple (''[[maginoo]]''), from the [[Boxer Codex]] (c. 1590)]]
In the Philippines, pre-colonial societies do not have a single social structure. The class structures can be roughly categorised into four types:&lt;ref name="Scott1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=William Henry |title=Class Structure in the Unhispanized Philippines |journal=Philippine Studies |date=1979 |volume=27 |issue=2, Special Issue in Memory of Frank Lynch |pages=137–159 |jstor=42632474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Classless societies - egalitarian societies with no class structure. Examples include the [[Mangyan people|Mangyan]] and the [[Kalanguya people]]s.&lt;ref name="Scott1979"/&gt;
* Warrior societies - societies where a distinct warrior class exists, and whose membership depends on martial prowess. Examples include the [[Mandaya people|Mandaya]], [[Bagobo people|Bagobo]], [[Tagakaulo people|Tagakaulo]], and [[B'laan people]]s who had warriors called the ''bagani'' or ''magani''. Similarly, in the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera highlands]] of [[Luzon]], the [[Isneg people|Isneg]] and [[Kalinga people]]s refer to their warriors as ''mengal'' or ''maingal''. This society is typical for [[head-hunting]] ethnic groups or ethnic groups which had seasonal raids (''[[mangayaw]]'') into enemy territory.&lt;ref name="Scott1979"/&gt;
* Petty [[Plutocracy|plutocracies]] - societies which have a wealthy class based on property and the hosting of periodic prestige feasts. In some groups, it was an actual caste whose members had specialised leadership roles, married only within the same caste, and wore specialised clothing. These include the ''kadangyan'' of the [[Ifugao people|Ifugao]], [[Bontoc people|Bontoc]], and [[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]] peoples, as well as the ''baknang'' of the [[Ibaloi people]]. In others, though wealth may give one prestige and leadership qualifications, it was not a caste per se.&lt;ref name="Scott1979"/&gt;
*Principalities - societies with an actual ruling class and caste systems determined by birthright. Most of these societies are either [[Greater India|Indianized]] or [[Islamized]] to a degree. They include the larger coastal ethnic groups like the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]], [[Visayan people|Visayan]], and [[Moro people|Moro]] societies. Most of them were usually divided into four to five caste systems with different names under different ethnic groups that roughly correspond to each other. The system was more or less [[feudalistic]], with the ''datu'' ultimately having control of all the lands of the community. The land is subdivided among the enfranchised classes, the ''sakop'' or ''sa-op'' ([[vassal]]s, lit. "those under the power of another"). The castes were hereditary, though they were not rigid. They were more accurately a reflection of the interpersonal political relationships, a person is always the follower of another. People can move up the caste system by marriage, by wealth, or by doing something extraordinary; and conversely they can be demoted, usually as criminal punishment or as a result of debt. Shamans are the exception, as they are either volunteers, chosen by the ranking shamans, or born into the role by innate propensity for it. They are enumerated below from the highest rank to the lowest:&lt;ref name="Scott1979"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arcilla"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arcilla, José S. |title =An Introduction to Philippine History|publisher =Ateneo de Manila University Press|year =1998|page=14&amp;ndash;16|isbn =9789715502610|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=uxEYobbU-D8C&amp;q=timawa&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scott2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott, William Henry |title =Barangay: sixteenth-century Philippine culture and society|publisher =Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=9789715501354|year =1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Royalty - ([[Visayan people|Visayan]]: ''[[kadatoan]]'') the ''[[datu]]'' and immediate descendants. They are often further categorised according to purity of lineage. The power of the ''datu'' is dependent on the willingness of their followers to render him respect and obedience. Most roles of the datu were judicial and military. In case of an unfit ''datu'', support may be withdrawn by his followers. ''Datu'' were almost always male, though in some ethnic groups like the [[Banwaon people]], the female shaman (''[[Philippine shamans|babaiyon]]'') co-rules as the female counterpart of the ''datu''.
:* Nobility - (Visayan: ''[[tumao]]''; [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]: ''[[maginoo]]''; [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] ''ginu''; [[Tausug people|Tausug]]: ''bangsa mataas'') the ruling class, either inclusive of or exclusive of the royal family. Most are descendants of the royal line or gained their status through wealth or bravery in battle. They owned lands and subjects, from whom they collected taxes.
:* [[Philippine shamans|Shamans]] - (Visayan: ''babaylan''; Tagalog: ''katalonan'') the spirit mediums, usually female or feminised men. While they weren't technically a caste, they commanded the same respect and status as nobility.
:* Warriors - (Visayan: ''[[timawa]]''; Tagalog: ''[[maharlika]]'') the martial class. They could own land and subjects like the higher ranks, but were required to fight for the ''datu'' in times of war. In some Filipino ethnic groups, they were often tattooed extensively to record feats in battle and as protection against harm. They were sometimes further subdivided into different classes, depending on their relationship with the ''datu''. They traditionally went on seasonal raids on enemy settlements.
:* Commoners and slaves - (Visayan, [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]]: ''[[ulipon]]''; Tagalog: ''[[alipin]]''; Tausug: ''kiapangdilihan''; [[Maranao people|Maranao]]: ''kakatamokan'') - the lowest class composed of the rest of the community who were not part of the enfranchised classes. They were further subdivided into the commoner class who had their own houses, the servants who lived in the houses of others, and the slaves who were usually captives from raids, criminals, or debtors. Most members of this class were equivalent to the European [[serf]] class, who paid taxes and can be conscripted to communal tasks, but were more or less free to do as they please.

====China and Mongolia====

During the period of [[Yuan Dynasty]], ruler [[Kublai Khan]] enforced a ''Four Class System'', which was a legal caste system. The order of four classes of people in descending order were:
* [[Mongols|Mongolian]]
* [[Semu]] people
* [[Han Chinese|Han]] people (in the northern areas of China)
* Southerners (people of the former Southern [[Song dynasty]])

Today, the [[Hukou system]] is argued by various Western sources to be the current caste system of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;"Chinese Society: Change, Conflict and Resistance", by Elizabeth J. Perry, Mark Selden, page [https://books.google.com/books?id=JqZyQCZmrRAC&amp;pg=PA90 90]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"China's New Confucianism: Politics and Everyday Life in a Changing Society", p. 86, by Daniel A.

====Tibet====
{{See also|Social classes of Tibet}}

There is significant controversy over the [[social classes of Tibet]], especially with regards to the [[serfdom in Tibet controversy]].

{{ill|Heidi Fjeld|no|vertical-align=sup}} has put forth the argument that pre-1950s Tibetan society was functionally a caste system, in contrast to previous scholars who defined the Tibetan social class system as similar to European feudal serfdom, as well as non-scholarly western accounts which seek to romanticise a supposedly 'egalitarian' ancient Tibetan society.

====Japan====
{{Main|Edo society}}
[[File:Edo social structure.svg|thumb|upright=2|Social classes during the Edo period ([[Tokugawa shogunate]])]]

In Japan's history, social strata based on inherited position rather than personal merit, were rigid and highly formalised in a system called ''mibunsei'' (身分制). At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles ([[kuge]]), together with the Shōgun and daimyō. Below them, the population was divided into [[Four occupations|four classes]]: [[samurai]], peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only samurai were allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants, craftsman or merchant who he felt were disrespectful. Merchants were the lowest caste because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, peasants were labelled as ''furiuri'', ''tanagari'', ''mizunomi-byakusho'' among others. As in Europe, the castes and sub-classes were of the same race, religion and culture.

Howell, in his review of [[Japan]]ese society notes that if a Western power had colonised Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan|author=David L. Howell|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24085-8|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vos and Wagatsuma observe that Japanese society had a systematic and extensive caste system. They discuss how alleged caste impurity and alleged racial inferiority, concepts often assumed to be different, are superficial terms, and are due to identical inner psychological processes, which expressed themselves in Japan and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=gdvhw&gt;{{cite book|title=Japan's invisible race: caste in culture and personality|url=https://archive.org/details/japansinvisibler00devorich|url-access=registration|author=George De Vos and Hiroshi Wagatsuma|publisher=University of California Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0-520-00306-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogamy was common because marriage across caste lines was socially unacceptable.&lt;ref name=gdvhw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Japanese Fashion: A Cultural History|author=Toby Slade|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-252-3|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japan]] had its own untouchable caste, shunned and ostracised, historically referred to by the insulting term ''eta'', now called ''[[burakumin]]''. While modern law has officially abolished the class hierarchy, there are reports of discrimination against the ''buraku'' or ''burakumin'' underclasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF39.htm |title=Class, Ethnicity and Nationality: Japan Finds Plenty of Space for Discrimination |publisher=Hrdc.net |date=2001-06-18 |access-date=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''burakumin'' are regarded as "ostracised".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The ''burakumin'' are one of the main [[demographics of Japan|minority groups in Japan]], along with the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of [[Hokkaidō]] and those of [[Zainichi Korean|Korean]] or [[Chinese in Japan|Chinese]] descent.

====Korea====
{{Korean caste system}}
[[File:Korea-History-Goban Game in Seoul Korea 1904 (LOC).jpg|thumb|upright|A typical Yangban family scene from 1904. The Yoon family had an enduring presence in Korean politics from the 1800s until the 1970s.]]

The [[baekjeong]] (백정) were an "untouchable" outcaste of Korea. The meaning today is that of butcher. It originates in the [[Goryeo-Khitan Wars|Khitan invasion of Korea]] in the 11th century. The defeated [[Khitan people|Khitans]] who surrendered were settled in isolated communities throughout Goryeo to forestall rebellion. They were valued for their skills in hunting, herding, butchering, and making of leather, common skill sets among nomads. Over time, their ethnic origin was forgotten, and they formed the bottom layer of Korean society.

In 1392, with the foundation of the Confucian [[Joseon dynasty]], Korea systemised its own native class system. At the top were the two official classes, the [[Yangban]], which literally means "two classes". It was composed of scholars (''munban'') and warriors (''muban''). Scholars had a significant social advantage over the warriors. Below were the ''jung-in'' (중인-中人: literally "middle people". This was a small class of specialised professions such as medicine, accounting, translators, regional bureaucrats, etc. Below that were the ''sangmin'' (상민-常民: literally 'commoner'), farmers working their own fields. Korea also had a [[serf]] population known as the ''nobi''. The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Junius P.|title=The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780874368857|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalencycl01rodr/page/392 392]|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalencycl01rodr|url-access=registration|quote=10 percent of the total population on average, but it could rise up to one-third of the total.|access-date=14 February 2017|language=en|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, the vast majority of government nobi were emancipated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Youngmin|last2=Pettid|first2=Michael J.|title=Women and Confucianism in Choson Korea: New Perspectives|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9781438437774|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwgUa6WWFBMC&amp;pg=PA141|access-date=14 February 2017|language=en|date=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1858 the nobi population stood at about 1.5% of the total population of Korea.&lt;ref name="nobi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Gwyn|title=Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135759179|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0iRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163|access-date=14 February 2017|language=en|date=2004-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around 1886–87 and the rest of the nobi system was abolished with the [[Gabo Reform]] of 1894,&lt;ref name="nobi" /&gt; but traces remained until 1930.

The opening of Korea to foreign [[Christian mission|Christian missionary]] activity in the late 19th century saw some improvement in the status of the ''baekjeong''. However, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and even so protests erupted when missionaries tried to integrate ''baekjeong'' into worship, with non-''baekjeong'' finding this attempt insensitive to traditional notions of hierarchical advantage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Around the same time, the ''baekjeong'' began to resist open social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=In Search of Human Rights: The Paekchŏng Movement in Colonial Korea|title=Colonial Modernity in Korea|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|editor=Gi-Wook Shin and Michael Robinson|year=1999|pages=326|isbn=978-0-674-00594-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on social and economic injustices affecting them, hoping to create an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] Korean society. Their efforts included attacking social discrimination by upper class, authorities, and "commoners", and the use of degrading language against children in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Korean Paekjŏng under Japanese rule: the quest for equality and human rights|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|year=2003|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Gabo reform]] of 1896, the class system of Korea was officially abolished. Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]], the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the [[Korean Empire]], introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists' cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.&lt;ref name="proper"&gt;Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California. ''Citizenship, Social Equality and Government Reform: Changes in the Household Registration System in Korea, 1894–1910''&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Koreans by then had surnames and even [[bongwan]], although still substantial number of [[cheonmin]], mostly consisted of [[serfs]] and slaves, and [[Untouchability|untouchables]] did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters' surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term ''inmin'' ("people") and later, ''kungmin'' ("citizen").&lt;ref name="proper"/&gt;

The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracised, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=Obinna1/&gt;

The ''osu'' class systems of eastern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the "Osus" people as "owned by deities" and outcasts.

The [[Songhai people|Songhai]] economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africankingdoms.com|title=Kingdoms of Ancient African History|website=africankingdoms.com|access-date=22 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519102901/http://africankingdoms.com/|archive-date=19 May 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Ivory Coast]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo|author=Dolores Richter|journal=Africa|date= January 1980|volume=50|issue=1|pages=37–54|doi=10.2307/1158641|jstor=1158641|s2cid=146454269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.

Tamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the [[Toucouleur people|Tukulor]], [[Songhai people|Songhay]], [[Dogon people|Dogon]], [[Senufo people|Senufo]], [[Minyanka language|Minianka]], Moors, [[Mandinka people|Manding]], [[Soninke people|Soninke]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Serer people|Serer]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]. Castes appeared among the [[Mandinka people|''Malinke'' people]] no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.

As West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specialisations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.&lt;ref name=tamari1&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1991|volume=32|issue=2|pages=221–250|doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718|title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa|author=Tal Tamari|s2cid=162509491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central Africa====
[[Ethel M. Albert]] in 1960 claimed that the societies in [[Central Africa]] were caste-like social stratification systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Socio-Political Organization and Receptivity to Change: Some Differences between Ruanda and Urundi|author=Ethel M. Albert|journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology|volume=16|number= 1|date= Spring 1960|pages=46–74|doi=10.1086/soutjanth.16.1.3629054|s2cid=142847876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1961, Maquet notes that the society in [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] can be best described as castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Premise of Inequality in Ruanda: A Study of Political Relations in a Central African Kingdom|author= Jacques J. Maquet|year=1962|pages=135–171|publisher=Oxford University Press, London|isbn=978-0-19-823168-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tutsi]], noted Maquet, considered themselves as superior, with the more numerous [[Hutu]] and the least numerous [[Twa]] regarded, by birth, as respectively, second and third in the hierarchy of Rwandese society. These groups were largely endogamous, exclusionary and with limited mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Power in Ruanda|author=Helen Codere|journal=Anthropologica|volume=4|number=1|year=1962|pages=45–85|jstor=25604523|doi=10.2307/25604523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Horn of Africa====
[[File:NSRW Africa Midgan.png|thumb|upright|The [[Madhiban]] (Midgan) specialise in leather occupation. Along with the Tumal and Yibir, they are collectively known as ''sab''.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;]]
In a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in [[Ethiopia]] in communities such as the [[Gurage people|Gurage]] and [[Konso people|Konso]]. He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=La Caste en Afrique? (Caste in Africa?)|author=D. M. Todd|journal=Africa|date=October 1977|volume=47 |issue=4|pages= 398–412|doi=10.2307/1158345|jstor=1158345|s2cid=144428371}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alula Pankhurst]] has published a study of caste groups in [[South West Ethiopia Peoples' Region|SW Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, Alula. 1999. {{"'}}Caste' in Africa: the evidence from south-western Ethiopia reconsidered". ''Africa'' 69(4), pp. 485–509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Kingdom of Kafa|Kafa]], there were also traditionally groups labelled as castes. "Based on research done before the Derg regime, these studies generally presume the existence of a social hierarchy similar to the caste system. At the top of this hierarchy were the Kafa, followed by occupational groups including blacksmiths (Qemmo), weavers (Shammano), bards (Shatto), potters, and tanners (Manno). In this hierarchy, the Manjo were commonly referred to as hunters, given the lowest status equal only to slaves."&lt;ref&gt;p. 299. Sayuri Yoshida. "Why did the Manjo convert to Protestant? Social Discrimination and Coexistence in Kafa, Southwest Ethiopia?" ''Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies'', ed. by Svein Ege, Harald
Aspen, Birhanu Teferra and Shiferaw Bekele, Trondheim 2009. pp. 299–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Borana Oromo]] of southern [[Ethiopia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] also have a class system, wherein the Wata, an acculturated hunter-gatherer group, represent the lowest class. Though the Wata today speak the [[Oromo language]], they have traditions of having previously spoken another language before adopting Oromo.&lt;ref name="Westermann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diedrich Westermann|first=Edwin William Smith, Cyril Daryll Forde|title=Africa|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditionally nomadic [[Somali people]] are divided into clans, wherein the [[Rahanweyn]] agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the [[Madhiban]] were traditionally sometimes treated as outcasts.&lt;ref&gt;I. M. Lewis, ''A pastoral democracy: a study of pastoralism and politics among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa'' (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster: 1999), pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; As Gabboye, the Madhiban along with the [[Yibir]] and Tumaal (collectively referred to as ''sab'') have since obtained political representation within [[Somalia]], and their general social status has improved with the expansion of urban centers.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=I.M.|title=Understanding Somalia and Somaliland: Culture, History, Society|year=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231700849|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
European [[feudalism]] with its rigid aristocracy can also be considered as a caste system.

==== Basque region ====
For centuries, through the modern times, the majority regarded [[Cagot]]s who lived primarily in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque region]] of France and Spain as an inferior caste, the untouchables. While they had the same skin color and religion as the majority, in the churches they had to use segregated doors, drink from segregated fonts, and receive communion on the end of long wooden spoons. It was a closed social system. The socially isolated Cagots were endogamous, and chances of social mobility non-existent.&lt;ref name="indi-2008-07-28"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-last-untouchable-in-europe-878705.html |first=Sean |last=Thomas |title=The Last Untouchable in Europe |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=28 July 2008 |pages=20 |access-date=28 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210112024608/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/last-untouchable-europe-878705.html |archive-date=12 January 2021 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansson1996"&gt;{{cite book|author-first=Anders |author-last=Hansson |title=Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA15 |year=1996 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-10596-6 |pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In July 2013, the UK government announced its intention to amend the [[Equality Act 2010]], to "introduce legislation on caste, including any necessary exceptions to the caste provisions, within the framework of domestic discrimination law".&lt;ref&gt;Government Equalities Office, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225658/130726-Caste-Discrimination.pdf Caste legislation introduction – programme and timetable], accessed 2 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Section 9(5) of the Equality Act 2010 provides that "a [[Minister (government)|Minister]] may by [[Statutory order|order]] amend the statutory definition of race to include caste and may provide for exceptions in the Act to apply or not to apply to caste".

From September 2013 to February 2014, [[Meena Dhanda]] led a project on "Caste in Britain" for the UK [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publication-download/research-report-91-caste-britain-socio-legal-review|title=Research report 91: Caste in Britain: Socio-legal Review {{!}} Equality and Human Rights Commission|website=equalityhumanrights.com|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
====United States====
{{main|Racial segregation in the United States}}
In [[W. Lloyd Warner]]'s view, the historic relationship between [[African Americans|Blacks]] and [[White Americans|Whites]] in the US showed many caste-like features such as [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential segregation]] and marriage restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1086/217391|title = American Caste and Class| journal=American Journal of Sociology| volume=42| issue=2| pages=234–237|year = 1936|last1 = Warner|first1 = W. Lloyd|s2cid = 146641210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her best-selling 2020 book ''[[Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents]]'', journalist [[Isabel Wilkerson]] similarly uses caste as a means to understand the racial hierarchy of the United States. Discrimination based upon socio-economic factors are historically prevalent within the country.

According to [[Gerald Berreman|Gerald D. Berreman]], in the two systems, there are rigid rules of avoidance and certain types of contacts are defined as contaminating. In India, there are complex religious features which make up the system, whereas in the United States race and color are the basis for differentiation. The caste systems in India and the United States have higher groups which desire to retain their positions for themselves and thus perpetuate the two systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berreman|first=Gerald|date=September 1960|title=Caste in India and the United States|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=66|issue=2|pages=120–127|jstor=2773155|doi=10.1086/222839|s2cid=143949609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isabel Wilkerson relates the caste systems of the United States, India, and [[Nazi Germany]] together. She makes the argument that all caste systems are derived off of foundational principles including a divine or natural justification for the system, terror or cruelty by the dominant caste to remain in power, heritability of caste, and occupational hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wilkerson|first=Isabel|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1147928120|title=Caste : the origins of our discontents|date=2020|isbn=978-0-593-23025-1|edition=First|location=New York|pages=99 et seq|oclc=1147928120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of creating a homogenised society by social engineering in both India and the US has created other institutions that have made class distinctions among different groups evident. Anthropologist [[James C. Scott]] elaborates on how "global [[capitalism]] is perhaps the most powerful force for homogenization, whereas the state may be the defender of local difference and variety in some instances".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Scott, James C.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37392803|title=Seeing like a state : how certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-07016-0|location=New Haven|pages=8|oclc=37392803}}&lt;/ref&gt; The caste system, a relic of feudalistic economic systems, emphasises differences between socio-economic classes that are obviated by openly free market capitalistic economic systems, which reward individual initiative, enterprise, merit, and thrift, thereby creating a path for social mobility.  When the feudalistic slave economy of the [[southern United States]] was dismantled, even [[Jim Crow laws]] did not prevent the economic success of many industrious [[African Americans]], including millionaire women like [[Maggie L. Walker|Maggie Walker]], [[Annie Turnbo Malone|Annie Malone]], and [[Madam C. J. Walker|Madame C.J. Walker]].  Parts of the United States are sometimes divided by race and class status despite the national narrative of integration.
==Caste in sociology and entomology==
The initial observational studies of the division of labour in ant colonies attempted to demonstrate that ants specialized in tasks that were best suited to their size when they emerged from the pupae stage into the adult stage. {{sfn|Gordon|2010|p=26}} A large proportion of the experimental work was done in species that showed strong variation in size.{{sfn|Gordon|2010|p=26}} As the size of an adult was fixed for life, workers of a specific size range came to be called a "caste," calling up the traditional caste system in India in which a human's standing in society was decided at birth.{{sfn|Gordon|2010|p=26}}

The notion of caste encouraged a link between scholarship in entomology and sociology because it served as an example of a division of labour in which the participants seemed to be uncompromisingly adapted to special functions and sometimes even unique environments.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=80}}  To bolster the concept of caste, entomologists and sociologists referred to the complementary social or natural parallel and thereby appeared to generalize the concept and give it an appearance of familiarity.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|pp=80&amp;ndash;82}}  In the late 19th- and early 20th centuries, the perceived similarities between the Indian caste system and [[Ant#polymorphism|caste polymorphism]] in insects were used to create a  correspondence or parallelism for the purpose of explaining or clarifying racial stratification in human societies; the explanations came particularly to be employed in the United States.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=81}}  Ideas from  [[heredity]] and [[natural selection]] influenced some sociologists who believed that some groups were predetermined to belong to a lower social or occupational status.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=81}}  Chiefly through the work of [[W. Lloyd Warner]] at the [[University of Chicago]], a group of sociologists sharing similar principles came to evolve around the creed of caste in the 1930s and 1940s.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=81}}  

The ecologically-oriented sociologist [[Robert E. Park]], although attributing more weight to environmental explanations than the biological nonetheless believed that there were obstacles to the assimilation of blacks into American society and that an "accommodation stage" in a biracially organized caste system was required before full assimilation.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=82}}  He did disavow his position in 1937, suggesting that blacks were a minority and not a caste.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=82}}  The Indian sociologist [[Radhakamal Mukerjee]] was influenced by Robert E. Park and adopted the concept of "caste" to describe race relations in the US.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|pp=81&amp;ndash;82}}   According to anthropologist Diane Rodgers, Mukerjee "proceeded to suggest that a caste system should be correctly instituted in the (US) South to ease race relations."{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|pp=81&amp;ndash;82}}  Mukerjee often employed both entomological and sociological data and clues to describe caste systems.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=82}}  He wrote  "while the fundamental industries of man are dispersed throughout the insect world, the same kind of polymorphism appears again and again in different species of social insects which have reacted in the same manner as man, under the influence of the same environment, to ensure the supply and provision of subsistence."{{sfn|Mukerjee|1926|p=228}}  Comparing the caste system in India to caste polymorphism in insects, he noted, "where we find the organization of social insects developed to perfection, there also has been seen among human associations a minute and even rigid specialization of functions, along with ant- and bee-like societal integrity and cohesiveness."{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=82}} He considered the "resemblances between insect associations and caste-ridden societies" to be striking enough to be "amusing."{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=82}}
