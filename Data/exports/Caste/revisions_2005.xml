Around one in 25 people in the world experiences some form of caste discrimination; more than half of these are in India.

The word ''caste'' is derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or [[Spanish  language|Spanish]] word ''casta'', meaning [[lineage]], [[breed]] or [[race]].

==Overview==
[[cultural anthropology|Anthropologists]] use the term more generally to refer to a social group that is [[Endogamy|endogamous]] and [[Profession|occupationally]] specialised; such groups are common in highly stratified societies with a very low degree of social mobility.  Broadly understood, [[South Africa]] during the era of [[apartheid]], the practice of [[slavery]] in the [[antebellum]] South of the [[United States]] through the [[American Civil Rights Movement|Civil Rights movement]], colonial [[Latin America]] under [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] rule (see [[Casta]]), and [[India]] prior to 1947 were all class and caste-based societies.

Caste is not unique to Hinduism.  Aside from India, caste systems still exist today in other parts of South Asia, and some countries in Africa have equivalents of the [[Untouchables]] ([[Dalit (outcaste)|Dalit]]) as a small proportion of the population.[http://www.dalits.org/globalcastesystems.htm]

5 categories called "Varna":
====Brahman====
priestly caste, on top of all others ex. kings

====Kshatriya====
responsible for upholding justice and social harmony, and including people in governing and military positions.

====Vaishya====
Indian society, comprising farmers, herders, artisans, merchants, and businessmen.

====Shudra====
the servants and workers

====Harijans====

*Within each of these categories are the actual "sub-castes"(jatis) within which people are born, marry, and die. 
*Although a varna is not a sub-caste, when asked, many Indians associate affiliations with a jati (sub-caste) name
*They all have their own place among each other and accept that it is the way to keep society from disintegrating to chaos.
*The first four Varnas existed in ancient Aryan society of Northern India and were originally fluid groups.  
*The caste system is used by Hindus, particularly in India and Nepal for reasons of determining lineage passed down through patrilineal descent.
*Although illegal, the system still has a major role in modern India.

====Twice Born====
*The first three castes are seen as 'twice born' allowed to study vedas

Existence of Castes is validated through the idea of rebirth according to a person's karma, the sum of an individual's deeds in this life and in past lives. After death, a person's life is judged by divine forces, and rebirth is assigned in a high or a low place, depending upon what is deserved. 
	
====Jati====
*Sub-castes within a Varna are called Jati 
*Each Jati members are allowed to marry only with their Jati.
*People are born into their Jati and it cannot be changed. 
*Each jati is part of a locally based system of interdependence with other groups, involving occupational specialization, and is linked in complex ways with networks that stretch across regions and throughout the nation.
	
====Inequalities among castes====
*Part of the divinely ordained natural order expressd in terms of purity and pollution
	
====Dharma====
Each caste is believed by devout Hindus to have its own dharma, or divinely ordained code of proper conduct. Accordingly, there is often a high degree of tolerance for divergent lifestyles among different castes.

==Indian caste system==
{{main|Indian caste system}}

The Indian caste system is a [[social system]] in which people are divided into separate communities, known in English as [[caste]]s, and in [[Hindi]] as ''Varna'' meaning "colour" or quality. The origin of the caste system is unknown (it exists in Indian populations as ''jatis'') but it affected the many societies that occupy the Indian sub-continent, and later it was transmitted to [[Nepal]]. Most Western thought and writing on the subject misapplies the term ''jati'' (sub-caste) to the Sanskrit word for Varna (or Caste). In Hindu religious terms the caste system was initiated by Manu, a Hindu priest. This system was basically a simple division of society into four castes or Varnas ([[Brahmin]], [[Kshatriya]], [[Vaishya]] and [[Sudra]]) arranged according to their function in Indian society. The four varnas by which the function of Indian society has been grouped cannot be identified with the color of the human skin, but by its "quality" or functions in pan-indian sense. Beyond these four castes were the panchamas (or fifths) . These groups were regarded as impure due to their traditional occupations of handling impure substances and therefore  were "Untouchable" ([[Dalit (outcaste)|Dalit]]) outcastes until a few decades ago.

For most Indians however, the central fact of their social identity is the sub-caste (''jati'') grouping they belong to, not the caste or Varna that a particular ''jati'' may be thought to fall under. Legally the Indian government forbids the practice of caste-based discrimination. The historic lower castes are provided opportunities through a system called "reservations", in which they are provided with quotas in jobs and educations (A step above affirmative action). Between 20-25% of all opportunities in higher education are reserved for the so called "scheduled castes" and other "backward castes". 

The caste system has existed in India from time immemorial.  The word "caste" is supposed to translate the Sanskrit word "Varna" but sometimes erraneously as "jati" which is actually a sub-caste in a local region.  The sub-caste (''jati'') belongs to a particular "varna". jati designates specialized hereditary functions to an endogamous community locally.  

Given the long history of humans on the Indian sub-continent and the semi-independent development of numerous socio-cultural groups, the population came to be differentiated by endogamous and occupational groupings, perhaps from pre-historic times. These were and still are subgroups (sub-castes) belonging to the four Varnas. By the time we see the development of a pan-Indian cultural notion of Varna, essentially that of being a "Hindu", the sub-caste ''jatis'' had proliferated which led to the complexity of India's social structure.

Hinduism came to be "Varnashrama Dharma", the order of (four) castes and (four) stages in life. In pan-indian terms, each local ''jatis'' were associated with a particular Varna in  pan-indian sense. The people belong to a ''jati'' or sub-caste are being identified by their social function/occupation locally and ''not'' determined by their economic status i.e, identified by their jati-dharma or jati-function/occupation. Most Indian law givers, maintained that the caste of Brahmins are foremost followed by the Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra in the social hierarchy. 

Perhaps the most interesting point about this caste structure is not that it is hierarchical (which it is without a doubt) but rather that the hierarchy disperses only social status but not necessarly economic power. 

Local ''jati'' sub-castes have also been largely endogamous except when different ''jati'' occupational groups merged their jati identification within a Varna. Hence, the proliferation of endogamous groups leading to ''jati'' diversity within each four Varna, as too the similarities across them. 
 
Much attention has been paid to the limitations on marraiges across varna/jati categories. Again it is instructive to note that many influential Brahmins, presumptive superiors in the traditional social ordering, had marriage relations that spanned Varnas. Some part of India, Brahmins used to marry Kshatriya Varna girls but less frequently with Vaishya girls. In these cases the offsprings invariably takes the caste of Kshatriya and Vaisya respectively. Brahmins developed various new systems and practices to increase their own numbers and spread the philosophy of social division based on birth. For example, in Bengal, a system of polygamy was developed and widely practiced by Brahmins called "Kulin System". This system was based on the edict that each brahmin sub-caste must marry their daughters to a higher sub-caste brahmin in order to maintain the purity and improve purity of their blood. This edict forced the people to find a suitable life partner for their daughters from a small number of brahmins who many a times took money to get married to a girl. This arrangement, however, did not put any obligations on the groom to fulfil his marital duties. The bride remained in her parental house and the husband visited her only when he wished. This way brahmin population increased greatly and became the majority single caste.


The Varna and ''jati'' system do not appear to have been the product of a conquering or dominating socio-economic class. Both systems have survived and indeed identification of ''jati'' has strengthened, long after the supposed era of "Brahmin dominance". The system is instead an implicit negotiation between India's numerous hereditary occupational (and infrequently ethnic) endogamous groups. The jati system at any given point in time is a point of equilibrium between these elements of society both at the local and pan-Indian level.



===Modern perceptions of caste===
Whilst the ancient Vedas are said to talk about only four varnas or castes, contemporary India has numerous sub-castes (jatis) within each Varna, officially documented (primarily to determine those deserving [[reservation]], an [[affirmative action]] process similar to and predating  the [[United States|US]] system) through the [[census]]. Caste-based [[politics]] have strong roots in many Indian states. At most times, conversions to other religions like [[Christianity]], or [[Islam]], does not result in end of ''jati'' identity due to deep social stratification and lack of social mobility.

The embracement of the lower castes into the mainstream of society was brought about by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] who called them [[Harijan]]s ("people of God").
[[Mahatma Gandhi]] was himself a devout hindu who vehemently believed in sanctity of Varna system that was at the root of Caste system in India and all the related social prejudices. His naming of lower castes as [[Harijan]]s ("people of God") simply became a euphemism (another name) by which the upper castes call the lower castes.
Infact, Mahatma Gandhi hurt the cause of Dalit upliftment by opposing Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]]'s movement and the major concessions he won from erstwhile Indian Goverment. Dr. Ambedkar was able to win right of representation in Legislative assemblies and Separate electorate for Dalits. But Gandhi went on a hunger strike to blackmail Dr. Ambedkar to give up the hard-won victory and fruites of decades-long struggle. He claimed that lower classes where themselves ''Hindus'' and should not be regarded as a separate group, however ground realities were in stark contrast to his stand.

Currently, India has tough laws against untouchability on the basis of caste.  In India caste affects daily life. Matrimony between members of different castes is still looked down upon, Intercaste marriages are very rare. Caste based [[atrocity|atrocities]] sometimes occur in many economically backward states and isolated rural districts. There is a policy for the socio-economic upliftment of the erstwhile outcastes, by the provision of [[education]], reservation of admission seats in institutions for higher education, and a 12.5% [[quota]] in [[government]] jobs with faster promotions. These [[affirmative action]]s have often been challenged in courts, and through mass protests. Anti-reservation activists allege that the process, which they suspect is fuelled by political gains, artificially fosters the sub-divisions. A few allege that in the process of categorizing people "who need reservation", sub-caste based ''jati'' identities becomes very important and is firmly entrenched in the Indian [[psyche]]. Many also allege that the progress of the meritorious is cramped by the reservation system, which has not been set any deadline by the [[Constitution of India]]. Pro-reservation activists allege that the system helps in upliftment of the lower castes and needs to be in place until all sections achieve an equal status in the Indian society. However, what started as a way of upliftment of a certain section of the society, has turned into a full fledged vote bank issue for the politicians. Certain states in India have a reservations of over 70%. Still not even 4% of the total "scheduled caste" population has been able to reach the higher rungs of decision making burocracy. Infact participation of scheduled castes in all areas of govenance, education, private section and business is negligible. This reflects the glaring gap between legislations and implementations. Infact the failure of scheduled castes in taking advantage of this system has been due to total failure of state in providing sufficient facilities in area of basic education. Most of the scheduled caste students study in government-run school that do not charge any fees. But the quality of education is very bad and the system works to the disadvantage of these students, especially in rural areas as even teachers are found to be prejudiced against lower caste students.

People who oppose the system of reservations in education and jobs, however, always forget the centuries old system of social and economic reservation that upper castes of hindus have been enjoying. Basic understanding of the way casteism has been operating in India for centuries is in the order to see through this logic. For centuries, the education was sole prerogative of the "Twice Born" and the lower castes or today's "scheduled castes" were kept away from education and any kind of access to formal knowledge by force. This single edict was so strongly practised that the holiest of hindu scriptures contained edicts as to how one should conduct the business of law if a Shudra was found to be practising knowledge acquisition by any means. The "Shambook Vadh" incident in "Uttar Kand" of Ramayana is one such incident where King Rama kills a shudra sage "Shambook" simply because he attempted to cross the boundaries of Varnashram Dharma by trying to acquire knowledge and attaining Nirwana.
Then the second level of traditional "reservation" has been of economic kind. There were various levels to this as well.
Shudras were not supposed to practice any profession that could give them financial independence. They were supposed to only serve the first three classes and in turn, it was the duty of the "twice borne" to make sure that he does not go hungry.
This effectively ensured the economic slavery of Shudras at the feet of upper castes. At second level, the laws were enacted that took away the right to wealth from shudras. A Shudra could not accumulate any kind of wealth, be it money, metal or livestock. If he does so, the Brahmins had power to take it away from him. So this "reserved" all the financial resources for the three top vernas.
The next level was the social reservation for upper classes. Untouchables were not allowed to use the same streets, same water resources and same better housing as the three upper classes. This way they were forced to drink water from unsafe and unhieginic sources causing various diseases and infections thereby limiting their strenth and life-spans.
In the light of above facts, you can well imagine the system of reservation that has been prevelent in India for a long long time. Even today, there are villages and towns, where these "reservations" for upper castes exists in one form or other. But there is never any movement or public protests against these from the anti-reservation lobby. Their sole target is the small number of seats that are offerred in Goverment run schools/colleges to the poorest of the poor students in the form of reservations.

==Nepalese caste system==
The caste system in [[Nepal]] can be traced back to the introduction of [[Muluki Ain]] (1854) by [[Jung Bahadur Rana]] after his return from his European tour. The Muluki Ain (1854) was a written version of social code that had been in practice for several centuries in Nepal. Its caste categories diverged from the four varnas of the classical Vedic model and instead had three categories to accommodate the tribal peoples between the pure and impure castes. These were further classified into five hierarchies with the following order precedence. (Harka Gurung 2005:3,Occational Papers in Sociology and Anthropology)

·	Thagadhari, (Wearer of holy chord)
·	Matwali
v	Namasyane Matwali (Non-enslavable alcohol-drinkers)
v	Masyane Matwali (Enslavable alcohol drinkers)
·	 Pani nachalne choichoto halnu naparne, (Impure but touchable castes)
·	Pani nachalne chiochoti halnu parne, (Impure and Untouchable castes)


The above mention categories implies that Thagadhari (Wearer of holy chord) remains in the highest hierarchy in Hindu caste system followed by Matwali, (Non-enslavable alcohol-drinkers) and enslavable alcohol drinkers touchable caste and lastly untouchable.

Muluki Ain imposes the caste system in Nepal in order to incorporate people of different origin to bring under one umbrella of caste system. The first categories of Thagadhari which include Parbate Brahmin and Chettri are in the higher categories of hierarchy where as Brahmins of Terai and Newari Brahmin as per Muluki Ain do not fall under these categories.

Matwali group, salvable and enslavable falls under second categories, which include the people of ethnic origin and Brahmins of terai and Newari Brahmins. It also includes those people in the non-enslavable group such as Magar, Gurung, Rai, and Limbu etc and enslavable are Tamang, Chepang, Thami etc.

Untouchable are the categories of varnas system in ancient Manu's Code but some people such as Musalman and foreigners as well falls under these categories. Untouchables are divided into Pani nachalne choichoto halnu naparne, (Impure but touchable castes) and Pani nachalne chiochoti halnu parne, (Impure and Untouchable castes). In present day context caste system falls under Hindu varna system i.e,Brahmin,Khatria  Vaisias and Sudra respectively instead of following Muluki Ain's codification, as ethnic group do not follow the caste system because they have their own culture, tradition ,religion and values system which do not fall under caste system.

==Sri Lankan caste system==
The caste system appears to have been introduced to [[Sri Lanka]] by [[Aryan]]-language-speakers from North India. There is evidence of the main vedic castes in the early [[Anuradhapura]] era. The introduction of [[Buddhism]] in the 3rd century BCE somewhat blunted the edge of the system somewhat. However, there is a reference to King [[Dutugemunu]] Abhaya's son, [[Saliya]] choosing to lose caste by marrying [[Asokamala]], a [[Chandala]] (outcaste) woman, in the 2nd century BCE.

The later caste system seems to have evolved as much through waves of ethnic migration as by occupation.  Among the present-day [[Sinhalese]] the Vedic categories no longer exist, while among the Sri Lanka [[Tamils]], the only Vedic category to persist is that of [[Brahmins]]; these ethnic groups share many categories.

The major Sinhalese castes (''Jathi'') are: ''Govigama'' or ''Goyi'' ('farmers'), ''Navandhaenna'' or ''Ridhi'' (silversmiths), ''Karava'' (fishermen), ''Dhurave'' (toddy tappers), ''Salagama'' or ''Haali'' (cinnamon peelers), ''Wahumpura'' or ''Hakuru'' (Jaggery-makers), ''Bathgama'' or ''Padhu'' (bearers), ''Berava'' (Tom-tom beaters), ''Panna'' (grass-cutters), ''Kumbal'' (potters), [[Radha]] (Washers or Dhobies), ''Demelagaththaro'' (Tamil tribes) and ''Hinna'' (washers to the Salagamas). There also 'Out' castes, the Tamil-speaking, wandering 'Gypsies' - ''Rodi'' and ''Ahikuntaka''. The aboriginal [[Veddas]] were considered to be outside the caste system: many aristocratic families claim descent from these tribes; however, the 'Gypsy' castes may be ofshoots of aboriginal hunters employed by the ancient kings.

Among the Tamils, many of these castes are duplicated: ''Vellala'' (equivalent to ''Govigama''), ''Karaiyar'' (''Karava'') and ''Dhuraiyar'' (''Dhurave''). There is also a caste called  ''Kovi'', the members of which claim to be Sinhalese ''Govigama'' isolated in Tamil areas after the [[Chola]] conquest of the North.

The Indian Tamils who were brought over by the British as [[indentured labour]] were mainly from the lower Indian castes; the South Indian categories came over with them.

It appears that caste was more important than ethnicity until comparatively recently. In pre-British times, the ''Govigama'' were classed as ''Vellala'' by the colonial authorities. [[Eurasians]] and South Indian ''[[Chetties]]'' were absorbed into the ''Govigamas''. Cross-ethnic marriage was fairly common. Several leading 'aristocratic' Sinhalese families are descended from Tamils or [[Keralites]]. Many ''Karavas'' speak Tamil at home and have relatives among the 'Tamil' ''Karaiyars''.

Religious practice tends to reinforce the caste system. In the feudal era, people of low castes were not allowed into the shrines of the major gods or into the [[Sangha|Buddhist clergy]]. The priests of the gods ([[kapuralas]]) had to be Govigama among the Sinhalese, Brahmins among the Tamils. However, the '[[Devil Dancers]]' (exorcists, healers and sorcerers) were drawn from the tom-tom beating caste.

In the 19th century the [[Amarapura Nikaya|Amarapura ]] and [[Ramanna Nikaya|Ramanna]] sects were formed to allow non-Govigama priests to be ordained, in opposition to the casteist [[Siam Nikaya| Siam]] sect. In the late 1960s, there were a series of '[[Temple Struggles]]' in the northern Jaffna district, during which members of lower castes forced their way into Hindu temples, establishing their right of entry.

==Castes in ancient Israel==
Something akin to the caste system was also found in [[Judaism]] (during the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] period), which divided its society into the inherited [[Cohanim]] priesthood, who, due to their Temple duties, had access to most parts of the Temple, [[Levites]], whose auxiliary duties allowed them somewhat less access than the Cohanim, and the rest of the [[Israelites]], whose involvement in the Temple was lesser than the Levites. This "caste system" had mostly ritualistic ramifications, and the social side-effects were very limited and far lesser than those found in the Hindu caste system, which entailed almost complete social separation and a clear social hierarchy. Intermarriage was completely allowed within the Israelite people, with rare exception (such as the prohibition against a Cohen marrying a divorcee), and the Israelites were prohibited only from marrying outside their own people. This Israelite "caste system" continued along lines of [[Patrilineal descent]]. Converts to the Israelite people were considered full Israelites, and Mosaic law demanded that they be treated kindly and with special sensitivity. In contemporary Judaism, despite the absence of the Temple, certain ritual laws continue to apply to Cohanim, and both they and the Levites are honored with deferential formalities in some rituals.

==Castes in Rwanda and Burundi==
The caste system is also found in Africa, in [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]] and eastern [[Congo]]; here it is known as ''ubuhake''.  The [[Tutsi]], who comprise about 15% of the population of these areas, were the ruling, Cattle-owning caste - corresponding to the "Kshatriyas" in the Vedic system. Below them were the [[Hutu]], the farmers - corresponding with the Vedic ''Sudras''; about 80% of the population. Fewer than 3% of the population are [[Twa]] or [[Pygmies]], whose role is somewhat parallel to that of tribespeople outside the Vedic caste system, and who are hunters, potters and jesters.

During the [[Germany|German]] suzerainty over Rwanda and Burundi, the authorities reinforced the system by employing Tutsis in hegemonic roles. The [[Belgian]] colonialists who succeeded them after [[World War I]] continued this policy, instituting 'ethnic' identity cards. They also incorporates subsidiary populations, such as the [[Hima]] and the [[Baganwa]], into the Tutsi. 

After independence, caste tensions intensified. In 1972, Tutsis were responsible for a wholesale massacre of Hutus. In the 1990s, Hutus responded with a counter-massacre. What has been internationally labelled an 'ethnic war' is in fact a caste struggle, with many parallels to that in [[Bihar]] in India, where the Brahmins and the [[Yadavs]] (farmers) are in a permanent state of tension.
