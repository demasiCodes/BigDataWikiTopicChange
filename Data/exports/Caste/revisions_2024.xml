A '''caste''' is a fixed [[social group]] into which an individual is born within a particular system of [[social stratification]]: a '''caste system'''. Within such a system, individuals are expected to marry exclusively within the same caste ([[endogamy]]), follow lifestyles often linked to a particular occupation, hold a ritual status observed within a hierarchy, and interact with others based on cultural notions of [[social exclusion|exclusion]], with certain castes considered as either more pure or more polluted than others.&lt;ref name=caste-lead&gt;{{bulleted list|

The paradigmatic ethnographic example of caste is the division of India's [[Hinduism|Hindu]] society into rigid social groups. Its roots lie in South Asia's ancient history and it still exists;&lt;ref name=caste-lead/&gt;{{sfn|Béteille|2002|p=66}} however, the economic significance of the [[caste system in India]] has been declining as a result of urbanisation and affirmative action programs. A subject of much scholarship by sociologists and anthropologists, the Hindu caste system is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside Hinduism and India. In colonial [[Spanish Empire|Spanish America]], mixed-race ''[[casta]]s'' were a category within the Hispanic sector but the social order was otherwise fluid.

==Etymology==
The English word ''caste'' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑː|s|t|,_|k|æ|s|t}}) derives from the Spanish and Portuguese {{lang|es|[[casta]]}}, which, according to the [[John Minsheu]]'s Spanish dictionary (1569), means "race, lineage, tribe or breed".&lt;ref name=oed-caste&gt;{{Cite OED|caste|id=28546}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Spanish colonised the [[New World]], they used the word to mean a 'clan or lineage'. It was, however, the Portuguese who first employed {{lang|pt|casta}} in the primary modern sense of the English word 'caste' when they applied it to the thousands of endogamous, hereditary Indian social groups they encountered upon their arrival in India in 1498.&lt;ref name=oed-caste/&gt;&lt;ref name=pitt-rivers&gt;{{cite book |last=Pitt-Rivers |first=Julian |editor-first=T.

Modern India's caste system is based on the superimposition of an old four-fold theoretical classification called [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] on the social ethnic grouping called [[jāti]]. The [[Vedic period]] conceptualised a society as consisting of four types of [[Varna (Hinduism)|varnas]], or categories: [[Brahmin]], [[Kshatriya]], [[Vaishya]] and [[Shudra]], according to the nature of the work of its members. Varna was not an inherited category and the occupation determined the varna. However, a person's [[Jāti|Jati]] is determined at birth and makes them take up that Jati's occupation; members could and did change their occupation based on personal strengths as well as economic, social and political factors.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}} A 2016 study based on the [[DNA analysis]] of unrelated Indians determined that [[Endogamy|endogamous]] jatis originated during the [[Gupta Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=16 February 2016 |title=Genetic study suggests caste began to dictate marriage from Gupta reign |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/genetic-study-suggests-caste-began-to-dictate-marriage-from-gupta-reign/ |access-date=5 April 2023 |website=[[The Indian Express]] |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231024105448/https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/genetic-study-suggests-caste-began-to-dictate-marriage-from-gupta-reign/ |archive-date=24 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kalyan |first1=Ray |title=Caste originated during Gupta dynasty: Study |date=27 January 2016 |url=https://www.deccanherald.com/content/525390/caste-originated-during-gupta-dynasty.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240301144303/https://www.deccanherald.com/content/525390/caste-originated-during-gupta-dynasty.html |archive-date=1 March 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Phillip |last=Martin |title=Even with a Harvard pedigree, caste follows 'like a shadow' |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-03-05/even-harvard-pedigree-caste-follows-shadow |access-date=10 September 2021 |website=The World from PRX |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240729192245/https://theworld.org/stories/2019/02/27/surajs-shadow-wherever-he-goes-his-caste-follows-even-america |archive-date=29 July 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Politics of India}}
From 1901 onwards, for the purposes of the [[Census of India prior to independence|Decennial Census]], the [[British Raj|British colonial authorities]] arbitrarily and incorrectly forced all Jātis into the four ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' categories as described in ancient texts. [[Herbert Hope Risley]], the Census Commissioner, noted that "The principle suggested as a basis was that of classification by social precedence as recognized by native public opinion at the present day, and manifesting itself in the facts that particular castes are supposed to be the modern representatives of one or other of the castes of the theoretical Indian system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crooke |first=William |chapter=Social Types |editor-last=Risley |editor-first=Herbert Hope |title=The People of India |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Varna'', as mentioned in [[Historical Vedic religion|ancient Hindu]] texts, describes society as divided into four categories: [[Brahmin]]s (scholars and yajna priests), [[Kshatriya]]s (rulers and warriors), [[Vaishyas]] (farmers, merchants and artisans) and [[Shudras]] (workmen/service providers). The texts do not mention any hierarchy or a separate, untouchable category in ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' classifications. Scholars believe that the ''Varnas'' system was never truly operational in society and there is no evidence of it ever being a reality in Indian history. The practical division of the society had always been in terms of ''Jatis'' (birth groups), which are not based on any specific religious principle but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations to geographic areas. The ''Jātis'' have been endogamous social groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political, or economic status. Many of India's major empires and dynasties like the Mauryas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Kaushik |date=2012 |title=Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia: From Antiquity to the Present |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-107-01736-8}} {{Page needed|date=June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shalivahanas,&lt;ref&gt;Shalivahana was born in a potter's house, by grace of Adi-Sheshan.

The Kakatiyas also maintained marital relations with other Shudra families, such as the Kotas and the Natavadi chiefs. All these evidences indicate that the Kakatiyas were of Shudra origin.[Sastry, P. V. Parabhrama (1978). N. Ramesan, ed. The Kākatiyas of Warangal.

It is well established that by the 9th century, kings from all the four Varnas, including Brahmins and Vaishyas, had occupied the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India, contrary to the Varna theory.&lt;ref&gt;Notes of Yuan Chwang, Altekar, Anant Sadashiv (1934).

Poona: Oriental Book Agency. {{OCLC|3793499}}, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, as in Bengal, historically the kings and rulers had been called upon, when required, to mediate on the ranks of ''Jātis'', which might number in thousands all over the subcontinent and vary by region. In practice, the ''jātis'' may or may not fit into the ''Varna'' classes and many prominent ''Jatis'', for example the Jats and Yadavs, straddled two Varnas i.e. Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, and the ''Varna'' status of ''Jātis'' itself was subject to articulation over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.epw.in/journal/2011/33/special-articles/census-colonial-india-and-birth-caste.html |first=Padmanabh |last=Samarendra |title=Census in Colonial India and the Birth of Caste |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |date=5 June 2015 |pages=7–8 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240521102625/https://www.epw.in/journal/2011/33/special-articles/census-colonial-india-and-birth-caste.html |archive-date=21 May 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the [[Census of India prior to independence|1901 Census of India]] led by colonial administrator Herbert Hope Risley, all the ''jātis'' were grouped under the theoretical ''varnas'' categories.&lt;ref name=dirks&gt;{{cite book |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7191.html |first=Nicholas B. |last=Dirks |title=Castes of Mind: Colonialism and the Making of New India |year=2001 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-08895-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Lloyd Rudolph]], Risley believed that ''varna'', however ancient, could be applied to all the modern castes found in India, and "[he] meant to identify and place several hundred million Indians within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vnsnma5nW4C |title=The Modernity of Tradition: Political Development in India |first=Lloyd I. |last=Rudolph |author-link=Lloyd I.

Upon independence from Britain, the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] listed 1,108 Jatis across the country as [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes]] in 1950, for [[Affirmative action|positive discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/rule3a.htm |title=The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950 |publisher=Lawmin.nic.in |access-date=30 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328234104/http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/rule3a.htm |archive-date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This constitution would also ban discrimination of the basis of the caste, though its practice in India remained intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-28/struggle-to-challenge-indias-caste-system/101185772 |title='I would tell the other girls at school that I was Brahmin': The struggle to challenge India's caste system |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=27 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240713213206/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-28/struggle-to-challenge-indias-caste-system/101185772 |archive-date=13 July 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Untouchable communities are sometimes called ''[[Scheduled Castes]]'', ''[[Dalit]]'' or ''[[Harijan]]'' in contemporary literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scaling Caste Walls With Capitalism's Ladders in India |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Lydia |last=Polgreen |date=21 December 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/world/asia/indias-boom-creates-openings-for-untouchables.html?pagewanted=all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231024035014/https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/world/asia/indias-boom-creates-openings-for-untouchables.html?pagewanted=all |archive-date=24 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Dalits were 16.2% of India's population.&lt;ref name=censtat01&gt;{{cite web |title=Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes population: Census 2001 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Government of India]] |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/scst.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210213220715/https://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_Glance/scst.aspx |archive-date=13 February 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the 15 million bonded child workers are from the lowest castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/pon95/chil0016.html |title=Children pay high price for cheap labour |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627151730/https://www.unicef.org/pon95/chil0016.html |archive-date=27 June 2017 |website=[[UNICEF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Zama |last=Coursen-Neff |date=30 January 2003 |title=For 15 million in India, a childhood of slavery |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/opinion/30iht-edzama_ed3__0.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=22 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404134622/https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/opinion/IHT-meanwhile-for-15-million-in-india-a-childhood-of-slavery.html |archive-date=4 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent India has witnessed [[Caste-related violence in India|caste-related violence]].

The socio-economic limitations of the caste system are reduced due to [[Urbanization in India|urbanisation]] and [[Affirmative action in India|affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, the caste system still exists in [[endogamy]] and [[Family patrimony|patrimony]], and thrives in the politics of democracy, where caste provides ready made constituencies to politicians. The globalisation and economic opportunities from foreign businesses has influenced the growth of India's middle-class population. Some members of the Chhattisgarh Potter Caste Community (CPCC) are middle-class urban professionals and no longer potters unlike the remaining majority of traditional rural potter members. There is persistence of caste in Indian [[Caste politics|politics]]. Caste associations have evolved into caste-based political parties. Political parties and the state perceive caste as an important factor for mobilisation of people and policy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sen |first1=Ronojoy |title=The persistence of caste in Indian politics |journal=Pacific Affairs |date=2012 |volume=85 |issue=2 |pages=363–369 |doi=10.5509/2012852363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies by Bhatt and Beteille have shown changes in status, openness, mobility in the social aspects of Indian society. As a result of modern socio-economic changes in the country, India is experiencing significant changes in the dynamics and the economics of its social sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gandhi |first1=Rag S. |title=From Caste to Class in Indian Society |journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations |date=1980 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; While arranged marriages are still the most common practice in India, the internet has provided a network for younger Indians to take control of their relationships through the use of dating apps. This remains isolated to informal terms, as marriage is not often achieved through the use of these apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Gandhi |first1=Divya |title= Running in the family |magazine=[[The Hindu]] |date=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hypergamy]] is still a common practice in India and Hindu culture. Men are expected to marry within their caste, or one below, with no social repercussions. If a woman marries into a higher caste, then her children will take the status of their father. If she marries down, her family is reduced to the social status of their son in law. In this case, the women are bearers of the egalitarian principle of the marriage. There would be no benefit in marrying a higher caste if the terms of the marriage did not imply equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Kingsley |last=Davis |date=13 June 2013 |title=Intermarriage in Caste Societies |journal=[[AnthroSource]] |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=376–395 |doi=10.1525/aa.1941.43.3.02a00030 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, men are systematically shielded from the negative implications of the agreement.

Geographical factors also determine adherence to the caste system. Many Northern villages are more likely to participate in exogamous marriage, due to a lack of eligible suitors within the same caste. Women in [[North India]] have been found to be less likely to leave or divorce their husbands since they are of a relatively lower caste system, and have higher restrictions on their freedoms. On the other hand, Pahari women, of the northern mountains, have much more freedom to leave their husbands without stigma. This often leads to better husbandry as his actions are not protected by social expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berreman |first1=Gerald D. |title=Village Exogamy in Northernmost India |journal=[[Southwestern Journal of Anthropology]] |date=1962 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=55–58 |doi=10.1086/soutjanth.18.1.3629123 |jstor=3629123 |s2cid=131367161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiefly among the factors influencing the rise of exogamy is the rapid [[urbanisation in India]] experienced over the last century. It is well known that urban centers tend to be less reliant on agriculture and are more progressive as a whole. As India's cities boomed in population, the job market grew to keep pace. Prosperity and stability were now more easily attained by an individual, and the anxiety to marry quickly and effectively was reduced. Thus, younger, more progressive generations of urban Indians are less likely than ever to participate in the antiquated system of arranged endogamy.

India has also implemented a form of Affirmative Action, locally known as "reservation groups". Quota system jobs, as well as placements in publicly funded colleges, hold spots for the 8% of India's minority, and underprivileged groups. As a result, in states such as [[Tamil Nadu]] or those in the [[Northeast India|north-east]], where underprivileged populations predominate, over 80% of government jobs are set aside in quotas. In education, colleges lower the marks necessary for the Dalits to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=A. |last=R. |date=13 June 2013 |title=Indian Reservations |url=https://www.economist.com/banyan/2013/06/29/indian-reservations |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |access-date=4 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231024032557/https://www.economist.com/banyan/2013/06/29/indian-reservations |archive-date=24 October 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Caste system in Nepal}}

The Nepali caste system resembles in some respects the Indian ''jāti'' system, with numerous ''jāti'' divisions with a ''varna'' system superimposed. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] period. [[Jayasthiti Malla]] (1382–1395) categorised Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506–1575). The Hindu social code was later set up in the [[Gorkha Kingdom]] by [[Ram Shah]] (1603–1636).

McKim Marriott claims a social stratification that is hierarchical, closed, endogamous and hereditary is widely prevalent, particularly in western parts of Pakistan. Frederik Barth in his review of this system of social stratification in Pakistan suggested that these are castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Fredrick |last=Barth |date=December 1956 |title=Ecologic Relationships of Ethnic Groups in Swat, North Pakistan |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=1079–1089 |doi=10.1525/aa.1956.58.6.02a00080 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Zeyauddin |last=Ahmed |title=The New Wind: Changing Identities in South Asia |editor-first=Kenneth |editor-last=David |publisher=Aldine Publishing Company |year=1977 |isbn=978-90-279-7959-9 |pages=337–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=McKim |last=Marriott |title=Caste ranking and community structure in five regions of India and Pakistan |year=1960 |oclc=186146571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The caste system in Sri Lanka is a division of society into strata,&lt;ref name="John Rogers 51–77"&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Rogers |date=February 2004 |title=Caste as a social category and identity in colonial Lanka |journal=Indian Economic and Social History Review |volume=41 |pages=51–77 |doi=10.1177/001946460404100104 |s2cid=143883066 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced by the textbook ''jāti'' system found in India. Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the [[Kingdom of Kandy|Kandyan-period]] Kadayimpoth – Boundary books as well indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka's monarchy.

[[Bali]]nese caste structure has been described as being based either on three categories—the noble triwangsa (thrice born), the middle class of ''dwijāti'' (twice born), and the lower class of ''ekajāti'' (once born), much similar to the traditional Indian [[Varna (Hinduism)|BKVS social stratification]] — or on four castes&lt;ref name="boon"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Anthropological Romance of Bali 1597-1972: Dynamic Perspectives in Marriage and Caste, Politics and Religion |first=James |last=Boon |year=1977 |publisher=CUP Archive |isbn=978-0-521-21398-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Brahmin]]as – [[priest]]
*[[Kshatriya|Satrias]] – [[knight]]hood
*[[Vaishya|Wesias]] – [[commerce]]
*[[Shudra|Sudras]] – [[Involuntary servitude|servitude]]

The Brahmana caste was further subdivided by Dutch ethnographers into two: Siwa and Buda. The Siwa caste was subdivided into five: Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher-caste Brahmana men with lower-caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to ''castas'' in [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]] such as [[New Spain|Mexico]], and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.&lt;ref name="boon" /&gt;

====Philippines====
[[File:Naturales 3.png|thumb|upright|A [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] royal couple (''[[maginoo]]''), from the [[Boxer Codex]] ({{Circa|1590}})]]
In the Philippines, pre-colonial societies do not have a single social structure. The class structures can be roughly categorised into four types:&lt;ref name="Scott1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=William Henry |title=Class Structure in the Unhispanized Philippines |journal=Philippine Studies |date=1979 |volume=27 |issue=2, Special Issue in Memory of Frank Lynch |pages=137–159 |jstor=42632474}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Classless societies – egalitarian societies with no class structure. Examples include the [[Mangyan people|Mangyan]] and the [[Kalanguya people]]s.&lt;ref name="Scott1979" /&gt;
* Warrior societies – societies where a distinct warrior class exists, and whose membership depends on martial prowess. Examples include the [[Mandaya people|Mandaya]], [[Bagobo people|Bagobo]], [[Tagakaulo people|Tagakaulo]], and [[B'laan people]]s who had warriors called the ''bagani'' or ''magani''. Similarly, in the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera highlands]] of [[Luzon]], the [[Isneg people|Isneg]] and [[Kalinga people]]s refer to their warriors as ''mengal'' or ''maingal''. This society is typical for [[head-hunting]] ethnic groups or ethnic groups which had seasonal raids (''[[mangayaw]]'') into enemy territory.&lt;ref name="Scott1979" /&gt;
* Petty [[Plutocracy|plutocracies]] – societies which have a wealthy class based on property and the hosting of periodic prestige feasts. In some groups, it was an actual caste whose members had specialised leadership roles, married only within the same caste, and wore specialised clothing. These include the ''kadangyan'' of the [[Ifugao people|Ifugao]], [[Bontoc people|Bontoc]], and [[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]] peoples, as well as the ''baknang'' of the [[Ibaloi people]]. In others, though wealth may give one prestige and leadership qualifications, it was not a caste per se.&lt;ref name="Scott1979" /&gt; 
*Principalities – societies with an actual ruling class and caste systems determined by birthright. Most of these societies are either [[Greater India|Indianized]] or [[Islamized]] to a degree. They include the larger coastal ethnic groups like the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]], [[Visayan people|Visayan]], and [[Moro people|Moro]] societies. Most of them were usually divided into four to five caste systems with different names under different ethnic groups that roughly correspond to each other. The system was more or less [[feudalistic]], with the ''datu'' ultimately having control of all the lands of the community. The land is subdivided among the enfranchised classes, the ''sakop'' or ''sa-op'' ([[vassal]]s, lit. "those under the power of another"). The castes were hereditary, though they were not rigid. They were more accurately a reflection of the interpersonal political relationships, a person is always the follower of another. People can move up the caste system by marriage, by wealth, or by doing something extraordinary; and conversely they can be demoted, usually as criminal punishment or as a result of debt. Shamans are the exception, as they are either volunteers, chosen by the ranking shamans, or born into the role by innate propensity for it. They are enumerated below from the highest rank to the lowest:&lt;ref name="Scott1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arcilla"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arcilla |first=José S. |title=An Introduction to Philippine History |publisher=[[Ateneo de Manila University Press]] |year=1998 |page=14&amp;ndash;16 |isbn=978-971-550-261-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxEYobbU-D8C&amp;q=timawa&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scott2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=William Henry |title=Barangay: sixteenth-century Philippine culture and society |publisher=[[Ateneo de Manila University Press]] |isbn=978-971-550-135-4 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Royalty – ([[Visayan people|Visayan]]: ''[[kadatoan]]'') the ''[[datu]]'' and immediate descendants. They are often further categorised according to purity of lineage. The power of the ''datu'' is dependent on the willingness of their followers to render him respect and obedience. Most roles of the datu were judicial and military. In case of an unfit ''datu'', support may be withdrawn by his followers. ''Datu'' were almost always male, though in some ethnic groups like the [[Banwaon people]], the female shaman (''[[Philippine shamans|babaiyon]]'') co-rules as the female counterpart of the ''datu''. 
:* Nobility – (Visayan: ''[[tumao]]''; [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]: ''[[maginoo]]''; [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] ''ginu''; [[Tausug people|Tausug]]: ''bangsa mataas'') the ruling class, either inclusive of or exclusive of the royal family. Most are descendants of the royal line or gained their status through wealth or bravery in battle. They owned lands and subjects, from whom they collected taxes.
:* [[Philippine shamans|Shamans]] – (Visayan: ''babaylan''; Tagalog: ''katalonan'') the spirit mediums, usually female or feminised men. While they were not technically a caste, they commanded the same respect and status as nobility. 
:* Warriors – (Visayan: ''[[timawa]]''; Tagalog: ''[[maharlika]]'') the martial class. They could own land and subjects like the higher ranks, but were required to fight for the ''datu'' in times of war. In some Filipino ethnic groups, they were often tattooed extensively to record feats in battle and as protection against harm. They were sometimes further subdivided into different classes, depending on their relationship with the ''datu''. They traditionally went on seasonal raids on enemy settlements. 
:* Commoners and slaves – (Visayan, [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]]: ''[[ulipon]]''; Tagalog: ''[[alipin]]''; Tausug: ''kiapangdilihan''; [[Maranao people|Maranao]]: ''kakatamokan'') – the lowest class composed of the rest of the community who were not part of the enfranchised classes. They were further subdivided into the commoner class who had their own houses, the servants who lived in the houses of others, and the slaves who were usually captives from raids, criminals, or debtors. Most members of this class were equivalent to the European [[serf]] class, who paid taxes and can be conscripted to communal tasks, but were more or less free to do as they please.

* [[Han Chinese|Han]] people (in the northern areas of China)
* Southerners (people of the former Southern [[Song dynasty]])

There is significant controversy over the [[social classes of Tibet]], especially with regards to the [[serfdom in Tibet controversy]].

{{ill|Heidi Fjeld|no|vertical-align=sup}} has put forth the argument that pre-1950s Tibetan society was functionally a caste system, in contrast to previous scholars who defined the Tibetan social class system as similar to European [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[serfdom]], as well as non-scholarly western accounts which seek to romanticise a supposedly 'egalitarian' ancient Tibetan society.

In Japan's history, social strata based on inherited position rather than personal merit, were rigid and highly formalised in a system called ''mibunsei'' (身分制). At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles ([[kuge]]), together with the [[Shōgun]] and [[daimyō]].

Older scholars believed that there were {{nihongo3|[[Four divisions of society|four classes]]|士農工商|Shi-nō-kō-shō}} of "samurai, peasants (''hyakushō''), craftsmen, and merchants (''[[chōnin]]'')" under the daimyo, with 80% of peasants under the 5% samurai class, followed by craftsmen and merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beasley|1972|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, various studies have revealed since about 1995 that the classes of peasants, craftsmen, and merchants under the samurai are equal, and the old hierarchy chart has been removed from Japanese history textbooks. In other words, peasants, craftsmen, and merchants are not a social pecking order, but a social classification.&lt;ref name="tokyoshoseki"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tokyo-shoseki.co.jp/question/e/syakai.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231130175341/https://www.tokyo-shoseki.co.jp/question/e/syakai.html |script-title=ja:「士農工商」や「四民平等」の用語が使われていないことについて |language=ja |title='Shinōkōshō' ya ' sì mín píng děng ' No yōgo ga tsukawa rete inai koto ni tsuite |trans-title=Regarding the absence of the terms "Shi-no-Ko-Sho" and "Equality of the Four Classes" |website=[[Tokyo Shoseki]] |archive-date=30 November 2023 |access-date=7 March 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uki300823"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.city.uki.kumamoto.jp/2028316 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230830135959/https://www.city.uki.kumamoto.jp/2028316 |script-title=ja:第35回　教科書から『士農工商』が消えた ー後編ー　令和3年広報うき「ウキカラ」8月号 |language=ja |title=Dai 35-kai kyōkasho kara "shinōkōshō" ga kieta ̄ kōhen ̄-rei wa 3-nen kōhō uki 'ukikara' 8 tsuki-gō |trans-title=No. 35: The disappearance of the four classes of samurai, farmers, artisans and merchants from textbooks - Part 2 - August issue of the Reiwa 3rd year Uki Public Relations "Ukikara" |website=[[Uki, Kumamoto]] |archive-date=30 August 2023 |access-date=7 March 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shimonoseki"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.city.shimonoseki.lg.jp/uploaded/attachment/58936.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230606001503/https://www.city.shimonoseki.lg.jp/uploaded/attachment/58936.pdf |script-title=ja:人権意識のアップデート |language=ja |title=Jinken ishiki no appudēto |trans-title=Update on human rights awareness |website=[[Shimonoseki]] |archive-date=6 June 2023 |access-date=7 March 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage between certain classes was generally prohibited. In particular, marriage between [[daimyo]] and court nobles was forbidden by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] because it could lead to political maneuvering. For the same reason, marriages between daimyo and high-ranking [[hatamoto]] of the samurai class required the approval of the Tokugawa shogunate. It was also forbidden for a member of the samurai class to marry a peasant, craftsman, or merchant, but this was done through a loophole in which a person from a lower class was adopted into the samurai class and then married. Since there was an economic advantage for a poor samurai class person to marry a wealthy merchant or peasant class woman, they would adopt a merchant or peasant class woman into the samurai class as an adopted daughter and then marry her.&lt;ref name="asahi"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dot.asahi.com/articles/-/42642?page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240307171356/https://dot.asahi.com/articles/-/42642?page=2 |script-title=ja:結婚は主君の許可が必要だが、離婚するときはどうだった？江戸時代「武士」の一生行事 |language=ja |title=Kekkon wa shukun no kyoka ga hitsuyōdaga, rikon suru toki wa dōdatta?

[[Japan]] had its own untouchable caste, shunned and ostracised, historically referred to by the insulting term ''eta'', now called ''[[burakumin]]''.

====Korea====
{{Korean caste system}}
[[File:Korea-History-Goban Game in Seoul Korea 1904 (LOC).jpg|thumb|upright|A typical Yangban family scene from 1904. The Yoon family had an enduring presence in Korean politics from the 1800s until the 1970s.]]

The [[baekjeong]] ({{lang|ko|백정}}) were an "untouchable" outcaste of Korea. The meaning today is that of butcher. It originates in the [[Goryeo-Khitan Wars|Khitan invasion of Korea]] in the 11th century. The defeated [[Khitan people|Khitans]] who surrendered were settled in isolated communities throughout Goryeo to forestall rebellion. They were valued for their skills in hunting, herding, butchering, and making of leather, common skill sets among nomads. Over time, their ethnic origin was forgotten, and they formed the bottom layer of Korean society.

In 1392, with the foundation of the Confucian [[Joseon dynasty]], Korea systemised its own native class system. At the top were the two official classes, the [[Yangban]], which literally means "two classes". It was composed of scholars (''munban'') and warriors (''muban''). Scholars had a significant social advantage over the warriors. Below were the ''jung-in'' ({{lang|ko|중인-中人}}: literally "middle people"). This was a small class of specialised professions such as medicine, accounting, translators, regional bureaucrats, etc. Below that were the ''sangmin'' ({{lang|ko|상민-常民}}: literally 'commoner'), farmers working their own fields. Korea also had a [[serf]] population known as the ''nobi''. The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Junius P. |title=The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=978-0-87436-885-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalencycl01rodr/page/392 392] |url=https://archive.org/details/historicalencycl01rodr |url-access=registration |quote=10 percent of the total population on average, but it could rise up to one-third of the total. |access-date=14 February 2017 |language=en |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, the vast majority of government nobi were emancipated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kim |first1=Youngmin |last2=Pettid |first2=Michael J. |title=Women and Confucianism in Choson Korea: New Perspectives |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |isbn=978-1-4384-3777-4 |page=141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwgUa6WWFBMC&amp;pg=PA141 |access-date=14 February 2017 |language=en |date=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1858 the nobi population stood at about 1.5% of the total population of Korea.&lt;ref name="nobi"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Gwyn |title=Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-1-135-75917-9 |page=163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0iRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163 |access-date=14 February 2017 |language=en |date=23 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around 1886–87 and the rest of the nobi system was abolished with the [[Gabo Reform]] of 1894,&lt;ref name="nobi" /&gt; but traces remained until 1930.

The opening of Korea to foreign [[Christian mission]]ary activity in the late 19th century saw some improvement in the status of the ''baekjeong''. However, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and even so protests erupted when missionaries tried to integrate ''baekjeong'' into worship, with non-''baekjeong'' finding this attempt insensitive to traditional notions of hierarchical advantage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Around the same time, the ''baekjeong'' began to resist open social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=In Search of Human Rights: The Paekchŏng Movement in Colonial Korea |title=Colonial Modernity in Korea |first=Joong-Seop |last=Kim |editor1-first=Gi-Wook |editor1-last=Shin |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Robinson |year=1999 |page=326 |publisher=Harvard Univ Asia Center |isbn=978-0-674-00594-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on social and economic injustices affecting them, hoping to create an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] Korean society. Their efforts included attacking social discrimination by upper class, authorities, and "commoners", and the use of degrading language against children in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Korean Paekjŏng under Japanese rule: the quest for equality and human rights |first=Joong-Seop |last=Kim |year=2003 |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Gabo reform]] of 1896, the class system of Korea was officially abolished. Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]], the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the [[Korean Empire]], introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists' cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.&lt;ref name="proper"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hwang |first=Kyung Moon |date=2004 |journal=Modern Asian Studies |title=Citizenship, Social Equality and Government Reform: Changes in the Household Registration System in Korea, 1894–1910|volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=355–387 |doi=10.1017/S0026749X04001106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Koreans by then had surnames and even [[bongwan]], although still substantial number of [[cheonmin]], mostly consisted of [[serfs]] and slaves, and [[Untouchability|untouchables]] did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters' surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term ''inmin'' ("people") and later, ''kungmin'' ("citizen").&lt;ref name="proper" /&gt;

===== Yazidis =====
{{further|Yazidi social organization}}

There are three hereditary groups, often called castes, in [[Yazidism]]. Membership in the Yazidi society and a caste is conferred by birth. Pîrs and Sheikhs are the [[priestly caste]]s, which are represented by many sacred lineages ({{langx|ku-Latn|Ocax}}). Sheikhs are in charge of both religious and administrative functions and are divided into three endogamous houses, Şemsanî, Adanî and Qatanî who are in turn divided into lineages. The Pîrs are in charge of purely religious functions and traditionally consist of 40 lineages or clans, but approximately 90 appellations of Pîr lineages have been found, which may have been a result of new sub-lineages arising and number of clans increasing over time due to division as Yazidis settled in different places and countries. Division could occur in one family, if there were a few brothers in one clan, each of them could become the founder of their own Pîr sub-clan ({{Langx|ku-Latn|ber}}). Mirîds are the lay caste and are divided into [[Kurdish tribes|tribes]], who are each affiliated to a Pîr and a Sheikh priestly lineage assigned to the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Pirbari |first1=Dimitri |last2=Mossaki |first2=Nodar |last3=Yezdin |first3=Mirza Sileman |date=March 2020 |title=A Yezidi Manuscript:—Mišūr of P'īr Sīnī Bahrī/P'īr Sīnī Dārānī, Its Study and Critical Analysis |journal=Iranian Studies |volume=53 |issue=1–2 |pages=223–257 |doi=10.1080/00210862.2019.1669118 |s2cid=214483496 |issn=0021-0862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Omarkhali |first=Khanna |date=31 December 2008 |title=On the Structure of the Yezidi Clan and Tribal System and its Terminology among the Yezidis of the Caucasus |journal=[[Journal of Kurdish Studies]] |volume=6 |pages=104–119 |doi=10.2143/jks.6.0.2038092 |issn=1370-7205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Omarkhali |first=Khanna |title=The Yezidi religious textual tradition: from oral to written categories, transmission, scripturalisation and canonisation of the Yezidi oral religious texts |year=2017 |isbn=978-3-447-10856-0 |page=27 |publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag |oclc=1007841078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, such as the ''[[Nupe people|Nupe]]'' of Nigeria, the ''[[Beni Amer]]'' of East Africa, and the ''[[Tira people|Tira]]'' of Sudan, the exclusionary principle has been driven by evolving social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Caste and government in primitive society |first=S.

[[File:GriotFête.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Griot]], who have been described as an endogamous caste of West Africa who specialise in oral story telling and culture preservation. They have been also referred to as the bard caste.]]
Among the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] of [[Nigeria]] – especially [[Enugu State|Enugu]], [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], [[Abia State|Abia]], [[Ebonyi State|Ebonyi]], [[Edo State|Edo]] and [[Delta state|Delta]] states of the country – scholar [[Elijah Obinna]] finds that the [[Osu caste system]] has been and continues to be a major social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracised, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="Obinna1" /&gt;

The ''osu'' class systems of eastern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the "Osus" people as "owned by deities" and outcasts.

The [[Songhai people|Songhai]] economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africankingdoms.com|title=Kingdoms of Ancient African History |website=africankingdoms.com |access-date=22 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519102901/http://africankingdoms.com/ |archive-date=19 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Ivory Coast]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo |first=Dolores |last=Richter |journal=[[Africa (journal)|Africa]] |date= January 1980 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=37–54 |doi=10.2307/1158641 |jstor=1158641 |s2cid=146454269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

Tamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the [[Toucouleur people|Tukulor]], [[Songhai people|Songhay]], [[Dogon people|Dogon]], [[Senufo people|Senufo]], [[Minyanka language|Minianka]], Moors, [[Mandinka people|Manding]], [[Soninke people|Soninke]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Serer people|Serer]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]. Castes appeared among the [[Mandinka people|''Malinke'' people]] no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

As West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specialisations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.&lt;ref name="tamari1"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[The Journal of African History]] |year=1991 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=221–250 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718 |title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa |first=Tal |last=Tamari |s2cid=162509491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in [[Ethiopia]] in communities such as the [[Gurage people|Gurage]] and [[Konso people|Konso]]. He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=La Caste en Afrique? (Caste in Africa?) |first=D.

Among the [[Kingdom of Kafa|Kafa]], there were also traditionally groups labelled as castes. "Based on research done before the Derg regime, these studies generally presume the existence of a social hierarchy similar to the caste system. At the top of this hierarchy were the Kafa, followed by occupational groups including blacksmiths (Qemmo), weavers (Shammano), bards (Shatto), potters, and tanners (Manno). In this hierarchy, the Manjo were commonly referred to as hunters, given the lowest status equal only to slaves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sayuri |last=Yoshida |chapter=Why did the Manjo convert to Protestant?

The [[Borana Oromo]] of southern [[Ethiopia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] also have a class system, wherein the Wata, an acculturated hunter-gatherer group, represent the lowest class. Though the Wata today speak the [[Oromo language]], they have traditions of having previously spoken another language before adopting Oromo.&lt;ref name="Westermann"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Edwin William |last1=Smith |first2=Cyril Daryll |last2=Forde |first3=Diedrich |last3=Westermann |title=Africa |year=1981|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditionally nomadic [[Somali people]] are divided into clans, wherein the [[Rahanweyn]] agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the [[Madhiban]] were traditionally sometimes treated as outcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=I.

In colonial Spanish America (16th-early 19th centuries), there were legal divisions of society, the Republic of Spaniards ({{lang|es|República de Españoles}}), comprising European whites, African slaves ({{lang|es|negros}}), and mixed-race ''[[casta]]s'', the offspring of unions between whites, blacks, and indigenous. The Republic of Indians ({{lang|es|República de Indios}}) comprised all the various indigenous peoples, now classified in a single category, {{lang|es|indio}}, by their colonial rulers. In the social and racial hierarchy, European Spaniards were at the apex, with legal rights and privileges. Lower racial groups (Africans, mixed-race castas, and pure indigenous), had fewer legal rights and lower social status. Unlike the rigid caste system in India, in colonial Spanish America there was some fluidity within the social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cope |first=R.

[[Gerald Berreman|Gerald D. Berreman]] contrasted the differences between discrimination in the United States and India. In India, there are complex religious features which make up the system, whereas in the United States race and color are the basis for differentiation. The caste systems in India and the United States have higher groups which desire to retain their positions for themselves and thus perpetuate the two systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Berreman |first=Gerald |date=September 1960 |title=Caste in India and the United States |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=120–127 |jstor=2773155 |doi=10.1086/222839 |s2cid=143949609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of creating a homogenized society by social engineering in both India and the Southern US has created other institutions that have made class distinctions among different groups evident. Anthropologist [[James C. Scott]] elaborates on how "global [[capitalism]] is perhaps the most powerful force for homogenization, whereas the state may be the defender of local difference and variety in some instances".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Scott |first=James C. |author-link=James C.

== Racial casteism ==
Racial casteism is a term used to identify the relationship between caste, race, and colorism. In modern-day India, the caste system has expanded to include groups and identities from diasporic groups as well such as the Africana Siddis and Kaffirs. Siddis make up 40,000 of India's vast population and are perceived as untouchables under the caste framework.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}This categorization is paired with anti-black ideology in the country, that is often adapted by broader uses of the term caste in western countries, most notably the United States. Like the Siddis, Africana caste [[Sri Lanka Kaffirs]] make up a small minority of the population with scholars noting that the exact number is hard to determine due to exclusion and lack of recognition from the government. Siddis and Kaffirs are considered untouchables due to their darker skin color alongside other physical factors that distinguish the group as lower caste.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

The migration of Africana groups such as the Siddis and Kaffirs to South Asia is widely considered to be a result of the [[Indian Ocean slave trade|Indian Ocean Slave Trade]], initiated by Muslim Arabs. During the trade, enslaved Africans were often brought as court servants, herbalists, midwives, or as bonded labor. The limited awareness of these groups can be attributed to caste-ideology fueled from this trade.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

The racial understanding of caste has largely been debated by scholars, with some like [[B. R. Ambedkar|Dr. B. R. Ambedkar]] arguing that caste differences between higher caste Aryans and lower cast native-Indians being more due to religious factors. While the term remains contended, it is widely understood that this racial assessment is based on the way lower-caste people are treated. Africana diasporic groups who do not fit the caste system reflected by the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|scheduled tribe]] are thus considered inferior for their darker skin and grouped in with the untouchables. Since caste is inherited at birth and is inflexible to change throughout a lifetime, this can lead to a racial caste system where colorism largely influences the mobility one has in their lifetime. Terminology shifted away from race-conscious terms in South Asian antiquity, where Aryans had pre-conceived social hierarchies built off of race, to a caste framework during [[Buddhism]]'s rise in the [[3rd century BC|third century BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayawardene, Sureshi M.

Racial caste is embedded in the institutions that make up South Asia, particularly its governing bodies. When it comes to the electorate of India, voter preference is often based on race, caste, religion, alongside other attributing physical and political factors. This power imbalance alongside the rigid nature of caste can work against those of darker skin complexion to hold positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;Ahuja, Amit, Susan, Ashish (2016).

== Caste and higher education ==
The foundational divisions of caste have historically been seen as a determining factor in one's skills and career prospects. Today, many people perceive higher education as a means of achieving their own professional goals, but there are still methods based on caste assumptions used to keep lower caste out of universities. This leads to their exclusion from the potential to be part of higher-paying jobs that are perceived as more elite. This social expectation and prevention of access to education and opportunity have elongated the struggle for financial and social equity amongst people from scheduled tribes and castes.

Affirmative Action has been a global phenomenon to develop more spaces in politics, jobs, and education for people from historically disadvantaged backgrounds, which has led to the reservation system being applied to universities. Even with these regulations, caste nevertheless remains a largely determining factor in the university system in [[Reservation in India|India]]. The guarantee of admittance to a certain proportion of people from oppressed castes is not enough to deal with the implications of divisions in higher education. For example, the reservation percentage can vary by state but is generally around 15% for Scheduled Castes, but 2019-20 data shows most universities miss this mark. Across the board, there is an average of 14.7% of scheduled caste students, meaning many universities are at a far lower rate than legislated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Nagaraj |first=Anuradha |date=November 29, 2021 |title=Indian student's fight against caste discrimination raises Dalit hopes |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-education-caste-idUSKBN2IF0C9/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231125175224/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-education-caste-idUSKBN2IF0C9/ |archive-date=Nov 25, 2023 |website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reservation systems have backlash from upper caste groups, who claim that people are only admitted due to their caste status, as opposed to merit, in a similar argument playing out to affirmative action in the United States.

Reservation policies constitute a first step in providing access to admittance into higher education opportunities but do not overcome the overarching challenge of casteism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kahali |first1=Sonu |last2=Sagarika |first2=Sipra |date=October 2021 |title=Education and Caste Based Discrimination: A Sociological Understanding |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356161834 |journal=Social Issues &amp; Problems |volume=10 |issue=2 |via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caste-based discrimination and social stigma can still affect the experiences of students from marginalized communities in academic institutions. Universities are a crucial place of integration and moving to offer equitable opportunity beyond just attendance, but implementing protective policies to ensure students can be successful. Attendance at university has already been shown to impact how people view caste and has the potential to shape equity building beyond the current interpersonal and systemic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gundemeda |first=Nagaraju |date=2020 |title=Caste in Twenty First Century India: Sociological Reflections on University Students' Perceptions in South India |url=https://www.sav.sk/journals/uploads/05281234AAS_20-1_Gundemeda.pdf |journal=Asian and African Studies |volume=29 |issue=1 |publisher=SAV |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231125175212/https://www.sav.sk/journals/uploads/05281234AAS_20-1_Gundemeda.pdf |archive-date=Nov 25, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several forms of discrimination manifest in universities:

Social Discrimination: Students from marginalized castes face social discrimination, exclusion, and/or isolation on campuses. This affects their general educational experience and mental well-being. Numerous cases of harassment and bullying based on caste lines have been reported, with drastic consequences for the victims, but often none for the perpetrators. This promotes a hostile environment for students and hampers their ability to engage positively in the academic community.

"When I was enrolled for an undergraduate course, I was vocal about his Dalit identity and vouched for the rights of Dalits and marginalized sections. Most of my upper-caste mates were against reservation. I was always typecast, stereotyped and even labeled with derogatory nicknames," Nishat Kabir, who is studying film at Ambedkar University in New Delhi, told Anadolu Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Adil |first=Ahmad |date=January 24, 2022 |title=India 'struggling' with casteism in higher education |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/india-struggling-with-casteism-in-higher-education/2483623 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231125175225/https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/india-struggling-with-casteism-in-higher-education/2483623 |archive-date=Nov 25, 2023 |website=Anadolu Ajansı}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campus Facilities: Discrimination can also be observed in access to living facilities, food services, and other campus amenities. Students from marginalized castes may encounter difficulties in availing of these services without bias, and the living arrangements are often internally segregated.

Academic + Faculty Discrimination: Discrimination may extend to the academic sphere, with students facing biased treatment, unfair grading, or limited access to academic resources based on their caste background. Instances of discrimination can involve faculty members, who may hold biases that affect their interactions with students. This comes from the inherent hierarchical nature of caste having built centuries of prejudice against lower caste and indigenous students. This influences academic mentorship, guidance, and opportunities for students from marginalized backgrounds.

Eighty-four percent of the SC/ST students surveyed said examiners had asked them about their caste directly or indirectly during their evaluations. One student said: "Teachers are fine till they do not know your caste. The moment they come to know, their attitude towards you changes completely."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Sitlhou |first=Makepeace |date=November 21, 2017 |title=India's Universities Are Falling Terribly Short on Addressing Caste Discrimination |url=https://thewire.in/caste/india-universities-caste-discrimination |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231125175211/https://thewire.in/caste/india-universities-caste-discrimination |archive-date=Nov 25, 2023 |website=The Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the challenges experienced on top of the normal pressure of being a student, the discrimination that Dalits and people of OBCs face has led to increased rates of suicide, with numerous examples shown to be tied directly to campus harassment and lack of administrative support.

The clarity that comes from people sharing their experiences has led to significant pushback in the 21st century, where students have been centering fights for justice and equity, often based on movements that student activists of the past have used. Allahabad University has seen a spike in student protests and demonstrations against institutional discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kumar |first=Satendra |chapter=Transforming universities: Student activism, caste, and politics in North India |date=2022-05-31 |title=Universities as Transformative Social Spaces |chapter-url=https://academic.oup.com/book/43057/chapter/361484410 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |language=en |doi=10.1093/oso/9780192865571.003.0008 |isbn=978-0-19-286557-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students used tactics of information spreading from pamphlets and court cases, to public civil disobedience through marches and sit-ins to disrupt the flow of university life and lead to broader discussions. The student unrest was not unique to Allahabad University but was strong enough to last over 90 days.

==Caste in sociology and entomology==
The initial observational studies of the division of labour in ant colonies attempted to demonstrate that ants specialized in tasks that were best suited to their size when they emerged from the pupae stage into the adult stage. {{sfn|Gordon|2010|p=26}} A large proportion of the experimental work was done in species that showed strong variation in size.{{sfn|Gordon|2010|p=26}} As the size of an adult was fixed for life, workers of a specific size range came to be called a "caste", calling up the traditional caste system in India in which a human's standing in society was decided at birth.{{sfn|Gordon|2010|p=26}}

The notion of caste encouraged a link between scholarship in entomology and sociology because it served as an example of a division of labour in which the participants seemed to be uncompromisingly adapted to special functions and sometimes even unique environments.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=80}} To bolster the concept of caste, entomologists and sociologists referred to the complementary social or natural parallel and thereby appeared to generalize the concept and give it an appearance of familiarity.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|pp=80&amp;ndash;82}} In the late 19th- and early 20th centuries, the perceived similarities between the Indian caste system and [[Ant#polymorphism|caste polymorphism]] in insects were used to create a correspondence or parallelism for the purpose of explaining or clarifying racial stratification in human societies; the explanations came particularly to be employed in the United States.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=81}} Ideas from [[heredity]] and [[natural selection]] influenced some sociologists who believed that some groups were predetermined to belong to a lower social or occupational status.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=81}} Chiefly through the work of [[W. Lloyd Warner]] at the [[University of Chicago]], a group of sociologists sharing similar principles came to evolve around the creed of caste in the 1930s and 1940s.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=81}}

The ecologically oriented sociologist [[Robert E. Park]], although attributing more weight to environmental explanations than the biological nonetheless believed that there were obstacles to the assimilation of blacks into American society and that an "accommodation stage" in a biracially organized caste system was required before full assimilation.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=82}} He did disavow his position in 1937, suggesting that blacks were a minority and not a caste.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=82}} The Indian sociologist [[Radhakamal Mukerjee]] was influenced by Robert E. Park and adopted the concept of "caste" to describe race relations in the US.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|pp=81&amp;ndash;82}} According to anthropologist Diane Rodgers, Mukerjee "proceeded to suggest that a caste system should be correctly instituted in the (US) South to ease race relations."{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|pp=81&amp;ndash;82}} Mukerjee often employed both entomological and sociological data and clues to describe caste systems.{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=82}} He wrote "while the fundamental industries of man are dispersed throughout the insect world, the same kind of polymorphism appears again and again in different species of social insects which have reacted in the same manner as man, under the influence of the same environment, to ensure the supply and provision of subsistence."{{sfn|Mukerjee|1926|p=228}} Comparing the caste system in India to caste polymorphism in insects, he noted, "where we find the organization of social insects developed to perfection, there also has been seen among human associations a minute and even rigid specialization of functions, along with ant- and bee-like societal integrity and cohesiveness."{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=82}} He considered the "resemblances between insect associations and caste-ridden societies" to be striking enough to be "amusing".{{sfn|Rodgers|2008|p=82}}
