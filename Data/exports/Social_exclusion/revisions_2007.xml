'''Social exclusion''' relates to the [[alienation]] or [[disenfranchisement]] of certain people within a society. It is often connected to a person's [[social class]], [[educational]] status and [[living standards]] and how these might affect their access to various opportunities. It also applies to some degree to the [[disabled]], to minority men, women of all races, and to the [[elderly]]. Anyone who deviates in any perceived way from the norm of a population can become subject to coarse or subtle forms of social exclusion.

''“Social exclusion is about the inability of our society to keep all groups and individuals within reach of what we expect as a society...[or] to realise their full potential."''&lt;ref&gt;http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514268539/html/x2692.html Social exclusion in the UK&lt;/ref&gt;

To be "excluded from [[society]]" can take various relative senses, but social exclusion is usually defined as more than a simple [[economic]] phenomenon: it also has consequences on the social, [[symbolic]] field. 

''"Women of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Caribbean descent [in Britain] are doing well in schools but are still being penalised in the workplace...80-89% of 16-year-olds from those ethnic groups wanted to work full-time...but they were up to four times more likely to be jobless."''&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5320708.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Axel Honneth]] thus speaks of a "struggle for [[recognition]]", which he attempts to theorize through [[Hegel]]'s philosophy. In this sense, to be socially excluded is to be deprived from social recognition and social value. In the sphere of [[politics]], social recognition is obtained by full [[citizenship]]; in the economic sphere (in [[capitalism]]) it means being paid enough to be able to participate fully in the life of the community.

This concept can be gleaned from considering examples of the ''"social integration crisis: poverty, professional exclusion or marginalization, social and civic disenfranchisement, absence or weakening of support networks, frequent inter-cultural conflicts,"''&lt;ref&gt;http://urbact.eu/document-library/virtual-files/childhood/france/situation-of-single-parent-households-headed-by-wo.html Situation of single parent households headed by women&lt;/ref&gt; These relate not only to gender, race and disability, but also to crime:

''"Social exclusion is a major cause of crime and re-offending. Removing the right to vote increases social exclusion by signalling to serving prisoners that, at least for the duration of their sentence, they are dead to society.The additional punishment of disenfranchisement is not a deterrent. There is no evidence to suggest that criminals are deterred from offending behaviour by the threat of losing the right to vote.....(and) the notion of civic death for sentenced prisoners isolates still further those who are already on the margins of society and encourages them to be seen as alien to the communities to which they will return on release"''&lt;ref&gt;http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:D-HJsClzBxYJ:www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/documents/download.asp%3Flvid%3D436%26id%3D790+social+exclusion+disenfranchisement&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10&amp;gl=uk Barred from Voting: the Right to Vote for  Sentenced Prisoners&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of social exclusion is usually tied to the problem of [[equal opportunity]], as some people are more subject to such exclusion than others. [[Marginalization]] of certain groups is a problem even in many economically more developed countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) and the [[United States]] (US), where the majority of the population enjoys considerable economic and social opportunities..

Since social exclusion may lead to one being deprived of one's citizenship, some  authors ([[Philippe Van Parijs]], [[Jean-Marc Ferry]], [[Alain Caillé]], [[André Gorz]]) have theorized a [[guaranteed minimum income]] which would impede exclusion from citizenship. &lt;ref&gt; P. Hassenteufel, "Exclusion sociale et citoyenneté", "Citoyenneté et société", ''Cahiers Francais'', n° 281, mai-juin 1997, quoted by Bertrand Villalba of the Catholic University of Lille: {{Cite web | author=B. Villalba | title=Chapitre 2 - Les incertitudes de la citoyenneté | accessdate=May 3, 2006|publisher=Catholic University of [[Lille]], Law Department | url=http://droit.univ-lille2.fr/enseignants/villalba/cours_PSC/Psc_chap_citoyen.html}} {{fr icon}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Social inclusion==
'''Social inclusion''', its converse, is [[affirmative action]] to change the circumstances and habits that lead to (or have led to) social exclusion.

Social Inclusion is a strategy to combat social exclusion, but it is not making reparations or amends for past wrongs as in Affirmative Action.  It is the coordinated response to the very complex system of problems that are known as social exclusion.  The notion of social inclusion can vary according to the type of strategies organisations adopted.
