It is often connected to a person's [[social class]], [[educational]] status and [[living standards]] and how these might affect their access to various opportunities. It also applies to some degree to the [[disabled]], to racial minorities, women and to the [[elderly]]. Anyone who deviates in any perceived way from the norm of a population can become subject to coarse or subtle forms of social exclusion.

''“Social exclusion is about the inability of our society to keep all groups and individuals within reach of what we expect as a society...[or] to realise their full potential."''[http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514268539/html/x2692.html Social exclusion in the UK]

To be "excluded from [[society]]" can take various relative senses, but social exclusion is usually defined as more than a simple [[economic]] phenomenon: it also has consequences on the social, [[symbolic]] field. 

''"Women of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Caribbean descent [in Britain] are doing well in schools but are still being penalised in the workplace...80-89% of 16-year-olds from those ethnic groups wanted to work full-time...but they were up to four times more likely to be jobless."'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5320708.stm]

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Axel Honneth]] thus speaks of a "struggle for [[recognition]]", which he attempts to theorize through [[Hegel]]'s philosophy. In this sense, to be socially excluded is to be deprived from social recognition and social value. In the sphere of [[politics]], social recognition is obtained by full [[citizenship]]; in the economic sphere (in [[capitalism]]) it means being paid enough to be able to participate fully in the life of the community.

The problem of social exclusion is usually tied to the problem of [[equal opportunity]], as some people are more subject to such exclusion than others. [[Marginalization]] of certain groups is a problem even in many economically more developed countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) and the [[United States]] (US), where the majority of the population enjoys considerable economic and social opportunities..

Since social exclusion may lead to one being deprived of one's citizenship, some  authors ([[Philippe Van Parijs]], [[Jean-Marc Ferry]], [[Alain Caillé]], [[André Gorz]]) have theorized a [[guaranteed minimum income]] which would impede exclusion from citizenship. &lt;ref&gt; P.
