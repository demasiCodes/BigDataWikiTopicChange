'''Social exclusion''' or '''social marginalisation''' is the social disadvantage and relegation to the fringe of [[society]]. It is a term that has been used widely in [[Europe]] and was first used in [[France]] in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.gsdrc.org/document-library/social-exclusion-and-social-solidarity-three-paradigms/ | title=Social Exclusion and Social Solidarity: Three Paradigms | vauthors = Silver H | journal=[[International Labour Review]] | year=1994 | volume=133 | issue=5–6 | pages=531–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the EU context, the [[European Commission]] defines it as ''"a situation whereby a person is prevented (or excluded) from contributing to and benefiting from economic and social progress"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=social exclusion - European Commission |url=https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/european-migration-network-emn/emn-asylum-and-migration-glossary/glossary/social-exclusion_en |access-date=2024-04-10 |website=home-affairs.ec.europa.eu |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used across disciplines including [[education]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[Health care|healthcare]], [[politics]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peace R | date = 2001 | title = Social exclusion: A concept in need of definition? | journal = Social Policy Journal of New Zealand | pages = 17–36 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253921414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Donnell P, O'Donovan D, Elmusharaf K | title = Measuring social exclusion in healthcare settings: a scoping review | journal = International Journal for Equity in Health | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 15 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29391016 | pmc = 5796599 | doi = 10.1186/s12939-018-0732-1 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social exclusion is the process in which individuals are blocked from (or denied full access to) various [[rights]], opportunities and resources that are normally available to members of a different group, and which are fundamental to social integration and observance of human rights within that particular group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adler.edu/page/institutes/institute-on-social-exclusion/about|title=About|publisher=[[Adler University]]  |work= Institute on Public Safety and Social Justice |date=26 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[due process]]).

[[Social alienation|Alienation]] or [[disenfranchisement]] resulting from social exclusion can be connected to a person's [[social class]], race, skin color, religious affiliation, ethnic origin, [[caste]], [[education|educational status]], childhood relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salvationarmy.org.uk/seeds|title= The Seeds of Exclusion (2008)|website=The Salvation Army |access-date=22 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827041209/http://www1.salvationarmy.org.uk/seeds|archive-date=27 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard of Living|living standards]], political opinions, and/or appearance. Such exclusionary forms of [[discrimination]] may also apply to [[disability|disabled people]], [[minority group|minorities]], [[LGBTQ+]] people, [[Recreational drug use|drug users]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ar2003.emcdda.europa.eu/en/page073-en.html|title=Social exclusion and reintegration|access-date=2014-12-29|archive-date=2014-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029201038/http://ar2003.emcdda.europa.eu/en/page073-en.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; institutional care leavers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewhocarestrust.org.uk/pages/the-statistics.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115203303/http://www.thewhocarestrust.org.uk/pages/the-statistics.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-11-15|title=The statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ageism|the elderly]] and the [[Youth Exclusion|young]]. Anyone who appears to deviate in any way from [[Normative social influence|perceived norms]] of a population may thereby become subject to coarse or subtle forms of social exclusion.

The outcome of social exclusion is that affected individuals or communities are prevented from participating fully in the economic, social, and political life of the society in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Young IM | date = 2000 | chapter = Five faces of oppression. | veditors = Adams M | title = Readings for Diversity and Social Justice | pages = 35–49 | location = New York | publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may result in resistance in the form of demonstrations, protests or lobbying from the excluded people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh T | year = 2006 | title = A right to inclusion? Homelessness, human rights, and social exclusion | journal = Australian Journal of Human Rights | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 185–204 | doi=10.1080/1323238x.2006.11910818| s2cid = 150777458 | url = https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/handle/unal/81846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of social exclusion has led to the researcher's conclusion that in many European countries the impact of social disadvantages, that influence the well-being of all people, including with special needs, has an increasingly negative impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Marsela R |date=July 2014|title=Social inclusion and inclusive education|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277651118|journal=Academicus International Scientific Journal|volume=10|pages=181–191|doi=10.7336/academicus.2014.10.12|via=ResearchGate|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the characteristics listed in this article are present together in studies of social exclusion, due to exclusion's multidimensionality.

Another way of articulating the definition of social exclusion is as follows:{{quotation|Social exclusion is a multidimensional process of progressive social rupture, detaching groups and individuals from social relations and institutions and preventing them from full participation in the normal, normatively prescribed activities of the society in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shababinclusion.org/content/document/detail/558/1 Hilary Silver, ''Social Exclusion: Comparative Analysis of Europe and Middle East Youth,'' Middle East Youth Initiative Working Paper (September 2007), p.15]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an alternative conceptualization, social exclusion theoretically emerges at the individual or group level on four correlated dimensions: insufficient access to [[social rights]], material deprivation, limited [[social participation]] and a lack of normative integration. It is then regarded as the combined result of personal risk factors (age, gender, race); macro-societal changes (demographic, economic and labor market developments, technological innovation, the evolution of social norms); government legislation and social policy; and the actual behavior of businesses, administrative organisations and fellow citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Joel-Gijsbers G, Vrooman C |title=Explaining Social Exclusion; A Theoretical Model tested in The Netherlands|url=http://www.scp.nl/English/Publications/Publications_by_year/Publications_2007/Explaining_Social_Exclusion#!|year=2007|publisher=[[The Netherlands Institute for Social Research/SCP]]|access-date=2019-09-10|archive-date=2019-05-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525085023/https://www.scp.nl/english/Publications/Publications_by_year/Publications_2007/Explaining_Social_Exclusion#!|url-status=dead}} {{ISBN|978 90 377 0325 2}};  {{cite journal | vauthors = Vrooman JC, Hoff SJ |date=June 2013 |title=The Disadvantaged Among the Dutch: A Survey Approach to the Multidimensional Measurement of Social Exclusion |journal=Social Indicators Research|volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=1261–1287 |issn= 0303-8300 |doi= 10.1007/s11205-012-0138-1|s2cid=144759218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual exclusion==
{{quotation|"The marginal man...is one whom fate has condemned to live in two societies and in two, not merely different but antagonistic cultures....his mind is the crucible in which two different and refractory cultures may be said to melt and, either wholly or in part, fuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Park RE | author-link1 = Robert E. Park | chapter = Cultural Conflict and the Marginal Man | veditors = Stonequist EV | title = The Marginal Man | location = New York | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons | date = 1937 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social exclusion at the individual level results in an individual's exclusion from meaningful participation in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/1323238x.2006.11910818|title = A right to inclusion? Homelessness, human rights and social exclusion| journal=Australian Journal of Human Rights| volume=12| pages=185–204|date = December 2006| vauthors = Walsh T |s2cid = 150777458|url = https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:82248/HCA09UQ82248.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the exclusion of [[single mother]]s from the [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] system prior to welfare reforms of the 1900s. The modern welfare system is based on the concept of entitlement to the basic means of being a productive member of [[society]] both as an organic function of society and as compensation for the socially useful labor provided. A single mother's contribution to society is not based on [[informal sector|formal employment]], but on the notion that provision of welfare for children is a necessary social expense. In some career contexts, caring work is devalued and [[motherhood]] is seen as a barrier to employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lessa I | title=Discursive struggles within social welfare: Restaging teen motherhood | journal= [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume=36 | issue = 2 | pages=283–298 | doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch256 | date = February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Single mothers were previously marginalized in spite of their significant role in the socializing of [[children]] due to views that an individual can only contribute meaningfully to society through "gainful" employment as well as a cultural bias against unwed mothers. When the father's sole task was seen as the breadwinner, his marginalization was primarily a function of class condition. Solo fatherhood brings additional trials due to society being less accepting of males 'getting away with' not working and the general invisibility/lack of acknowledgment of single fathers in society. Acknowledgment of the needs participatory fathers may have can be found by examining the changes from the original clinical report on the father's role published by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] in May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coleman WL, Garfield C | title = Fathers and pediatricians: enhancing men's roles in the care and development of their children | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 113 | issue = 5 | pages = 1406–1411 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15121965 | doi = 10.1542/peds.113.5.1406 | doi-access =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight week paternity leave is a good example of one social change. Child health care providers have an opportunity to have a greater influence on the child and family structure by supporting fathers and enhancing a father's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yogman M, Garfield CF | title = Fathers' Roles in the Care and Development of Their Children: The Role of Pediatricians | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 138 | issue = 1 | pages = e20161128 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27296867 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2016-1128 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, many women face social exclusion. Moosa-Mitha discusses the Western [[feminist movement]] as a direct reaction to the marginalization of white women in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Moosa-Mitha M | date = 2005 | chapter = Situating anti-oppressive theories within critical and difference-centred perspectives. | veditors = Brown L, Strega S | title = Research as Resistance | pages = 37–72 | location = Toronto | publisher = Canadian Scholars' Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were excluded from the labor force and their work in the home was not valued. Feminists argued that men and women should equally participate in the labor force, in the public and private sector, and in the home. They also focused on labor laws to increase access to employment as well as to recognize [[child-rearing]] as a valuable form of labor. In some places today, women are still [[Glass ceiling|marginalized]] from [[Executive (management)|executive]] positions and continue to earn less than men in [[Senior management|upper management]] positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/equal-pay | work=[[whitehouse.gov]] | title=Did You Know That Women Are Still Paid Less Than Men? | via=[[NARA|National Archives]] | access-date=February 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of individual marginalization is the exclusion of individuals with [[disabilities]] from the [[Labour (economics)|labor]] force. Grandz discusses an employer's viewpoint about hiring individuals living with disabilities as jeopardizing [[productivity]], increasing the rate of [[absenteeism]], and creating more accidents in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Leslie (2003)"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Leslie DR, Leslie K, Murphy M | date = 2003 | chapter = Inclusion by design: The challenge for social work in workplace accommodation for people with disabilities. | veditors = Shera W | title = Emerging perspectives on anti-oppression practice | pages = 157–169 | location = Toronto | publisher = Canadian Scholar's Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor also discusses employer concern about the excessively high cost of accommodating people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Leslie (2003)" /&gt; The marginalization of individuals with disabilities is prevalent today, despite the legislation intended to prevent it in most western countries, and the [[academic]] achievements, skills and training of many disabled people.&lt;ref name="Leslie (2003)" /&gt;

There are also exclusions of [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]] because of their [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], and/or [[sexual characteristics]]. The [[Yogyakarta Principles]] require that the states and communities abolish any [[stereotype]]s about LGBT people as well as stereotyped [[gender role]]s.

{{quotation|"Isolation is common to almost every vocational, religious or cultural group of a large city. Each develops its own sentiments, attitudes, codes, even its own words, which are at best only partially intelligible to others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Thrasher F | author1-link = Frederic Thrasher | title = The Gang: A Study of 1,313 Gangs in Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
==Community exclusion==
Many communities experience social exclusion, such as racial (e.g. [[Black people|black]]), caste (e.g. [[Untouchable (social system)|untouchables]] or [[dalits]] in some regions in India), and economic (e.g. [[Romani people|Romani]]) communities.

One example is the [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] community in Australia. The marginalization of Aboriginal communities is a product of [[colonization]]. As a result of [[colonialism]], Aboriginal communities lost their land, were forced into destitute areas, lost their sources of livelihood, were excluded from the labor market and were subjected to widespread unpunished [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|massacres]]. Additionally, Aboriginal communities lost their culture and values through [[forced assimilation]] and lost their rights in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Baskin C | date = 2003 | chapter = Structural social work as seen from an Aboriginal Perspective. | veditors = Shera W | title = Emerging perspectives on anti-oppressive practice | pages = 65–78 | location = Toronto | publisher = Canadian Scholar's Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, various Aboriginal communities continue to be marginalized from society due to the development of practices, policies and programs that, according to J. Yee, "met the needs of white people and not the needs of the marginalized groups themselves".&lt;ref name=" Yee (2005)"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Yee J | date = 2005 | chapter = Critical anti-racism praxis: The concept of whiteness implicated. | veditors = Hick S, Fook J, Pozzuto R | title = Social work, a critical turn | pages = 87–104 | location = Toronto | publisher = Thompson }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee also connects marginalization to [[Minority group|minority]] communities, when describing the concept of [[Whiteness studies|whiteness]] as maintaining and enforcing dominant norms and discourse.&lt;ref name="Yee (2005)" /&gt; [[Poverty|Poor people]] living in [[sink estate|run-down council estates]] and areas with high crime can be locked into [[social deprivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radical.org.uk/barefoot/socex.htm|title=Social Exclusion: A Social Worker's View| vauthors = Searing H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributors==
Social exclusion has many contributors. Major contributors include race, income, employment status, social class, geographic location; personal habits, appearance, or interests (i.e., a favorite hobby, sports team, or music genre); education, religion, and political affiliation.

===Global and structural===
[[Globalization]] (global capitalism), immigration, social welfare, and policy are broader social structures that have the potential to contribute negatively to one's access to resources and services, resulting in the social exclusion of individuals and groups. Similarly, increasing use of information technology and the company [[outsourcing]] have contributed to [[job insecurity]] and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. Flobalization sets forth a decrease in the role of the state with an increase in support from various "corporate sectors resulting in gross inequalities, injustices and marginalization of various vulnerable groups" (p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alphonse M, George P, Moffat K | title = Redefining social work standards in the context of globalization: Lessons from India. | journal = International Social Work | date = March 2008 | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–158 | doi = 10.1177/0020872807085855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies are outsourcing, jobs are lost, the [[cost of living]] continues to rise, and the land is being [[expropriate]]d by large companies. Material goods are made in large abundances and sold at cheaper costs, while in India for example, the [[poverty line]] is lowered in order to mask the number of individuals who are actually living in poverty as a result of globalization. Globalization and structural forces aggravate poverty and continue to push individuals to the margins of society, while governments and large corporations do not address the issues (George, P, SK8101, lecture, October 9, 2007).

Certain language and the meaning attached to language can cause universalizing discourses that are influenced by the Western world, which is what Sewpaul (2006) describes as the "potential to dilute or even annihilate local cultures and traditions and to deny context-specific realities" (p.&amp;nbsp;421). What Sewpaul (2006) is implying is that the effect of dominant global discourses can cause individual and cultural displacement, as well as sex safety are jeopardized (p.&amp;nbsp;422). Insecurity and fear of an unknown future and instability can result in displacement, exclusion, and forced [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into the dominant group. For many, it further pushes them to the margins of society or enlists new members to the outskirts because of global-capitalism and dominant discourses (Sewpaul, 2006).

With the prevailing notion of globalization, we now see the rise of [[immigration]] as the world gets smaller and smaller with millions of individuals relocating each year. This is not without hardship and struggle of what a newcomer thought was going to be a new life with new opportunities. Immigration has had a strong link to the access of welfare support programs.&lt;ref name = "Ferguson_2005"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ferguson I, Lavalette M, Whitmore E | date = 2005 | title = Globalization, Global Justice and Social Work. | location = London and New York | publisher = Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Newcomers are constantly bombarded with the inability to access a country's resources because they are seen as "undeserving foreigners" (p.&amp;nbsp;132). With this comes a denial of access to [[public housing]], [[health care]] benefits, [[employment]] support services, and [[social security]] benefits.&lt;ref name = "Ferguson_2005" /&gt; Newcomers are seen as undeserving, or that they must prove their [[Entitlement (psychology)|entitlement]] in order to gain access to basic support necessities. It is clear that individuals are [[Exploitation of labor|exploited]] and marginalized within the country they have emigrated.&lt;ref name = "Ferguson_2005" /&gt;

[[Welfare state]]s and social policies can also exclude individuals from basic necessities and support programs. Welfare payments were proposed to assist individuals in accessing a small amount of [[material wealth]] (Young, 2000). Young (2000) further discusses how "the provision of the welfare itself produces new injustice by depriving those dependent on it of rights and freedoms that others have...marginalization is unjust because it blocks the opportunity to exercise capacities in socially defined and recognized way" (p.&amp;nbsp;41). There is the notion that by providing a minimal amount of welfare support, an individual will be free from marginalization. In fact, welfare support programs further lead to injustices by restricting certain behaviour, as well the individual is mandated to other agencies. The individual is forced into a new system of rules while facing [[social stigma]] and [[stereotypes]] from the dominant group in society, further marginalizing and excluding individuals (Young, 2000). Thus, social policy and welfare provisions reflect the dominant notions in society by constructing and reinforcing categories of people and their needs. It ignores the unique-subjective human essence, further continuing the cycle of dominance.&lt;ref name = "Wilson_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson A, Beresford P |year=2000 |title=Anti-oppressive practice': Emancipation or appropriation? |journal=British Journal of Social Work |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=553–573 |doi=10.1093/bjsw/30.5.553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unemployment===
{{see also|Blacklisting|Involuntary unemployment}}
Whilst recognising the multi-dimensionality of exclusion, policy work undertaken in the [[European Union]] focused{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} on [[unemployment]] as a key cause of, or at least correlating with, social exclusion. This is because, in modern societies, paid work is not only the principal source of income with which to buy services but is also the fount of individuals' identity and feeling of self-worth. Most people's social networks and a sense of embeddedness in society also revolve around their work. Many of the indicators of extreme social exclusion, such as poverty and homelessness, depend on monetary income which is normally derived from work. Social exclusion can be a possible result of long-term unemployment, especially in countries with weak welfare safety nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Furlong A | title = Youth Studies: An Introduction | publisher = Routledge | date = 2013 | page =  31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much policy to reduce exclusion thus focuses on the labour market:
* On the one hand, to make individuals at risk of exclusion more attractive to employers, i.e. more "employable".
* On the other hand, to encourage (and/or oblige) employers to be more inclusive in their employment policies.

The EU's [[EQUAL Community Initiative]] investigated ways to increase the inclusiveness of the labor market. Work on social exclusion more broadly is carried out through the [[Open Method of Coordination]] (OMC) among the Member State governments. The United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal 10]] is also an example of global initiatives aimed at promoting social inclusion for all by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Goal 10 targets|url=https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-10-reduced-inequalities/targets.html|access-date=2020-09-23|website=UNDP|language=en|archive-date=2020-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127140337/https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-10-reduced-inequalities/targets.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{see also|Shunning#in religion|Apostasy|Exclusivism#Religious exclusivism}}
Some religious traditions recommend [[excommunication]] of individuals said to deviate from religious teaching, and in some instances [[shunning]] by family members. Some religious organizations permit the censure of critics.

Across societies, individuals and communities can be socially excluded on the basis of their religious beliefs. Social hostility against religious minorities and [[communal violence]] occur in areas where governments do not have policies restricting the religious practise of minorities. A study by the [[Pew Research Center]] on international [[religious freedom]] found that&lt;ref name="prc-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Executive summary)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=491|access-date=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|access-date=12 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223318/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.&lt;ref name="pew2013"/&gt; The five highest social hostility scores were for [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Iraq]], and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf|title=Table: Social Hostilities Index by country|year=2012|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121005033805/http%3A//stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide%2DSHI.pdf|archive-date=2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but harassment of Jews increased.&lt;ref name="pew2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/02/26/religious-hostilities/|title=Latest Trends in Religious Restrictions and Hostilities|work=Pew Forum|date=26 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===
The problem of social exclusion is usually tied to that of [[equal opportunity]], as some people are more subject to such exclusion than others. [[Marginalisation]] of certain groups is a problem in many economically more developed countries where the majority of the population enjoys considerable economic and social opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Christiano T | date = 1996 | title = The Rule of the Many: Fundamental Issues in Democratic Theory | location = Boulder | publisher = Westview Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social inclusion==
{{See also|Inclusivism}}
Social inclusion is the converse of social exclusion. As the [[World Bank]] states, social inclusion is the process of improving the ability, opportunity, and worthiness of people, disadvantaged on the basis of their identity, to take part in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Inclusion Matters: The Foundation for Shared Prosperity|year=2013|publisher=World Bank|location=Washington, DC|doi=10.1596/978-1-4648-0010-8 |hdl=10986/16195 |isbn=978-1-4648-0010-8|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/16195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on ''The Changing Nature of Work''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf |title=World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007041636/http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf |archive-date=2018-10-07 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that enhanced social protection and better investments in [[human capital]] improve equality of opportunity and social inclusion. Social inclusion can be measured individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Coombs |first=Tim |last2=Nicholas |first2=Angela |last3=Pirkis |first3=Jane |date=2013 |title=A review of social inclusion measures |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0004867413491161 |journal=Australian &amp; New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |language=en |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=906–919 |doi=10.1177/0004867413491161 |issn=0004-8674|hdl=11343/58506 |hdl-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One successful attempt to measure social inclusion was the development of the Social and Community Opportunities Profile (SCOPE). The framework of SCOPE focuses on the perceived opportunities that a person can access to exercise his or her rights, the objective measures of opportunities, and the person's subjective perception of satisfaction toward the opportunity in various life domains. The SCOPE (short version) developed in the U.K. was tested and demonstrated to have good construct validity. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Huxley |first=P. |last2=Evans |first2=S. |last3=Madge |first3=S. |last4=Webber |first4=M. |last5=Burchardt |first5=T. |last6=McDaid |first6=D. |last7=Knapp |first7=M. |date=2012 |title=Development of a social inclusion index to capture subjective and objective life domains (Phase II): psychometric development study |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22260923/ |journal=Health Technology Assessment |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=iii–vii, ix–xii, -1-241 |doi=10.3310/hta16010 |issn=2046-4924 |pmid=22260923|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using concept mapping methodology, the concept of social inclusion observed many similarities among UK and HK participants in how they viewed social inclusion as an important element in building harmony in society. However, Hong Kong participants rarely approached the concept of social inclusion from a civic right point of view.  Instead, Hong Kong participants put more emphasis on civic responsibility point of view. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chan |first=Kara |last2=Evans |first2=Sherrill |last3=Ng |first3=Yu-Leung |last4=Chiu |first4=Marcus Yu-Lung |last5=Huxley |first5=Peter J. |date=2014 |title=A Concept Mapping Study on Social Inclusion in Hong Kong |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24721072 |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=121–137 |issn=0303-8300}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese version of the SCOPE was administered to a sample of persons with mental health conditions in Hong Kong.

Another study examined the understanding of the concept of social inclusion among Singaporean citizens through concept mapping. Results found that there was much similarities with the results found among UK and Hong Kong participants. One striking difference was that Singaporean participants expected the government to take the lead in driving social inclusion. Singaporean participants' perception of social inclusion was highly nation-centric, showing lack of concern to foreign workers in Singapore. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chiu |first=Marcus Y.

The Polish sample were generally satisfied with their level of social inclusion, in particular for those who are well situated economically. This was the first empirical study in Poland that measured social inclusion. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Balwicki |first=Łukasz |last2=Chan |first2=Kara |last3=Huxley |first3=Peter J. |last4=Chiu |first4=Marcus Yu-Lung |date=2018-06-01 |title=Applying SCOPE to Measure Social Inclusion Among People with Mental Illness in Poland |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40737-018-0113-5 |journal=Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Mental Health |language=en |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=89–100 |doi=10.1007/s40737-018-0113-5 |issn=2198-963X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study in Poland also examined the impact of the use of communication technology on perceived social inclusion and health. The Polish sample were identified as three different clusters based on their internet usage activities and the internet use motivations. These three clusters were labelled as leisure-seeking omnivores, gamers, and passive selective users. The three clusters had no significant difference in social inclusion or satisfaction with opportunities. Gamers had better physical and mental health than the other two clusters. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ng |first=Yu-Leung |last2=Chan |first2=Kara |last3=Balwicki |first3=Łukasz |last4=Huxley |first4=Peter |last5=Chiu |first5=Marcus Yu-Lung |date=2019-03-28 |title=The Digital Divide, Social Inclusion, and Health Among Persons With Mental Illness in Poland |url=https://ojs3.ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/10584 |journal=International Journal of Communication |language=en |volume=13 |pages=21–21 |issn=1932-8036}}&lt;/ref&gt; A SCOPE-B was developed and applied in Brazil by surveying among a sample of persons with mental health conditions.

Pulling the samples from the UK general population, UK immigrants, new arrivals in Hong Kong from Mainland China, and mental health services users in the UK, Hong Kong, Poland, and Brazil, a framework inspired by Maslow's hierarchy of needs was developed to predict social inclusion among the well and unwell samples. Among the well samples (i.e. the general population, the UK immigrants, and new arrivals in Hong Kong from Mainland China), only variables related to self-actualization was useful in predicting social inclusion. However, for the unwell samples (i.e. mental health services users in the UK, Hong Kong, Poland, and Brazil), variables related to the basic needs and the safety needs were significant predictors of social inclusion. Once these needs are met, their experience of social inclusion improved significantly. The findings send out a strong message for policy makers that they should first support the disadvantaged groups with their basic needs in order to improve their experience of social inclusion &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chan |first=Kara |title=Social inclusion: Theoretical development and cross-cultural measurements |last2=Huxley, Peter J. |publisher=City University of Hong Kong Press |year=2019 |isbn=978-962-937-642-0 |location=Hong Kong |pages=219-235 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social Inclusion ministers have been appointed, and special units established, in a number of jurisdictions around the world. The first [[Minister for Social Inclusion (South Australia)|Minister for Social Inclusion]] was Premier of South Australia [[Mike Rann]], who took the portfolio in 2004. Based on the UK's [[Social Exclusion Unit]], established by Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in 1997, Rann established the Social Inclusion Initiative in 2002. It was headed by Monsignor [[David Cappo]] and was serviced by a unit within the department of Premier and Cabinet. Cappo sat on the executive committee of the [[South Australian Cabinet]] and was later appointed Social Inclusion Commissioner with wide powers to address social disadvantage. Cappo was allowed to roam across agencies given that most social disadvantage has multiple causes necessitating a "joined up" rather than a single agency response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = ABC News | date = 28 April 2006 | title = Cappo appointed Social Inclusion Commissioner | url = https://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-04-28/cappo-appointed-social-inclusion-commissioner/1740772}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Initiative drove a big investment by the South Australian Government in strategies to combat [[homelessness]], including establishing Common Ground, building high quality inner city apartments for "rough sleeping" homeless people, the Street to Home initiative&lt;ref&gt;Street to Home, sacommunity.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the ICAN flexible learning program designed to improve school retention rates. It also included major funding to revamp mental health services following Cappo's "Stepping Up" report, which focused on the need for community and intermediate levels of care&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mifa.org.au|title=Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an overhaul of disability services.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News 20 Oct 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] appointed [[Julia Gillard]] as the nation's first [[Social Inclusion Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Julia Gillard: before office {{!}} naa.gov.au|url=https://www.naa.gov.au/explore-collection/australias-prime-ministers/julia-gillard/before-office|access-date=2020-09-23|website=www.naa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], the concept and term "social inclusion" went through a number of changes over time and eventually became incorporated in community-based activities under the names ''hōsetsu'' (包摂) and ''hōkatsu'' (包括), such as in the "Community General Support Centres" (''chiiki hōkatsu shien sentā'' 地域包括支援センター) and "Community-based Integrated Care System" (''chiiki hōkatsu kea shisutemu''　地域包括ケアシステム).&lt;ref name="Dahl 2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dahl N |date=March 2018 |title=Social inclusion of senior citizens in Japan: an investigation into the 'Community-based Integrated Care System' |journal=Contemporary Japan |volume=30 |issue=1|pages=43–59 |doi=10.1080/18692729.2018.1424069 |s2cid=158466875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One may explore its implications for social work practice. Mullaly (2007) describes how "the personal is political" and the need for recognizing that social problems are indeed connected with larger structures in society, causing various forms of oppression amongst individuals resulting in marginalization.&lt;ref name="Mullaly_2007"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Structural Social Work| vauthors = Mullaly B |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0195419061|pages=252–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important for the social worker to recognize the intersecting nature of oppression. A non-judgmental and unbiased attitude is necessary on the part of the social worker. The worker may begin to understand [[oppression]] and marginalization as a systemic problem, not the fault of the individual.&lt;ref name="Mullaly_2007" /&gt;

Working under an anti-oppression perspective would then allow the social worker to understand the lived, subjective experiences of the individual, as well as their cultural, historical and social background. The worker should recognize the individual as political in the process of becoming a valuable member of society and the structural factors that contribute to oppression and marginalization (Mullaly, 2007).&lt;ref name="Mullaly_2007" /&gt; Social workers must take a firm stance on naming and labeling global forces that impact individuals and communities who are then left with no support, leading to marginalization or further marginalization from the society they once knew (George, P, SK8101, lecture, October 9, 2007).

The social worker should be constantly [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]], work to raise the consciousness, [[Empowerment|empower]], and understand the lived subjective realities of individuals living in a fast-paced world, where fear and insecurity constantly subjugate the individual from the collective whole, perpetuating the dominant forces, while silencing the oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Sakamoto I, Pitner RO |date=June 2005|title=Use of Critical Consciousness in Anti-Oppressive Social Work Practice: Disentangling Power Dynamics at Personal and Structural Levels|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/35/4/435/1716745|journal=The British Journal of Social Work|volume= 35| issue = 4|pages=435–452|doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals and groups who are not professional social workers build relationships with marginalized persons by providing [[relational care]] and support, for example, through [[homeless ministry]]. These relationships validate the individuals who are marginalized and provide them a meaningful contact with the mainstream.

==In law==
There are countries, [[Italy]] for example, that have a legal concept of ''social exclusion''. In Italy, "''esclusione sociale''" is defined as [[poverty]] combined with [[social alienation]], by the [[statute]] n. 328 (11-8-2000), that instituted a state investigation commission named "''Commissione di indagine sull'Esclusione Sociale''" (CIES) to make an annual report to the government on legally expected issues of social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoro.gov.it/Lavoro/CIES/|title=''Commissione di Indagine sull'Esclusione Sociale'', accessed February 07, 2013|website=lavoro.gov.it|access-date=22 October 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117133555/http://www.lavoro.gov.it/Lavoro/CIES/|archive-date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], a document on [[international human rights instruments]] affirms that "[[extreme poverty]] and social exclusion constitute a violation of [[human dignity]] and that urgent steps are necessary to achieve better knowledge of extreme poverty and its causes, including those related to the program of development, in order to promote the human rights of the poorest, and to put an end to extreme poverty and social exclusion and promote the enjoyment of the fruits of social progress. It is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the [[decision making]] process by the community in which they live, the promotion of human rights and efforts to combat extreme poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(symbol)/a.conf.157.23.en|title=unhchr.ch|website=www.unhchr.ch|access-date=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
