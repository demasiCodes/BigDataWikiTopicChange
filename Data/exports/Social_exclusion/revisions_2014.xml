{{sociology}}
'''Social exclusion''' (or '''marginalization''') is social disadvantage and relegation to the fringe of [[society]]. It is a term used widely in [[Europe]], and was first used in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Silver, “Social Exclusion and Social Solidarity.” International Labour Review 133, nos. 5-6 (1994): 531-78.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used across disciplines including [[education]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[politics]] and [[economics]].

Social exclusion is the process in which individuals or entire communities of people are systematically blocked from (or denied full access to) various rights, opportunities and resources that are normally available to members of a different group, and which are fundamental to social integration within that particular group&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adler.edu/page/institutes/institute-on-social-exclusion/about ''Adler School of Professional Psychology'']&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., housing, employment, healthcare, civic engagement, democratic participation, and due process).

[[Social alienation|Alienation]] or [[disenfranchisement]] resulting from social exclusion is often connected to a person's [[social class]], [[education|educational status]], childhood relationships,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvationarmy.org.uk/seeds The Salvation Army: The Seeds of Exclusion (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard of Living|living standards]], or [[fashion|personal choices in fashion]].

Such exclusionary forms of [[discrimination]] may also apply to [[disability|people with a disability]], [[minority group|minorities]], [[LGBT|members of the LGBT community]], [[Old age|"seniors"]], or [[Youth Exclusion|young people]]. Anyone who appears to deviate in any way from the "perceived norm" of a population may thereby become subject to coarse or subtle forms of social exclusion.

The outcome of social exclusion is that affected individuals or communities are prevented from participating fully in the economic, social, and political life of the society in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;Young, I. M. (2000). Five faces of oppression. In M. Adams, (Ed.), Readings for Diversity and Social Justice (pp. 35–49). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the characteristics listed in this article are present together in studies of social exclusion, due to exclusion's multidimensionality.

Another  way of articulating the definition of social exclusion is as follows:

{{quotation|Social exclusion is a multidimensional process of progressive social rupture, detaching groups and individuals from social relations and institutions and preventing them from full participation in the normal, normatively prescribed activities of the society in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shababinclusion.org/content/document/detail/558/1 Hilary Silver, ''Social Exclusion: Comparative Analysis of Europe and Middle East Youth,'' Middle East Youth Initiative Working Paper (September 2007), p.15]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One model to conceptualize  social exclusion and [[social inclusion|inclusion]] is that they are on a continuum on a vertical plane below and above the 'social horizon'. According to this model, there are ten social structures that impact exclusion and can fluctuate over time: race, geographic location, class structure, globalization, social issues, personal habits and appearance, [[education]], [[religion]], [[economics]] and [[politics]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In an alternative conceptualization, social exclusion theoretically emerges at the individual or group level on four correlated dimensions: insufficient access to [[social rights]], material deprivation, limited [[social participation]] and a lack of normative integration. It is then regarded as the combined result of personal risk factors (age, gender, race); macro-societal changes (demographic, economic and labor market developments, technological innovation, the evolution of social norms); government legislation and social policy; and the actual behavior of businesses, administrative organisations and fellow citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G. Jehoel-Gijsbers and C.

An inherent problem with the term, however, is the tendency of its use by practitioners who define it to fit their argument.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Social Exclusion, ed. J. Hills, J. Le Grand &amp; D. Piachaud 2002, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual exclusion==
{{quotation|"The marginal man...is one whom fate has condemned to live in two societies and in two, not merely different but antagonistic cultures....his mind is the crucible in which two different and refractory cultures may be said to melt and, either wholly or in part, fuse."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E. Park]], ''Cultural Conflict and the Marginal Man'' in Everett V Stonequist, ''The Marginal Man,'' Introduction, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social exclusion at the individual level results in an individual's exclusion from meaningful participation in society. An example  is the exclusion of [[single mother]]s from the [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] system prior to welfare reforms of the 1900s. The modern welfare system is based on the concept of entitlement to the basic means of being a productive member of [[society]] both as an organic function of society and as compensation for the socially useful labor provided. A single mother's contribution to society is not based on [[informal sector|formal employment]], but on the notion that provision of welfare for children is a necessary social expense. In some career contexts, caring work is devalued and [[motherhood]] is seen as a barrier to employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Discursive struggles within social welfare: Restaging teen motherhood | author=Lessa, I | journal=British Journal of Social Work | year=2006 | volume=36 | pages=283–298 | doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single mothers were previously marginalized in spite of their significant role in the socializing of [[children]] due to views that an individual can only contribute meaningfully to society through "gainful" employment as well as a cultural bias against unwed mothers. Today the marginalization is primarily a function of class condition.

More broadly, many women face  social exclusion. Moosa-Mitha discusses the Western [[feminist movement]] as a direct reaction to the marginalization of white women in society.&lt;ref&gt;Moosa-Mitha, Mehmoona, (2005). Situating anti-oppressive theories within critical and difference-centrered perspectives. In L. Brown &amp; S. Strega (Eds.) Research as Resistance (pp. 37–72). Toronto: Canadian Scholars' Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were excluded from the labor force and their work in the home was not valued. Feminists argued that men and women should equally participate in the labor force, in the public and private sector, and in the home. They also focused on labor laws to increase access to employment as well as to recognize [[child-rearing]] as a valuable form of labor. Today, women are still marginalized from [[Executive (management)|executive]] positions and continue to earn less than men in [[Senior management|upper management]] positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/equal-pay | title=Did You Know That Women Are Still Paid Less Than Men? | publisher=White House | accessdate=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of individual marginalization is the exclusion of individuals with [[disabilities]] from the [[Labour (economics)|labor]] force. Grandz discusses an employer's viewpoint about hiring individuals living with disabilities as jeopardizing [[productivity]], increasing the rate of [[absenteeism]], and creating more accidents in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Leslie (2003)"&gt;Leslie, D.R., Leslie K. &amp; Murphy M. (2003). Inclusion by design: The challenge for social work in workplace accommodation for people with disabilities. In W. Shera (Eds.), Emerging perspectives on anti-oppression practice (pp. 157–169). Toronto: Canadian Scholar's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor also discusses employer concern about the excessively high cost of accommodating people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Leslie (2003)" /&gt; The marginalization of individuals with disabilities is prevalent today, despite the legislation intended to prevent it in most western countries, and the [[academic]] achievements, skills and training of many disabled people.&lt;ref name="Leslie (2003)" /&gt;

There are also exclusions of lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender ([[LGBT]]) and other intersexual people because of their [[sexual orientation]]s and [[gender identity|gender identities]]. [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] require that the states and communities abolish any [[stereotype]]s about LGBT people as well as stereotyped [[gender role]]s.

{{quotation|"Isolation is common to almost every vocational, religious or cultural group of a large city. Each develops its own sentiments, attitudes, codes, even its own words, which are at best only partially intelligible to others." &lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Thrasher]], ''The Gang: A Study of 1,313 Gangs in Chicago,'' University of Chicago Press, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Community exclusion==
Many communities experience social exclusion, such as racial  (e.g., [[Black people|black]]) and economic (e.g., [[Romani people|Romani]]) communities.

One example is the [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] community in Australia. Marginalization of Aboriginal communities is a product of [[colonization]]. As a result of [[colonialism]], Aboriginal communities lost their land, were forced into destitute areas, lost their sources of livelihood, and were excluded from the labor market. Additionally, Aboriginal communities lost their culture and values through [[forced assimilation]] and lost their rights in society.&lt;ref&gt;Baskin, C. (2003). Structural social work as seen from an Aboriginal Perspective. In W. Shera (Ed.), Emerging perspectives on anti-oppressive practice (pp. 65–78). Toronto: Canadian Scholar's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today various Aboriginal communities continue to be marginalized from society due to the development of practices, policies and programs that “met the needs of white people and not the needs of the marginalized groups themselves”.&lt;ref name="Yee (2005)"&gt;Yee, J. (2005). Critical anti-racism praxis: The concept of whiteness implicated. In S. Hick, J. Fook and R. Pozzuto (Eds.), Social work, a critical turn, pp. 87–104. Toronto: Thompson&lt;/ref&gt; Yee also connects marginalization to [[Minority group|minority]] communities, when describing the concept of [[whiteness]] as maintaining and enforcing dominant norms and discourse.&lt;ref name="Yee (2005)" /&gt;

==Professional exclusion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
Some intellectuals and thinkers are marginalised because of their dissenting, radical or controversial views on a range of topics, including [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[climate change]], [[evolution]], [[alternative medicine]], [[Sustainable energy|green energy]], or third world politics. Though fashionable for a time to some, they are more widely regarded as intellectual freethinkers and [[dissident]]s whose ideas and views run against those of the mainstream. At times they are marginalised and abused, often systematically ostracized by colleagues, and in some cases their work ridiculed or banned from publication.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Examples include [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], [[Peter Duesberg]], [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]], [[Martin Fleischman]], [[Stanley Pons]], [[Fred Hoyle]], [[James Lovelock]], [[E. F. Schumacher]].

==Other contributors==
Social exclusion has many contributors. Major contributors include race, income, employment status, social class, geographic location, personal habits and appearance, education, religion and political affiliation.

===Global and structural===

[[Globalization]] (global-capitalism), immigration, social welfare and policy are broader social structures that have the potential to contribute negatively to one's access to resources and services, resulting in the social exclusion of individuals and groups. Similarly, increasing use of information technology and company [[outsourcing]] have contributed to [[job insecurity]] and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. Alphonse, George &amp; Moffat (2007) discuss how globalization sets forth a decrease in the role of the state with an increase in support from various “corporate sectors resulting in gross inequalities, injustices and marginalization of various vulnerable groups” (p.&amp;nbsp;1). Companies are outsourcing, jobs are lost, the [[cost of living]] continues to rise, and land is being [[expropriate]]d by large companies. Material goods are made in large abundances and sold at cheaper costs, while in India for example, the [[poverty line]] is lowered in order to mask the number of individuals who are actually living in poverty as a result of globalization. Globalization and structural forces aggravate poverty and continue to push individuals to the margins of society, while governments and large corporations do not address the issues (George, P, SK8101, lecture, October 9, 2007).

Certain language and the meaning attached to language can cause universalizing discourses that are influenced by the Western world, which is what Sewpaul (2006) describes as the “potential to dilute or even [[annihilate]] local cultures and traditions and to deny context specific realities” (p.&amp;nbsp;421). What Sewpaul (2006) is implying is that the effect of dominant global discourses can cause individual and cultural displacement, as well as an experience of “de-localization”, as individual notions of security and safety are jeopardized (p.&amp;nbsp;422). Insecurity and fear of an unknown future and instability can result in displacement, exclusion, and forced [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into the dominant group. For many, it further pushes them to the margins of society or enlists new members to the outskirts because of global-capitalism and dominant discourses (Sewpaul, 2006).

With the prevailing notion of globalization, we now see the rise of [[immigration]] as the world gets smaller and smaller with millions of individuals relocating each year. This is not without hardship and struggle of what a newcomer thought was going to be a new life with new opportunities. Ferguson, Lavalette, &amp; Whitmore (2005) discuss how immigration has had a strong link to access of welfare support programs. Newcomers are constantly bombarded with the inability to access a country's resources because they are seen as “undeserving foreigners” (p.&amp;nbsp;132). With this comes a denial of access to [[public housing]], [[health care]] benefits, [[employment]] support services, and [[social security]] benefits (Ferguson et al., 2005). Newcomers are seen as undeserving, or that they must prove their [[entitlement]] in order to gain access to basic support necessities. It is clear that individuals are [[Exploitation|exploited]] and marginalized within the country they have emigrated (Ferguson et al., 2005).

[[Welfare state]]s and social policies can also exclude individuals from basic necessities and support programs. Welfare payments were proposed to assist individuals in accessing a small amount of [[material wealth]] (Young, 2000). Young (2000) further discusses how “the provision of the welfare itself produces new injustice by depriving those dependent on it of rights and freedoms that others have…marginalization is unjust because it blocks the opportunity to exercise capacities in socially defined and recognized way” (p.&amp;nbsp;41). There is the notion that by providing a minimal amount of welfare support, an individual will be free from marginalization. In fact, welfare support programs further lead to injustices by restricting certain behaviour, as well the individual is mandated to other agencies. The individual is forced into a new system of rules while facing [[social stigma]] and [[stereotypes]] from the dominant group in society, further marginalizing and excluding individuals (Young, 2000). Thus, social policy and welfare provisions reflect the dominant notions in society by constructing and reinforcing categories of people and their needs. It ignores the unique-subjective human essence, further continuing the cycle of dominance (Wilson &amp; Beresford, 2000).

===Unemployment===
Whilst recognising the multi-dimensionality of exclusion, policy work undertaken at [[European Union]] level focuses on [[unemployment]] as a key cause of, or at least correlating with, social exclusion. This is because in modern societies, paid work is not only the principal source of income with which to buy services, but is also the fount of individuals' identity and feeling of self-worth. Most people's social networks and sense of embeddedness in society also revolve around their work. Many of the indicators of extreme social exclusion, such as poverty and homelessness, depend on monetary income which is normally derived from work. Social exclusion can be a possible result of long-term unemployment, especially in countries with weak welfare safety nets.&lt;ref&gt;Furlong, Andy. ''Youth Studies: An Introduction''. Routledge, 2013, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Much policy to reduce exclusion thus focuses on the labour market:
* On the one hand, to make individuals at risk of exclusion more attractive to employers, i.e. more "employable".
* On the other hand, to encourage (and/or oblige) employers to be more inclusive in their employment policies.

The EU's [[EQUAL Community Initiative]] investigated ways to increase the inclusiveness of the labour market. Work on social exclusion more broadly is carried out through the [[Open Method of Coordination]] (OMC) among the Member State governments.

===Transportation===
In some circumstances, transport may be a factor in social exclusion - for instance, if lack of access to public transport or a vehicle prevents a person from getting to a job, training course, job centre or doctor's surgery, entertainment venues. Some schemes therefore promote [[accessibility]], for instance:
* By ensuring public transport is available.
* By subsidising the purchase of a scooter, which is relevant to young people living in rural areas, or a car, or a bicycle, etc.

===Religion===
Individuals and communities can be socially excluded on the basis of their religious beliefs. Significant historical examples include the [[Spanish inquisition]], [[History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933–1939)|Jewish life under Nazi rule]], [[Christianity in Egypt|Christians in Egypt]] and in other [[Dhimmi|Muslim-majority countries]], and  [[Islamophobia]] in the [[United States]] after the [[September 11 attacks]].

Within some religious traditions, individuals who are seen as deviating from a religious teaching may be excluded. One example is [[excommunication]] in Christianity. Excommunication is generally justified by the religion's internal code, such as Douglas A. Jacoby's interpretation of [[1 Corinthians]] 5:11 and [[Titus]] 3:9-11 as evidence that members can be excluded from fellowship for matters perceived within the church as grave sin without a religiously acceptable repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacoby|first=Douglas|title=Your Bible Questions Answered: Clear, Concise, Compelling|year=2011|publisher=Harvest House Publishers|isbn=0-7369-3074-4|page=199|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H6pMm8L3P0AC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=Titus+3:9-11+exclude&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OYucT8ibDuLm0QGKzfWuDw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Titus%203%3A9-11%20exclude&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links between exclusion and other issues==
The problem of social exclusion is usually tied to that of [[equal opportunity]], as some people are more subject to such exclusion than others. [[Marginalisation]] of certain groups is a problem even in many economically more developed countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], where the majority of the population enjoys considerable economic and social opportunities.

Since social exclusion may lead to one being deprived of one's citizenship, some authors ([[Philippe Van Parijs]], [[Jean-Marc Ferry]], [[Alain Caillé]], [[André Gorz]] and [[Axel Wolz]]) have proposed a [[basic income]], which would impede exclusion from citizenship. The concept of a Universal Unconditional Income, or social salary, has been disseminated notably by the Green movement in Germany.

In the last few years, there has been research focused on possible connections between exclusion and brain function. Studies published by the University of Georgia and San Diego State University found that exclusion can lead to diminished brain functioning and poor decision making. Such studies corroborate with earlier beliefs of sociologists. The effect of exclusion may likely correlate with such things as substance abuse and crime.

==Social inclusion==
Social inclusion, the converse of social exclusion, is [[affirmative action]] to change the circumstances and habits that lead to (or have led to) social exclusion.
The World Bank defines social inclusion as the process of improving the ability, opportunity, and dignity of people, disadvantaged on the basis of their identity, to take part in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Bank|title=Inclusion Matters: The Foundation for Shared Prosperity|year=2013|publisher=World Bank|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-4648-0010-8|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/16195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social Inclusion ministers have been appointed, and special units established, in a number of jurisdiction around the world. The first Minister for Social Inclusion was Premier of South Australia Mike Rann, who took the portfolio in 2004. Based on the UK's Social Exclusion Unit, established by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 1997, Rann established the Social Inclusion Initiative in 2002. It was headed by Monsignor David Cappo and was serviced by a unit within the department of Premier and Cabinet. Cappo sat on the Executive Committee of the South Australian Cabinet and was later appointed Social Inclusion Commissioner with wide powers to address social disadvantage.  Cappo was allowed to roam across agencies given that most social disadvantage has multiple causes necessitating a "joined up" rather than a single agency response.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 28 April 2006,"Cappo appointed Social Inclusion Commissioner"&lt;/ref&gt; The Initiative drove a big investment by the South Australian Government in strategies to combat homelessness, including establishing Common Ground, building high quality inner city apartments for "rough sleeping" homeless people, the Street to Home initiative&lt;ref&gt;Street to Home, sacommunity.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the ICAN flexible learning program designed to improve school retention rates. It also included major funding to revamp mental health services following Cappo's "Stepping Up" report, which focused on the need for community and intermediate levels of care&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mifa.org.au MIFA Home | Mental Illness Fellowship of Australia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and an overhaul of disability services.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News 20 Oct 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd appointed Julia Gillard as the nation's first Social Inclusion Minister.

==Consequences of social exclusion==

===Crime===
Sociologists see strong links between crime and social exclusion in industrialized societies such as the United States. Growing crime rates may reflect the fact that a growing number of people do not feel valued in the societies in which they live. The socially excluded population are in favor of illegal means of fulfilling their goals and motives in life as they have no other way to fit into a society that will not accept them. Crime is favored over the political system or community organization. Young people increasingly grow up without guidance and support from the adult population. Young people also face diminishing job opportunities to sustain a livelihood. This can cause a sense of willingness to turn to illegitimate means of sustaining a desired lifestyle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Health===
In [[gay men]], results of psychoemotional damage from marginalization from both heterosexual society and from within mainstream [[homosexual]] society include [[bug chasing]] (purposeful acts to acquire HIV),&lt;ref&gt;Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225, Crossley, Michelle, 2004. "'Resistance' and health promotion". British Journal of Social Psychology, Vol. 43, pp. 225–244&lt;/ref&gt; [[suicide]], and drug addiction.

==In philosophy==
The marginal, the processes of marginalisation, etc. bring specific interest in [[postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[postcolonialism|postcolonial]] philosophy and social studies.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert McInnis, [http://www.postcolonialweb.org/poldiscourse/mcinnis1.html The Struggle of Postmodernism and Postcolonialism], Laval University, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernism question the "center" about its authenticity and postmodern sociology and cultural studies research marginal cultures, behaviours, societies, the situation of the marginalized individual, etc.

Linda Hutcheon describes postmodernism itself as "intertextual, parodic, contradictory, provisional, heterogeneous, transgressive of generic divisions, ex-centric and ''marginal'' [italic by editor]".&lt;ref&gt;Long, Maebh (2010) ''[http://www.scribd.com/doc/52624202/9/Derrida-and-Postmodern-Irony Derrida and a Theory of Irony: Parabasis and Parataxis]''. Doctoral thesis, DurhamUniversity&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for social work practice==

Upon defining and describing marginalization as well as the various levels in which it exists, one must now explore its implications for social work practice. Mullaly (2007) describes how “the personal is political” and the need for recognizing that social problems are indeed connected with larger structures in society, causing various forms of oppression amongst individuals resulting in marginalization (p.&amp;nbsp;262). It is also important for the social worker to recognize the intersecting nature of oppression. A non-judgmental and unbiased attitude is necessary on the part of the social worker. The worker must begin to understand [[oppression]] and marginalization as a systemic problem, not the fault of the individual (Mullaly, 2007).

Working under an Anti-oppression perspective would then allow the social worker to understand the lived, subjective experiences of the individual, as well as their cultural, historical and social background. The worker should recognize the individual as political in the process of becoming a valuable member of society and the structural factors that contribute to oppression and marginalization (Mullaly, 2007). Social workers must take a firm stance on naming and labeling global forces that impact individuals and communities who are then left with no support, leading to marginalization or further marginalization from the society they once knew (George, P, SK8101, lecture, October 9, 2007).

The social worker should be constantly [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]], work to raise the consciousness, [[Empowerment|empower]], and understand the lived subjective realities of individuals living in a fast-paced world, where fear and insecurity constantly subjugate the individual from the collective whole, perpetuating the dominant forces, while silencing the oppressed (Sakamoto and Pitner, 2005).

Some individuals and groups who are not professional social workers build relationships with marginalized persons by providing [[relational care]] and support, for example, through [[homeless ministry]]. These relationships validate the individuals who are marginalized and provide them a meaningful contact with the mainstream.

==Juridical concept==
There are countries, [[Italy]] for example, that have a legal concept of ''social exclusion''. In Italy, "''esclusione sociale''" is defined as [[poverty]] combined with [[social alienation]], by the [[statute]] n. 328 (11-8-2000), that instituted a state investigation commission named "''Commissione di indagine sull'Esclusione Sociale''" (CIES) to make an annual report to the government on legally expected issues of social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavoro.gov.it/Lavoro/CIES/ ''Commissione di Indagine sull’Esclusione Sociale'', accessed February 07, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], a document on [[international human rights instruments]] affirms that "[[extreme poverty]] and social exclusion constitute a violation of [[human dignity]] and that urgent steps are necessary to achieve better knowledge of extreme poverty and its causes, including those related to the program of development, in order to promote the human rights of the poorest, and to put an end to extreme poverty and social exclusion and promote the enjoyment of the fruits of social progress. It is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the [[decision making]] process by the community in which they live, the promotion of human rights and efforts to combat extreme poverty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(symbol)/a.conf.157.23.en ''Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,'' Part I, paragraph 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==

''To be "excluded from [[society]]" can take various relative senses, but social exclusion is usually defined as more than a simple [[economic]] phenomenon: it also has consequences on the social, [[symbol]]ic field.''{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

''"Women of [[Pakistan]]i, [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]] and [[Caribbean]] descent [in Britain] are doing well in schools but are still being penalised in the workplace...80-89% of 16-year-olds from those ethnic groups wanted to work full-time...but they were up to four times more likely to be [[jobless]]."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5320708.stm | work=BBC News | title=Career worries for minority women | date=September 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Axel Honneth]] thus speaks of a "struggle for [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]]",  which he attempts to theorize through [[Hegel]]'s philosophy. In this sense, to be socially excluded is to be deprived from social recognition and social value. In the sphere of [[politics]], social recognition is obtained by full [[citizenship]]; in the economic sphere (in [[capitalism]]) it means being paid enough to be able to participate fully in the life of the community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Axel Honneth]], ''The Struggle for Recognition: Moral Grammar of Social Conflicts'', 1996. ISBN 978-0-7456-1838-8&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept can be gleaned from considering examples of the ''"social integration crisis: poverty, professional exclusion or marginalization, social and civic disenfranchisement, absence or weakening of support networks, frequent [[Clash of Civilizations|inter-cultural conflicts]]"'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbact.eu/document-library/virtual-files/childhood/france/situation-of-single-parent-households-headed-by-wo.html ''single parent households''] Situation of single parent households headed by women&lt;/ref&gt; These relate not only to gender, race and disability, but also to [[crime]]:

''"Social exclusion is a major cause of crime and re-offending. Removing the right to vote increases social exclusion by signalling to serving prisoners that, at least for the duration of their sentence, they are dead to society. The additional punishment of disenfranchisement is not a deterrent. There is no evidence to suggest that criminals are deterred from offending behaviour by the threat of losing the right to vote.....(and) the notion of civic death for sentenced prisoners isolates still further those who are already on the margins of society and encourages them to be seen as alien to the communities to which they will return on release"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:D-HJsClzBxYJ:www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/documents/download.asp%3Flvid%3D436%26id%3D790+social+exclusion+disenfranchisement&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10&amp;gl=uk ''Barred from Voting: the Right to Vote for Sentenced Prisoners''] {{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
