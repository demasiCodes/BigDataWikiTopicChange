{{sociology}}
'''Social exclusion''' is a concept used in many parts of the world to characterise contemporary forms of social disadvantage. Dr. Lynn Todman, director of the Institute on Social Exclusion at the Adler School of Professional Psychology, suggests that social exclusion refers to processes in which individuals and entire communities of people are systematically blocked from rights, opportunities and resources (e.g. housing, employment, healthcare, civic engagement, democratic participation and due process) that are normally available to members of society and which are key to social integration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adler.edu/page/institutes/institute-on-social-exclusion/about ''Adler School of Professional Psychology'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of multiple deprivations that prevent individuals or groups from participating fully in the economic, social, and political life of the society in which they live.

Another definition of this sociological term is as follows:

Social exclusion is a multidimensional process of progressive social rupture, detaching groups and individuals from social relations and institutions and preventing them from full participation in the normal, normatively prescribed activities of the society in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shababinclusion.org/content/document/detail/558/1Hilary Silver, ''Social Exclusion: Comparative Analysis of Europe and Middle East Youth,'' Middle East Youth Initiative Working Paper (September 2007), p.15]&lt;/ref&gt;
With different kinds of poverty in today’s scenario developmental studies is necessary to explore the subject of social exclusion. Basically ,poverty is a multi-dimensional phenomenon.
Poverty and exclusion are two different concepts. Poverty is a distributional outcome whereas exclusion can be defined as process of declining participation, solidarity and access. 
But the definition or meaning of social exclusion varies from country to country. Like in French Republican social exclusion is defined as “rupture of social bond”. It can be termed as European approach to social disadvantage. They used policies of social inclusion like minimum income policies, active labour market policies, improved access to service in order to combat social exclusion.

It is quite difficult to measure social exclusion “scientifically” as social exclusion is in itself is quite relative, sensitive, and variable; therefore making it very difficult to measure. However, still some efforts have been made to measure social exclusion on the basis of output indicator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utoronto.ca/mcis/q2/papers/II_deHann_Dubey_Qual-Quant-AdH-21m.pdf 'de Hann &amp; Dubey paper'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Like for example in European Union the benchmark is “Risk of financial poverty (60 percent of national median income with Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development equivalence scales, before and after social transfers).”
All efforts to capture social exclusion have been casual approaches except poverty and low income. 

Tony Atkinson says in his report on the measurement of social exclusion that there are three levels of social exclusion: the first level being indicators like poverty, lack of education, unemployment; the persistent second level elaborates on these indicators; the third level stresses nation specific indicators. But the main list stresses factors like consumption and production. Some non-tangible aspects are also being examined to measure it like poor future prospects, inability to participate in community activities, education, housing and homelessness. Financial precariousness also measures social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Sociology/faculty/silver/documents/silver_and_miller-european_approach_to_social_disadvantage.pdf ''Silver &amp; Miller, European approach to social disadvantage'']&lt;/ref&gt;

An inherent problem with the term, however, is the tendency of its use by practitioners who define it to fit their argument.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Social Exclusion, ed. Hills, Le Grand &amp; Piachaud 2002, Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term used widely in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]], and was first utilized in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Silver, “Social Exclusion and Social Solidarity.” International Labour Review 133, nos. 5-6 (1994): 531-78.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used across disciplines including [[education]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[politics]] and [[economics]].

In social excluding communities, weak social networking limits the circulation of information about jobs, political activities, and community events.

Some{{Who|date=August 2011}} believe that exclusion in the countryside is as great as, if not greater than, that in cities. In [[rural]] areas there is less access to goods, services and facilities, making life difficult in many respects.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Social exclusion relates to the [[Social alienation|alienation]] or [[disenfranchisement]] of certain people within a society. It is often connected to a person's [[social class]], [[educational]] status, relationships in childhood&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salvationarmy.org.uk/seeds The Salvation Army: The Seeds of Exclusion (2008)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[living standards]] and how these might affect access to various opportunities. It also applies to some degree to people with a [[disability]], to [[minority group|minority]] men and women of all races, of all [[sexual orientation]]s and [[gender identity|gender identities]] (the [[LGBT]] community), to the [[elderly]], and to youth ([[Youth Exclusion]]). Anyone who deviates in any perceived way from the norm of a population may become subject to coarse or subtle forms of social exclusion. Additionally, communities may self-exclude by removing themselves physically from the larger community, for example, in the [[gated community]] model.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Most of the characteristics listed in the following paragraphs are present together in studies of social exclusion, due to exclusion's multidimensionality. One of the best descriptions of social exclusion and [[social inclusion]] are that they are on a continuum on a vertical plane below and above the 'social horizon'; they have a ten-phase modulating ("phase" because they increase and decrease [modulate] with time) social structure: race, geographic location, class structure, globalization, social issues, personal habits and appearance, [[education]], [[religion]], [[economics]] and [[politics]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Juridical concept==
There are countries, Italy for example, that have a legal concept of ''social exclusion''. In Italy, "esclusione sociale" is defined as ''[[poverty]]'' combined with [[social alienation]], by the [[statute]] n. 328 (11-8-2000), that instituted a state investigation commission named "Commissione di indagine sull'Esclusione Sociale" (CIES) to make an annual report to the government on legally expected issues of ''social exclusion''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], a document on [[international human rights instruments]] affirms that "[[extreme poverty]] and social exclusion constitute a violation of [[human dignity]] and that urgent steps are necessary to achieve better knowledge of extreme poverty and its causes, including those related to the programm of development, in order to promote the human rights of the poorest, and to put an end to extreme poverty and social exclusion and promote the enjoyment of the fruits of social progress. It is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the [[decision making]] process by the community in which they live, the promotion of human rights and efforts to combat extreme poverty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(symbol)/a.conf.157.23.en ''Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,'' Part I, paragraph 25]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
===Unemployment===
Whilst recognising the multi-dimensionality of exclusion, policy work undertaken at [[European Union]] level focuses on [[unemployment]] as a key cause of, or at least correlating with, social exclusion. This is because in modern societies, paid work is not only the principal source of income with which to buy services, but is also the fount of individuals' identity and feeling of self-worth. Most people's social networks and sense of embeddedness in society also revolve around their work. Many of the indicators of extreme social exclusion, such as poverty and homelessness, depend on monetary income which is normally derived from work. Much policy to reduce exclusion thus focuses on the labour market:
* On the one hand, to make individuals at risk of exclusion more attractive to employers, i.e. more "employable".
* On the other hand, to encourage (and/or oblige) employers to be more inclusive in their employment policies.

The EU's [[EQUAL Community Initiative]] investigated ways to increase the inclusiveness of the labour market. Work on social exclusion more broadly is carried out through the [[Open Method of Coordination]] (OMC) among the Member State governments.

===Transportation===
In some circumstances, transport may be a factor in social exclusion - for instance, if lack of access to public transport or a vehicle prevents a person from getting to a job, training course, job centre or doctor's surgery, entertainment venues. Some schemes therefore promote [[accessibility]], for instance:
* By ensuring public transport is available.
* By subsidising the purchase of a scooter, which is relevant to young people living in rural areas, or a car, or a bicycle, etc.

==Quotations==
''“Social exclusion is about the inability of our society to keep all groups and individuals within reach of what we expect as a society...[or] to realise their full potential."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514268539/html/x2692.html ''Social exclusion in the UK'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''"Whatever the content and criteria of social membership, socially excluded groups and individuals lack capacity or access to social opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shababinclusion.org/content/document/detail/558/1 Hilary Silver, ''Social Exclusion: Comparative Analysis of Europe and Middle East Youth,'' Middle East Youth Initiative Working Paper (September 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

To be "excluded from [[society]]" can take various relative senses, but social exclusion is usually defined as more than a simple [[economic]] phenomenon: it also has consequences on the social, [[symbol]]ic field.

''"Women of [[Pakistan]]i, [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]] and [[Caribbean]] descent [in Britain] are doing well in schools but are still being penalised in the workplace...80-89% of 16-year-olds from those ethnic groups wanted to work full-time...but they were up to four times more likely to be [[jobless]]."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5320708.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Career worries for minority women&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Axel Honneth]] thus speaks of a "struggle for [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]]",  which he attempts to theorize through [[Hegel]]'s philosophy. In this sense, to be socially excluded is to be deprived from social recognition and social value. In the sphere of [[politics]], social recognition is obtained by full [[citizenship]]; in the economic sphere (in [[capitalism]]) it means being paid enough to be able to participate fully in the life of the community.

This concept can be gleaned from considering examples of the ''"social integration crisis: poverty, professional exclusion or marginalization, social and civic disenfranchisement, absence or weakening of support networks, frequent [[Clash of Civilizations|inter-cultural conflicts]]"'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbact.eu/document-library/virtual-files/childhood/france/situation-of-single-parent-households-headed-by-wo.html ''single parent households'']&lt;/ref&gt; Situation of single parent households headed by women&lt;/ref&gt; These relate not only to gender, race and disability, but also to [[crime]]:

''"Social exclusion is a major cause of crime and re-offending. Removing the right to vote increases social exclusion by signalling to serving prisoners that, at least for the duration of their sentence, they are dead to society. The additional punishment of disenfranchisement is not a deterrent. There is no evidence to suggest that criminals are deterred from offending behaviour by the threat of losing the right to vote.....(and) the notion of civic death for sentenced prisoners isolates still further those who are already on the margins of society and encourages them to be seen as alien to the communities to which they will return on release"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:D-HJsClzBxYJ:www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/documents/download.asp%3Flvid%3D436%26id%3D790+social+exclusion+disenfranchisement&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10&amp;gl=uk ''Barred from Voting: the Right to Vote for Sentenced Prisoners''] {{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Links between exclusion and other issues==
The problem of social exclusion is usually tied to that of [[equal opportunity]], as some people are more subject to such exclusion than others. [[Marginalisation]] of certain groups is a problem even in many economically more developed countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], where the majority of the population enjoys considerable economic and social opportunities.

Since social exclusion may lead to one being deprived of one's citizenship, some  authors ([[Philippe Van Parijs]], [[Jean-Marc Ferry]], [[Alain Caillé]], [[André Gorz]] and [[Axel Wolz]]) have proposed a [[basic income]], which would impede exclusion from citizenship. The concept of a Universal Unconditional Income, or social salary, has been disseminated notably by the Green movement in Germany.

In the last few years, there has been research focused on possible connections between exclusion and brain function. Studies published by the University of Georgia and San Diego State University found that exclusion can lead to diminished brain functioning and poor decision making. Such studies corroborate with earlier beliefs of sociologists. The effect of exclusion may likely correlate with such things as substance abuse and crime.

==Social inclusion==
Social inclusion, the converse of social exclusion, is [[affirmative action]] to change the circumstances and habits that lead to (or have led to) social exclusion.

==Crime==
Sociologists see strong links between crime and social exclusion in industrialized societies such as the United States.  Growing crime rates may reflect the fact that a growing number of people do not feel valued in the societies in which they live.  The socially excluded population cannot meet the standards of economic status and consumption that are promoted within society.  Therefore legitimate means are bypassed in favor of illegal ones.  Crime is favored over the political system or community organization.  Young people increasingly grow up without guidance and support from the adult population.  Young people also face diminishing job opportunities to sustain a livelihood.  This can cause a sense of willingness to turn to illegitimate means of sustaining a desired lifestyle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
