'''Fear of children''', '''hatred of children''', or occasionally called '''paedophobia''', is fear triggered by the presence or thinking of [[children]] or [[infants]]. It is an emotional state of fear, disdain, aversion, or prejudice toward children or [[youth]]. Paedophobia is in some usages identical to [[ephebiphobia]].&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kring/&gt;&lt;ref name=Djordjevic/&gt;

The fear of children has been diagnosed and treated by psychiatrists, with studies examining the effects of multiple forms of treatment.&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt; Studies have identified the fear of children as a factor affecting biological conception in humans.&lt;ref name=Kemeter/&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonald/&gt;

==Causes==
[[Letty Cottin Pogrebin]], a founding editor of ''[[Ms. magazine|Ms.]]'' [[Ms. magazine|magazine]], diagnosed America as having an "epidemic of paedophobia", saying that, "though most of us make exceptions for our own offspring, we do not seem particularly warm-hearted towards other people's children."&lt;ref name=Pogrebin/&gt;

One author suggests that the cause of the fear of children in [[academia]] specifically extends from [[adult|adults']] distinct awareness of the capacity of children: "Children embarrass us because they point ever too cleverly and clearly to our denial of personal, material, and maternal history."&lt;ref name=Coiner/&gt; 

One report suggests that the source of current trends in the fear of children have a specific source: [[James Q. Wilson]], a professor at [[UCLA]]'s School of Management, who in 1975 helped inaugurate the current climate of pedophobia when he said "a [[Critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]] of younger persons... creates an explosive increase in the amount of crime."&lt;ref name=Murashigi/&gt;

Sociologists have situated "contemporary fears about children and childhood" as "contributing to the ongoing social construction of childhood", suggesting that "generational power relations, in which children's lives are bounded by adult surveillance" affect many aspects of society.&lt;ref name=Scott/&gt;

==Efforts to decrease==
Efforts to decrease inattention to the needs of children or opposition to youths is a focus of several international [[social justice]] movements addressing young people, including [[children's rights]] and [[youth participation]]. Major international organizations addressing discrimination, either outright or by implication, include [[Save the Children]] and [[Children's Defense Fund]]. However, some organizations, particularly those associated with the [[youth rights]] movement, claim that these movements perpetuate discrimination.&lt;ref name=Axon/&gt;

The United Nations has created the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], which is implicitly designed to foster [[intergenerational equity]] between children and adults.&lt;ref name=Penn/&gt;

The influence of the fear of youths in [[American popular culture]] is examined by critical media analysts who have identified the effects of pedophobia in both [[List of notable Disney feature films|Disney]]&lt;ref name=Giroux/&gt; and [[horror movies|horror]] films.&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;

Other authors and scholars, including [[Henry Giroux]],&lt;ref name=Giroux2/&gt; [[Mike Males]], and [[Barbara Kingsolver]]&lt;ref name=Dudley-Marling/&gt; have suggested that the popular modern fear of youths stems from [[corporatisation]] of [[mass media]] and its complicity with a range of [[political]] and [[economic]] interests. Males perhaps goes the furthest, and wrote an entire book exploring the subject.&lt;ref name=Males/&gt;

==Terminology==
''Paedophobia'' is the British English spelling, and ''pediaphobia'' is another alternate spelling. The terms come from the Greek roots παιδ- ''paid-'' (child) and φόβος ''-phóbos'' (fear). Pedophobia is not to be confused with [[pediophobia]] (fear of dolls) or podophobia (fear of feet).
