==Ahmadis==

{{Main|Persecution of Ahmadiyya}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] regard themselves as Muslims, but are seen by many other Muslims as non-Muslims and "heretics" since they do not believe in the finality of [[Prophets in Islam|prophethood]] since the death of [[Muhammad]]. Armed groups, led by the umbrella organization [[Khatme Nabuwat]] ("Finality of Prophethood"), have launched violent attacks against their mosques in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh: Breach of Faith|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2005/bangladesh0605/|publisher=Hrw.org|accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They committed massacres against them which resulted in 2,000 Ahmadiyya deaths in Pakistani Punjab. Eventually, martial law had to be established and Governor general Ghulam Mohamed dismissed the federal cabinet. This anti-Ahmadiyya movement led Pakistani prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to declare that the Ahmadiyyas were "non-Muslims".&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+pk0121) Jamaat-i-Islami] Federal Research Division US Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss16/khan.shtml Persecution of the Ahmadiyya Community in Pakistan: An Analysis Under International Law and International Relations]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Government of [[Pakistan]], under General [[Zia-ul-Haq]], passed [[Ordinance XX]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepersecution.org/50years/paklaw.html Ordinance XX]&lt;/ref&gt; which banned proselytizing by Ahmadis and also banned Ahmadis from referring to themselves as [[Muslim]]s. According to this ordinance, any Ahmadi who refers to oneself as a Muslim by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, directly or indirectly, or makes the call for prayer as other Muslims do, is punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years. Because of these difficulties, [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]] migrated to London, UK.

==Ajlafs and Arzals==

{{Main|Caste system among South Asian Muslims}}
Despite [[Islam]]'s egalitarian tenets, units of social stratification, termed as "castes" by many, have developed among Muslims in some parts of South Asia.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042918 "Islamic caste."] Encyclopædia Britannica. 2006. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 18 Oct. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;[[John Burton-Page|Burton-Page, J.]], [http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-2884 Hindū], ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''. Edited by: [[Peri Bearman|P. Bearman]], Th. Bianquis, [[C. E. Bosworth]], E. van Donzel and [[W. P. Heinrichs]]. Brill, 2006. Brill Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories have been put forward regarding the development of castes among Indian Muslims. Majority of  sources state that the castes among Muslims developed as the result of close contact with Hindu culture and Hindu converts to Islam,&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslim Caste in Uttar Pradesh (A Study of Culture Contact), Ghaus Ansari, Lucknow, 1960, Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sikand"&gt;{{cite web|last = Singh Sikand|first = Yoginder|title = Caste in Indian Muslim Society|publisher = Hamdard University|url = http://stateless.freehosting.net/Caste%20in%20Indian%20Muslim%20Society.htm|accessdate = 18 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while few others feel that these developed based on claims of descent from Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Alvi"&gt;Sajida Sultana Alvi, Advice on the art of governance, an Indo-Islamic Mirror for Princes P122, State University of New York Press, ISBN 0-88706-918-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Imtiaz"&gt;Ahmad, Imtiaz, "The Ashraf-Ajlaf dichotomy in Muslim social structure in India", Indian economic and social history review 33 (1966) pgs 268-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections of the ulema (scholars of Islamic jurisprudence) have declared the religious legitimacy of the caste system with the help of the concept of kafa'a{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. A classic example of scholarly literature supporting the Muslim caste system is the ''Fatawa-i Jahandari'', written by the 14th century Turkish scholar, Ziauddin Barani, a member of the court of  [[Muhammad bin Tughlaq]], of the Tughlaq dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. Barani was known for his intensely casteist views, and he regarded the Ashraf Muslims as racially superior to the Ajlaf Muslims{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. 

He divided the Muslims into grades and sub-grades. In his scheme, all high positions and privileges were to be a monopoly of the high born Turks, not the Indian Muslims{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. Even in his interpretation of the Koranic verse "Indeed, the pious amongst you are most honored by Allah", he considered piety to be associated with noble birth.&lt;ref name="Alvi"/&gt; Barrani was specific in his recommendation that the "sons of Mohamed" [i.e. Ashrafs] "be given a higher social status than the low-born [i.e. Ajlaf].&lt;ref name="Das_138_139"&gt;{{harvp|Das|1996|pp=138-139}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most significant contribution in the fatwa was his analysis of the castes with respect to Islam.&lt;ref name="Das2"&gt;{{harvp|Das|1996|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; His assertion was that castes would be mandated through state laws or "Zawabi" which would carry precedence over [[Sharia]] law whenever they were in conflict.&lt;ref name="Das2"/&gt; 

In the Fatwa-i-Jahandari (advice XXI), he wrote about the "qualities of the high-born" as being "virtuous" and the "low-born" as being the "custodians of vices". Every act which is "contaminated with meanness and based on ignominy, comes elegantly [from the Ajlaf]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Das|1996|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barani had a clear disdain for the Ajlaf and strongly recommended that they be denied education, lest they usurp the Ashraf masters{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. He sought appropriate religious sanction to that effect.&lt;ref name="Sikand"/&gt; Barrani also developed an elaborate system of promotion and demotion of Imperial officers ("Wazirs") that was conducted primarily on the basis of caste.&lt;ref name="Das_138_139"/&gt;

In addition to the Ashraf/Ajlaf divide, there is also the ''Arzal'' caste among Muslims, whose members were regarded by anti-Caste activists like Babasaheb [[B. R. Ambedkar|Ambedkar]] as the equivalent of untouchables.&lt;ref name="Ambedkar"&gt;{{cite book |last = Ambedkar |first = Bhimrao |authorlink = B.R. Ambedkar |title = Pakistan or the Partition of India |publisher =  Thackers Publishers  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ambedkaronline"&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html Web resource for ''Pakistan or the Partition of India'']&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Arzal" stands for "degraded" and the Arzal castes are further subdivided into Bhanar, Halalkhor, Hijra, Kasbi, Lalbegi, Maugta, Mehtar etc.&lt;ref name="Ambedkar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ambedkaronline"/&gt; The Arzal group was recorded in the 1901 census in India and its members are also called [[Dalit]] Muslims “with whom no other Muhammadan would associate, and who are forbidden to enter the mosque or to use the public burial ground”{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.They are relegated to "menial" professions such as scavenging and carrying [[night soil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/story/12109.html Dereserve these myths] by Tanweer Fazal,''Indian express''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alawites==

The [[Alawites]] are a secretive group that believe in the divine nature of [[Ali]], the cousin of [[Muhammad]].  They have been persecuted in the past and survive in the remote and more mountainous parts of [[Syria]].  The ruling [[Ba'ath]] party is dominated by Alawis ([[President of Syria|President]] [[Bashar al-Assad]] is Alawi himself) and they have sought fatwas from Shiite clergy in [[Lebanon]] declaring that they are, in fact, Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/lebanon/religious-sects.htm Lebanon - Religious Sects]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutazilites==

In medieval Iraq, the [[Mu'tazili]] theological movement was made a state doctrine in 832, igniting the [[Mihna]] (ordeal) a struggle over the application of Greek logical proof of the Qu'ran; people who would not accept Mu'tazili claims that the Qur'an was created rather than eternal were sometimes persecuted.  The most famous victims of the Mihna were [[Ahmad Ibn Hanbal]] who was imprisoned and tortured, and the judge Ahmad Ibn Nasr al-Khuza'i who was crucified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iskandrani.wordpress.com/2008/02/09/do-not-envy-anyone-who-has-not-been-harmed-for-the-sake-of-this-affair/ “Do not envy anyone who has not been harmed for the sake of this affair.” « A Resource of Translated Islamic Texts]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ahmad Ibn Hanbal]] was dragged before the inquisition, known as the [[Mihna]], ordered by the caliph [[al-Maʾmūn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/10121/Ahmad-ibn-Hanbal Ahmad ibn Hanbal -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it lost official support soon afterwards. This coincided with the rise to prominence of the [[Ash'ari]] approach to Islam, of which [[Al-Ghazali]] was a staunch defender. [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]] Islam became the mainstream schools of Islam.
As a consequence, the tables turned and some Mutazili scholars were victims of persecution themselves in the centuries to follow. Some [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] like [[Averroes]] and [[Avicenna]] also faced persecution from fellow Muslims in their time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmima.csic.es/mirror/mattom/science+society/lectures/illustrations/lecture16/ibnsina.html Science, civilization and society]&lt;/ref&gt; Mu'tazilite doctrine - by now regarded as heretical by Sunnis - continued to be influential amongst some Shia in Persia and Zaydis in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H052 Ash'ariyya and Mu'tazila]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shi'a==

{{Main|Persecution of Shia Muslims|Shi'a–Sunni relations}}

At various times many Shi'a groups have faced persecution. All of the [[Twelve Imams]] of [[Shia Islam]] have been martyred and their followers persecuted by either [[Kharijites]], the [[Umayyads]], or [[Abassids]]. In 1513, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Selim I]] ("The Grim") ordered the massacre of 40,000 [[Shia]] Muslim "heretics" in Anatolia during the Safavid-Ottoman struggles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasmorestudies.org/segn/control/context?docId=65&amp;searchDocId=65&amp;selectedDoc=65&amp;offset=0&amp;version=modern&amp;xpath=/wp:Document/wp:Content/page%5B1%5D&amp;allDoc=true St Thomas More Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenaref/cmh/cmh103.html The Ottoman Conquest]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the dominant strand in modern Sunni dogma regards Shiism as a valid ''madhhab'', following [[Al Azhar]], some Sunnis both now and in the past have regarded it as beyond the pale, and have attacked its adherents.  In modern times, notable examples include the bombing campaigns by the Sunni [[Sipah-e-Sahaba]] and the Shia [[Tehrik-e-Jafria]], two small extremist groups, against Shia or Sunni mosques in [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39432 RELIGION-PAKISTAN: Shia-Sunni Tensions Surface on Campus]&lt;/ref&gt; the persecution of [[Hazara people|Hazara]] under the [[Taliban]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1608289.stm BBC News | SOUTH ASIA | Hazara people's long suffering]&lt;/ref&gt; and the bloody attacks linked with [[Zarqawi]] and his followers against Shia in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6293230.stm BBC NEWS | Middle East | Crushing Iraq's human mosaic]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the worst Shia-Sunni sectarian strife has occurred after the [[Iraq War|American invasion of Iraq]], steadily building up to present.{{when|date=July 2012}}&lt;ref name="Civil War"&gt;[http://www.motherjones.com/news/featurex/2007/03/civil_war.html Civil War]&lt;/ref&gt; According to one estimate, as of early 2008, 1,121 Muslim suicide bombers have blown themselves up in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/03/14/7682/ March 14, 2008 The Independent/UK "The Cult of the Suicide Bomber" by Robert Fisk ] "month-long investigation by The Independent, culling four Arabic-language newspapers, official Iraqi statistics, two Beirut news agencies and Western reports"&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni [[suicide attack|suicide bombers]] have targeted not only thousands of civilians,&lt;ref&gt;over half of the 20,000 fatalities worldwide from terrorism in 2006 occurred in Iraq according to the American National Counterterrorism Center [http://wits.nctc.gov/reports/crot2006nctcannexfinal.pdf Report on Terrorist Incidents 2006] p.3 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326171214/http://wits.nctc.gov/reports/crot2006nctcannexfinal.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[2006 al-Askari Mosque bombing|mosques]], shrines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/BA05CFF2-8D0A-4B2D-BBD0-B92EB85E1267.htm Al Jazeera English - News - Car Bomb Blast Near Iraq Shrine]&lt;/ref&gt; wedding and funeral processions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/05/24/bomb-iraq.html Iraqi funeral procession bombed; at least 26 killed]&lt;/ref&gt; markets, hospitals, offices, and streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Nasr|2007|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Shia side, in early February 2006 militia-dominated government death squads were reportedly "tortur[ing] to death or summarily" executing "hundreds" of Sunnis "every month in Baghdad alone," many arrested at random.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article347806.ece Iraq's death squads]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,1883854,00.html Iraq 'failing to tackle death squads']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2006/04/02/iraq_militias_wave_of_death/ Iraq militias' wave of death, Sectarian killings now surpass terrorist bombings]," The Boston Globe, April 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saudi Arabian government has been viewed as repressive against Shias living in Saudi Arabia, mainly because it encourages the [[Salafi]] faith, which denounces Shia Islam as heretical. Shias are mainly persecuted due to the belief that they are Iranian "puppets" and traitors. In several Saudi Arabian cities, Shia [[azans]] and [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] demonstrations are banned.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

==Sunni Madhabs==

Yaqub Beg's Uyghur forces declared a Jihad against [[Hui people|Chinese Muslims]] under T'o Ming during the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]]. The Uyghurs thought that the Chinese Muslims were [[Shafi`i]], and since the Uyghurs were [[Hanafi]] that they should wage war against them. Yaqub Beg enlisted non Muslim Han Chinese militia under Hsu Hsuehkung in order to fight against the Chinese Muslims. T'o Ming's forces were defeated by Yaqub, who planned to conquer Dzungharia. Yaqub intended to seize all Dungan territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fairbank|Liu|Twitchett|1980|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fairbank|Liu|Twitchett|1980|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Takfiris==

Certain small groups - the [[Kharijite]]s of early medieval times, and [[Takfir wal Hijra]]- follow ''[[takfir]]ist'' doctrines, regarding almost all other Muslims as infidels whose blood may legitimately be shed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5400/is_200112/ai_n21482222/pg_9 new global threat: Transnational Salafis and Jihad], The Middle East Policy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmfaff/36/5020105.htm House of Commons - Foreign Affairs - Minutes of Evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wahhabis==

The [[Kuomintang]] [[Sufi]] [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] General [[Ma Bufang]], who backed the [[Yihewani]] (Ikhwan) Muslims, persecuted the Salafi/[[Wahhabi]]s. The Yihewani forced the Salafis into hiding. They were not allowed to move or worship openly. The Yihewani had become secular and Chinese nationalist, and they considered the Salafiyya to be "Heterodox" (xie jiao), and people who followed foreigner's teachings (waidao). Only after the Communists took over were the Salafis allowed to come out and worship openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wEih57-GWQQC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=ma+bufang+secret+war&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Lh6YTKKkLYT68AbGy7iKAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20secret%20war&amp;f=false|title=Guide to Islamist Movements|author=BARRY RUBIN|year=2000|publisher=M.E.
