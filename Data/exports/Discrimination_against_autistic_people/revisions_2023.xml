'''Discrimination against autistic people''' is the [[discrimination]], [[persecution]], and oppression that [[Autism spectrum|autistic]] people have been subjected to. Discrimination against autistic people is a form of [[ableism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Billawalla |first1=Alshaba |last2=Wolbring |first2=Gregor |title=Analyzing the discourse surrounding Autism in the New York Times using an ableism lens |journal=Disability Studies Quarterly |date=2014 |volume=34 |issue=1 |doi=10.18061/dsq.v34i1.3348 |url=https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/3348/3524 |access-date=13 December 2021|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
Research published in 2019 used data from more than 8,000 children in the [[University of London]]'s [[Millennium Cohort Study]], which tracks the lives of about 19,000 people born in the [[United Kingdom]] starting in 2000. Out of the children selected, 231 were autistic. The study from the ''[[Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders]]'' found that these autistic children were more likely to engage in "two-way sibling bullying", meaning being both a victim and perpetrator of bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Toseeb U, McChesney G, Oldfield J, Wolke D | title = Sibling Bullying in Middle Childhood is Associated with Psychosocial Difficulties in Early Adolescence: The Case of Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder | journal = Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders | volume = 50 | issue = 5 | pages = 1457–1469 | date = May 2020 | pmid = 31332675 | pmc = 7211196 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-019-04116-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research published in 2017, a meta-analysis of three studies, demonstrated that "first impressions of individuals with ASD made from thin slices of real-world social behavior by typically-developing observers are not only far less favorable across a range of trait judgments compared to controls, but also are associated with reduced intentions to pursue social interaction."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The meta-analysis continues, "These patterns are remarkably robust, occur within seconds, do not change with increased exposure, and persist across both child and adult age groups."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This may be why autistic people have "smaller social networks and fewer friendships, difficulty securing and retaining employment, high rates of loneliness, and an overall reduced quality of life."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sasson |first1=Noah J. |last2=Faso |first2=Daniel J. |last3=Nugent |first3=Jack |last4=Lovell |first4=Sarah |last5=Kennedy |first5=Daniel P. |last6=Grossman |first6=Ruth B. |title=Neurotypical Peers are Less Willing to Interact with Those with Autism based on Thin Slice Judgments |journal=Scientific Reports |date=1 February 2017 |volume=7 |page=40700 |doi=10.1038/srep40700 |pmid=28145411 |pmc=5286449 |bibcode=2017NatSR...740700S |issn=2045-2322|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller social networks, fewer friendships, and loneliness correlate with severe health outcomes. According to a paper published in the ''[[Journal of Health and Social Behavior]]'', "Health risks associated with social isolation have been compared in magnitude to the well-known dangers of smoking cigarettes and obesity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=CORNWELL |first1=ERIN YORK |last2=WAITE |first2=LINDA J. |title=Social Disconnectedness, Perceived Isolation, and Health among Older Adults |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |date=2009 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=31–48 |doi=10.1177/002214650905000103 |pmid=19413133 |issn=0022-1465|pmc=2756979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Office for National Statistics]], the unemployment rate of autistic people may reach 85%, the highest rate among all disabled groups studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Putz |first1=Catherine |last2=Sparkes |first2=Indiana |last3=Foubert |first3=Josephine |title=Outcomes for disabled people in the UK - Office for National Statistics |website=www.ons.gov.uk |date=18 February 2021 |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/disability/articles/outcomesfordisabledpeopleintheuk/2020 |access-date=15 April 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; autistic adults are also more likely to face healthcare disparities, such as being [[Vaccines and autism|unvaccinated]] against common diseases like [[tetanus]] and being more likely to use emergency services.&lt;ref name="Nicolaidis Raymaker McDonald Dern pp. 761–769"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Nicolaidis | first1=Christina | last2=Raymaker | first2=Dora | last3=McDonald | first3=Katherine | last4=Dern | first4=Sebastian | last5=Boisclair | first5=W.

In the [[United States]], people with disabilities are victims of violent crime three times as often as people without disabilities. The [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] does not report separately on autistic victims, but it does note that the victimization rate is especially high among those whose disabilities are cognitive. A small-sample study of Americans and Canadians found that autistic adults face a greater risk of [[Sexual abuse|sexual victimization]] than their peers. Autistic respondents were more than twice as likely to say they had been the victim of [[rape]] and over three times as likely to report unwanted sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Pitney Jr JJ |title=The politics of autism : navigating the contested spectrum|isbn=978-1-4422-4960-8|location=Lanham|oclc=907022313|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a large scale study found that autistic girls were almost three times more likely to be a victim of sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ohlsson Gotby|first1=Vide|last2=Lichtenstein|first2=Paul|last3=Långström|first3=Niklas|last4=Pettersson|first4=Erik|date=September 2018|title=Childhood neurodevelopmental disorders and risk of coercive sexual victimization in childhood and adolescence - a population-based prospective twin study|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29570782/|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines|volume=59|issue=9|pages=957–965|doi=10.1111/jcpp.12884|issn=1469-7610|pmid=29570782|s2cid=4238219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination in media and culture==
Representation of autistic people in media has perpetuated myths about autism, including characterizing autism as shameful and burdensome for family members, advertising fake cures for autism, and publicizing the long-disproven arguments surrounding [[vaccines and autism]]. These myths are perpetuated in [[mass media]] as well as [[news media]] and [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holton |first1=Avery |last2=Farrell |first2=Laura C. |last3=Fudge |first3=Julie L. |title=A Threatening Space?: Stigmatization and the Framing of Autism in the News |journal=Communication Studies |date=March 28, 2014 |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=189–207 |doi=10.1080/10510974.2013.855642 |s2cid=145668002 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10510974.2013.855642 |access-date=23 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stigmatization of autism can also be perpetuated by advertising from autism conversion organizations, such as [[Autism Speaks]]' advertising wherein a mother describes having considered [[Murder–suicide|murder-suicide]] in front of her autistic daughter or the NYU Child Study Center's advertisements where autism is personified as a kidnapper holding children for ransom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Waltz |first1=Mitzi |title=Images and narratives of autism within charity discourses |journal=Disability &amp; Society |date=February 16, 2012 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=219–233 |doi=10.1080/09687599.2012.631796 |s2cid=143756605 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/09687599.2012.631796 |access-date=23 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertising from Autism Speaks also brings up another form of discrimination autistic children in particular face, which is subpar education. In the US, only one third of autistic children in public schools receive [[special education]] services.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane Kanaya pp. 662–669"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=MacFarlane | first1=Jaclyn R. | last2=Kanaya | first2=Tomoe | title=What Does it Mean to be Autistic? Inter-state Variation in Special Education Criteria for Autism Services | journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=18 | issue=6 | date=2009-03-10 | issn=1062-1024 | doi=10.1007/s10826-009-9268-8 | pages=662–669| s2cid=143938436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the autistic behavior known as [[stimming]] is frequently referred to as "distracting" and the way autistic people naturally talk is often described as rude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2021-08-09 |title=Asperger's Doesn't Mean They're Rude |url=https://psychcentral.com/autism/myths-about-aspergers-and-rudeness |access-date=2023-02-21 |website=Psych Central |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical health-related research ==
In the United States, recently published research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=McDonald |first1=T. A. Meridian |last2=Scudder |first2=Audrey |date=2023-01-13 |title=Mind the NIH-Funding Gap: Structural Discrimination in Physical Health–Related Research for Cognitively Able Autistic Adults |url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10803-022-05856-w |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |language=en |doi=10.1007/s10803-022-05856-w |pmid=36635433 |s2cid=255773930 |issn=0162-3257}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has not funded grants focused on the treatment of physical health disparity conditions, such as insomnia, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions, in autistic adults across four decades of research funding.  McDonald and Scudder (2023) explicitly distinguish health disparity conditions that affect the lives of autistic people from research grants focused on the cause, cure, and prevention of autism.  Although their research focused on autistic adults without an intellectual disability, the research did not exclude this population and found a lack of funded grants focused on the treatment of health disparity conditions for autistic adults with intellectual disabilities.  The research describes several systemic discriminatory "nodes" of practices and policies that may contribute to the apparent discrimination in research grant funding.  These include the exclusion of disability populations from groups designated for physical health disparity research grants, the designation of autism as a "primary disease;" a designation used as a rationale for some National Institutes of Health (e.g., the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute) to exclude research focused on autistic populations from grant funding review, and the pressure on early career researchers by academic institutions (that receive NIH funding) to either change their research topic or their population for NIH grant applications and to avoid challenging NIH policies until they are at a more advanced stage in their career.

==Immigration==
In the United States, the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] supported restrictive immigration policies that discriminated against autistic people. Under these policies, autistic immigrants faced deportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inquirer.com/news/immigration-trump-deferred-action-medical-autism-mexico-guatemala-20190913.html |title=Immigrant families with severely ill or disabled children now face deportation by Trump administration |date=13 September 2019 |publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |accessdate=2022-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2018/04/30/trump-bar-immigrants-disabilities/25032/ |title=Trump Administration Seeks To Bar Immigrants with Disabilities |date=30 April 2018 |publisher=Disability Scoop |accessdate=2022-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Disability in Canada|Canada]], autistic immigrants have been denied citizenship or they have faced deportation due to the perception that they are a "burden" upon the Canadian medical system. In 2018, reforms in Canadian immigration law were announced, the reforms are supposed to make it easier for autistic and disabled immigrants to migrate to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4150860/disability-immigration-law-a-blessing-says-father-autistic-child/ |title=Father of son with autism calls Canada's new immigration policy a 'blessing for all of us' |publisher=Global News |accessdate=2022-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand effectively prohibits the immigration of autistic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title="Burdens" and Borders: Disability Discrimination in New Zealand Immigration Law |url=https://www.equaljusticeproject.co.nz/articles/burdens-and-borders-disability-discrimination-in-new-zealand-immigration-law2020 |access-date=2023-03-04 |website=Equal Justice Project |date=4 May 2020 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's health criteria have prompted criticism about its immigration policies. Australia forbids the immigration of people who would be exceptionally costly for the nation's health care or social services. People with autism may be subject to this policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Isaiah |first=Ebubechukwu |date=2023-06-04 |title=4 Countries that don't allow Autistic immigrants - StrangerMiles |url=https://strangermiles.com/countries-that-dont-allow-autistic-immigrants/ |access-date=2023-08-28 |website=Tranger |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV statement|NPOV in section on Immigration|date=September 2023}}

Singapore, which is renowned for having rigorous rules and regulations, also has severe immigration laws. According to these laws, prospective immigrants with long-term medical issues, such as autism, could be turned away by the country's immigration officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2023-06-04 |title=4 Countries that don't allow Autistic immigrants - StrangerMiles |url=https://strangermiles.com/countries-that-dont-allow-autistic-immigrants/ |access-date=2023-08-28 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
