Most authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world's largest religions generally view these negatively. This can range from quietly discouragement, explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices or sex/gender reassignment among adherents, actively opposing social acceptance of LGBT identites, to execution of people engaging in homosexual acts while tolerating sex/gender reassignment in specific cases.  Liberal voices within these religions tend to view LGBT people more positively, and some liberal [[religious denomination]]s may bless [[same-sex marriage]]s, as well as accepting and marrying people who are transgender. Historically, some cultures and religions accommodated, institutionalised, or revered, same-sex love and sexuality;&lt;ref name = BOSWELL1&gt;{{Citation | last= Boswell | first= John | Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality | publisher= University Of Chicago Press | year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ASIA&gt;{{Citation | last1= Dynes | first1= Wayne | last2= Donaldson first2= Stephen | title= Asian homosexuality | publisher= Routledge | year= 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; such [[mythology of same-sex love|mythologies and traditions]] can be found around the world;&lt;ref name = CARPENTER1&gt;{{Citation | last= Carpenter | first= Edward | title= Intermediate Types among Primitive Types: A Study in Social Evolution | publisher= Mitchell Kennerley | city= New York | year= 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; elements of religious and cultural incorporation of non-heterosexual practice can still be identified in traditions that have survived into the modern era, such as the [[Berdache]],&lt;ref name= BERDACHE&gt;{{Citation | last= Williams | first= Walter | title= The Spirit and the Flesh: Sexual Diversity in American Indian Culture | publisher=Beacon House | year= 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]],&lt;ref name = HIJRA1&gt;{{Citation | last= Nanda | first= Serena | title= Neither Man Nor Woman | publisher= Wadsworth Publishing | year= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Xanith]].&lt;ref name = XANITH1&gt;{{Citation | last= Wikan | first= Unni | title= The Omani Xanith: A Third Gender Role? | journal= Man, New Series | volume= 13 | number= 3 | date= September 1978 | pages= 473-475 | publisher= Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views of LGBT people==
According to a 2006 [[Australia]]n survey, LGBT Australians, compared to the general Australian population, were much more likely to have no religious affiliation, much less likely to be affiliated with a Christian denomination, and more likely to be affiliated with a non-Christian religion. The distribution of religions that LGBT Australians were raised in, however, was similar to that of the general population. Men, particularly bisexual men, were more likely to be Christian and more likely to have stayed in the same religion. Lesbians were more likely to have left the religion they were raised in and be currently unaffiliated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Murray|last=Couch|coauthors=Hunter Mulcare, Marian Pitts, Anthony Smith and Anne Mitchell|title=The religious affiliation of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex Australians: a report from the Private Lives survey|journal=People and Place|volume=16|issue=1|year=2008|month=April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 survey of LGB [[New Zealand]]ers found that 73% had no religion, 14.8% were Christian and 2.2% were Buddhist. In contrast, in 2001 census the general New Zealand population reported 59.8% Christian and 29.2% no religion. When looking at change since 1966, LGB people are disaffiliating with Christianity at a rate 2.37 times the rate of the general population in New Zealand. In the survey 59.8% reported a belief in a spiritual force, god or gods; this differed significantly by gender, with 64.9% of women and 55.5% of men reporting such a belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mark|last=Henrickson|title=Lavender Faith: Religion, Spirituality and Identity in Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual New Zealanders|journal=Journal of Religion &amp; Spirituality in Social Work|volume=26|issue=3|date=2007|url=http://lavenderislands.massey.ac.nz/downloads/Henrickson%20(2007)%20Lavender%20Faith.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Radical Faeries]] are a worldwide [[queer]] [[Spirituality|spiritual]] movement, founded in 1979 in the [[United States]]. Radical Faerie communities are generally inspired by aboriginal, native or traditional spiritualities, especially those that incorporate queer sensibilities.

==Religious groups and public policy==
Opposition to [[same-sex marriage]] and [[LGBT rights]] is often associated with conservative religious views. The [[American Family Association]] and other religious groups have promoted boycotts of corporations whose policies support the LGBT community.

On the other hand, the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] supports the freedom to marry &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uua.org/news/freedomtomarry/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and compares resistance to it to the resistance to abolition of [[slavery]], women's [[suffrage]], and the end of anti-[[miscegenation]] laws. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uusm.org/services/021305.php UUSM - Services &amp; Sermons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbians and gay men face particular problems in conservative Islamic nations where laws generally prohibit same-sex sexual behavior; where interpretation of Sharia Law on male homosexuality carries the death penalty this is quite a big problem for gay men, and this form of discrimination is seen as a breach of human rights by international human rights [[The Yogyakarta Principles|experts]] and human rights organisations such as [[Amnesty International]]; with the signature of the USA in 2009, the proposed [[UN declaration on LGBT rights]] has now been signed by every European secular state and all western nations, as well as others from South America and other countries around the world; 67 members of the UN have signed to date; there was an opposing statement put forward by Muslim nations, and this has been signed by 57 member states, the majority being in Africa and Asia.  68 out of the total 192 countries have not yet signed either statement.

Among the [[Indian religions|religions that originated in India]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], homosexuality is rarely discussed, although contemporary religious authorities tend to view homosexuality negatively.  Ancient religious texts such as the [[Vedas]] often refer to people of a [[third gender]], who are neither female nor male. Some see this third gender as an ancient parallel to modern western lesbian, gay, [[transgender]] and/or [[intersex]] identities. This third sex is also negatively valued as a [[pariah]] class in some texts.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Janet (2003). ''One Plus One Makes Three: Buddhist Gender Conceptions and the Law of the Non-Excluded Middle'', History of Religions. 2003, no. 2. University of Chicago press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Main|LGBT topics and Hinduism}}
[[Hinduism]] has taken various positions, ranging from positive to neutral or antagonistic. [[Rigveda]],one of the four canonical sacred texts of [[Hinduism]] says 'Vikruti Evam Prakriti' (perversity/diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognizes homosexuality as natural, if not an approval of homosexuality&lt;ref&gt;'Expose the Hindu Taliban!' by [[Ashok Row Kavi]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Sexuality is rarely discussed openly in Hindu society, and LGBT issues are largely a [[taboo]] subject&amp;nbsp;— especially among the strongly religious.  A "[[third gender]]" has been acknowledged within Hinduism since [[Vedic period|Vedic times]]. Several Hindu texts, such as [[Manu Smriti]]&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti, 3.49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sushruta Samhita]], assert that some people are born with either mixed male and female natures, or sexually [[neuter]], as a matter of natural biology. They worked as [[hairdressing|hairdressers]], flower-sellers, servants, [[massage|masseurs]] and [[prostitution|prostitutes]]. Today, many people of a "third gender" ([[Hijra (India)|hijras]]) live throughout India, mostly on the margins of society, and many still work in prostitution, or make a livelihood as beggars.

The Indian [[Kama Sutra]], written in the 4th century AD, contains passages describing [[eunuch]]s or "third-sex" males performing [[oral sex]] on men.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kama Sutra]], Chapter 9, "Of the Auparishtaka or Mouth Congress". [http://www.kamashastra.com/kama209.htm Text online].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the author was "not a fan of homosexual activities" and treated such individuals with disdain, according to historian [[Devdutt Pattanaik]].&lt;ref&gt;Pattanaik, Devdutt (2001). ''Homosexuality in Ancient India'', [[Debonair (magazine)|Debonair]] 2000 or 2001. Essay available [http://www.gaybombay.org/reading/art0001.html online] from GayBombay.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, some medieval Hindu temples and artifacts openly depict both male homosexuality and lesbianism within their carvings, such as the temple walls at [[Khajuraho]]. Some infer from these images that Hindu society and religion were previously more open to variations in human sexuality than they are at present.

In some Hindu sects, many divinities are [[androgynous]].  There are Hindu deities who are [[intersex]] (both male and female); who manifest in all three genders; who switch from male to female or from female to male; male deities with female moods and female deities with male moods; deities born from two males or from two females; deities born from a single male or single female; deities who avoid the opposite sex; deities with principal companions of the same sex, and so on.  However, this is not accepted by the majority of Hindus, and is often considered heretical in nature.  Those who do accept it justify with the belief that both God and nature are unlimitedly diverse and God is difficult to comprehend.
