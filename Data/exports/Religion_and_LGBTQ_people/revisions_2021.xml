{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}

The relationship between '''religion and [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]]''' ('''[[LGBT]]''') '''people''' can vary greatly across time and place, within and between different religions and sects, and regarding different forms of [[homosexuality]], [[bisexuality]], and [[transgender]] identities.

Some of the authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world's largest religions may view these negatively. This can range from quiet discouragement, explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices or sex/gender reassignment among adherents, actively opposing social acceptance of LGBT identities, to execution of people engaging in homosexual acts while tolerating sex/gender reassignment in specific cases.

Liberal and progressive voices within these religions tend to view LGBT people more positively, and some liberal [[religious denomination]]s may bless [[same-sex marriage]]s, as well as accepting and marrying people who are transgender. Historically, some cultures and religions accommodated, institutionalized, or revered same-sex love and sexuality;&lt;ref name = BOSWELL1&gt;{{Cite book | last= Boswell | first= John | publisher= University Of Chicago Press | year= 2005 |title= Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = ASIA&gt;{{Cite book | last1= Dynes | first1= Wayne | last2= Donaldson |first2= Stephen | title= Asian homosexuality | publisher= Routledge | year= 1992 | isbn= 978-0-8153-0548-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; such [[LGBT themes in mythology|mythologies and traditions]] can be found around the world;&lt;ref name = CARPENTER1&gt;{{Cite book | last= Carpenter | first= Edward | title= Intermediate Types among Primitive Types: A Study in Social Evolution | publisher= Mitchell Kennerley | location= New York | year= 1914 | isbn= 978-0-405-07352-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; elements of religious and cultural incorporation of non-heterosexual practice can still be identified in traditions that have survived into the modern era, such as the [[Two-Spirit|Berdache]],&lt;ref name= BERDACHE&gt;{{Cite book | last= Williams | first= Walter | author-link = Walter Lee Williams| title= The Spirit and the Flesh: Sexual Diversity in American Indian Culture | publisher=Beacon House | year= 1992 | isbn= 978-0-8070-4602-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]],&lt;ref name = HIJRA1&gt;{{Cite book | last= Nanda | first= Serena |author-link=Serena Nanda | title= Neither Man Nor Woman | publisher= Wadsworth Publishing | year= 1998 | isbn= 978-0-534-12204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Xanith]].&lt;ref name = XANITH1&gt;{{Cite journal | last= Wikan | first= Unni | title= The Omani Xanith: A Third Gender Role? | journal= Man |series=New Series | volume= 13 | issue= 3 | date= September 1978 | pages= 473–475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views of LGBT people==
According to a 2006 [[Australia]]n survey, LGBT Australians, compared to the general Australian population, were much more likely to have no religious affiliation, much less likely to be affiliated with a Christian denomination, and more likely to be affiliated with a non-Christian religion. The distribution of religions that LGBT Australians were raised in, however, was similar to that of the general population. Men, particularly bisexual men, were more likely to be Christian and more likely to have stayed in the same religion. Lesbians were more likely to have left the religion they were raised in and be currently unaffiliated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Murray|last=Couch|author2=Hunter Mulcare, Marian Pitts, Anthony Smith and Anne Mitchell|title=The religious affiliation of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex Australians: a report from the Private Lives survey|journal=People and Place|volume=16|issue=1|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 survey of LGBT [[New Zealand]]ers found that 73% had no religion, 14.8% were Christian and 2.2% were Buddhist. In contrast, in 2001 census the general New Zealand population reported 59.8% Christian and 29.2% no religion. When looking at change since 1966, LGBT people are disaffiliating with Christianity at a rate 2.37 times the rate of the general population in New Zealand. In the survey 59.8% reported a belief in a spiritual force, god or gods; this differed significantly by gender, with 64.9% of women and 55.5% of men reporting such a belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mark|last=Henrickson|title=Lavender Faith: Religion, Spirituality and Identity in Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual New Zealanders|journal=Journal of Religion &amp; Spirituality in Social Work|volume=26|issue=3|year=2007|url=http://lavenderislands.massey.ac.nz/downloads/Henrickson%20(2007)%20Lavender%20Faith.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008072403/http://lavenderislands.massey.ac.nz/downloads/Henrickson%20(2007)%20Lavender%20Faith.pdf|archive-date=8 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Radical Faeries]] are a worldwide [[queer]] [[Spirituality|spiritual]] movement, founded in 1979 in the [[United States]]. Radical Faerie communities are generally inspired by aboriginal, native or traditional spiritualities, especially those that incorporate queer sensibilities.

==Religious groups and public policy==
Opposition to [[same-sex marriage]] and [[LGBT rights]] is often associated with conservative religious views. The [[American Family Association]] and other religious groups have promoted boycotts of corporations whose policies support the LGBT community.

On the other hand, the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] supports the freedom to marry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uua.org/news/freedomtomarry/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-03-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716123613/http://www.uua.org/news/freedomtomarry/index.html |archive-date=16 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and compares resistance to it to the resistance to abolition of [[slavery]], women's [[suffrage]], and the end of anti-[[miscegenation]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uusm.org/services/021305.php UUSM - Services &amp; Sermons&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112081521/http://www.uusm.org/services/021305.php |date=12 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbians and gay men face particular problems in conservative Islamic nations where laws generally prohibit same-sex sexual behavior; where interpretation of Sharia Law on male homosexuality carries the death penalty this is quite a big problem for gay men, and this form of discrimination is seen as a breach of human rights by international human rights [[The Yogyakarta Principles|experts]] and human rights organisations such as [[Amnesty International]]; with the signature of the USA in 2009, the proposed [[UN declaration on LGBT rights]] has now been signed by every European secular state and all western nations, as well as others from South America and other countries around the world; 67 members of the UN have signed to date; there was an opposing statement put forward by Muslim nations, and this has been signed by 57 member states, the majority being in Africa and Asia.  68 out of the total 192 countries have not yet signed either statement.

{{Main|Unitarian Universalism and LGBT people}}
[[Unitarian Universalism]] and the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] (UUA) have a long-standing tradition of welcoming LGBT people.  The first ordained minister of any religion in the US or Canada to [[come out of the closet|come out]] was the Rev. [[James Stoll]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uupetaluma.org/sermons/sermon09jan05.html "My Greatly Human Hometown Minister--James Lewis Stoll, 1936-1994"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217204501/http://www.uupetaluma.org/sermons/sermon09jan05.html |date=17 February 2005 }}, sermon by Leland Bond-Upson, delivered January 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There have been UUA resolutions supporting people regardless of sexual orientation since 1970, and a popular program of becoming a "Welcoming Congregation" since 1989. The UUA has officially supported UUA clergy performing Services of Union between same-sex couples since 1984,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0DB1539F93AA15755C0A962948260 "Unitarians Endorse Homosexual Marriages"], UPI, ''New York Times'', 29 June 1984, retrieved on 21 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/obgltc/resource/history.html UUA: Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] (CUC) similarly operates a Gender and Sexual Diversity Monitoring Group&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuc.ca/social_responsibility_monitoring_groups/gender-and-sexual-diversity/ Gender and Sexual Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt; and, like the UUA (of which it became autonomous in 2002), has Welcoming Congregations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuc.ca/wp-content/uploads//2011/10/cucbrochures_welcomingcongregation.pdf CUC pamphlet on their Welcoming Congregation program]&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian Unitarian Universalist congregations perform same-sex marriages and the CUC supports this work through its Lay Chaplaincy program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuc.ca/wp-content/uploads//2011/10/cucbrochures_laychaplaincy.pdf CUC pamphlet on their Lay Chaplaincy program]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baháʼí Faith====
{{Main|Homosexuality and the Baháʼí Faith}}

The [[Baháʼí Faith]] teaches that the only acceptable form of sexual expression is within [[marriage]], and [[Baháʼí marriage]] is defined in the religion's texts as exclusively between one man and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |author-link=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Baháʼí Faith |title= Homosexuality |year= 2002 |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]]  |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn= 978-1-85168-184-6 |pages=184–185 |url= https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/184 |via=[[Internet Archive]] |url-access=limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="man and woman"&gt;"Baháʼí law restricts permissible sexual intercourse to that between a man and the woman to whom he is married." 
:(Letter from the Universal House of Justice to an individual; ''Lights of Guidance'', pp. 365, #1225) [http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance&amp;chapter=2#n1225]&lt;/ref&gt; Baháʼís stress the importance of absolute [[chastity]] for any unmarried person,&lt;ref name="married"&gt;"...according to the Baháʼí Teachings no sexual act can be considered lawful unless performed between lawfully married persons. Outside of marital life there can be no lawful or healthy use of the sex impulse."
:(On behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual; ''Lights of Guidance'', pp. 364, #1220) [http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance&amp;chapter=2#n1220]&lt;/ref&gt; and focus on personal restraint. The [[Universal House of Justice]], the elected governing body of the Baháʼí Faith, has stated that "the Faith does not recognize homosexuality as a 'natural' or permanent phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;"…the Faith does not recognize homosexuality as a "natural" or permanent phenomenon. Rather, it sees this as an aberration subject to treatment, however intractable exclusive homosexuality may now seem to be. To the question of alteration of homosexual bents, much study must be given, and doubtless in the future clear principles of prevention and treatment will emerge. As for those now afflicted, a homosexual does not decide to be a problem human, but he does, as you rightly state, have decision in choosing his way of life, i.e. abstaining from homosexual acts.
"Your plea for understanding and of justice extended to homosexuals is well taken in many respects, and the House of Justice assures you of its concern for the large number of persons so afflicted. Your work with the homosexual community is praiseworthy, and it permits you personally to exercise the support which is necessary for these often harassed persons, support which you call for in your essay. Moreover, your interest cannot but be therapeutic, at least for the more superficial elements of the problem; however, definitive therapy of the underlying predisposition, which you consider to be innate but the Teachings do not, may have to await additional investigations. As for the responsibility of Assemblies and of individual Baháʼís, certainly all are called upon to be understanding, supportive and helpful to any individual who carries the burden of homosexuality."
:(Letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual, 22 March 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The Universal House of Justice has approved of and encouraged Shoghi Effendi's idea of possible medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;(Letter of The Universal House of Justice, 5 June 1993, ''Homosexuality'', [http://bahai-library.com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc#page7 p. 7])&lt;/ref&gt;
However, membership in the Baháʼí community is open to lesbian and gay adherents,&lt;ref&gt;"They (homosexuals) should be treated just like any other people seeking admittance to the Faith, and be accepted on the same basis. Our teachings, as outlined in “The Advent of Divine Justice” on the subject of living a chaste life, should be emphasized to them just as to every other applicant, but certainly no ruling whatsoever should be laid down in this matter. The Baháʼís have certainly not yet reached that stage of moral perfection where they are in a position to too harshly scrutinize the private lives of other souls, and each individual should be accepted on the basis of his faith, and sincere willingness to try to live up to the Divine standards" 
:(Compiled by the Universal House of Justice Research Department, ''Homosexuality'', p. 3) [http://bahai-library.com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc]&lt;/ref&gt; who are to be "advised and sympathized with".&lt;ref name="sympathized"&gt;"Amongst the many other evils afflicting society in this spiritual low water mark in history is the question of immorality, and over-emphasis of sex. Homosexuality, according to the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, is spiritually condemned. This does not mean that people so afflicted must not be helped and advised and sympathized with."
:(On behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual, 21 May 1954; ''Lights of Guidance'', p. 365, #1221) [http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance&amp;chapter=2#n1221]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="understanding"&gt;"As for the responsibility of Assemblies and of individual Baháʼís, certainly all are called upon to be understanding, supportive and helpful to any individual who carries the burden of homosexuality."
:(Compiled by Universal House of Justice Research Department, ''Homosexuality'', p. 7) [http://bahai-library.com/compilation_homosexuality_bwc]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When an individual becomes a Baháʼí , he or she accepts the claim of Bahá'u'lláh to be the Manifestation of God bringing a divinely-inspired message from God for the benefit of mankind. Implicit in the acceptance of this claim is the commitment of the believer to embark on the lifelong process of endeavouring to implement the teachings on personal conduct. Through sincere and sustained effort, energized by faith in the validity of the Divine Message, and combined with patience with oneself and the loving support of the Baháʼí community, individuals are able to effect a change in their behaviour; as a consequence of this effort they partake of spiritual benefits which liberate them and which bestow a true happiness beyond description.
As you know, Bahá'u'lláh has clearly forbidden the expression of sexual love between individuals of the same sex. However, the doors are open for all of humanity to enter the Cause of God, irrespective of their present circumstance; this invitation applies to homosexuals as well as to any others who are engaged in practices contrary to the Baháʼí teachings. Associated with this invitation is the expectation that all believers will make a sincere and persistent effort to eradicate those aspects of their conduct which are not in conformity with Divine Law.

Referring to the nature of Samsara, the [[Rigveda]], one of the four canonical sacred texts of [[Hinduism]] says 'Vikruti Evam Prakriti' (perversity/diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognizes homosexuality as natural, if not an approval of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;'Expose the Hindu Taliban!' by [[Ashok Row Kavi]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sexuality is rarely discussed openly in Hindu society, and LGBT issues are largely a [[taboo]] subject&amp;nbsp;— especially among the strongly religious.  A "[[third gender]]" has been acknowledged within Hinduism since [[Vedic period|Vedic times]]. Several Hindu texts, such as [[Manu Smriti]]&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti, 3.49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sushruta Samhita]], assert that some people are born with either mixed male and female natures, or sexually neuter, as a matter of natural biology. They worked as [[hairdressing|hairdressers]], flower-sellers, servants, [[massage|masseurs]] and [[prostitution|prostitutes]]. Today, many people that identify as ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]]'' are officially recognized as a [[third gender]] that is neither male nor female in India;&lt;ref name="Cult. Health Sex."/&gt; they mostly live on the margins of society, and many still work in prostitution, or make a livelihood as beggars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Nanda |author-first=Serena |year=1996 |chapter=Hijras: An Alternative Sex and Gender Role in India |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlI91F_FHSYC |editor-last=Herdt |editor-first=Gilbert H. |title=Third sex, third gender: Beyond sexual dimorphism in culture and history |publisher=Zone Books |isbn=9780942299823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Hindu religious laws contain injunctions against homosexual activity, while some Hindu mythologies speaks favorably of lesbian relations and some third-gendered individuals were highly regarded by Hindu legends. Hindu groups are historically not unifyed regarding the issue of homosexuality, each one having a distinct doctrinal view.&lt;ref&gt;Lariviere. ''Naradasmriti, (Part One)''. Philadelphia, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History1"&gt;{{harvnb|Vanita|Kidwai|2001|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mahabharata]], book 5, Chapter 191-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian [[Kama Sutra]], written in the 4th century AD, contains passages describing [[eunuch]]s or "third-sex" males performing [[oral sex]] on men.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kama Sutra]], Chapter 9, "Of the Auparishtaka or Mouth Congress". [http://www.kamashastra.com/kama209.htm Text online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313043325/http://www.kamashastra.com/kama209.htm |date=13 March 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the author was "not a fan of homosexual activities" and treated such individuals with disdain, according to historian [[Devdutt Pattanaik]].&lt;ref&gt;Pattanaik, Devdutt (2001). ''Homosexuality in Ancient India'', [[Debonair (magazine)|Debonair]] 2000 or 2001. Essay available [http://www.gaybombay.org/reading/art0001.html online] from GayBombay.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, some medieval Hindu temples and artifacts openly depict both male homosexuality and lesbianism within their carvings, such as the temple walls at [[Khajuraho]]. Some infer from these images that Hindu society and religion were previously more open to variations in human sexuality than they are at present.

In some Hindu sects(specially among the hijras), many divinities are [[androgynous]].  There are Hindu deities who are [[intersex]] (both male and female); who manifest in all three genders; who switch from male to female or from female to male; male deities with female moods and female deities with male moods; deities born from two males or from two females; deities born from a single male or single female; deities who avoid the opposite sex; deities with principal companions of the same sex, and so on.  However, this is not accepted by the majority of Hindus, and is often considered heretical in nature.  Those who do accept it justify with the belief that both God and nature are unlimitedly diverse and God is difficult to comprehend.

Several Hindu priests have performed same-sex marriages, arguing that love is the result of attachments from previous births and that marriage, as a union of spirit, is transcendental to gender.

It is often regarded that Hinduism does not condemn homosexuality.

According to the [[Pāli Canon]] and [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgama]] (the [[Buddhist texts|early Buddhist scriptures]]), there is nothing saying that same or opposite gender relations have anything to do with sexual misconduct,&lt;ref name="cunda kammaraputta sutta"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta|trans-title=To Cunda the Silversmith|others=Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu|publisher=Access to Insight|year=1997|id=[[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 10.176|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.176.than.html| access-date = 2011-03-14|quote=Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct.

This is consonant with the general Buddhist principle that that which causes suffering for oneself or others is unethical behaviour. ("Unskillful behaviour" would be closer to the original.) There is no good reason to assume that '''''homosexual relations which do not violate this principle''''' should be treated differently. }}

====Religious Science====
Religious Science is a teaching based on the text book "The Science of Mind" by Dr. Ernest Holmes first published in 1926 and revised in 1938.  This 'new thought' tradition is related to the thoughts of Ralph Waldo Emerson and the transcendentalists as well as drawing on the main teachings of all the great world religions at the mystical level.  The churches or centers are under an umbrella of "Centers for Sprititual Living".  From its beginning Religious Science has advanced the social progressive edge by including all those regardless of sexual orientation fully into ministry, and blessing the marriages of same gender couples.

====Satanism====
The [[Church of Satan]] has always accepted gays, lesbians and bisexuals since its foundation in 1966.&lt;ref name="COS FAQ"&gt;[http://www.churchofsatan.com/Pages/_FAQ10.html Church of Satan FAQ 10.

Retrieved 28 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The church supports legalization of same-sex marriages.&lt;ref name = "COS FAQ"/&gt;
