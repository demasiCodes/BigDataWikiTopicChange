Novels that fall into this category may be of any genres, such as, but not limited to, [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], and [[Romance novel|romance]].

==History==
The first novel in the [[English language]] recognised as having a lesbian theme is [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' (1928), which a British court found obscene because it defended "unnatural practices between women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the [[United States]] ''The Well of Loneliness'' survived legal challenges in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the [[United States Customs Court|Customs Court]].

''Sex Variant Women in Literature'', [[Naiad Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

Lesbian fiction saw a huge explosion in interest with the advent of the dime-store or [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] novel. [[Lesbian pulp fiction]] became its own category of fiction&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, Katherine V. [[Katherine V. Forrest]], ''Lesbian Pulp Fiction: The Sexually Intrepid World of Lesbian Paperback Novels 1950-1965'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;, although a significant number of authors of this genre were men using either a male or female [[pen name]].&lt;ref&gt;Grier, Barbara (1973). ''The Lesbian in Literature''. [Naiad Press], 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[second-wave feminism|feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s]] saw a more accepted entry of lesbian-themed literature.

==Young adult==

Publication of lesbian fiction for teenagers and young adults started in the 1970s. [[Nancy Garden]]'s ''[[Annie on My Mind]]'' was one of the first [[young adult novels]] featuring love between two girls.  More recent authors who write about lesbian and [[bisexual]] teenagers include [[Sara Ryan]], [[Julie Anne Peters]], and [[Judy MacLean]]. This genre showed a notable increase in the 1990s, with the publication of novels by authors including [[Nancy Garden]], [[M.E. Kerr]], and [[Ellen Wittlinger]].

==Publishers==
An early publisher devoted to publishing lesbian and feminist books was [[Naiad Press]], which published the seminal lesbian romance novel ''Curious Wine'' by [[Katherine V. Forrest]]. The Press closed in 2003 after 31 years&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Vern L. (2003). ''Before Stonewall''. Haworth, 2003 (262).&lt;/ref&gt;. Other early publishers include [[Spinsters Ink]], [[Rising Tide]], [[Crossing Press]], [[Seal Press]] and [[New Victoria]]. In many cases, these presses were operated by authors who also published with the press, such as [[Barbara Wilson]] at [[Seal Press]] and [[Joan Drury]] at [[Spinsters Ink]].

The current largest publishers of lesbian fiction are [[Bella Books]] and [[Bold Strokes Books]]. [[Bella Books]], established in 2001, acquired the Naiad backlist, including the majority of works by [[Jane Rule]]. Their catalog includes 250 titles of lesbian romance, lesbian mystery and erotica. [[Bold Strokes Books]] publishes lesbian and gay male mystery, thrillers, sci-fi, adventure, and other [[LGBT]] genre books. Their catalog includes 130 titles. Smaller publishers of exclusively lesbian fiction include [[Blue Feather]], [[Bywater Books]], [[Intaglio Publications]], and [[PD Publishing]]. Some women's presses also produce lesbian fiction, such as [[Firebrand Books]] and [[Virago Press]]. A [http://www.wifp.org/DWM/publishers.html more complete list] of lesbian and women's publishers has been maintained by the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press since 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wifp.org/pcabout%20us.html Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press Philosophy and Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;.
