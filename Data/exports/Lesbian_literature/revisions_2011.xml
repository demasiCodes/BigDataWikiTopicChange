Novels that fall into this category may be of any genres, such as, but not limited to, [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], and [[Romance novel|romance]].

==History==
The first novel in the [[English language]] recognised as having a lesbian theme is [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' (1928), which a British court found obscene because it defended "unnatural practices between women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the [[United States]] ''The Well of Loneliness'' survived legal challenges in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the [[United States Customs Court|Customs Court]]. A deeper examination of many classic novels and texts reveals lesbian-focused characters.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Dr. Jeannette H. [[Jeannette Howard Foster]]. (1985). ''Sex Variant Women in Literature'', [[Naiad Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbian fiction saw a huge explosion in interest with the advent of the dime-store or [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] novel. [[Lesbian pulp fiction]] became its own distinct category of fiction,&lt;ref name="Grier, Barbara 1973"&gt;Grier, Barbara (1973). ''The Lesbian in Literature''. [Naiad Press], 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; although a significant number of authors of this genre were men using either a male or female [[pen name]].&lt;ref name="Grier, Barbara 1973"/&gt; The [[second-wave feminism|feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s]] saw a more accepted entry of lesbian-themed literature.

==Lesbian literature==

[[File:Godward-In the Days of Sappho-1904.jpg|thumb|[[Sappho]] of [[Lesbos]], depicted in an 1904 painting by [[John William Godward]] gave the term ''[[lesbian]]'' the connotation of erotic desire between women.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;"Lesbian", [http://dictionary.oed.com/ Oxford English Dictionary], Second Edition, 1989. Retrieved on January 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
Lesbian literature includes works by [[lesbian]] authors, as well as lesbian-themed works by heterosexual authors. Even works by lesbian writers that do not deal with lesbian themes are still often considered lesbian literature. Works by heterosexual writers which treat lesbian themes only in passing, on the other hand, are not often regarded as lesbian literature.

The fundamental work of lesbian literature is the poetry of [[Sappho of Lesbos]]. From various ancient writings, historians have gathered that a group of young women were left in Sappho's charge for their instruction or cultural edification.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeannette Howard Foster|Foster, Jeannette H.]] (1985). ''Sex Variant Women in Literature'', Naiad Press. ISBN 0-930044-65-7, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Not much of Sappho's poetry remains, but that which does demonstrates the topics she wrote about: women's daily lives, their relationships, and rituals. She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Robert, ed. (2006). ''Gay Life and Culture: A World History'', Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd. ISBN 0-7893-1511-4, p. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain works have established historical or artistic importance, and the world of lesbian fiction continues to grow and change as time goes on. Until recently, contemporary lesbian literature has been centered around several small, exclusively lesbian presses, as well as online fandoms. However since the new Millennium began, many lesbian presses have branched out to include the works of trans-men and -women, gay and bisexual voices, and other queer works not represented by the mainstream press.

Works of lesbian literature are sometimes difficult to find if they are not published by small lesbian presses. There has always been a general lack of promotion of lesbian themes by mainstream publishers, and the small presses lack the funding to get the word out. An exhaustive list of works cannot be provided here, but key works in different genres are listed.

===1970s===
In ''Ruby'' (1976) by [[Rosa Guy]], the main character is a girl from the West Indies. The novel tells the story of her relationship with another girl. Other young adult novels with lesbian characters and themes that were published during this time include [[Sandra Scoppettone]]'s ''[[Happy Endings Are All Alike]]'' (1978). According to the author, it "barely got reviewed and when it did it wasn't good," unlike Scoppettone's novel about gay boys, which was better received.&lt;ref name="EH"&gt;{{cite news

Frequent themes in books published during the 1970s are that homosexuality is a "phase," or that there are no "happy endings" for gay people, and that they generally lead a difficult life.&lt;ref name="some"&gt;{{cite web

The School Library Journal reported,

{{cquote|Throughout the 1970s, there was, on average, a single young adult title per year dealing with gay issues. Although many of these early books were well written — and well reviewed — gay characters were at best a sidekick or foil for the straight protagonist and at worst a victim who would face violence, injury, or death (fatal traffic accidents were commonplace). Young protagonists who worried that they might be gay would invariably conclude that their same-sex attraction was simply a temporary stage in the journey toward heterosexual adulthood.&lt;ref name="SLJ"/&gt;|}}

[[Judy Blume]] has been cited as a catalyst in the 1970s for an increase in inclusion of "taboo" topics in children's literature, which include homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Tacoma"&gt;{{cite news

===1980s===

[[Nancy Garden]]'s ''[[Annie on My Mind]]'', published in 1982, tells the story of two high school girls who fall in love. The novel, which has never been out of print, was a step forward for homosexuality in young adult literature.&lt;ref name="SLJ"&gt;{{cite news

===1990s===
During this decade the number of lesbian-themed young adult novels published rose. Nancy Garden published two novels with lesbian protagonists, ''Lark in the Morning'' (1991) and ''Good Moon Rising'', and received positive sales and reviews. In 1994, [[M.E. Kerr]] published ''Deliver Us From Evie'', about a boy with a lesbian sister, which was well received by the public.&lt;ref name="AfterEllen2"/&gt; Other books published during this decade include ''Dive'' by Stacey Donovan (1996), ''The Necessary Hunger'' (1997) by Nina Revoyr, ''The House You Pass On the Way'' (1997) by Jacqueline Woodson, ''Girl Walking Backwards'' (1998) by Bett Williams, who intended the novel for an adult audience though it was popular among teens,&lt;ref name="AfterEllen2"/&gt; ''Hard Love'' by Ellen Wittlinger (1999), and ''Dare Truth or Promise'' (1999) by Paula Boock.

===2000s===

The 1990s represented a turning point for young adult novels that explored lesbian issues, and since 2000, a flood of such books has reached the market.&lt;ref name="AfterEllen2"&gt;{{cite news

In the past, most books portrayed gay people as "living isolated lives, out of context with the reality of an amazingly active community."&lt;ref name="some"/&gt; Today books have progressed, with gay characters not as stigmatized and separate.

There are fewer books about female homosexuality than male homosexuality,&lt;ref name="libraryhandbook"&gt;{{cite book

==Publishers==
The first lesbian publisher devoted to publishing lesbian and feminist books was [[Naiad Press]], which published the seminal lesbian romance novel ''Curious Wine'' by [[Katherine V. Forrest]] and many other books. The press closed in 2003 after 31 years.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Vern L. (2003). ''Before Stonewall''. Haworth, 2003 (262).&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founder [[Barbara Grier]] handed off her books and operation to a newly established press, [[Bella Books]] which is still going strong today. Other early publishers include [[Spinsters Ink]], [[Rising Tide]], [[Crossing Press]], [[Seal Press]] and [[New Victoria]]. In many cases, these presses were operated by authors who also published with the press, such as [[Barbara Wilson]] at [[Seal Press]] which became part of the mainstream company, Avalon, and [[Joan Drury]] at [[Spinsters Ink]], which has been sold a couple of times and now is part of the [[Bella Books]] organization.

The current largest publishers of lesbian fiction are [[Bella Books]], [[Bold Strokes Books]], and [[Regal Crest Enterprises]]. [[Bella Books]], established in 2001, acquired the Naiad backlist, including the majority of works by [[Jane Rule]] and all the works of [[Karin Kallmaker]]. Their catalog includes over 300 titles of lesbian romance, lesbian mystery, and erotica. [[Bold Strokes Books]] established in 2005, publishes lesbian and gay male mystery, thrillers, sci-fi, adventure, and other [[LGBT]] genre books. Their catalog includes 130 titles. [[Regal Crest Enterprises]], established in 1999, has a catalog currently exceeding 100 works, and they publish lesbian romance, lesbian mystery, some erotica, sci-fi, fantasy, and sagas. 

Smaller publishers of exclusively lesbian fiction include [[Blue Feather]], [[Bywater Books]], [[Intaglio Publications]], [[Colbere Publishing]] and [[PD Publishing]]. Some women's presses also produce lesbian fiction, such as [[Firebrand Books]] and [[Virago Press]].
