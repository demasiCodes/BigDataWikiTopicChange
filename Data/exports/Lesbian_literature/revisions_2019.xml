'''Lesbian literature''' is a subgenre of [[literature]] addressing [[lesbian]] themes. It includes poetry, plays, '''fiction''' addressing lesbian characters, and '''non-fiction''' about lesbian-interest topics.

Fiction that falls into this category may be of any genre, such as [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], and [[Romance novel|romance]].

==Overview==
{{main|List of lesbian periodicals in the United States}}

Lesbian literature includes works by lesbian authors, as well as lesbian-themed works by heterosexual authors. Even works by lesbian writers that do not deal with lesbian themes are still often considered lesbian literature. Works by heterosexual writers which treat lesbian themes only in passing, on the other hand, are not often regarded as lesbian literature. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The fundamental work of lesbian literature is the poetry of [[Sappho of Lesbos]]. From various ancient writings, historians have gathered that a group of young women were left in Sappho's charge for their instruction or cultural edification.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeannette Howard Foster|Foster, Jeannette H.]] (1985). ''Sex Variant Women in Literature'', Naiad Press. {{ISBN|0-930044-65-7}}, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Not much of Sappho's poetry remains, but that which does demonstrates the topics she wrote about: women's daily lives, their relationships, and rituals. She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Robert, ed. (2006). ''Gay Life and Culture: A World History'', Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7893-1511-4}}, p. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain works have established historical or artistic importance, and the world of lesbian fiction continues to grow and change as time goes on. Until recently, contemporary lesbian literature has been centered around several small, exclusively lesbian presses, as well as online fandoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seajay|first=Carol|date=December 1994|title=The Backlash and Backlist|journal=The Women's Review of Books|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the new millennium began, many lesbian presses have branched out to include the works of trans men and women, gay and bisexual voices, and other queer works not represented by the mainstream press.  Additionally, novels with lesbian themes and characters have become more accepted in mainstream publishing.  {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Early literature==
===Medieval Christian mysticism===
The European [[Middle Ages]] lacked a specific term for lesbians, but medieval French texts, under the influence of the [[Arabic literature]] of the period, featured literary depictions of love and sexual desire between women. Such expressions are found in devotional texts to the [[Virgin Mary]] or the [[hagiography]] of [[Ida of Louvain|Ida Louvain]], by [[Beguines]], or the writings of female [[Christian mystic]]s, including [[Hildegarde of Bingen]], [[Hadewijch]], [[Margery Kempe]], [[Mechtild of Magdeburg]], and [[Marguerite Porete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amer|first1=Sahar|title=Crossing Borders: Love Between Women in Medieval French and Arabic Literatures|date=2008|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|pages=9–11|edition=1st|chapter=1.

===Nineteenth century: forerunners===
[[File:Anne Lister.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Diarist [[Anne Lister]]]]

In the early nineteenth century, Chinese poet [[Wu Tsao]] gained popularity for her lesbian love poems.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Miller, Historical Dictionary of Lesbian Literature, Scarecrow Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Her songs, according to poet [[Kenneth Rexroth]], were "sung all over China".&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Rexroth, Women Poets of China,  New Directions Publishing, 1972, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Though lesbian literature had not yet evolved as a distinct genre in English in the 19th century, lesbian writers like the essayist and supernatural fiction writer [[Vernon Lee]] sometimes hinted at lesbian subtexts in their work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/violet-paget/|title=Violet Paget Archives – The Paris Review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, like Lee's lover [[Amy Levy]], wrote love poems to women using the voice of a heterosexual man.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Hetherington, Nadia Valman, Amy Levy: Critical Essays Ohio University Press, Apr 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Others wrote, but kept their writing secret. Beginning in 1806, English landowner and mountaineer [[Anne Lister]] kept extensive diaries for thirty four years which included details of her lesbian relationships and seductions, with the lesbian sections written in secret [[code]]. The diaries were not published until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=BBCBradford&gt;{{Citation  | title = The life and loves of Shibden Hall's Anne Lister  | work = [[BBC News]]  | publisher = BBC  | date = 25 May 2010 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bradford/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8388000/8388858.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, they were the basis for a [[BBC Television|BBC television]] production, ''[[The Secret Diaries of Miss Anne Lister]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/11_november/11/lister.shtml |title=BBC Two announces brand new drama: The Secret Diaries Of Miss Anne Lister |date=11 November 2009 |work=BBC Press Office |publisher=BBC |accessdate=1 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-first century writer and editor Susan Koppelman compiled an anthology titled ''Two Friends and Other 19th-century American Lesbian Stories: by American Women Writers'',&lt;ref name=Koppelman&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Koppelman|editor1-first=Susan H.|title=Two Friends and Other 19th-century American Lesbian Stories: by American Women Writers|date=1994|edition=1st|publisher=Meridian Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0452011199|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452011199}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes stories by [[Constance Fenimore Woolson]], [[Octave Thanet]], [[Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman]], [[Kate Chopin]] and [[Sarah Orne Jewett]] that were originally published in periodicals of their time. Of these stories, which range "from the explicit to inferentially lesbian", Koppelman said, "I recognize these stories as stories about women loving women in the variety of romantic ways that we wouldn't even have to struggle to define if we were talking about men and women loving each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Friends and Other 19th-Century American Lesbian Stories: By American Women Writers|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-452-01119-9|website=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=August 1, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, scholars of lesbian literature have analyzed as lesbian relationships that would not have been labeled as such in the nineteenth century due to different conceptions of intimacy and sexuality. For example, [[Christina Rossetti]]'s 1862 poem "[[Goblin Market]]" has been widely read as a narrative of lesbianism even though it attempts to paint itself as a narrative of sisterly love.&lt;ref name="Lesbianism 2003"&gt;The Literature of Lesbianism: A Historical Anthology from Ariosto to Stonewall. Ed. Terry Castle. New York: Columbia University Press 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have also seen lesbian potential in characters such as Marian Halcombe in [[Wilkie Collins]]'s 1859 novel ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]''. Marian is described as masculine and unattractive, and her motivation throughout the story is her love for her half-sister, Laura Fairlie.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Tamar. ''Dead Secrets: Wilkie Collins and the Female Gothic''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, scholars have engaged in queer readings of the novels of [[Charlotte Brontë]], particularly ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]'' and ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'', in which the female main characters engage in close or even obsessive relationships with other women. Some have even speculated that Brontë herself may have been in love with her friend Ellen Nussey; [[Vita Sackville-West]] called the letters between the two “love letters pure and simple.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.out.com/art-books/2015/6/16/was-charlotte-bronte-gay&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have similarly speculated on whether the nineteenth-century poet [[Emily Dickinson]] might have been in love with her sister-in-law, Susan Gilbert, a possibility that encourages queer readings of Dickinson's many love poems.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Janet. "The American Sappho: In Pursuit of a Lesbian Emily Dickinson". ''Harrington Lesbian Fiction Quarterly'', 3(3), Sept. 2002, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Field (author)|Michael Field]] was the pseudonym used by two British women, Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper, who wrote poetry and [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse-dramas]] together. Bradley was Cooper's aunt, and the two lived together as lovers from the 1870s to their deaths in 1913 and 1914. Their poetry often took their love as its subject, and they also wrote a book of poems for their dog, Whym Chow.&lt;ref&gt;Donoghue, Emma. We Are Michael Field. Bello 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carmilla.jpg|thumb|An illustration from "Carmilla," by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]]
Certain canonical male authors of the nineteenth century also incorporated lesbian themes into their work. At the beginning of the century, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] published his unfinished narrative poem “[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]].” Scholars have interpreted the interactions in this poem between the titular character and a stranger named Geraldine as having lesbian implications.&lt;ref&gt;Grossberg, Benjamin Scott. “Making Christabel: Sexual Transgression and Its Implication in Coleridge's 'Christabel.'” Journal of Homosexuality 41(2), 145-165. 10 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] became known for subject matter that was considered scandalous, including lesbianism and [[sadomasochism]]. In 1866, he published ''Poems and Ballads'', which contained the poems “[[Anactoria]]” and “Sapphics” concerning [[Sappho]] of Lesbos and dealing explicitly with lesbian content.&lt;ref name="Lesbianism 2003"/&gt; Finally, [[Henry James]] portrayed a [[Boston marriage]], considered an early form of lesbian relationship, between the feminist characters Olive Chancellor and Verena Tarrant in his 1886 novel ''[[The Bostonians]]''.&lt;ref name="Lesbianism 2003"/&gt;

One of the more explicitly lesbian works of the nineteenth century is the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] [[novella]] “[[Carmilla]],” by [[Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]], first published in serial form in 1871-72. Considered a precursor to and an inspiration for [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', “Carmilla” tells the story of the relationship between the innocent Laura and the vampire Carmilla, whose sucking of Laura's blood is clearly linked to an erotic attraction to Laura. This story has inspired many other works that take advantage of the trope of the lesbian vampire.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, David J.

Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was also adapted into a YouTube webseries of the same name beginning in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, Dean.

The first novel in the [[English language]] recognised as having a lesbian theme is ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' (1928) by [[Radclyffe Hall]], which a British court found obscene because it defended "unnatural practices between women". The book was banned in Britain for decades; this is in the context of the similar censorship of ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'', which also had a theme of transgressive [[female sexuality]], albeit heterosexual. In the United States, ''The Well of Loneliness'' survived legal challenges in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the [[United States Customs Court|U.S. Customs Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=David|title=Lesbian novel was 'danger to nation'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/02/books.gayrights|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=January 1, 2005|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Machlin|first1=Sherri|title=Banned Books Week: The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall|url=https://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/09/26/banned-books-week-well-loneliness|website=[[New York Public Library]]|date=September 26, 2013|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, an increasingly visible [[LGBT culture in Paris#French Revolution to World War II|lesbian community in Paris]] which centered on literary salons hosted by French lesbians as well as expatriates like [[Nathalie Barney]] and [[Gertrude Stein]], who produced lesbian-themed works in French and English, including ''[[Nightwood]]'' by [[Djuna Barnes]],  ''Idyll Saphique'' by [[Liane de Pougy]], poetry by [[Renee Vivien]],  Barney's own [[epigrams]], poetry, and several works by Stein.  [[Radclyffe Hall]] also spent time in Paris at Barney's salon and modeled one of her characters in ''The Well of Loneliness'' after her.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole G Albert, "De la topographie invisible à l'espace public et littéraire :les lieux de plaisir lesbien dans le Paris de la Belle Époque".&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese writer [[Nobuko Yoshiya]] was an important early 20th century author of stories about intense romance between young women, though her writing was accepted in mainstream culture because none of the relationships were consummated.&lt;ref name="Early Fiction"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suzuki|first= Michiko|date=August 2006|title =Writing Same-Sex Love: Sexology and Literary Representation in Yoshiya Nobuko's Early Fiction|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=65|issue=3|url= http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=419D6C9B25191554B1DBD61007F71527.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=857000|doi =10.1017/S0021911806001148|page=575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virginia Woolf]]'s 1928 novel of a high-spirited gender-bending poet who lives for centuries, ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'', which was said to be based on her lover, [[Vita Sackville-West]], was re-examined in the 1970s as a 'subversive' lesbian text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/10/11/virginia-woolf-orlando-lesbian-readings/|title=How Virginia Woolf's Orlando Subverted Censorship and Revolutionized the Politics of LGBT Love in 1928|first=Maria|last=Popova|date=11 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eileen Barrett, ''Virginia Woolf: Lesbian Readings'', NYU Press, Jul 1, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950 to 1970: Pulp fiction and beyond===

[[File:Cover of Spring Fire - Vin Packer Marijane Meaker 1952.jpg|thumb|150px|Lesbian Pulp Fiction, like  ''Spring Fire'' by Vin Packer (Marijane Meaker 1952) was popular during the 50s and 60s.]]

Lesbian fiction in English saw a huge explosion in interest with the advent of the dime-store or [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] novel. [[Lesbian pulp fiction]] became its own distinct category of fiction in the 1950s and 60s,&lt;ref name="Grier, Barbara 1973"&gt;Grier, Barbara (1973). ''The Lesbian in Literature''. [Naiad Press], 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; although a significant number of authors of this genre were men using either a male or female [[pen name]].&lt;ref name="Grier, Barbara 1973"/&gt; [[Tereska Torrès]] is credited with writing the first Lesbian pulp novel, ''[[Lesbian pulp fiction#Women's Barracks|Women's Barracks]]'', a fictionalized story about women in the [[Free France|Free French Forces]] during World War II. The 1950 book sold two million copies in the first five years.&lt;ref name="Smallwood"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Smallwood|first=Christine|title=Sapphic soldiers|url=https://www.salon.com/2005/08/09/torres_3/|website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=August 9, 2005|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable female author of lesbian pulp fiction, who came out later in life as a lesbian, was [[Ann Bannon]], who created the [[Beebo Brinker]] series.

''[[The Price of Salt]]'' by [[Patricia Highsmith]], considered the first lesbian novel with a happy ending,{{efn|[[Marijane Meaker]] stated in her 2003 [[memoir]]: "[''The Price of Salt'' ] was for many years the only lesbian novel, in either hard or soft cover, with a happy ending."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meaker|first1=Marijane|title=Highsmith: A Romance of the 1950s|date=2003|publisher=[[Cleis Press]]|edition=1st|chapter=One|page=1|isbn=1573441716}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} was groundbreaking for being the first where neither of the two women has a nervous breakdown, dies tragically, faces a lonely and desolate future, commits suicide, or returns to being with a male. The [[manuscript]] was rejected by Highsmith's publisher [[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Brothers]] and published in [[hardcover]] by [[Coward-McCann]] in 1952 under the pseudonym "Claire Morgan", followed by the [[Bantam Books]] lesbian pulp fiction [[paperback]] in 1953.

In the 1950s, parts of French author [[Violette Leduc|Violette leDuc]]'s novel ''Ravages'' were censored because they contained explicit lesbian passages.  The deleted passages were published in the 1960s as ''Therese and Isabelle'' and made into the 1968 film of same title.&lt;ref&gt;Stockinger, Jacob (4 February 2006).

[[Jane Rule]]'s ''[[Desert of the Heart]]'' was able to break out of the pulp fiction category when it was published as a hardback by [[Macmillan of Canada|Macmillan Canada]] in 1964. Several publishers turned it down beforehand however, with one telling Rule, "If this book isn't pornographic, what's the point of printing it? ... if you can write in the dirty parts we'll take it but otherwise no".&lt;ref name="hannon"&gt;Hannon, Gerald. {{cite web|url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=1&amp;STORY_ID=3980&amp;PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=1|title=Jane Rule: The woman behind Lesbian Images.}} Xtra.ca (Toronto). Retrieved November 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was loosely adapted into the 1985 film ''[[Desert Hearts]]''.

When publishing her novel ''Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing'' in 1965, the novelist [[May Sarton]] feared that writing openly about lesbianism would lead to a diminution of the previously established value of her work. "The fear of homosexuality is so great that it took courage to write ''Mrs. Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing,''" she said, "to write a novel about a woman homosexual who is not a sex maniac, a drunkard, a drug-taker, or in any way repulsive, to portray a homosexual who is neither pitiable nor disgusting, without sentimentality ..."&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of a Solitude'', 1973, pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first English contemporary novelist to come out as a lesbian was [[Maureen Duffy]], whose 1966 book ''Microcosm'' explored the subcultures of lesbian bars.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/08/gayrights.gender|title=A literature of our own|first=Julie|last=Bindel|date=7 August 2008|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970 to present: Second wave feminism, mainstream acceptance, and diversification===
[[File:Audre Lorde.jpg|150px|thumb|Lesbian feminist and [[womanist]] [[Audre Lorde]] wrote several books from the 1970s to the 1990s.]]

The [[second-wave feminism|feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s]] saw the development of a more politicized voice in lesbian literature and more mainstream acceptance of lesbian-themed literature that moved away from the 'tragic lesbian' theme that had dominated earlier works.  A pioneering autobiographical novel of this era was the [[picaresque]] 1973 novel ''[[Rubyfruit Jungle]]''  by [[Rita Mae Brown]], which became a national best-seller.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Emery, The Lesbian Index: Pragmatism and Lesbian Subjectivity in the Twentieth-Century United States,  SUNY Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ep6pDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=rubyfruit%20jungle&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=rubyfruit%20jungle|title=A Study Guide for Rita Mae Brown's "Ruby Fruit Jungle"|date=12 July 2016|publisher=Gale Cengage Learning|isbn=9781410357069}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jill Johnston]] argued for [[lesbian separatism]] in her 1973 book ''[[Lesbian Nation]]''. In the 1970s, more voices of American lesbians of color began to be heard, including works by [[Audre Lorde]], [[Jewelle Gomez]], [[Paula Gunn Allen]] [[Cherrie Moraga]], and [[Gloria Anzaldua]].  In France, [[Monique Wittig]] published ''[[Les Guérillères]]'', (The Women Warriors),  which envisioned a lesbian-dominated world. Similarly, [[Joanna Russ]]'s 1975 novel ''[[The Female Man]]'' contains an alternative universe inhabited solely by lesbians. The 1970s also saw the advent of feminist and [[LGBT]] publishing houses, such as [[Naiad Press]], and literary magazines like ''[[Sinister Wisdom]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmhFCQAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary LGBTQ Literature of the United States|last=Nelson|first=Emmanuel S.|date=2009-07-14|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313348600|page=203|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Conditions (magazine)|Conditions]]''&lt;ref name="Busia, Abena P.

[[Adrienne Rich]] and [[Judy Grahn]] were important poets and essayists of the era. ''[[Patience and Sarah]]'' by [[Alma Routsong]], published under the [[pen name]] "Isabel Miller" in 1971, examined the historical confines of a romance between two 19th century women in a [[Boston marriage|Boston Marriage.]]

After the birth of an explicitly gay and lesbian literature in the 1970s, the following decades saw a tremendous rise in its production. While [[Gay literature|gay male novels]] had more cross-over appeal and often became mid-list sellers in mainstream publishing houses, lesbian literature, depending on smaller presses, developed smaller but 'respectable' audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Herring, The Cambridge Companion to American Gay and Lesbian Literature,  Cambridge University Press, May 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s, with the advent of [[sex-positive feminism]], a few lesbian literary magazines began to specialize in more explicitly erotic work, such as ''[[On Our Backs]]'', a satirical reference to the feminist 1970s magazine, ''[[Off Our Backs]]''.&lt;ref name=sides&gt;Josh Sides, "Erotic City: Sexual Revolutions and the Making of Modern San Francisco", Oxford University Press US, 2009, {{ISBN|0-19-537781-8}}, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; The 1988 founding of the [[Lambda Literary Award]], with several lesbian categories, helped increase the visibility of LGBT literature.&lt;ref name="Lambda"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewey|first=Charlsie|title=Lambda Literary Foundation marks 25 years of LGBT writers|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Lambda-Literary-Foundation-marks-25-years-of-LGBT-writers/42961.html|work=[[Windy City Times]] |date=May 28, 2013|accessdate=February 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alison Bechdel at Politics and Prose.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Alison Bechdel]], who has been praised for her cartoons and [[Graphic novel|graphic memoir]], ''[[Fun Home]]'', exemplifies the increasing diversification of lesbian literature in the 21st century.]]

In the 80s and 90s, lesbian literature diversified into genre literature, including fantasy, mystery, science fiction, romance, graphic novels, and young adult.&lt;ref&gt;George Haggerty, Bonnie Zimmerman Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures, Taylor &amp; Francis, Sep 2, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of late twentieth century feminism and greater acceptance of LGBT work was also felt in Mexico, with the emergence of lesbian poets [[Nancy Cardenas]], Magaly Alabau, Mercedes Roffe, and others. In Argentina and Uruguay, [[Alejandra Pizarnik]] and [[Cristina Peri Rossi]] combined lesbian eroticism with artistic and sociopolitical concerns in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Zimmerman, Encyclopedia of Lesbian Histories and Cultures,  Routledge, Aug 21, 2013, p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cristina Peri.jpg|150px|thumb|Uruguayan writer [[Cristina Peri Rossi]] has written about the eroticism of lesbian relationships.]]

In Asia, Singaporean playwright [[Eleanor Wong (playwright)|Eleanor Wong]] and Taiwanese writer [[Qiu Miaojin]] have written about lesbian relationships, as have Chinese writers [[Lin Bai]] and [[Chen Ran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leng Lin Leung Ping-kwan |url=http://contemporary_chinese_culture.academic.ru/425/lesbianism_in_literature |title=lesbianism in literature |publisher=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Chinese Culture |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spinning Tropics'' by Aska Mochizuki, ''Beauty and Sadness'' by [[Yasunari Kawabata]], ''Quicksand'' (卍 Manji) by [[Junichiro Tanizaki]] and ''Real World'' by [[Natsuo Kirino]] are all novels that explore lesbian love in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fuckyeahlesbianliterature.tumblr.com/post/102813834509/japanese-lesbian-literature-recommendations|title=(Japanese) Lesbian Literature Recommendations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian novelist [[Abha Dawesar]]'s 2006 ''Babyji'' won a [[Stonewall Award]] and the [[Lambda Award]].

In the 21st century, lesbian literature has emerged as a genre in Arabic speaking countries, with some novels, like ''Ana Hiya Anti'' (I Am You) by Elham Mansour, achieving best-seller status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Samir Habib |url=https://www.brunel.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/185872/ET53HabibEd.pdf |title=The Historical Context and Reception of the First Arabic-Lesbian Novel, I Am You, by Elham Mansour |publisher=Brunel University London |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Iman Al-Ghafari |url=http://alraidajournal.com/index.php/ALRJ/article/viewFile/89/88 |title=The Lesbian Subjectivity in Contemporary Arabic Literature: 'An Absent Presence' Disciplined by the Gaze |publisher=Al-raida; Issue 138-139-140 |date=2012–2013 |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jolanda Guardi, Female Homosexuality in Contemporary Arabic Literature in DEP, 2014, 25, Special Issue "Queerness in the Middle East and South Asia, guest editor, pp. 17-30&lt;/ref&gt; This century has also brought more attention to African literary works and authors, such as Cameroonian novelist [[Frieda Ekotto]] and Ghanaian writer [[Ama Ata Aidoo|Ama Ata Aido]].&lt;ref name=Diabate&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diabate|first1=Naminata|last2=Ekotto |first2=Frieda|title=From Women Loving Women in Africa to Jean Genet and Race: A Conversation with Frieda Ekotto|journal=Journal of the African Literature Association|year=2010|volume=4|issue=1|pages=181–202|url=https://www.academia.edu/1042121/From_Women_Loving_Women_in_Africa_to_Jean_Genet_and_Race_A_Conversation_with_Frieda_Ekotto|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genderacrossborders.com/2012/04/06/a-look-at-lgbt-literature-in-sub-saharan-africa/|title=A Look at LGBT Literature in sub-Saharan Africa|date=6 April 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, English-language novels which include lesbian characters or relationships have continued to garner national awards and mainstream critical acclaim, like ''[[The Color Purple]]'' (1982) by [[Alice Walker]], ''[[Bastard out of Carolina]]'' (1992) by [[Dorothy Allison]], ''[[The Hours (novel)|The Hours]]'' (1998) by [[Michael Cunningham]], ''[[Fingersmith (novel)|Fingersmith]]'' (2002) by [[Sarah Waters]] and ''Lost and Found'' (2006) by [[Carolyn Parkhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parkhurst|first=Carolyn|title=Lost and Found|url=https://archive.org/details/lostfound00park|url-access=registration|publisher=[[Back Bay Books]]|year= 2007|ISBN= 978-0-316-06639-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage|first=Guy|title=Carolyn Parkhurst: ''Lost and Found''|url= http://mostlyfiction.com/humor/parkhurst.htm|website=MostlyFiction Book Reviews|date=September 30, 2006|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As literature including lesbian characters and relationships has become more accepted in mainstream Western society, some writers and literary critics have questioned why there needs to be a separate category for lesbian literature at all. "I've never understood why straight fiction is supposed to be for everyone, but anything with a gay character or that includes gay experience is only for queers," said [[Jeanette Winterson]], author of the best-selling 1985 novel ''[[Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit]].''&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|last=Winterson|first=Jeanette|title=Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit|url=http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=50|website=jeanettewinterson.com|date=March 21, 1985|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have stressed the continuing need for LGBT-themed literature, especially for younger LGBT readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/aasl/sites/ala.org.aasl/files/content/aaslpubsandjournals/slr/vol16/SLR_LGBTQThemedLiteratureforTeens_V16.pdf|issn=2165-1019 |title=(Volume 16, 2013) Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning (LGBTQ)-Themed Literature for Teens: Are School Libraries Providing Adequate Collections? |publisher=American Library Association |date=August 24, 2012 |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Young adult fiction==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:YA lesbian novels - book spines.jpg|thumb|250px|]] --&gt;

===1970s===

In ''Ruby'' (1976) by [[Rosa Guy]], the main character is a girl from the West Indies. The novel tells the story of her relationship with another girl. Other young adult novels with lesbian characters and themes that were published during this time include ''Happy Endings Are All Alike'' (1978) by [[Sandra Scoppettone]]. According to the author, it "barely got reviewed and when it did it wasn't good", unlike Scoppettone's novel about gay boys, which was better received.&lt;ref name="EH"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=Ellen|title=ELLEN INTERVIEWS SANDRA SCOPPETTONE|url=http://www.ellenhart.com/int_scop.html|website=EllenHart.com|accessdate=June 24, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610091409/http://www.ellenhart.com/int_scop.html|archivedate=2007-06-10|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequent themes in books published during the 1970s are that homosexuality is a "phase", or that there are no "happy endings" for gay people, and that they generally lead a difficult life.&lt;ref name="targeted"&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Julia|title ='Targeted' young adult fiction: the need for literature speaking to gay/lesbian and African-American youth|url=http://www.crowbold.com/homepage/topic5.htm|website=crowbold.com|accessdate=March 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JudyBlume2009(cropped).jpg|180px|thumb|[[Judy Blume]] has been cited as a catalyst for the inclusion of 'taboo' subjects, including homosexuality, in children's and YA books.]]

The School Library Journal reported:
{{Quote|Throughout the 1970s, there was, on average, a single young adult title per year dealing with gay issues. Although many of these early books were well written—and well reviewed—gay characters were at best a sidekick or foil for the straight protagonist and at worst a victim who would face violence, injury, or death (fatal traffic accidents were commonplace). Young protagonists who worried that they might be gay would invariably conclude that their same-sex attraction was simply a temporary stage in the journey toward heterosexual adulthood.&lt;ref name="SLJ"/&gt;}}

[[Judy Blume]] has been cited as a catalyst in the 1970s for an increase in inclusion of "taboo" topics in children's literature, which include homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Tacoma"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodnow|first=Cecelia|title=Tacoma writer's gay-theme teen novel offers insights to young adults|url=http://www.brenthartinger.com/pi.html|date=April 7, 2003|accessdate=February 25, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707032318/http://www.brenthartinger.com/pi.html|archivedate=July 7, 2007|url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===

''[[Annie on My Mind]]'' (1982) by [[Nancy Garden]] tells the story of two high school girls who fall in love. The novel, which has never been out of print, was a step forward for homosexuality in young adult literature.&lt;ref name="SLJ"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins |first=Christine A. |title=Annie on Her Mind: Edwards Award–winner Nancy Garden's groundbreaking novel continues to make a compelling case for sexual tolerance |url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleid=CA300723 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023174349/http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleid=CA300723 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 23, 2007 |publisher=[[School Library Journal]] |date=June 1, 2003 |accessdate=February 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in hardback and by a major press. In the book, homosexuality is seen as something permanent and to be explored, not "fixed."&lt;ref name="targeted"/&gt;

In [[Kansas]], a minister led a public burning of ''Annie on My Mind'' following a controversy after it was donated to a school library.&lt;ref name="NCAC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Books in Trouble: Annie on My Mind |url=http://www.ncac.org/literature/related/19960501~USA~Books_in_Trouble_2.cfm |publisher=National Coalition Against Censorship |date=May 1996 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118083427/http://www.ncac.org/literature/related/19960501~USA~Books_in_Trouble_2.cfm |archivedate=2010-11-18 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===

During this decade the number of lesbian-themed young adult novels published rose. [[Nancy Garden]] published two novels with lesbian protagonists, ''Lark in the Morning'' (1991) and ''Good Moon Rising'', and received positive sales and reviews. In 1994, [[M.E. Kerr]] published ''Deliver Us From Evie'', about a boy with a lesbian sister, which was well received by the public. Other books published during this decade include ''Dive'' (1996) by Stacey Donovan, ''The Necessary Hunger'' (1997) by [[Nina Revoyr]], ''The House You Pass On the Way'' (1997) by [[Jacqueline Woodson]], ''Girl Walking Backwards'' (1998) by Bett Williams (who intended the novel for an adult audience though it was popular among teens), ''Hard Love'' (1999) by [[Ellen Wittlinger]] and ''Dare Truth or Promise'' (1999) by [[Paula Boock]].

===2000s===

The 1990s represented a turning point for young adult novels that explored lesbian issues, and since 2000, a flood of such books has reached the market. The public attitude towards lesbian themes in young adult literature has grown more accepting.

In 2000, the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' included ''Annie on My Mind'' in its list of the top 100 most influential books of the century.&lt;ref name="SLJ 100"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff |title=One Hundred Books that Shaped the Century |url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleId=CA153035 |publisher=[[School Library Journal]] |date=January 1, 2000 |accessdate=February 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023174338/http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleId=CA153035 |archivedate=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, most books portrayed gay people as "living isolated lives, out of context with the reality of an amazingly active community."&lt;ref name="targeted"/&gt; Today, books also show gay characters not as stigmatized and separate.

A popular young adult novel of 2012, ''[[The Miseducation of Cameron Post]]'' by [[Emily M. Danforth]], tells the story of a 12-year-old girl who is sent to a [[de-gaying]] camp in [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/02/the_miseducation_of_cameron_post_by_emily_danforth_a_conversation_between_the_writer_and_novelist_curtis_sittenfeld_.single.html|title=The Best Novel About a "De-Gaying Camp" Ever Written|first=Curtis|last=Sittenfeld|date=8 February 2012|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[principal photography]] began on a [[The Miseducation of Cameron Post (film)|film adaptation]].

There are fewer books about female homosexuality than male homosexuality,&lt;ref name="libraryhandbook"&gt;{{citebook|last1=Woolls|first1=Blanche|last2=Loertsche|first2=David V.|title=The Whole School Library Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0838908837&amp;id=ZcjyWHAHuRMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA110&amp;lpg=RA1-PA110&amp;dq=%22gay+young+adult+fiction%22%7C%22books+for+gay+teenagers%22|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|date=2005|pages=109–112|isbn = 0-8389-0883-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even fewer books on bisexuality are published. Despite the fact that availability of books with teen lesbian and bisexual themes has increased since the 1960s, books with non-white characters are still difficult to find.&lt;ref name="targeted"/&gt;

==Publishers==
[[File:Elizabeth Sims writing 2013 photo by Tom Bender.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Alyson Books]] published a lesbian detective series by [[Elizabeth Sims]], pictured here.]]

The first lesbian publisher devoted to publishing lesbian and feminist books was [[June Arnold|Daughters, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daughters, Inc.|url=http://www.lesbianpoetryarchive.org/node/133|website=Lesbian Poetry Archive|date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Plainfield, Vermont]], which published ''Rubyfruit Jungle'' by Rita Mae Brown in 1973. [[Naiad Press]], followed, which published the seminal lesbian romance novel ''Curious Wine'' by [[Katherine V. Forrest]] and many other books. The press closed in 2003 after 31 years.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Vern L. (2003). ''Before Stonewall''. Haworth, 2003 (262).&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founder [[Barbara Grier]] handed off her books and operation to a newly established press, [[Bella Books]]. Established in 2001, Bella Books acquired the Naiad Press backlist, including the majority of works by [[Jane Rule]] and all the works of [[Karin Kallmaker]]. Their catalog includes over 300 titles of lesbian romance, lesbian mystery and erotica.

Other early publishers include [[Spinsters Ink]] (which has been sold a couple of times and now is part of the Bella Books organization), [[Rising Tide Press]], [[Crossing Press]], [[Onlywomen Press]], [[Kitchen Table Press]], and [[New Victoria]]. In many cases, these presses were operated by authors who also published with the publication house, such as [[Barbara Wilson (writer)|Barbara Wilson]] at [[Seal Press]], which became part of the mainstream company [[Perseus Books Group|Avalon Publishing]], and [[Joan Drury]] at Spinsters Ink.

The current largest publishers of lesbian fiction are Bella Books, [[Bold Strokes Books]], and [[Regal Crest Enterprises]]. Bold Strokes Books, established in 2005, publishes lesbian and gay male mystery, thrillers, sci-fi, adventure, and other LGBT genre books. Their catalog includes 130 titles. Regal Crest Enterprises, established in 1999, has a catalog currently exceeding 150 works and they publish lesbian romance, lesbian mystery, some erotica, sci-fi, fantasy, and sagas. [[Alyson Books]] specializes in LGBT authors and has a number of lesbian titles.
 
Smaller publishers of exclusively lesbian fiction include [[Bedazzled Ink]], [[Bywater Books]], [[Intaglio Publications]], [[Sapphire Books Publishing]], [[Supposed Crimes]], [[Wicked Publishing]], and [[Ylva Publishing]]. Some women's presses also produce lesbian fiction, such as [[Firebrand Books]] and [[Virago Press]].
