Novels that fall into this category may be of any genres, such as, but not limited to, [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], and [[Romance novel|romance]].

==History==
The first novel in the [[English language]] recognised as having a lesbian theme is [[Radclyffe Hall]]'s ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' (1928), which a British court found obscene because it defended "unnatural practices between women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the [[United States]] ''The Well of Loneliness'' survived legal challenges in [[New York (state)|New York]] and the [[United States Customs Court|Customs Court]].

Lesbian fiction saw a huge explosion in interest with the advent of the dime-store or [[pulp fiction]] novel. [[Lesbian pulp fiction]] became its own category of fiction, although a significant number of authors of this genre were men using either a male or female [[pen name]]. The [[second-wave feminism|feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s]] saw a more accepted entry of lesbian-themed literature.

==Young adult==

Publication of lesbian fiction for teenagers and young adults started in the 1970s. [[Nancy Garden]]'s ''[[Annie on My Mind]]'' was one of the first [[young adult novels]] featuring love between two girls.  More recent authors who write about lesbian and [[bisexual]] teenagers include [[Sara Ryan]], [[Julie Anne Peters]], and [[Judy MacLean]]. This genre showed a notable increase in the 1990s, with the publication of novels by authors including [[Nancy Garden]], [[M.E. Kerr]], and [[Ellen Wittlinger]]. Today several lesbian-themed novels for young adults are published each year.

==Publishers==
An early publisher devoted to publishing lesbian and feminist books was [[Naiad Press]], now [[Bella Books]]. [[Bold Strokes Books]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boldstrokesbooks.com&lt;/ref&gt; is a proliferous publisher of lesbian mystery, thrillers, sci-fi, adventure and other [[LGBT]] genre books. One of their most recent release is ''Blind Curves'' by [[Diane Anderson-Minshall]]. [[Bywater Books]] is another publisher of lesbian fiction. [[Virago Press]], a publisher of women's literature, has also published lesbian-related novels.
