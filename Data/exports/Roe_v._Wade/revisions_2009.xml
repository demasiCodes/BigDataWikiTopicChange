The Court held that a woman may abort her pregnancy for any reason, up until the "point at which the fetus becomes 'viable.'" The Court defined [[Fetus#Viability|viability]] as the potential "to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid," adding that viability "is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks."&lt;ref&gt;The Court recognized that these numbers would change with changing medical technology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court said that, after viability, abortion must be available when needed to protect a woman's health, as [[Doe v.

Wade'' prompted a [[abortion debate|national debate]] that continues today, about issues including whether and to what extent abortion should be legal, who should decide the legality of abortion, what methods the Supreme Court should use in constitutional [[adjudication]], and what the role should be of [[religion|religious]] and [[morality|moral]] views in the political sphere. ''Roe v. Wade'' reshaped national politics, dividing much of the nation into pro-''Roe'' (mostly [[pro-choice]]) and anti-''Roe'' (mostly [[pro-life]]) camps, while activating [[grassroots]] movements on both sides.

==History of the case==
In September, 1969, while working as a carnival side-show [[Barker (occupation)|barker]], [[Norma McCorvey|Norma L. McCorvey]] discovered she was pregnant.  She returned to [[Dallas, TX]], where friends advised her to assert that she had been raped, because then she could obtain a legal abortion (with the understanding that Texas's anti-abortion laws allowed abortion in the cases of rape and incest).  However, this scheme failed, as there was no police report documenting the alleged rape.  She attempted to obtain an illegal abortion, but found the site shuttered, closed down by the police.  Eventually, she was referred to attorneys [[Linda Coffee]] and [[Sarah Weddington]]. &lt;ref&gt;"[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Roe+v.+Wade]" McCorvey, Norma and Meisler, Andy.

In 1970, attorneys [[Linda Coffee]] and [[Sarah Weddington]] filed suit in a U.S. District Court in [[Texas]] on behalf of [[Norma McCorvey|Norma L. McCorvey]] (under the alias Jane Roe).  At the time, McCorvey was no longer claiming her pregnancy was the result of [[rape]], but she later acknowledged she had lied earlier about having been raped.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ostling]].

Although McCorvey was still hoping the courts would rule in her favor in time for her to end her unwanted pregnancy, she told her attorneys, "Let's do it for other women." &lt;ref&gt;"[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Roe+v.+Wade]" McCorvey, Norma and Meisler, Andy.

==Supreme Court decision==
[[File:US Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, detail.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Harry Blackmun]] wrote the Court’s opinion.]]  The court issued its decision on January 22, 1973, with a 7 to 2 majority vote in favor of McCorvey.  Burger and Douglas' concurring opinion and White's dissenting opinion were issued separately, in the companion case of ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]''.

The ''Roe'' Court deemed abortion a [[fundamental right]] under the [[United States Constitution]], thereby subjecting all laws attempting to restrict it to the standard of [[strict scrutiny]]. Although abortion is still considered a fundamental right, subsequent cases, notably ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', and ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' have affected the legal standard.

The opinion of the ''Roe'' Court, written by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], declined to adopt the district court's [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] rationale, and instead asserted that the "right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."  Douglas, in his concurring opinion from the companion case ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', stated more emphatically that, "The Ninth Amendment obviously does not create federally enforceable rights."  Thus, the ''Roe'' majority rested its opinion squarely on the Constitution's [[due process clause]].

The majority opinion is organized into twelve sections preceded by a brief preface; the first four sections provide background.  '''Section I'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; briefly outlines the challenged '''[[Texas abortion statutes]]'''.  '''Section II'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterizes the factual and procedural backgrounds of Jane Roe's and Mary Doe's litigation, including the District Court's rulings regarding the procedural questions (here, [[justiciability]], [[standing]], and [[abstention]]) and the merits (here, the requests for [[declaratory judgment]] and [[injunctive relief]]).  '''Section III'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a single paragraph resolving that under the law of [[Federal Court procedure]], the opinions in [[Mitchell v. Donovan]] and [[Gunn v. University Committee]] do not foreclose review a case of this kind when it is properly here on appeal under § 1253.   '''Section IV'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; issues the court's decision on the procedural questions described in Part II.

'''Section V'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a single paragraph introducing the discussion of the merits, led by the following:
{{cquote|The principal thrust of appellant's attack on the Texas statutes is that they improperly invade a right, said to be possessed by the pregnant woman, to choose to terminate her pregnancy. Appellant would discover this right in the concept of personal "liberty" embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause; or in personal, marital, familial, and sexual privacy said to be protected by the Bill of Rights or its penumbras ... or among those rights reserved to the people by the Ninth Amendment ...}}

'''Section VI'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; surveys the history of abortion regulations, in eight subparts: ''1. Ancient attitudes (including those of the [[Persia|Persian Empire]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek times]], the [[Roman era]]). 2. The [[Hippocratic oath]]. 3. The [[common law]].  4. The English [[statutory law]].  5. The American law.  6. The position of the [[American Medical Association]].  7. The position of the [[American Public Health Association]]. 8. The position of the [[American Bar Association]].  According to the ''Roe'' Court, "the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage."  Prior to 1821, when Connecticut passed the first state statute criminalizing abortion, [[abortion in the United States]] was sometimes considered a common law crime.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Wilson|Wilson, James]], "[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=831 Of the Natural Rights of Individuals]" (1790-1792): “In the contemplation of law, life begins when the infant is first able to stir in the womb.”  Also see [[William Blackstone|Blackstone, William]]. [http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIXs1.html Commentaries] (1765): "Life ... begins in contemplation of law as soon as an infant is able to stir in the mother's womb."&lt;/ref&gt;  Every state had abortion legislation by 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, George; Frankowski, Stanislaw.  ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=-ujuOMTNAQAC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=quickening+and+abortion+and+states&amp;ei=u4_7R7P4J5XOywSnzu3JBA&amp;sig=_94hQXPrYdnIuox3681ca1grp8g Abortion and protection of the human fetus : legal problems in a cross-cultural perspective]'', page 20 (1987): "By 1900 every state in the Union had an anti-abortion prohibition."  Via Google Books.  Retrieved (2008-04-08).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the court concluded that it could not find a sufficient historical basis to justify [[Texas abortion statutes (1961)|the Texas statute]].

In '''Section VII''',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Court identified three state interests that could be cited to justify criminalizing abortion: (1) an interest in discouraging women from engaging in "illicit sexual conduct", which interest would be undermined by making abortion widely available; (2) an interest in reducing access to a risky medical procedure—which abortion could still be in the late stages of pregnancy, despite modern medical techniques such as [[antibiotic]]s; and (3) an interest in protecting prenatal life.  Blackmun rejected the first interest out-of-hand, writing that "no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously" and that in any event it could not be cited in support of this statute, which failed to "distinguish between married and unwed mothers".  Accordingly, the only valid state interests are reducing medical risk and protecting prenatal life.  (In Section X, the Court reiterated, "[T]he State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman [and] still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.")  Thus, "arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive".

In '''Section VIII''',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Court also identified a countervailing right that would have to be weighed against these state interests: namely, a Constitutional right to privacy: "We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation."  The innovation of the ''Roe'' court was to locate this "right of privacy" in the due process clause of the Constitution.  Although the Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy, the Court had previously found support for various privacy rights—directly (in several provisions of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]) as well as indirectly (in the "[[wiktionary:penumbra|penumbra]]" of the Bill of Rights) -- most recently in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''. 

In '''Section IX''',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Court added that there was no legal grounds for factoring into this balancing test any [[right to life]] of the unborn [[fetus]].  The fetus would have such a right if it were defined as a legal person for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, but the [[original intent]] of the Constitution (up to the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868) did not include protection of the unborn.  The Court emphasized that its determination of whether a fetus can enjoy constitutional protection neither meant to reference, nor intervene in, the question of when life begins:  "We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]] are unable to arrive at any consensus, the [[judiciary]], at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer."

'''Section X'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained that the [[trimester]] of pregnancy is highly relevant to the weight of the factors in this balancing test.  Thus, during the first trimester, the state cannot restrict a woman's right to an abortion in any way; during the second trimester, the state may only regulate the abortion procedure "in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health"; during the third trimester, the state can choose to restrict or [[proscription|proscribe]] abortion as it sees fit when the fetus is viable ("except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother").

'''Section XI'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; succinctly summarizes the Court's legal conclusions, explaining that a Texas-style criminal statute was unconstitutional, and recapitulating the permissible extent of state regulation in each of the three Constitutionally relevant time periods of pregnancy (i.e. divided by "approximately the end of the first trimester" and "the stage subsequent to viability").  '''Section XII'''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|410|113|1973|pin=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; resolves the present dispute: it struck down the Texas statute and characterized the relief that should be accorded to Roe.

===Justiciability===
An aspect of the decision that attracted comparatively little attention was the Court's disposition of the issues of [[Standing (law)|standing]] and [[mootness]].  Under the traditional interpretation of these rules, Jane Roe's appeal was "moot" because she had already given birth to her child and thus would not be affected by the ruling; she also lacked "standing" to assert the rights of other pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;Abernathy, M. et al., ''[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0872498549&amp;id=tHhlYpWokFIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA4&amp;lpg=RA1-PA4&amp;ots=OeQSTLp91C&amp;dq=standing+and+mootness+and+%22roe+v.+wade%22&amp;num=100&amp;sig=gfDTMq-LyUVI-lg8tNreUQFjX6c Civil Liberties Under the Constitution]'' (U. South Carolina 1993), page 4.  Retrieved 2007-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt;  As she did not present an "actual [[case or controversy]]" (a grievance and a demand for relief), any opinion issued by the Supreme Court would constitute an [[advisory opinion]], a practice in which the Court traditionally did not engage.

The Court concluded that the case came within an established exception to the rule; one that allowed consideration of an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review." This phrase had been coined in 1911 by Justice [[Joseph McKenna]].&lt;ref&gt;''Southern Pacific v. Interstate Commerce Commission'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=219&amp;invol=498 219 U.S. 498] (1911).  Findlaw.com.  Retrieved 2007-01-26&lt;/ref&gt; Blackmun's opinion quoted McKenna, and noted that pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an appellate process: "If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied."

==Dissents==
[[Image:Justice White Official.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Byron White]] was the senior dissenting justice.]]
Associate Justices [[Byron R. White]] and [[William H. Rehnquist]] wrote emphatic dissenting opinions in this case.  Justice White wrote:
{{cquote|I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment.  The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant mothers and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review that the Constitution extends to this Court.&lt;ref name="Doe" /&gt;}}

White asserted that the Court "values the convenience of the pregnant mother more than the continued existence and development of the life or potential life that she carries." Despite White suggesting he "might agree" with the Court's values and priorities, he wrote that he saw "no constitutional warrant for imposing such an order of priorities on the people and legislatures of the States."  White criticized the Court for involving itself in this issue by creating "a constitutional barrier to state efforts to protect human life and by investing mothers and doctors with the constitutionally protected right to exterminate it."  He would have left this issue, for the most part, "with the people and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs."

Rehnquist elaborated upon several of White's points, by asserting that the Court's historical analysis was flawed:

{{cquote|To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment.  As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature.  By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today.&lt;ref name="Roe"&gt;''Roe v. Wade'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;page=113 410 U.S. 113] (1973). Findlaw.com.  Retrieved 2007-01-26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this historical record, Rehnquist concluded that, "There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted." Therefore, in his view, "the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter."

Advocates of ''Roe'' describe it as vital to preservation of [[women's rights]], personal freedom, and privacy.  Denying the abortion right has been equated to compulsory motherhood, and some scholars (not including any member of the Supreme Court) have argued that abortion bans therefore violate the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]:

{{cquote|When women are compelled to carry and bear children, they are subjected to 'involuntary servitude' in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment….[E]ven if the woman has stipulated to have consented to the risk of pregnancy, that does not permit the state to force her to remain pregnant.&lt;ref name="Koppelman" /&gt;}}

Opponents of ''Roe'' have objected that the decision lacks a valid constitutional foundation.  Like the dissenters in ''Roe'', they have maintained that the Constitution is silent on the issue, and that proper solutions to the question would best be found via state legislatures and the [[democracy|democratic]] process, rather than through an all-encompassing ruling from the Supreme Court. Supporters of ''Roe'' contend that the decision has a valid constitutional foundation, or contend that justification for the result in ''Roe'' could be found in the Constitution but not in the articles referenced in the decision.&lt;ref name="Koppelman"&gt;Koppelman, Andrew.

In response to ''Roe v. Wade'', most states enacted or attempted to enact laws limiting or regulating abortion, such as laws requiring [[parental consent]] for minors to obtain abortions, parental notification laws, spousal mutual consent laws, [[Paternal rights and abortion|spousal notification]] laws, laws requiring abortions to be performed in hospitals but not clinics, laws barring state funding for abortions, laws banning intact dilation and extraction (also known as [[intact dilation and extraction|partial-birth abortion]]), laws requiring waiting periods before abortion, or laws mandating women read certain types of literature before choosing an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Guttmacher Institute, "[http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf State Policies in Brief, An Overview of Abortion Laws (PDF)]", published 2007-01-01. Retrieved 2007-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress in 1976 passed the [[Hyde Amendment]], barring federal funding of abortions for poor women through the [[Medicaid]] program. The Supreme Court struck down several state restrictions on abortions in a long series of cases stretching from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, but upheld restrictions on funding, including the Hyde Amendment, in the case of ''[[Harris v. McRae]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;''Harris v. McRae'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=448&amp;invol=297 448 U.S. 297] (1980).  Findlaw.com.

The most prominent organized groups that mobilized in response to ''Roe'' are the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America|National Abortion Rights Action League]] on the pro-choice side, and the [[National Right to Life Committee]] on the pro-life side.  The late Harry Blackmun, author of the ''Roe'' opinion, was a determined advocate for the decision.  Others have joined him in support of ''Roe'', including [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]], who before the decision had offered an influential defense of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Judith. "[[A Defense of Abortion]]," in ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', vol. 1, no. 1 (1971), pp. 47–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Roe'' remains controversial. [[Abortion in the United States#Public opinion|Polls]] show continued division about its landmark rulings, and about the decision as a whole.

===Internal memoranda===
Internal Supreme Court memoranda surfaced in the [[Library of Congress]] in 1988, among the personal papers of Douglas and other Justices, showing the private discussions of the Justices on the case. Blackmun said of the majority decision he authored, "You will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical. This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as quickening or viability, is equally arbitrary."&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Bob.

Retrieved 2007-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart said the lines were "legislative" and wanted more flexibility and consideration paid to the state legislatures, though he joined Blackmun's decision.&lt;ref&gt;Kmiec, Douglas.

The assertion that the Supreme Court was making a legislative decision is often repeated by opponents of the Court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George Walker. Quoted in ''Boston Globe'', p. A12 (2000-01-22). "Roe v. Wade was wrong because it 'usurped the power of the legislatures,' Bush said. 'I felt like it was a case where the court took the place of what legislatures should do in America,' he said. But Bush refused to say how he felt each state should act. Instead, he said that when it comes to legalizing abortion, 'it should be up to each legislature.'" Retrieved 2007-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The "viability" criterion, which Blackmun acknowledged was arbitrary, is still in effect, although the point of viability has changed as medical science has found ways to help premature babies survive.&lt;ref&gt;Stith, Irene.

===Liberal critiques===
[[Modern liberalism in the United States|Liberal]] and [[feminist]] legal scholars have had various reactions to ''Roe'', not always giving the decision unqualified support. One reaction has been to argue that Justice Blackmun reached the correct result but went about it the wrong way.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Balkin|Balkin, Jack]].

"Gore and the Boundary Between Law and Politics"], 110 ''Yale Law Journal'' 1407 (2001): "Liberal and feminist legal scholars have spent decades showing that the result was correct even if Justice Blackmun’s opinion seems to have been taken from the Court’s [[cubism|Cubist]] period."&lt;/ref&gt; Another reaction has been to argue that the ends achieved by ''Roe'' do not justify the means.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cohen (Washington Post columnist)|Cohen, Richard]].

Retrieved 2007-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], in a 2007 interview, averred that ''Roe'' "create[d] a new doctrine that really didn’t make sense," and lamented that if Justice Blackmun "could have written a better opinion[, that] ... might have avoided some of the criticism."&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey.

==Role in subsequent decisions and politics==
Opposition to ''Roe'' on the bench grew when President Reagan—who supported legislative restrictions on abortion—began making federal judicial appointments in 1981.  Reagan denied that there was any [[litmus test (politics)|litmus test]]: "I have never given a litmus test to anyone that I have appointed to the bench…. I feel very strongly about those social issues, but I also place my confidence in the fact that the one thing that I do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] used the rulings in both ''Roe'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' as grounds to find Canada's federal law restricting access to abortions unconstitutional.

===''Planned Parenthood v. Casey''===
{{Main|Planned Parenthood v. Casey}}
With the retirement of ''Roe'' supporters [[William J. Brennan]] in 1990 and [[Thurgood Marshall]] in 1991, and their replacement by [[David Souter]] and [[Clarence Thomas]], pro-choice advocates viewed ''Roe'' for the first time as being in danger.&lt;ref&gt;Wattleton, Faye.

Retrieved 2007-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the confirmation hearings of David Souter, [[National Organization for Women|NOW]] president [[Molly Yard]] declared that confirming Souter would mean "ending freedom for women in this country."&lt;ref&gt;Yard, Molly. Quoted in Kamen, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/18/AR2005091801188.html For Liberals, Easy Does it With Roberts]", ''Washington Post'' (2005-09-19).  Retrieved 2007-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[National Public Radio|NPR]], in deliberations for ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), an initial majority of five Justices that would have overturned ''Roe'' foundered when [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]] switched sides.&lt;ref&gt;Totenberg, Nina. "[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1745254 Documents Reveal Battle to Preserve 'Roe'; Court Nearly Reversed Abortion Ruling, Blackmun Papers Show]", ''NPR's Morning Edition'' (2004-03-04).  Retrieved 2007-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter joined Blackmun and Stevens to reaffirm the central holding of ''Roe'', saying, "At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life."&lt;ref name="Casey"&gt;''Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=505&amp;page=833 505 U.S. 833] (1992).  Retrieved 2007-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rehnquist and Scalia signed each others' dissenting opinions; White and Thomas signed those dissenting opinions as well.

Scalia's dissent acknowledged that abortion rights are of "great importance to many women", but asserted that it is not a liberty protected by the Constitution, because the Constitution does not mention it, and because longstanding traditions have permitted it to be legally proscribed.  Scalia concluded: "[B]y foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish."&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;

===''Stenberg v. Carhart''===
{{Main|Stenberg v. Carhart}}
During the 1990s, [[Nebraska]] attempted to ban a certain second-trimester abortion procedure known as [[intact dilation and extraction]] (sometimes called [[partial birth abortion]]).  The Nebraska ban allowed other second-trimester abortion procedures called [[dilation and evacuation]] abortions.  Ginsburg (who replaced White) stated, "this law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only 'a method of performing abortion'."&lt;ref name="Stenberg"&gt;''Stenberg v. Carhart'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=530&amp;page=914 530 U.S. 914] (2000).  Retrieved 2007-02-02.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court struck down the Nebraska ban by a 5-4 vote in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' (2000), citing a right to use the safest method of second trimester abortion.

Kennedy, who had co-authored the 5-4 ''Casey'' decision upholding ''Roe'', was among the dissenters in ''Stenberg'', writing that Nebraska had done nothing unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="Stenberg"/&gt;  Kennedy described the second trimester abortion procedure that Nebraska was ''not'' seeking to prohibit: "The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn from limb from limb. The fetus can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off."  Kennedy wrote that since this dilation and evacuation procedure remained available in Nebraska, the state was free to ban the other procedure sometimes called "partial birth abortion."&lt;ref name="Stenberg"/&gt;

The remaining three dissenters in ''Stenberg''{{ndash}} Thomas, Scalia, and Rehnquist{{ndash}} disagreed again with ''Roe'': "Although a State may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State must do so."

===''Gonzales v. Carhart''===
{{Main|Gonzales v. Carhart}}
In 2003, Congress passed the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], which led to a lawsuit in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''.  The Court had previously ruled in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' that a state's ban on "partial birth abortion" was unconstitutional because such a ban would not allow for the health of the mother.  The membership of the Court changed after ''Stenberg'', with [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]] replacing Rehnquist and O'Connor, respectively.  Further, the ban at issue in ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' was a federal statute, rather than a relatively vague state statute as in the ''Stenberg'' case.

On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a 5 to 4 decision upholding the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left the door open for as-applied challenges.  Kennedy's opinion did not reach the question whether the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'', ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', and ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' were valid, and instead the Court said that the challenged statute is consistent with those prior decisions whether or not those prior decisions were valid.

Joining the majority were Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]], Scalia, Thomas, and Alito. Ginsburg and the other three justices dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent, and also offering an equality-based justification for that abortion precedent. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the [[Commerce Clause]].

===Activities of Norma McCorvey===
[[Norma McCorvey]] became a member of the pro-life movement in 1995; she now supports making abortion illegal.  In 1998, she testified to Congress:
{{cquote|It was my pseudonym, Jane Roe, which had been used to create the "right" to abortion out of legal thin air. But Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee never told me that what I was signing would allow women to come up to me 15, 20 years later and say, "Thank you for allowing me to have my five or six abortions. Without you, it wouldn't have been possible."  Sarah never mentioned women using abortions as a form of birth control. We talked about truly desperate and needy women, not women already wearing maternity clothes.&lt;ref name="testimony"&gt;McCorvey, Norma.

As a party to the original litigation, she sought to reopen the case in [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in Texas to have ''Roe v. Wade'' overturned.  However, the [[Fifth Circuit]] decided that her case was moot, in ''[[McCorvey v. Hill]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''McCorvey v. Hill'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/5th/0310711p.pdf 385 F3d 846 (PDF)] (5th Cir 2004).  Findlaw.com.  Retrieved 2007-01-26&lt;/ref&gt;  In a concurring opinion, Judge [[Edith Jones]] agreed that McCorvey was raising legitimate questions about emotional and other harm suffered by women who have had abortions, about increased resources available for the care of unwanted children, and about new scientific understanding of fetal development, but Jones said she was compelled to agree that the case was moot.  On February 22, 2005, the Supreme Court refused to grant a [[certiorari|writ of certiorari]], and McCorvey's appeal ended.
