'''''Roe v. Wade''''', [[Court citation|410 U.S. 113]] ([[1973]]){{ref|citation}}, was a [[landmark case|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case establishing that most laws against [[abortion]] violate a [[United States Constitution|constitutional right]] to privacy, overturning all [[U.S. state|state]] laws outlawing or restricting abortion. It is one of the most controversial decisions in Supreme Court history.

The decision in ''Roe v. Wade'' has sparked a decades-long national debate over whether or when abortion should be legal; the role of the Supreme Court in constitutional adjudication; and the role of [[religion|religious]] views in the political sphere. ''Roe v. Wade'' became one of the most politically significant Supreme Court decisions in history, reshaping national politics, dividing the nation into "[[Pro-Choice|pro-choice]]" and "[[Pro-Life|pro-life]]" camps, and inspiring [[grassroots]] activism. 

''Roe'' sparked widespread opposition, from those who viewed the Court's decision as illegitimate for straying too far from the text and history of the Constitution, as well as from those motivated by religious and moral beliefs about the inviolability of [[fetus|fetal]] life. It also attracted widespread support, from those who view the decision as necessary to achieve [[feminism|women's equality]] and personal freedom. The Supreme Court has been forced on several occasions to acknowledge the furor it inspired, and indeed reopened ''Roe v. Wade'' in a 1992 case (see [[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]), only to reaffirm the central holding of its earlier decision. 

&lt;br&gt;
==Background of the case==
The case originated in [[Texas]] in March [[1970]] at the behest of [[Sarah Weddington]], a young [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] attorney who would play the leading role in pursuing the case. Weddington brought a lawsuit on behalf of [[Norma McCorvey]], an unmarried pregnant woman of Texas, to overturn the state of Texas' anti-abortion law. The name "[[Jane Roe]]", a standard alias for anonymous plaintiffs, was used to protect Norma McCorvey's identity. After filing the initial lawsuit, the case was expanded to include several other parties, including: James Hubert Hallford, a licensed physician who had been arrested for violations of the Texas abortion statutes; "John and Mary Doe," aliases for a married couple whose doctor had advised against pregnancy; "all couples similarly situated" to the Does; and "all other women" similarly situated to Roe.

At the time of the case, McCorvey claimed that she had become pregnant by [[rape]]. She has since recanted that claim and rescinded her support for the Supreme Court decision she prompted (see below).

The law in question made having or attempting to perform an abortion a crime, except by "medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother." The suit claimed that the laws were unconstitutionally vague and abridged the rights guaranteed to pregnant women by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]], [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth]], and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]s to the United States Constitution. [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] district attorney [[Henry Wade]] was the defendant in the case. 
A three-judge district court ruled for "Jane Roe", but refused to grant [[injunction|injunctive relief]] against the enforcement of the laws.

Since 1965's ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', the Supreme Court has recognized a "right of privacy" which inheres in the various provisions of the [[Bill of Rights]], primarily the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Due Process clause had long been held to have a "substantive" component, providing protection for certain fundamental rights. The ruling in ''Griswold'' recognized constitutional protection for the possession of [[birth control]] as part of an intimate sphere of marital privacy, and the reasoning of that case had been extended to protect the possession of birth control by non-married couples in 1972's ''Eisenstadt v. Baird''. Many advocates of liberalizing abortion laws saw promise in this line of cases, as abortion was widely proscribed by state laws at that time.

Both "Jane Roe" and defendant Wade appealed to the Supreme Court and the case was argued there by Weddington and Texas assistant attorney general Jay Floyd on [[December 13]], [[1971]]. Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] assigned the opinion of the Court to [[Harry Blackmun]], who wrote an opinion that would strike the Texas law down as unconstitutionally vague. Burger proposed that the case be put over for reargument, and the justices, unimpressed with the first oral argument in the case, underwhelmed by Blackmun's opinion, and wishing that new Justices [[William Rehnquist]] and [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]] participate, voted to reargue the case on [[October 11]], [[1972]], at the behest of Chief Justice Burger. At the reargument, Weddington again represented Roe, while district attorney Wade was represented by Texas assistant attorney general Robert C. Flowers. 

As recounted in [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Scott Armstrong]]'s ''The Brethren'', Justice [[William O. Douglas]] was outraged by Chief Justice Burger's proposal to put the case over for reargument, believing Burger wished that the case be decided after the [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|November 1972 elections]] (Burger was a close friend of President [[Richard Nixon]]). Douglas threatened to write a dissent from the reargument order, but was coaxed out of the action by his colleagues; his dissent was merely mentioned in the order without further statement or opinion.

==The Supreme Court's decision==	
The Court issued its opinion on [[January 22]], [[1973]], with a 7-2 majority voting to strike down the law and [[Byron White]] and [[William Rehnquist]] dissenting. On the same day, the same 7-2 majority invalidated a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] abortion law in the lesser-known case of ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', 410 U.S. 179 (1973), involving Georgia's abortion laws.

===Abortion===
The opinion of the Court, written by Justice Harry Blackmun, states that "the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage" with criminalization of abortion mostly occurring from law enacted in the latter half of the 19th century. Section VI of the opinion was devoted to an analysis of historical attitudes, including those of the [[Persian Empire]], [[ancient Greece]], the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Hippocratic Oath]], [[common law]], English [[statutory law]], American law, the [[American Medical Association]], the [http://www.apha.org/ American Public Health Association], and the [[American Bar Association]].

State laws outlawing abortion were set aside by the Court, permitting abortions during the first three months of pregnancy and setting standards for regulations after that time to safeguard the woman's health.  The Supreme Court of the United States declared unconstitutional all but the least restrictive state statutes.  Noting that induced early abortions had become safer than childbirth and holding that the word person in the Constitution of the United States "does not include the unborn," the court defined, within each of the three stages of pregnancy, the reciprocal limits of state power and individual freedom: (a) During the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician. (b) After the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State, in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate and even proscribe abortion, except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgement, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother. In 1980, however, the Court refused to apply this ruling to require the federal government to bear the cost of abortions for women who could not afford them. 

Without finding a historical basis for the laws, the Court identified three justifications in Section VII of the opinion to explain the criminalization of abortion: (1) women who can receive an abortion are more likely to engage in "illicit sexual conduct", (2) the medical procedure was extremely risky prior to the development of antibiotics and, even with modern medical techniques, is still risky in late stages of pregnancy, and (3) the state has an interest in protecting prenatal life. As to the first, "no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously" and the statute failed to "distinguish between married and unwed mothers." However, according to the Court, the second and third constitute valid state interests. In Section X, the Court reiterated, "[T]he State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman ... and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life."

Valid state interests, however, must be weighed against the constitutional rights granted to individuals in order to determine whether a law is a constitutional exercise of power. Even though the "Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy" the court found support for a constitutional right of privacy in the First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Ninth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment. The court found this "right of [[privacy]]" to be "broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."

However, the Court determined that "arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive." The Court declared, "We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation." 
	
When weighing the competing interests the Court also noted that if the fetus was defined as a [[person]] for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment then the fetus would have a specific right to life under that Amendment. However, given the relatively recent nature of abortion criminalization, the Court determined that the original intent of the Constitution up to the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment in [[1868]] did not include the unborn. It should be noted that the Court's determination of whether a fetus can enjoy Constitutional protection is separate from the notion of when life begins. To that, the Court said, "We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]] are unable to arrive at any consensus, the [[judiciary]], at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer."

Relying on the current state of medical knowledge, the decision established a system of [[trimester]]s that attempted to balance the state's legitimate interests with the individual's constitutional rights. The Court ruled that the state cannot restrict a woman's right to an abortion during the first trimester, the state can regulate the abortion procedure during the second trimester "in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health," and in the third trimester, demarcating the viability of the fetus, a state can choose to restrict or even to [[proscription|proscribe]] abortion as it sees fit.

===Justiciability===
An aspect of the decision that attracted comparatively little attention was the Court's disposition of the issues of [[Standing (law)|standing]] and [[mootness]]. The Supreme Court does not issue [[advisory opinion]]s (those stating what the law would be in some hypothetical circumstance). Instead, there must be an actual "[[case or controversy]]", including particularly a plaintiff who is aggrieved and seeks relief. In the ''Roe'' case, "Jane Roe," who began the litigation in March 1970, had already given birth by the time the case was argued before the Supreme Court in December 1971. By the traditional rules, therefore, there was an argument that Roe's appeal was moot because she would not be affected by the ruling, and also that she lacked standing to assert the rights of pregnant women (other than herself) seeking an abortion. The Court concluded, however, that the case came within an established exception to the rule, one that allowed consideration of an issue that was "capable of repetition, yet evading review." Justice Blackmun's opinion noted that human pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an appellate process. "If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied." Such a ruling was critical to the Supreme Court's power to review the case, since the Supreme Court dismissed the physician James Hubert Hallford's intervention and affirmed the dismissal of John and Mary Doe.

===Dissent===
Byron White, joined by William Rehnquist, vigorously dissented, calling the Court's decision "an exercise of raw judicial power." He wrote, "I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment. The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant mothers and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the mother, on the other hand.''

== Controversy over ''Roe'' ==
The ''Roe'' decision sparked nationwide protest, including a massive letter-writing campaign to the Supreme Court. Many Americans, including many [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]], believe that abortion is morally equivalent to [[infanticide]]. Others believe that life begins upon [[fertilisation|conception]], and thus the right to life of the fetus trumps any other rights. Widespread protest over the decision resulted in the creation of the Pro-Life Movement, which organized large protest rallies outside the Supreme Court. Pro-life protesters frequently picket abortion clinics, distribute literature and other forms of persuasion to women considering abortion, and have promoted adoption efforts to steer women away from abortion. More extreme variants of the movement have also developed; abortion doctors have been the targets of harassment and even murder by individuals who claim that by taking the life of an abortion doctor they are actually saving the lives of many fetuses. However, activists who advocate or practice violence against abortion providers or recipients are consistently denounced by virtually all prominent pro-life groups.  Some abortion opponents have claimed that there exists a link between abortion and [[breast cancer]], and Texas has enacted a law requiring literature advancing this theory be distributed to women considering abortion; more credibly, abortion has been linked to some [[psychology|psychological]] problems, and to a higher risk of future [[infertility]]. Every year on the anniversary of the decision, protesters continue to demonstrate outside the Supreme Court Building in [[Washington, D.C.]] 

In response to ''Roe v. Wade'', several states enacted laws limiting the right of abortion, including laws requiring parental consent for minors to obtain abortions, parental notification laws, spousal consent laws, spousal notification laws, laws requiring abortions to be performed in hospitals but not clinics, laws barring state funding for abortions, laws banning most [[intact dilation and extraction]] procedures (colloquially referred to as [[partial-birth abortion]]s), laws requiring waiting periods before abortion, laws mandating that women read certain types of literature before choosing an abortion, and many more. The United States Congress in the 1970s passed the Hyde Amendment, barring federal funding for abortion. Abortions are currently prohibited in overseas military hospitals, and the U.S. is barred from aiding international [[birth control|family planning]] organizations that might advise abortions. The Supreme Court struck down several state restrictions on abortions in a long series of cases stretching from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, but consistently upheld restrictions on funding, including the Hyde Amendment, in the case of ''Harris v. McRae'' (1980). 

Some academics also criticized the decision. In his 1973 article in the Yale Law Journal, "The Wages of Crying Wolf," Professor [[John Hart Ely]] criticized ''Roe'' as a decision which "is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be." Left-leaning Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and other liberals such as Massachusetts congressman [[John F. Tierney]] and editorial writer [[Michael Kinsley]], have criticized the court's ruling in ''Roe v. Wade'' as terminating a nascent, democratic movement to liberalize abortion laws which they contend might have built a more durable consensus in support of abortion rights.

Some academics supported the decision, including Judith Jarvis Thomson, who before the decision had offered an influential defense of abortion in "A Defense of Abortion," printed in ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', vol. 1, no. 1 (1971), pp. 47-66. 
Several groups have also emerged dedicated to ''Roe'''s defense. Many Americans vigorously support abortion rights as necessary to women's equality and personal liberty. Most prominent is the [[National Abortion Rights Action League]], as well as [[EMILY's List]], a pro-choice [[Political Action Committee]]. During his lifetime, [[Harry Blackmun]], author of the ''Roe'' opinion, also was a determined advocate for the decision, making speeches across the country praising Roe as essential to women's equality and reproductive freedom. During the 1980s and 1990s, pressure grew from these groups for the Democratic Party to take a unified stand in favor of ''Roe''. 

Fueled by the intensity of feelings in both its supporters and critics, the controversy over "Roe" shows no sign of abating. Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] delineated the positions of the two camps in his opinion for the Court in 2000's ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'': 

: "''Millions of Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child; they recoil at the thought of a law that would permit it. Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering.''"
....

=== 'Arbitrary' and 'Legislative' ===
Internal Supreme Court memoranda that surfaced in the [[Library of Congress]] in 1988, among the personal papers of Justice Douglas, and subsequently found in the papers of other Justices, showed the private discussions of the Justices on the case.  Blackmun said of the majority decision he authored: "you will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical.  This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as quickening or viability, is equally arbitrary."  Stewart said that the lines were "legislative" and wanted more flexibility and consideration paid to the state legislatures, though he joined Blackmun's decision.  Professor Douglas Kmiec [http://members.aol.com/abtrbng2/roememos.txt testified] on Justice Marshall's papers to this effect before the House Judiciary Committee in 1996.  The assertion that the Supreme Court was making a legislative decision is often repeated by opponents of the Court's decision.  The lines that Blackmun chose are no longer effect since ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992).

==''Roe's'' role in subsequent decisions and politics==
[[Image:Roevwade.jpg|right|frame|[[Albert Wynn]] and [[Planned Parenthood]] president [[Gloria Feldt]] at a pro-choice rally on the steps of the Supreme Court building. The rally was held on the anniversary of the Roe decision.]] 

Opposition to ''Roe'' on the bench grew as [[Ronald Reagan]], who supported legislative restrictions on abortion, controversially made abortion his "[[litmus test]]" for federal judicial appointments. In addition to White and Rehnquist, Reagan appointee [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] began dissenting from the Court's abortion cases, arguing that the trimester-based analysis devised by the ''Roe'' Court was "unworkable." Shortly before his retirement from the bench, Chief Justice Warren Burger suggested that ''Roe'' be "reexamined," and the associate justice who filled Burger's place on the Court, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], is a vigorous opponent of ''Roe''. Concerns over a possible overturning of ''Roe'' played a major role in the defeat of [[Robert Bork]]'s nomination to the Court, and the man eventually appointed to replace ''Roe'' supporter Lewis Powell, [[Anthony M. Kennedy]], was seen as a potential anti-''Roe'' vote. 

In a 5-4 decision in 1989's ''Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services'', Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, declined to explicitly overrule ''Roe'', but did uphold several abortion restrictions and substantially modified the ''Roe'' trimester framework. In a concurring opinion, Justice O'Connor pointedly refused to reconsider ''Roe''. Justice Antonin Scalia, in a concurring opinion, refused to join the plurality's opinion because it refused to overrule ''Roe'', and criticized O'Connor's ambiguous position on the matter. Justice Harry Blackmun, by now a passionate defender of his ''Roe'' opinion, dissented angrily, arguing that the plurality opinion signaled doom for the abortion right.

With the retirement of ''Roe'' supporters [[William J. Brennan]] and [[Thurgood Marshall]], and their replacement by judges appointed by President [[George H. W. Bush]], many predicted the demise of ''Roe''. The Supreme Court, however, in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', 505 U.S. 833 ([[1992]]), reexamined ''Roe'' and explicitly upheld its validity by a 5-4 vote. A plurality of Reagan-Bush appointees, O'Connor, Kennedy, and [[David H. Souter]], reaffirmed that the Constitution protects a right of abortion. Rehnquist and Scalia filed biting dissenting opinions. During the [[1990s]], attempts were made at the state level to ban "partial-birth" abortions, which were struck down, again by a 5-4 vote, in ''Stenberg v. Carhart'', 530 U.S. 914 ([[2000]]), with Justice Kennedy, co-author of the ''Casey'' decision, among the dissenters. Subsequently, Congress passed a law banning third trimester abortions, which is currently in litigation.

With the changes to the Supreme Court that have occurred in 2005 (the death of [[Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] and the announced departure of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]), it remains to be seen whether the current interpretation of Roe will hold much longer.  It should be noted, however, that regardless of what happens (and despite widespead belief to the contrary), a Supreme Court decision overturning ''Roe'' would not outlaw abortion in the U.S.  Rather, such a decision would simply send the issue back to the individual states.  The most likely outcome would be a patchwork of laws varying from state to state running the gamut from a full guarantee of abortion rights to a complete ban on abortions, depending on the state.

=="Jane Roe" switches sides==
In an interesting turn of events, "Jane Roe," whose real name is [[Norma McCorvey]], became a member of the pro-life movement following her conversion to [[Christianity]], and now fights to make abortion illegal. In a press conference held on [[January 18]], [[2005]], McCorvey claimed that she was the "pawn" of the ambitious Weddington, who was looking for a [[plaintiff]] to challenge the Texas state law prohibiting abortion. Using her prerogative as a party to the original litigation, she sought to reopen the case in a [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in Texas and have it overturned. Her new stance is based on claims made since the decision, claiming evidence of emotional and other harm suffered by many women who have had abortions, and increased resources for the care of unwanted children. On [[June 19]], [[2003]], Judge [[David Godbey]] ruled that the motion was not made within a "reasonable time." On [[February 22]], [[2005]], the Supreme Court refused to grant a [[writ of certiorari]], ending McCorvey's appeal.

It is also important to note that Roe was essentially a class action lawsuit. Even without "Jane Roe", the case could have gone on.
