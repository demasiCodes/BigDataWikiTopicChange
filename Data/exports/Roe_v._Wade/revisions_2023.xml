'''''Roe v. Wade''''', 410 U.S. 113 (1973),&lt;ref name=roevwadeussc&gt;{{ussc|name=Roe v. Wade|410|113|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark decision]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in which the Court ruled that the [[Constitution of the United States]] generally protected a right to have an [[abortion]]. The decision struck down many [[Abortion laws in U.S. states|abortion laws]], and caused an ongoing [[abortion debate]] in the United States about whether, or to what extent, abortion should be legal, who should decide the legality of abortion, and what the role of [[Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate#Philosophical argumentation on the moral issue|moral]] and [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution#Establishment of religion|religious views]] in the political sphere should be.&lt;ref name=mears_01222003&gt;{{cite news | first1 = William | last1 = Mears | first2 = Bob | last2 = Franken | url = http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/01/21/roevwade.overview/ | title = 30 years after ruling, ambiguity, anxiety surround abortion debate | publisher = CNN | date = January 22, 2003 | quote = In all, the ''Roe'' and ''Doe'' rulings impacted laws in 46 states.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Greenhouse|2005|p=72}} The decision also shaped debate concerning which methods the Supreme Court should use in constitutional [[adjudication]].

The case was brought by [[Norma McCorvey]]{{mdash}}under the legal pseudonym "[[John Doe|Jane Roe]]"{{mdash}}who, in 1969, became pregnant with [[Shelley Lynn Thornton|her third child]]. McCorvey wanted an abortion but lived in [[Texas]], where abortion was illegal except when necessary to save the mother's life. Her lawyers, [[Sarah Weddington]] and [[Linda Coffee]], filed a lawsuit on her behalf in U.S. federal court against her local [[district attorney]], [[Henry Wade]], alleging that [[Texas abortion statutes (1961)|Texas's abortion laws]] were unconstitutional. A special [[Judicial panel|three-judge court]] of the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] heard the case and ruled in her favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://casetext.com/case/roe-v-wade-2| title = Roe v.

In January 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision in McCorvey's favor holding that the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] provides a fundamental "right to privacy", which protects a pregnant woman's right to an abortion. It also held that the right to abortion is not absolute and must be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and prenatal life.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&amp;nbsp;18.29(a)(i)}}{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} It resolved these competing interests by announcing a [[pregnancy trimester]] timetable to govern all abortion regulations in the United States. The Court also classified the right to abortion as "fundamental", which required courts to evaluate challenged abortion laws under the "[[strict scrutiny]]" standard, the most stringent level of judicial review in the United States.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&amp;nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}}

The Supreme Court's decision in ''Roe'' was among the most controversial in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 886}}: "Few decisions in Supreme Court history have provoked the intense controversy that has surrounded the abortion rulings."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dworkin 1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Limits: The Role of the Law in Bioethical Decision Making|last=Dworkin|first=Roger|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0-253-33075-8|pages=28–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the dissent, ''Roe'' was criticized by some in the legal community,&lt;ref name="Dworkin 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Epstein |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Epstein |date=1973-01-01 |title=Substantive Due Process by Any Other Name: The Abortion Cases |url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/journal_articles/3779 |journal=[[University of Chicago Law Review]] |volume=1973 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Ely|1973}} including some who thought that ''Roe'' reached the correct result but went about it the wrong way,&lt;ref name="Balkin 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roosevelt 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2005" /&gt; and some called the decision a form of [[judicial activism]].{{sfnp|Greenhouse|2005|pp=135–136}} Others argued that ''Roe'' did not go far enough, as it was placed within the framework of [[civil rights]] rather than the broader [[human rights]].&lt;ref name="Ross &amp; Solinger 2017" /&gt; The decision also radically reconfigured the voting coalitions of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] parties in the following decades.

In June 2022, the Supreme Court overruled ''Roe'' in ''[[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization]]'' on the grounds that the [[Substantive due process|substantive right]] to abortion was not "deeply rooted in this Nation's history or tradition", nor considered a right when the Due Process Clause was ratified in 1868, and was unknown in U.S. law until ''Roe''.

From the [[American Revolution]] to the mid-19th century, abortion was legal in every state under [[Common law|the common law]] until [[quickening]] and was not an issue of significant controversy. Americans generally held to the traditional [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]] belief that [[personhood]] began at [[quickening]], which occurred between the fourth and sixth month of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Blackemore 2022"&gt;{{cite web |last=Blakemore |first=Erin |date=May 22, 2022 |title=The complex early history of abortion in the United States |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/the-complex-early-history-of-abortion-in-the-united-states |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220517150742/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/the-complex-early-history-of-abortion-in-the-united-states |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 17, 2022 |access-date=July 26, 2022 |website=National Geographic |quote=But that view of history is the subject of great dispute.

In 1821, [[Connecticut]] passed the first state statute legislating [[abortion in the United States]];&lt;ref name="cole" /&gt; it forbade the use of poisons in abortion.&lt;ref name="Hardin 1978" /&gt; After the 1840s, there was an upsurge in abortions. In the 19th century, the medical profession was generally opposed to abortion, which Mohr argues arose due to competition between men with medical degrees and women without one. The practice of abortion was one of the first medical specialties, and was practiced by unlicensed people; well-off people had abortions and paid well. The press played a key role in rallying support for anti-abortion laws.&lt;ref name="Hardin 1978" /&gt; According to James S. Witherspoon, a former briefing attorney for the Court of Appeals for the Third Supreme Judicial District of Texas, abortion was not legal before quickening in 27 out of all 37 states in 1868;&lt;ref name="Witherspoon 1985"&gt;[https://www.thecatholicthing.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/https:__bearspace.baylor.edu_Francis_Beckwith_www_Sites_ReexaminingRoe.pdf "Reexamining ''Roe'': Nineteenth-Century Abortion Statutes and the Fourteenth Amendment"] by James S.

In the United States, before specific statutes were made against it, abortion was sometimes considered a [[Common law offense in the United States|common law offense]], such as by [[William Blackstone]] and [[James Wilson (Founding Father)|James Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, William (1765).

"In the contemplation of law, life begins when the infant is first able to stir in the womb."&lt;/ref&gt; In all states throughout the 19th and early 20th century, pre-quickening abortions were always considered to be actions without a lawful purpose. This meant that if the mother died, the individual performing the abortion was guilty of murder. This aspect of common law regarded pre-quickening abortions as a type of [[inchoate offense]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncregister.com/blog/fact-checking-the-abortion-claims-in-dobbs-v-jackson-women-s-health-oral-arguments Fact-Checking the Abortion Claims in 'Dobbs v.

===Postponement===
''Roe v. Wade'' reached the Supreme Court when both sides appealed in 1970. The case continued under the name ''Roe v. Wade'' instead of being switched to ''Wade v. Roe''. The justices delayed taking action on ''Roe'' and a closely related case, ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', until they had first decided certain other cases. One case they decided first was ''[[Younger v. Harris]]''. The justices felt the appeals raised difficult questions on judicial [[jurisdiction]].

Another case was ''[[United States v. Vuitch]]'', in which they considered the constitutionality of a [[Washington D.C.|District of Columbia]] statute which banned abortion except when the mother's life or health was endangered. The Court upheld the statute on the grounds that the word "health" was not [[Vagueness doctrine#Unconstitutional vagueness|unconstitutionally vague]] and placed the [[Burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] concerning dangers to the life or health of the mother on the prosecutor instead of on the person who had performed the abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/402/62/ ''United States v. Vuitch'', 402 U.S. 62 (1971)], ''justia.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote a lengthy dissenting opinion to this case. He argued that the right to marital privacy and the limitation of family size from ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' also applied here, although he acknowledged that "on the other side is the belief of many that the fetus, once formed, is a member of the human family and that mere personal inconvenience cannot justify the fetus' destruction." He also challenged the majority opinion with a series of hypothetical questions asking whether "health" might also include the stigma of having an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] child, anxiety from the pregnancy being unwanted, the physical work of raising a child, the financial drain from the added expense of another child, and far off health risks that may never actually materialize in a similar fashion to how risks were warded off with [[Prophylactic surgery|prophylactic]] appendectomy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/402/62.html United States v.

According to Blackmun, Stewart felt the cases were a straightforward application of ''Younger v. Harris'', and enough justices agreed to hear the cases in order to review whether they would be suitable for federal as opposed to only state courts.&lt;ref name=forsythe98&gt;{{harvnb|Forsythe|2013|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sort of review was not about the constitutionality of abortion and would not have required evidence, witnesses, or a record of facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forsythe|2013|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oral argument was scheduled by the full Court for December 13, 1971. Before the Court could hear the oral argument, Justices [[Hugo Black]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II]] retired. Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] asked Justice [[Potter Stewart]] and Justice Blackmun to determine whether ''Roe'' and ''Doe'', among others, should be heard as scheduled. They recommended that the Court continue on as scheduled.{{sfnp|Greenhouse|2005|p=80}}

===Oral argument===
As she began speaking for the oral argument, Sarah Weddington was unaware that the Court had decided to hear the case in order to decide which courts had jurisdiction to hear it rather than as an attempt to overturn abortion laws in a broad ruling. She began by bringing up constitutional reasons why the Court should overturn Texas's abortion law, but Justice Stewart asked questions directed towards the jurisdiction question instead. Weddington replied that she saw no problem with jurisdiction and continued to talk about a [[Constitutional right#United States|constitutional right]] to abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ofbhHLhOhH8C&amp;dq=%22In+one+case%2C+Sarah+Weddington%2C+a+poised%22&amp;pg=PT265 The Brethren: Inside the Supreme Court] by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong, New York: Simon and Schuster, page 1979, page 265&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, she spent between 20 and 30 minutes discussing jurisdiction and procedure instead of constitutional issues.&lt;ref name=forsythe98/&gt;

In his opening argument in defense of the abortion restrictions, attorney Jay Floyd made what was later described as the "worst joke in legal history".&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;Sant, Geoffrey. "[http://www.salon.com/2013/07/26/8_horrible_courtroom_jokes_and_their_ensuing_legal_calamity 8 horrible courtroom jokes and their ensuing legal calamities]", ''Salon.com'' (July 27, 2013): "The title of Worst Joke in Legal History belongs to one of history's highest-profile cases.

Retrieved August 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing against two female lawyers, Floyd began, "Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. It's an old joke, but when a man argues against two beautiful ladies like this, they are going to have the last word." His remark was met with cold silence; one observer thought that Chief Justice Burger "was going to come right off the bench at him.

McCorvey did not attend either of the oral arguments along with her two lawyers.

===Initial discussions===
After the first argument session, Burger assigned the task of writing the Court's opinions for both ''Roe'' and ''Doe'' to Blackmun.&lt;ref name=schwartz103/&gt; Douglas suggested to Blackmun that Burger assigned the opinions to him out of malicious intention, but Blackmun disagreed. He knew that Burger could not write it himself because the abortion was too controversial, and his opinions might get rejected by the majority. He also understood why the other justices could not be assigned to write the opinions: Douglas was too liberal for the public to accept his word. Likewise, he might split the Court's vote by writing something radical. In addition, the quality of his opinions had suffered recently. Brennan was the only Catholic on the Court, and he would have to face Catholic political groups which were against abortion. If Marshall wrote the opinions, the ruling would be perceived as being directed towards African Americans, and he would have to face the displeasure of African American political groups. Stewart would have trouble going far enough in legalizing abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F5xBEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 The Justices Behind ''Roe v. Wade'': The Inside Story, Adapted from The Brethren] by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2021, page 96&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, Black and Harlan had been replaced by William Rehnquist and [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.]], but the first argument had already occurred before they became Supreme Court justices.&lt;ref name="greenhouse81–88"/&gt; Justice Blackmun worked on a preliminary opinion for ''Roe'' which argued that Texas's law was unconstitutionally vague.&lt;ref name=schwartz103&gt;{{harvp|Schwartz|1988|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach accommodated the claims of some doctors who were concerned that prosecutors might disagree with them over what constituted "life". Blackmun thought this approach would be a good way to avoid controversy which would come with saying there was a fundamental right to abortion. Brennan and Douglas disagreed with Blackmun and wrote to him that instead he needed to focus on privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2010/05/Goluboff_0.pdf Dispatch from the Supreme Court Archives: Vagrancy, Abortion, and What the Links Between Them Reveal About the History of Fundamental Rights] by Risa L. Goluboff, ''Stanford Law Review'' Volume 62, Issue 5, page 1379 (page 20 of the pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; After communicating with the other justices, Blackmun felt that his opinion did not adequately reflect his liberal colleagues' views.&lt;ref name="greenhouse81–88"&gt;{{harvp|Greenhouse|2005|pp=81–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1972, the court issued a ruling in ''[[Eisenstadt v.

In May 1972, Blackmun proposed that the case be reargued. Justice Douglas threatened to write a dissent from the [[:wikt:reargument|reargument]] order because he and the other liberal justices were suspicious that Rehnquist and Powell would vote to uphold the [[Texas abortion statutes (1961)|Texas abortion statutes]]. He was coaxed out of the action by his colleagues, and instead his dissent was merely mentioned in the reargument order without further statement or opinion.{{sfnp|Garrow|1994|p=556}}{{sfnp|Greenhouse|2005|p=89}} The case was reargued on October 11, 1972.

===Drafting the opinion===
[[File:George Frampton (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|George Frampton, [[law clerk]] to {{nowrap|Justice Harry Blackmun}} during the 1971–72 term]]
Blackmun continued to work on his opinions in both cases over the summer recess, even though there was no guarantee that he would be assigned to write them again. Over the recess, he spent a week researching the history of abortion at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in Minnesota, where he had worked in the 1950s. He talked daily on the phone with [[George T. Frampton|George Frampton]], his 28-year-old law clerk who stayed behind in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=browder93&gt;{{cite book |last1=Browder |first1=Sue Ellen |title=Subverted: How I Helped the Sexual Revolution Hijack the Women's Movement |date=2015 |publisher=Ignatius Press |isbn=978-1-58617-796-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/subvertedhowihel00brow/page/93 93]–94 |url=https://archive.org/details/subvertedhowihel00brow |url-access=registration |quote=george frampton jr. |access-date=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frampton researched the history of abortion using a book authored by Lawrence Lader, the founding chairman of what is now called [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]].

The historical survey for ''Roe'' also referenced two articles by Cyril Means,&lt;ref&gt;In the [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/#tab-opinion-1950137 ''Roe v.

Tundermann about Means's scholarship. The memo stated that the conclusions in Means's articles "sometimes strain credibility."&lt;ref name=keown/&gt; It also stated:&lt;ref name=keown/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Where the important thing is to win the case no matter how, however, I suppose I agree with Means's technique: begin with a scholarly attempt at historical research; if it doesn't work, fudge it as necessary; write a piece so long that others will read only your introduction and conclusion; then keep citing it until courts begin picking it up. This preserves the guise of impartial scholarship while advancing the proper ideological goals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the Court held the second argument session, Powell said he would agree with Blackmun's conclusion but pushed for ''Roe'' to be the lead of the two abortion cases being considered. Powell also suggested that the Court strike down the Texas law on privacy grounds. Byron White was unwilling to sign on to Blackmun's opinion, and Justice Rehnquist had already decided to dissent.{{sfnp|Greenhouse|2005|pp=93–95}}

During the drafting process, the justices discussed the trimester framework at great length. Powell had suggested that the point where the state could intervene be placed at viability, which [[Thurgood Marshall]] supported as well.{{sfnp|Greenhouse|2005|pp=96–97}} In an internal memo to the other justices before the majority decision was published, Justice Blackmun wrote: "You will observe that I have concluded that the end of the first trimester is critical. This is arbitrary, but perhaps any other selected point, such as [[quickening]] or viability, is equally arbitrary."&lt;ref name=revelations/&gt; In the same memo he suggested that the end of the first trimester seemed more likely to get support from other justices and allowed states the ability to adjust their statutes. He was of the impression that doctors were concerned that recovering abortion patients would take up too many hospital beds, and that abortion patients later than the first trimester were more likely to require hospital beds than those whose fetuses were aborted earlier.&lt;ref name=revelations&gt;[http://www.davidgarrow.com/File/DJG%202000%20AmLawRoevWadeLFP.pdf Revelations on the Road to Roe] by David Garrow, ''American Lawyer'', Volume 22, May 2000, page 4 of the pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the justices who preferred viability, Douglas preferred the first-trimester line.&lt;ref name=savagelatimes&gt;{{cite news |last1=Savage |first1=David G. |title=Roe Ruling: More Than Its Author Intended |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-sep-14-na-abortion14-story.html |access-date=October 11, 2021 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart said the lines were "legislative" and wanted more flexibility and consideration paid to state legislatures, though he joined Blackmun's decision.&lt;ref&gt;Kmiec, Douglas.

== Supreme Court decision ==
On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7–2 decision in favor of "Jane Roe" (Norma McCorvey) holding that women in the United States had a fundamental right to choose whether to have abortions without excessive government restriction and striking down Texas's abortion ban as [[unconstitutional]]. The decision was issued together with a decision in ''Roe''{{'s}} [[companion case]], ''Doe v. Bolton'', which involved a similar challenge to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s abortion laws.&lt;ref name=mears_01222003/&gt;

Larry Hammond, a law clerk for Powell, gave a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reporter a copy of the decision "[[on background]]", expecting that it would be issued by the court before the next issue of ''Time'' was published; however, due to a delay in the decision's release, the text of the decision appeared on newsstands a few hours before it was published by the court. Burger demanded a meeting with ''Time''{{'s}} editors and punishment for the leaker.&lt;ref name="leak" /&gt; Powell refused Hammond's resignation, on the grounds that "Hammond had been double-crossed" by the reporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robenalt |first1=James |title=January 1973: Watergate, Roe v.

===Opinion of the Court===

Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] wrote the majority [[Judicial opinion|opinion]] and was joined by Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] and Justices [[Potter Stewart]], [[William J. Brennan Jr.]], [[William O. Douglas]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], and [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.]]

==== Mootness ====
After reciting the facts of the case, the Court's opinion first addressed procedure and [[justiciability]]. This included [[mootness]], a legal doctrine that prevents American federal courts from hearing cases that have ceased to be "live" controversies because of intervening events.{{sfnp|Lee|1992|pp=610–11}} Under a normal application of the doctrine, McCorvey's appeal would have been considered moot because she had already given birth to her child and therefore no longer had a pregnancy to abort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abernathy|first=M.|year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tHhlYpWokFIC|title=Civil Liberties Under the Constitution|publisher=U. South Carolina|page=4|isbn=978-0-87249-854-9 |access-date=February 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court concluded that an established exception to the mootness doctrine allows consideration of cases that are "capable of repetition, yet evading review".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Federal Jurisdiction |series=Introduction to Law |first=Erwin |last=Chemerinsky |author-link=Erwin Chemerinsky |edition=4th |publisher=Aspen Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7355-2718-8 |page=132 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgpGAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackmun noted that McCorvey might get pregnant again, and pregnancy would normally conclude more quickly than an [[Appeal#Appellate procedure|appellate process]]: "If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy [[litigation]] seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied."&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/#tab-opinion-1950137 ''Roe'', 410 U.S.] at 125; see also {{harvp|Schwartz|1988|pp=108–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Abortion and right to privacy ====
After dealing with mootness and [[Standing (law)|standing]], the Court proceeded to the main issue of the case: the constitutionality of Texas's abortion law. The Court first surveyed abortion's status throughout the history of [[Roman law]] and the English and early American common law.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} It also reviewed the developments of medical procedures and technology used in abortions.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}

After its historical surveys, the Court introduced the concept of a constitutional "[[Right to privacy#United States|right to privacy]]" that it said had been intimated in earlier decisions such as ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' and ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'', which involved parental control over [[Parenting|childrearing]], and ''Griswold v. Connecticut'', which involved the use of contraception.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} Then, "with virtually no further explanation of the privacy value",{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&amp;nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}} the Court ruled that regardless of exactly which provisions were involved, the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of liberty covered a right to privacy that protected a pregnant woman's decision whether to abort a pregnancy.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}
{{Blockquote
|text=This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether to terminate her pregnancy.

}}
The Court reasoned that outlawing abortions would infringe a pregnant woman's right to privacy for several reasons: having unwanted children "may force upon the woman a distressful life and future"; it may bring imminent psychological harm; caring for the child may tax the mother's physical and mental health; and because there may be "distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}, quoting ''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 153.&lt;/ref&gt; But at the same time, the Court rejected the notion that this right to privacy was absolute.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} It held instead that women's abortion right must be balanced against other [[government interest]]s, such as protecting [[maternal health]] and protecting the life of the fetus.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} The Court held that these government interests were sufficiently compelling to permit states to impose some limitations on pregnant women's right to choose to have an abortion.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}}
{{Blockquote
|text=A State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. ... We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation.
|source=''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 154.
}}
Texas's lawyers had argued that limiting abortion to situations where the mother's life was in danger was justified because life began at the moment of [[Fertilisation#Humans|conception]], and therefore the state's governmental interest in protecting prenatal life applied to all pregnancies regardless of their [[Prenatal development|stage]].{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&amp;nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}} The Court said that there was no indication that the Constitution's uses of the word "[[Legal person|person]]" were meant to include fetuses, and it rejected Texas's argument that a fetus should be considered a "person" with a legal and constitutional [[right to life]].{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, pp. 887–88}} The Court observed that there was still great disagreement over when an unborn fetus becomes a living being.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, pp. 887–88}}

}}

{{anchor|trimester}}

To balance women's rights to privacy and state governments' interests in protecting mothers' health and prenatal life, the Court created the [[Trimester (pregnancy)|trimester]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/roe_v_wade_(1973)|title=Roe v.

Having completed its analysis, the Court concluded that Texas's abortion statutes were unconstitutional and struck them down.
{{blockquote|A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type, that excepts from criminality only a life-saving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.|source=''Roe'', 410 U.S. at 164.}}

==== Concurrences ====
Three justices from the majority filed [[concurring opinion]]s in the case. Justice Potter Stewart wrote a concurring opinion in which he said that even though the Constitution makes no mention of the right to choose to have an abortion without interference, he thought the Court's decision was a permissible interpretation of the doctrine of [[substantive due process]], which says that the [[Due Process Clause]]{{'s}} protection of liberty extends beyond simple procedures and protects certain fundamental rights.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 888, note 47}}{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&amp;nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}} Justice William O. Douglas's concurring opinion described his view that although the Court was correct to find that the right to choose to have an abortion was a fundamental right, he thought it would have been better to derive it from the Ninth Amendment{{mdash}}which states that the fact that a [[Unenumerated rights|right is not specifically enumerated]] in the Constitution shall not be construed to mean that American people do not possess it{{mdash}}rather than through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 888, note 47}}{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&amp;nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}}

Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote a concurrence in which he wrote that he thought it would be permissible to allow a state to require two physicians to certify an abortion before it could be performed.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 888, note 47}} His concurrence also states:&lt;ref name=burgerconcurring&gt;[http://landmarkcases.c-span.org/pdf/Roe_Burger_Concurrence.pdf ''Roe v.

Plainly, the Court today rejects any claim that the Constitution requires abortions on demand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been interpreted as Chief Justice Burger thinking that medical standards and judgment would restrict the number of abortions. Instead of the law restricting abortions to limited circumstances as pre-''Roe'', now doctors would get to do the restricting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2012&amp;context=clevstlrev Judges as Medical Decision Makers: Is the Cure Worse than the Disease] by Alan A. Stone, ''Cleveland State Law Review'', Volume 33, Issue 4, 1984, page 580 (page 3 of the pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of ''Roe'' appears to be related to several statements in the majority opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2012&amp;context=clevstlrev Judges as Medical Decision Makers: Is the Cure Worse than the Disease] by Alan A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...{{nbsp}}the Court does not today hold that the Constitution compels abortion on demand. It does not today pronounce that a pregnant woman has an absolute right to abortion. It does, for the first trimester of pregnancy, cast the abortion decision and the responsibility for it upon the attending physician.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These statements appear to indicate that the justices voting in the majority thought that patients had personal physicians. Earlier in American history it was once common for people to have individual doctors, but the nature of doctor-patient relationship had already changed prior to ''Roe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2012&amp;context=clevstlrev|title=Judges as Medical Decision Makers: Is the Cure Worse than the Disease|first=Alan A.|last=Stone|journal=Cleveland State Law Review|volume=33|number=4|year=1984|pages=581–582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justices [[Byron White]] and [[William Rehnquist]] dissented from the Court's decision.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&amp;nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}}  White's dissent, which was issued with ''Roe''{{'s}} companion case, ''Doe v. Bolton'', argued that the Court had no basis for deciding between the competing values of pregnant women and unborn children. 
{{Blockquote
|text=I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to support the Court's judgment. The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant women and, with scarcely any reason or authority for its action, invests that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes. The upshot is that the people and the legislatures of the 50 States are constitutionally disentitled to weigh the relative importance of the continued existence and development of the fetus, on the one hand, against a spectrum of possible impacts on the woman, on the other hand. As an exercise of raw judicial power, the Court perhaps has authority to do what it does today; but, in my view, its judgment is an improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of [[Judicial review in the United States|judicial review]] that the Constitution extends to this Court.

}}
White also argued that the legality of abortion, "for the most part, should be left with the people and the political processes the people have devised to govern their affairs."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=§&amp;nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 888}}, quoting ''Doe'', 410 U.S. at 222 (White, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Rehnquist's dissent compared the majority's use of substantive due process to the Court's repudiated use of the doctrine in the 1905 case ''[[Lochner v. New York]]''.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=§&amp;nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}} He elaborated on several of White's points and asserted that the Court's historical analysis was flawed.
{{blockquote|To reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or [[Territories of the United States#Governments and legislatures|territorial legislatures]] limiting abortion. While many States have amended or updated their laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today.

From this historical record, Rehnquist wrote, "There apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted." He concluded "the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Drafters|drafters]] did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKjOeBQIcc8C&amp;pg=PA602|title=American Constitutional Law: Essays, Cases, and Comparative Notes|last1=Kommers|first1=Donald P.|last2=Finn|first2=John E.|last3=Jacobsohn|first3=Gary J.|date=2004|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-2687-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support for ''Roe'' and abortion rights ===
==== 1960s–1970s ====
In the 1960s, there was an alliance between the [[population control movement]] and the [[abortion-rights movement in the United States]].&lt;ref name=ziegler98/&gt; [[Abortion rights]] were especially supported by younger women within the [[population control]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2015|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperation was mostly due to [[feminists]] who wanted some of the popularity already enjoyed by the population control movement. In addition, population control advocates thought that legalizing abortion would help solve the coming population crisis that demographers had projected.&lt;ref name=ziegler98/&gt;

In 1973, [[Hugh Moore (businessman)|Hugh Moore]]'s [[Population Crisis Committee]] and [[John D. Rockefeller III]]'s [[Population Council]] both publicly supported abortion rights following ''Roe''.&lt;ref name=ziegler117&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2015|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, public support for abortion rights within the population control movement instead came from less established organizations such as [[Zero Population Growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2013|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exception was [[Planned Parenthood-World Population]], which supported repealing all laws against abortion in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;In 1969, Planned Parenthood-World Population took a position in favor of repealing all laws against abortion; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=-3J_3pDNZlkC&amp;pg=PA744 Gender and Women's Leadership: A Reference Handbook] by Karen O'Connor, London: SAGE Publications, 2010, page 744; the Planned Parenthood organization had merged with the World Population Emergency Campaign organization in 1961 to create Planned Parenthood-World Population; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=rwU3AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA916 Population Crisis], Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Foreign Aid Expenditures of the Committee on Government Operations, United States Senate, Eighty-Ninth Congress, First Session on S. 1676, June 29; July 9–24, 1965, Part 2-A, page 916; the merger occurred during a shift within the birth control movement away from individual health and towards population control; see [https://books.google.com/books?id=SNs1AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6742 Competitive Problems in the Drug Industry], Hearings before the Subcommittee on Monopoly of the Select Committee on Small Business. United States Senate, Ninety-First Congress, First session on Present Status of Competition in the Pharmaceutical Industry, February 24 – March 4, 1970, Part 16, Oral Contraceptives (Volume Two), page 6742&lt;/ref&gt; Together, population control and abortion rights advocates voiced the benefits of legalized abortion such as smaller welfare costs, fewer illegitimate births, and slower population growth.&lt;ref name=ziegler98/&gt; At the same time, the use of these arguments put them at odds with [[civil-rights movement]] leaders and [[Black Power]] activists who were concerned that abortion would be used to eliminate non-whites.&lt;ref name=ziegler98&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2015|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. Rap Brown]] denounced abortion as "black genocide",&lt;ref name=ziegler115&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2015|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dick Gregory]] said that his "answer to genocide, quite simply, is eight Black kids and another one on the way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dS4eA77qau0C&amp;pg=PA215|title=Black Maverick: T.R.M.

Soon after ''Roe'', the population control movement suffered setbacks, which caused the movement to lose political support and instead appear divisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2013|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, 1973, a lawsuit was filed concerning [[the Relf sisters]], 14-year old Minnie Lee and her 12-year-old sister Alice Lee. A worker at a federally-funded family planning clinic lied to their illiterate mother, saying they would get birth control shots. Instead, the Relf sisters were sterilized without their knowledge or consent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://voicesofthecivilrightsmovement.com/video-collection/2015/12/04/relf-sisters-sue-for-involuntary-sterilization Relf Sisters Sue for Involuntary Sterilization], Moments in the Civil Rights Movement, ''Voices of the Civil Rights Movement'', ''Comcast/NBC Universal'', April 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; During the next fifteen months, 80 additional women came forward about their forced sterilizations, all belonging to minority races. Concerns rose that abortions would also become compulsory.&lt;ref name="ziegler117"/&gt; During the 1974 [[World Population Conference]] in [[Bucharest]], Romania, most developing nations argued that the developed nations' focus on population growth was an attempt to avoid solving the deeper causes of underdevelopment, such as the unequal structure of international relations.&lt;ref name=dobos/&gt; Instead, they wanted more favorable terms under the [[New International Economic Order]]. A draft plan with fertility targets was strongly opposed by the developing countries, which surprised the delegations from the United States, Canada, and Great Britain.&lt;ref name=dobos&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/eceu/45/2-3/article-p215_215.xml?language=en|title=Global Challenges, Local Knowledges: Politics and Expertise at the World Population Conference in Bucharest|first=Corina|last=Doboș|journal=East Central Europe|volume=45|date=November 29, 2018|pages=219–220|doi=10.1163/18763308-04502004 |s2cid=195477022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final plan omitted fertility targets and instead stated, "A population policy may have a certain success if it constitutes an integral part of socio-economic development."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C11EAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22A+population+policy+may%22&amp;pg=RA5-PA15 Translations on Sub-Saharan Africa], United States Joint Publications Research Service circular #72986, issue number 2074 March 13, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

As members questioned the political benefits of population control rhetoric, the abortion-rights movement distanced itself from the population control movement.&lt;ref name=ziegler36&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2013|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1973, Robin Elliott circulated a memo to other Planned Parenthood members concerning opposition to "Planned Parenthood's credibility in its reference to the population problem".&lt;ref name=ziegler36/&gt; Instead, she thought they should use ''Roe'' inspired rhetoric about "the reaffirmation of commitment to freedom of choice in parenthood."&lt;ref name=ziegler36/&gt; By 1978, a NARAL handbook denounced population control.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2013|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Into the 21st century, advocates of ''Roe'' describe it as vital to the preservation of [[women's rights]], personal freedom, bodily integrity, and privacy. Advocates have also reasoned that access to safe abortion and reproductive freedom generally are [[fundamental rights]]. Supporters of ''Roe'' contend that even if abortion rights are also supported by another portion of the constitution, the decision in 1973 accurately founds the right in the Fourteenth Amendment. Others support ''Roe'' despite concern that the fundamental right to abortion is found elsewhere in the Constitution but not in the portions referenced in the 1973 decision.&lt;ref name="Koppelman"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090225130324/http://www.law1.northwestern.edu/faculty/fulltime/koppelman/forcedlabor.pdf "Forced Labor: A Thirteenth Amendment Defense of Abortion"], Archived February 25, 2009, by Andrew Koppelman, ''Northwestern Law Review'', Vol. 84, p. 480 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balkin"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Us-277i9ZJYC&amp;pg=PP1 What Roe v.

==== Opposition to ''Roe'' but support for abortion rights ====

Some in academia have equated the denial of abortion rights to compulsory motherhood, and reason that because of this abortion bans violate the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]: "When women are compelled to carry and bear children, they are subjected to 'involuntary servitude' in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment. Even if the woman has stipulated to have consented to the risk of pregnancy, that does not permit the state to force her to remain pregnant."&lt;ref name="Koppelman" /&gt; In 1993, a district court rejected an attempt to justify abortion rights apart from ''Roe'' and instead upon the basis that pregnancy and childrearing constituted [[involuntary servitude]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/828/1544/2352063/|title=Jane L. v.

In response to ''Roe v. Wade'', most states enacted or attempted to enact laws limiting or regulating abortion, such as laws requiring [[parental consent]] or parental notification for minors to obtain abortions; spousal mutual consent laws; [[Paternal rights and abortion|spousal notification]] laws; laws requiring abortions to be performed in hospitals, not clinics; laws barring state funding for abortions; laws banning [[intact dilation and extraction]], also known as partial-birth abortion; laws requiring waiting periods before abortions; and laws mandating that women read certain types of literature and watch a [[Obstetric ultrasonography|fetal ultrasound]] before undergoing an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Guttmacher Institute, "[http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_OAL.pdf State Policies in Brief, An Overview of Abortion Laws (PDF)]", published January 1, 2007.

The Supreme Court struck down some state [[Types of abortion restrictions in the United States|restrictions]] in a long series of cases stretching from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, but upheld restrictions on funding, including the Hyde Amendment, in the case of ''Harris v.

===Responses within the legal profession===
[[Modern liberalism in the United States|Liberal]] and [[feminist]] legal scholars have had various reactions to ''Roe'', not always giving the decision unqualified support. One argument is that Justice Blackmun reached the correct result but went about it the wrong way.&lt;ref name="Balkin 2001"&gt;[[Jack Balkin|Balkin, Jack]].

[[David Garrow]] said that the decision in ''Roe'' and also ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' "owed a great amount of their substance and language" to Justice Blackmun's [[law clerks]], George Frampton and Randall Bezanson. He thought the extent of their contributions were remarkable, and that the clerks exhibited an "unusually assertive and forceful manner" in voicing their views to Justice Blackmun. In his research, it was the earliest significant example he found of this behavior pattern, which grew more consistent later on. In Garrow's evaluation, the clerks' contributions were "historically significant and perhaps decisive" in shaping the two decisions.&lt;ref name=garrow&gt;[https://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/May-June-2005/feature_garrow_mayjun05.msp The Brains Behind Blackmun] by David J. Garrow, ''Legal Affairs: The Magazine at the intersection of law and life'', May/June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Garrow, [[Edward Lazarus]] said that Justice Blackmun's later clerks like himself did not need as much direction on reproductive rights since they had Justice Blackmun's prior opinions to draw from. Lazarus thought that on at least some occasions when legal formulations were created for opinions to be published in Justice Blackmun's name, the justice himself was not engaged in originating every significant thought pattern that they employed. Lazarus agreed that Garrow's depiction of how the trimester framework came about was an example of one of these occasions.&lt;ref name=garrow/&gt; He concluded: "The problem of excessive clerk delegation was less serious in Blackmun's chambers than Garrow suggests but is also more commonplace among the justices. The modern Supreme Court has deep problems in its decisional culture and the overuse of law clerks is an aspect of this."&lt;ref name=Lazarus&gt;[https://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/May-June-2005/feature_response_mayjun05.msp Readers Respond: Justice Blackmun], letter by Edward Lazarus, ''Legal Affairs: The Magazine at the intersection of law and life'', May/June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], while agreeing with the decision, suggested that it should have been more narrowly focused on the issue of privacy. According to Stevens, if the decision had avoided the trimester framework and simply stated that the right to privacy included a right to choose abortion, "it might have been much more acceptable" from a legal standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Rosen|first=Jeffrey|author-link=Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic)|title=The Dissenter|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/magazine/23stevens-t.html|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=September 23, 2007 }} Rosen notes that Stevens is "the oldest and arguably most liberal justice".&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining the Court, Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] criticized the decision for venturing "too far in the change it ordered".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2961&amp;context=nclr Some Thoughts on Autonomy and Equality in Relation to ''Roe v.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, the ruling about that surprised me. Frankly I had thought that at the time ''Roe'' was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don't want to have too many of. So that ''Roe'' was going to be then set up for Medicaid funding for abortion. Which some people felt would risk coercing women into having abortions when they didn't really want them. But when the court decided ''McRae'', the case came out the other way. And then I realized that my perception of it had been altogether wrong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Watergate]] prosecutor [[Archibald Cox]] thought the "failure to confront the issue in principled terms leaves the opinion to read like a set of hospital rules and regulations whose validity is good enough this week but will be destroyed with new statistics upon the medical risks of child birth and abortion or new advances in providing for the separate existence of a fetus.

[[Richard Epstein]] thought that the majority opinion relied on a book written by [[William Lloyd Prosser]] about [[tort]] law when it stated that it "is said" recovery of [[damages]] was allowed "only if the fetus was viable, or at least quick, when the injuries were sustained".&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/#tab-opinion-1950137 ''Roe'', 410 U.S.] at 161&lt;/ref&gt; He compared this to what was in fact written in the book,&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of Torts'' by William Lloyd Prosser, 4th edition, St Paul, Minnesota: West Publishing, 1971, page 337&lt;/ref&gt; which was that "when actually faced with the issue for decision, almost all of the jurisdictions have allowed recovery even though the injury occurred during the early weeks of pregnancy, when the child was neither viable nor quick."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/supremecourtrevi0000unse_z3m8/page/174/mode/1up?view=theater Substantive Due Process by any other name: The Abortion Cases] by Richard A.

[[Matt Bruenig]], lawyer and founder of the [[People's Policy Project]], criticized ''Roe'' as being "weaker than normal" and observed that similarly broad interpretations of the Constitution could be used to argue the opposite outcome, saying "right now we have a constitutional right to an abortion—you could also constitutionally ban abortion. If you wanted to, someone could bring a case, file it in a district court, hit the appeal button twice, and then if you get five judges together, the opinion would be the easiest thing in the world to write. You would say, 'the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to life, liberty, and property without due process and all that shit. So we're looking at that, and we think that abortion takes a life and so we think that in fact states may not permit abortion'.

=== Later responses by those involved ===

==== Harry Blackmun ====
Justice Blackmun, who authored the ''Roe'' decision, subsequently had mixed feelings about his role in the case. During a 1974 television interview, he stated that ''Roe'' "will be regarded as one of the worst mistakes in the court's history or one of its great decisions, a turning point."&lt;ref name=scsentinel&gt;[https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&amp;d=SCS19830116.1.65&amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 Legalized abortion a decade later], ''Santa Cruz Sentinel'', Volume 127, Number 13, January 16, 1983
&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1983 interview for a newspaper journalist, he responded that he was "mildly annoyed at those, law professors included, who personalize it" because "it was a decision of the court, not my decision. There were seven votes." As a Methodist, he felt hurt that Methodist pastors wrote condemning letters to him, but as time passed, the letters did not hurt "as much anymore". In defense he responded, "People misunderstand. I am not for abortion. I hope my family never has to face such a decision", noting that "I still think it was a correct decision" because "we were deciding a constitutional issue, not a moral one."&lt;ref name=nytimes1983&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/18/us/blackmun-accepts-aftermath-of-writing-abortion-opinion.html|title=Blackmun Accepts Aftermath of Writing Abortion Opinion|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 18, 1983|page=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described ''Roe'' as "a no-win case" and predicted that, "fifty years from now, depending on the fate of the proposed constitutional amendment, abortion probably will not be as great a legal issue. I think it will continue to be a moral issue, however."&lt;ref name=scsentinel/&gt;
He reflected that his role in the decision meant he was most known as the "author of the abortion decision". His response was that "we all pick up tags. I'll carry this one to my grave" and "so be it".&lt;ref name=nytimes1983/&gt;

In 1987, Justice Blackmun explained in a letter to Chief Justice Rehnquist:&lt;ref name=forsythe18&gt;{{harvnb|Forsythe|2013|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember that the old Chief appointed a screening committee, chaired by Potter, to select those cases that could (it was assumed) be adequately heard by a Court of seven. I was on that little committee. We did not do a good job. Potter pressed for ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Doe v. Bolton'' to be heard and did so in the misapprehension that they involved nothing more than an application of ''Younger v. Harris''. How wrong we were.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1991, he regretted how the Court decided to hear ''Roe'' and ''Doe'' in a televised interview: "It was a serious mistake{{nbsp}}... We did a poor job. I think the committee should have deferred them until we had a full Court."&lt;ref name=forsythe19&gt;{{harvnb|Forsythe|2013|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, he stood by the analytical framework he established in ''Roe'' during the subsequent ''Casey'' case.&lt;ref name=Blackmun&gt;''Casey'', 505 U.S. at 930–34 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("In sum, ''Roe''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s requirement of strict scrutiny as implemented through a trimester framework should not be disturbed.").&lt;/ref&gt; He often gave speeches and lectures promoting ''Roe v. Wade'' and criticizing ''Roe''{{'}}s critics.{{sfnp|Greenhouse|2005|pp=183–206, 250}}

==== Norma McCorvey ====

[[Norma McCorvey]] would later claim that, during the 1970s although some years after ''Roe'', she had a nightmare concerning "little babies lying around with daggers in their hearts". This was the first of a series of recurring [[nightmare]]s which kept her awake at night.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dj2CAlbeX8UC&amp;pg=PT38 Won by Love: Norma McCorvey, Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade, Speaks Out for the Unborn as She Shares Her New Conviction For Life] by Norma McCorvey and Gary Thomas, Nashville, Tennessee: Thomas Nelson, 1997, Chapter 5, The Shadow Plaintiff pages 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; She became worried and wondered, "What really, had I done?"&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dj2CAlbeX8UC&amp;pg=PT38 Won by Love: Norma McCorvey, Jane Roe of Roe v.

McCorvey later reflected:&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dj2CAlbeX8UC&amp;pg=PT39 Won by Love: Norma McCorvey, Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade, Speaks Out for the Unborn as She Shares Her New Conviction For Life] by Norma McCorvey and Gary Thomas, Nashville, Tennessee: Thomas Nelson, 1997, Chapter 5, The Shadow Plaintiff pages 39&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I couldn't get the thought out of my mind. I realize it sounds very naïve, especially for a woman who had already conceived and delivered three children. Though I had seen and experienced more than my share of the world, there were some things about which I still didn't have a clue—and this was one of them. Ironically enough, Jane Roe may have known less about abortion than anyone else.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the years after ''Roe'', although not immediately, McCorvey joined with and accompanied others in the abortion rights movement. During this time, McCorvey stated that she had publicly lied about being raped and apologized for making the false rape claim.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/153030575/ This Woman and This Man Made History] by Lloyd Shearer, Parade magazine, May 8, 1983; for a book which relied on Shearer, see [https://archive.org/details/stormcentersupre00davi/page/22/mode/2up Storm center: the Supreme Court in American politics] by David M.

In 2002, along with [[Sandra Cano (Mary Doe)]] from ''Doe v. Bolton'' and [[Bernard Nathanson]], a co-founder of NARAL Pro-Choice America, McCorvey appeared in a television advertisement intended to get the [[Presidency of George W.

As a party to the original litigation, she sought to reopen the case in [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in Texas to have ''Roe v. Wade'' overturned.

''Roe'' is embedded in a long line of cases concerning personal liberty in the realm of privacy, since ''Roe'' was based on individual liberty cases concerning privacy like ''[[Meyer v.

Prior to ''Roe'', the [[New Jersey Superior Court#Chancery Division|Chancery Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey]] found that a pregnant [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]] woman could be ordered to submit to lifesaving [[blood transfusion]]s due to the state's compelling interest "to save her life and the life of her unborn child."&lt;ref name=raleighfitkinpaulmorgan&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/1964/42-n-j-421-0.html ''Raleigh Fitkin-Paul Morgan Mem.

President Reagan, who supported legislative restrictions on abortion, began [[Appointments Clause#Nomination|making federal judicial appointments]] in 1981.

In addition to Justices White and Rehnquist, Reagan-appointee Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] began dissenting from the Court's abortion cases, arguing in 1983 that the trimester-based analysis devised by the ''Roe'' Court was "unworkable."&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=City of Akron v.

The justices voting in the majority on the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] in pre-unification [[West Germany]] rejected the trimester framework in the ''[[German Constitutional Court abortion decision, 1975]]'' on the basis that development during pregnancy is a continuous whole rather than made up of three trimesters. The Court found that the right to life extends also to the unborn and that life begins on the fourteenth day after conception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=law_faculty_scholarship Abortion and Constitution: United States and West Germany] by Donald P. Kommers,  1977, page 267 (page 14 of the pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the liberties of pregnant mothers were qualified by the existence of another life inside them. The Court found that "A compromise which guarantees the protection of the life of the one about to be born and permits the pregnant woman the freedom of abortion is not possible since the interruption of pregnancy always means the destruction of the unborn life."&lt;ref name=rauch/&gt; It ruled that the fetus must be protected, and the first responsibility for this lies with the mother, with a second responsibility in the hands of the [[Politics of Germany#Legislature|legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=law_faculty_scholarship Abortion and Constitution: United States and West Germany] by Donald P.

Legislation allowing abortion could be constitutional if the rights of the unborn persons were acknowledged in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=law_faculty_scholarship Abortion and Constitution: United States and West Germany] by Donald P. Kommers,  1977, page 269 (page 16 of the pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two minority justices in the ruling for the German Constitutional Court abortion decision in 1975 remarked that "the Supreme Court of the United States has even regarded punishment for the interruption of pregnancy, performed by a physician with the consent of the pregnant woman in the first third of pregnancy, as a violation of fundamental rights. This would, according to German constitutional law, go too far indeed."&lt;ref name=rauch&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/germandecision/german_abortion_decision2.html |first=Robert E. |last=Jonas |author2=John D.

In 1988, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] used the rulings in both ''Roe'' and ''Doe v.

In ''Floyd v. Anders'', 440 F. Supp. 535 (D.S.C. 1977), South Carolina attempted to prosecute a doctor for illegal abortion and murder after he attempted to abort an African American boy at 25 weeks.

=== ''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services'' ===
In a 5–4 decision in 1989's ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'', Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, declined to explicitly overrule ''Roe'', because "none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri Act properly before us conflict with the Constitution." In particular, the Court found that the ability to have a nontherapeutic abortion was not an affirmative right of the sort that required the state to pay for it.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{ussc|name=Webster v. Reproductive Health Services|volume=492|page=490|pin=|year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the Court upheld several abortion restrictions, and modified the ''Roe'' trimester framework.&lt;ref name="Webster"/&gt;

In concurring opinions, Justice O'Connor refused to reconsider ''Roe'', and Justice Antonin Scalia criticized the Court and Justice O'Connor for not overruling ''Roe''.&lt;ref name="Webster"/&gt; Justice Blackmun stated in his dissent that Justices White, Kennedy and Rehnquist were "callous" and "deceptive", that they deserved to be charged with "cowardice and illegitimacy", and that their [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] opinion "[[:wikt:foment#Verb|foments]] disregard for the law."&lt;ref name="Webster"/&gt; White had recently opined that the majority reasoning in ''Roe v.

During initial deliberations for ''[[Planned Parenthood v.

The plurality of justices stated that abortion-related legislation should be reviewed based on the [[undue burden standard]] instead of the strict scrutiny standard from ''Roe''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1608&amp;context=hastings_constitutional_law_quaterly The Casey Undue Burden Standard: Problems Predicted and Encountered, and the Split over the Salerno Test] by Ruth Burdick, ''Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly'', Volume 23, Issue 3, Article 8, pages 830–832, (pages 7–9 of the pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

The plurality also found that a fetus was now viable at 23 or 24 weeks rather than at the 28 week line from 1973.&lt;ref&gt;''Casey'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833#fn6-1 505 U.S. at 6.]&lt;/ref&gt; They also felt that fetal viability was "more workable" than the trimester framework.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833 ''Casey'', 505 U.S.] at 95.&lt;/ref&gt; They abandoned the trimester framework due to two basic flaws: "in its formulation it misconceives the nature of the pregnant woman's interest; and in practice it undervalues the State's interest in potential life, as recognized in ''Roe''."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833 ''Casey'', 505 U.S.] at 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Only Justice Blackmun wanted to retain ''Roe'' entirely and issue a decision completely in favor of [[Planned Parenthood]].&lt;ref name=Blackmun/&gt; Prior to this, he had considered a Pennsylvania viability-based law to be unconstitutionally vague in his majority opinion for ''[[Colautti v. Franklin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/439/379/ ''Colautti v. Franklin'', 439 U.S. 379 (1979)], ''justia.com'', "The viability determination requirement of § 5(a) is void for vagueness."&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Scalia's dissent asserted that abortion is not a liberty protected by the Constitution for the same reason [[bigamy]] was not protected either: because the Constitution does not mention it, and because longstanding traditions have permitted it to be legally [[Proscription|proscribed]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833 ''Casey'', 505 U.S.] at 393–394 (Scalia, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; He also asked:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/505/833 ''Casey'', 505 U.S.] at 989 n.5 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Precisely why is it that, at the magical second when machines currently in use (though not necessarily available to the particular woman) are able to keep an unborn child alive apart from its mother, the creature is suddenly able (under our Constitution) to be protected by law, whereas before that magical second it was not? That makes no more sense than according infants legal protection only after the point when they can feed themselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' ===
[[File:Rehnquist Court in 1994.jpg|thumb|The [[Rehnquist Court]] in 1994; the members pictured are the ones who decided ''Stenberg v. Carhart''. Justice Ginsburg replaced Justice White.]]
During the 1990s, [[Nebraska]] enacted a law banning partial-birth abortion. The law allowed another second-trimester abortion procedure known as [[dilation and evacuation]]. In 2000, the Supreme Court struck down the law by a 5–4 vote in ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', with Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] writing for the majority that sometimes partial-birth abortion "would be the safest procedure".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-830.ZO.html ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' (99–830) 530 U.S. 914 (2000), Opinion of the Court], ''law.cornell.edu''&lt;/ref&gt; Justice O'Connor wrote a concurrence stating Nebraska was actually banning both abortion methods.&lt;ref&gt;"and it proscribes not only the D&amp;X procedure but also the D&amp;E procedure" [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-830.ZC1.html ''Stenberg v.

Justice Stevens stated that "the notion that either of these two equally gruesome procedures performed at this late [[Pregnancy (mammals)#Gestation periods|stage of gestation]] is more akin to infanticide than the other{{nbsp}}... is simply irrational."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-830.ZC.html ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' (99–830) 530 U.S. 914 (2000), Stevens, J., concurring], ''law.cornell.edu''&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Ginsburg stated that the "law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only 'a method of performing abortion'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-830.ZC2.html ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' (99–830) 530 U.S. 914 (2000), Ginsburg, J., concurring], ''law.cornell.edu''&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Thomas's dissent stated, "The 'partial birth' gives the fetus an autonomy which separates it from the right of the woman to choose treatments for her own body."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-830.ZD3.html ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' (99–830) 530 U.S. 914 (2000), Thomas, J., dissenting], ''law.cornell.edu''&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Scalia joined Justice Thomas's dissent and also wrote his own, stating that partial-birth abortion is "so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion" and that this case proved ''Casey'' was "unworkable".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-830.ZD1.html ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' (99–830) 530 U.S. 914 (2000), Scalia, J., dissenting], ''law.cornell.edu''&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice Rehnquist joined the two dissents by Justices Scalia and Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-830.ZD.html ''Stenberg v. Carhart'' (99–830) 530 U.S. 914 (2000), Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting], ''law.cornell.edu''&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Kennedy, who had co-authored ''Casey'', dissented in ''Stenberg''. He described in graphic detail exactly how a fetus dies while being [[Dismemberment|dismembered]] during a dilation and evacuation procedure. He reasoned that since Nebraska was not seeking to prohibit it, the state was free to ban partial-birth abortion.&lt;ref name="Stenberg"&gt;{{ussc|name=Stenberg v. Carhart|volume=530|page=914|pin=958–59|year=2000}} ("The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn from limb from limb. The fetus can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off.").&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Gonzales v. Carhart'' ===
In 2003, Congress passed the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=S.3 – Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003| date=November 5, 2003 | url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/3 |publisher=Congress.gov |access-date=May 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to a lawsuit in the case of ''[[Gonzales v.

Carhart'', 550 U.S. 124 (2007)], ''justia.com'', "Congress, it is apparent, responded to these concerns because the Act departs in material ways from the statute in Stenberg."&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2007, a 5 to 4 decision upheld the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion that Congress was within its power to ban partial-birth abortion. The Court left the door open for [[Facial challenge#Facial versus as-applied challenges|as-applied challenges]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/550/124/ ''Gonzales v. Carhart'', 550 U.S. 124 (2007)], ''justia.com'', "While it found that it was not facially unconstitutional, it did not reject the possibility of an as-applied challenge."&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion did not address whether ''Casey'' remained valid. Instead it only assumed ''Casey'' was valid "for the purposes of this opinion".&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/550/124/ ''Gonzales v.

The balance was central to its holding. We now apply its standard to the cases at bar."&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito joined the majority. Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in ''Roe v. Wade'' and ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' should be reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/550/124/#tab-opinion-1962399  Concurrence (Thomas)], ''Gonzales v.

Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justices Stevens, [[David Souter|Souter]], and Breyer, dissented,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; contending that the ruling ignored precedent and that abortion rights should instead be justified by equality.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== ''Dubay v. Wells'' ===
[[File:David M. Lawson.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|Judge David Lawson]]

''[[Dubay v. Wells]]'' was a 2006 paternity case where a man argued he should not have to pay [[Child support in the United States|child support]] for a child he did not want to parent. The case was billed as "''Roe v. Wade'' for men".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcenterformen.org/ The National Center For Men], p.[http://www.nationalcenterformen.org/page7.shtml 7] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502152025/http://www.nationalcenterformen.org/page7.shtml |date=2018-05-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2006, Dubay filed a lawsuit before the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]]. [[Michigan Attorney General|Michigan's Attorney General]], Joel D. McGormley, made a [[Motion (legal)|motion to have the case dismissed]]. On July 17, 2006, District Court Judge [[David M. Lawson|David Lawson]] agreed and dismissed Dubay's lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/PDFFIles/06-11016.pdf ''Dubay v.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dubay's claim that a man's right to disclaim fatherhood would be analogous to a woman's right to abortion rests upon a false analogy. In the case of a father seeking to opt out of fatherhood and thereby avoid child support obligations, the child is already in existence and the state therefore has an important interest in providing for his or her support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0442p-06.pdf|title=U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, case No. 06-11016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2013, the [[Texas House Bill 2|Texas legislature enacted restrictions]] which required abortion doctors to have [[admitting privileges]] at a local hospital and required abortion clinics to have facilities equivalent to others which conducted [[outpatient surgery]].&lt;ref name=wholesyllabus/&gt; On June 27, 2016, the Supreme Court in a 5–3 decision for ''[[Whole Woman's Health v.

The majority opinion by Justice Breyer struck down these two provisions of Texas law in a [[Facial challenge|facial]] manner—that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. The ruling also stated that the task of judging whether a law puts an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion belongs with the courts and not the legislatures.&lt;ref name="20160627SCOTUSDenniston"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-abortion-rights-reemerge-strongly/|title=Whole Woman's Health v.

===''Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson''===
In 2021, the state of Texas devised a legal workaround to ''Roe'' that allowed it to successfully outlaw abortion at six weeks of pregnancy despite the continued existence of ''Roe'' and ''Casey''.

=== ''Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization'' ===
''[[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization]]'' is a case that was a legal challenge to Mississippi's 2018 [[Gestational Age Act]], which had banned abortions after 15 weeks with exceptions only for medical emergencies or fetal abnormalities. Federal courts had [[enjoined]] the state from enforcing the law after the state's only abortion clinic, [[Jackson Women's Health Organization]], filed suit immediately after passage; the federal courts stated that the law [[Legal wrong|violated]] the previously established 24-week point of viability. Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to hear the case on June 15, 2020, and the Court [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States#Selection of cases|certified the petition]] on May 17, 2021, limited to the question, "Whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional."&lt;ref name=perry/&gt; The Court chose not to take up two other questions that Mississippi wanted to bring before the Court.&lt;ref name=perry&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/LM293.pdf |title = ''Dobbs v.

On May 2, 2022, ''[[Politico]]'' released a leaked first draft of a majority opinion written by Justice [[Samuel Alito]], which had been circulated among the court in February 2022. Alito's draft wrote, "We hold that ''Roe'' and ''Casey'' must be overruled. It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives." The release of a draft opinion for a pending case was unprecedented in recent Supreme Court history. The document was not a final decision, and the justices were still able to change their votes.

On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 to uphold Mississippi's Gestational Age Act, and 5–4 to overrule ''Roe'' and ''Casey''. Similar to the leaked draft opinion, the opinion of the court written by Justice Alito stated that ''Roe'' was "egregiously wrong from the start" and its reasoning "exceptionally weak". It also stated that ''Roe'' has "enflamed debate and deepened division" and that overruling it would "return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court |date=24 June 2022 |litigants=Dobbs v.

To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception.

=== State laws regarding ''Roe'' ===
At the state level, there have been many laws about abortion. In the decade after ''Roe'', most states passed laws protecting medical workers with a [[conscientious objection to abortion]]. Nine states which had legalized abortion or loosened abortion restrictions prior to ''Roe'' already had statutory protection for those who did not want to participate in or perform an abortion. As of 2011, forty-seven states and the District of Columbia had laws allowing certain people to decline to perform certain actions or provide information related to abortion or reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarlycommons.law.emory.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1244&amp;context=elj The Constitutional Right Not to Kill] by Mark L. Rienzi, ''Emory Law Journal'', Volume 62, Issue 1, 2012, pages 148–152 (pages 29–33 of the pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; At the federal level, the [[Church Amendment of 1973]] was proposed in order to protect private hospitals objecting to abortion from being deprived of funding.

Those states include California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, and Washington.&lt;ref name="Vestal" /&gt; Other states have enacted so-called [[trigger law]]s that would take effect in the event that ''Roe v.

The Donohue–Levitt hypothesis about the [[legalized abortion and crime effect]] proposed that legalized abortion was responsible for reductions in the crime rate. If there is a relationship between abortion and crime, there are several possibilities that could explain how abortion lowers crime. One possibility is that crime is disproportionally committed by young males, and legalizing abortion reduced the number of young males. Another possibility is that children born in the post-legalization era are less likely to commit crimes. If this is the case, it might be explained in two ways. One way is that the sort of women who have abortions are not representative of pregnant women as a whole; rather they are the sort who are most likely to give birth to children who grow up to be criminals. In this way, abortion serves to [[Eugenics in the United States#Efforts to shape American families|shape American family structure]].&lt;ref name=donohue2001/&gt; Studies linking demographics to crime have found that children born to American teenagers, unmarried mothers, and mothers with lower incomes are more likely to engage in criminal activity as adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w6034/w6034.pdf Abortion Legalization and Child Living Circumstances: Who is the "Marginal Child?"] by Jonathan Gruber, Phillip Levine, and Douglas Staiger, National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper 6034, May 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion rates are higher for these demographics. A second possible way to explain it is that women use abortion to prevent births until they are most able to provide a stable home environment. Factors involved in stability include the age, education, income, of the mother, her use of drugs and alcohol, the presence of a father, and wanted as opposed to unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref name=donohue2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Donohue |first1=J.J.

The hypothesis is that people in favor of abortion rights would not parent as many children when abortion is legal, and since children tend to have similar views to their parents eventually voters would not support abortion rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930202354/http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110006557 Babies Having (Fewer) Babies] by James Taranto, wsj.com ''OpinionJournal'', Dow Jones &amp; Company, April 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have argued that Donohue and Levitt's methodologies are flawed and that no statistically significant relationship between abortion and later crime rates can be proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Handbook on Crime and Deviance |date=2019 |others=Marvin D.
