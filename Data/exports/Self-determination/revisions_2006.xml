'''Self-determination''' or '''the right to self-determination''' is a concept of [[principle]], wherein a [[people]] or [[nation]], have a [[human rights|human right]] to statehood, and that such a state has an equal right to sovereignty.

Developed at least before 1859, the self-determination concept was at the time an ethical and political statement by the world community against several hundred years of European [[colonialism]] and frequent tyrannical rule.
The concept attempted to translate the universally agreeable ethical rights of [[individuals]] (''[[political freedom]], [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of speech]]'') and apply these to peoples as a whole &amp;mdash;as like a [[humanism|humanist]] concept of [[sovereignty]].
However, because nationalities have competing and [[ethics|ethically]] equal interests, the concept has been notoriously difficult to formulate outside of particular nationalistic definitions &amp;mdash;which typically do not give equal consideration to foreign claims for self-determination. 

== History and overview ==
Many of the concepts embodied in the ideal of self-determination can be found in earlier documents such as the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence of the United States]].  
The concept of the right to self-determination of a political community can be seen to date back at least as far as 1859 with [[John Stuart Mill]]'s work ''On Liberty'' in which he argues that political communities are entitled collectively to determine their own affairs. In his work he argues that states should be seen as self-determining communities ''even if'' their internal political arrangements are not free, self-determination and political freedom are not equivalent terms.

This principle was first applied to the modern [[international relations]] context by [[Woodrow Wilson]] in his [[Fourteen Points]] of January 1918, in which he set out a blueprint for a just and lasting peace in Europe after [[World War I]].
The 1918 [[1918 Soviet Constitution|Constitution of the Soviet Union]] acknowledged this right for its sister [[republic]]s (although not for declared "[[autonomous oblast|autonomous" regions]]), but was not applied in practice until the [[Perestroika]], when it led to the [[collapse of the Soviet Union|breakup of the Soviet Union]].

At the ratification of the [[UN Charter]] in post [[World War II]] [[1945]], the signatories introduced the right of all people to self-determination into the framework of international law and diplomacy. In addition, the right to self-determination holds the prestigious position of Article 1 in both the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR).  Its presence in the two covenants points to the right's complex nature and importance.

In the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] the [[United Nations]] states that everyone has the right to a nationality and that no one should be arbitrarily deprived of a nationality or denied the right to change nationality. Self-determination is often invoked in national liberation struggles, succession of territories and constitutional disputes about how this right can be expressed to the satisfaction of opposing interest groups. 

=== In the wake of European colonialism ===
The purpose of the self determination clause in [[international law]] was to allow the former [[colony|colonies]] that existed before [[World War II]] to have a say in their future.  Some felt that after [[decolonization]], the right to self-determination should apply only to states and not to peoples, and to be circumscribed by the principles of [[territorial integrity]] and [[Non-Intervention|non-intervention]]. 

Territorial integrity can only be applied to prevent the cessation of integral parts of a state, and does not apply to decolonisation. It is clear that a colony cannot affect the territorial integrity of a country of which she does not form part. Many of the newly independent former colonies faced secessionist and [[irredentist]] movements and therefore there was an international consensus that self-determination did not apply to these movements. UN Resolution 1514(XV) was adopted and guarantees the right to self-determination of all peoples.

The [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]] in [[1948]] committed the idea of the right for self-determination to the body of international protocol. In essence, all people reserve the right to seek self-determination to address a lack of proper representation or oppression from any given government. 

There is tension between the concept of self-determination and that of [[territorial integrity]].  The prevailing force of the principle of territorial integrity was exemplified by the adherence to the principle of [[uti possidetis]] during the decolonization process (that is, the retaining of colonial borders in the birth of independent nations).  

This conflict has been resolved in practice by defining the notion of "people" entitled to self-determination as persons living in a particular geographic area within a nation-state rather than persons sharing a common culture or language.  Hence, self-determination as it is understood in the early [[21st century]] does not generally promote the political aspirations of oppressed [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]].

== Problems of nationalism and fragmentation ==
Self-determination is a notoriously difficult principle to define and apply.  
A state is self-determining even if its citizens strive, and fail, to create free political institutions, however in turn, it is deprived of its self-determination if such institutions are established by an external power. [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] argued that the members of a political community must seek their own freedom, just as they may seek to be virtuous, they cannot be 'set free' just as an individual cannot be made virtuous. In this way self-determination can be seen to be a parallel to state sovereignty.

In many cases self-determination is invoked where the there is an [[ethnic]] or religious minority within a specific geographic area seeking independence from a majority to escape prejudice or persecution.  However, the right to self-determination has been most effectively employed in the [[decolonization]] movement.  Given the perceived risk of constant fragmentation, states have approached self-determination cautiously. Methods of self-determination range from sovereignty referendum, as in the case of the people of [[1995 Quebec referendum|Quebec]] in [[Canada]], or as an armed struggle in the case of the [[Tamil Tigers]] in [[Sri Lanka]].

In [[Europe]] after [[World War I]], many of the former Empires destroyed in that war were broken up into ethnic states which themselves were amalgamations of peoples containing their own minorities, in [[Yugoslavia]], the former Russian and Austro-Hungarian provinces, and in the Middle East. In [[History of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jewish]] immigrants would claim self-determination to justify the creation of the state of [[Israel]] in the former lands of the [[Ottoman Empire]], just as [[Palestinian]]s would later claim independence as [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].

Given the rise of [[globalism|global]] [[transculturism]] and its effect on the concepts of nationality and nationhood, attempts have been made to reinterpret the "self-determination principle" in terms which do not rely on subjective or nationalistic definitions &amp;mdash; typically refomulating the principle as an extension of ''[[liberty|Right to liberty]]'', wherin a people ''ought not be subject to [[coercion]],'' via the will of a non-[[representative government|representative form]] of [[government]].

The threat of fragmentation due to self-determination can be regarded as very dangerous to other communities in a country, especially if the groups striving for self-determination live in an area with the majority of a country's wealth.  On the other hand, supporters of self-determination argue that if the wealth is coming from the land they live in the local inhabitants deserve the wealth not the country as a whole.  This is an important dimension of the the self-determination arguments in [[Iraq]] and [[Nigeria]] as well as many other countries.

== Local interpretations ==
=== Wilsonian idealism ===
Wilson's ideas of self-determination originated in his [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] heritage and sympathies. His favorite movie was ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', and his [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] beliefs and personal ties were steeped in Southern pride and resentment of [[U.S. Northern states|Northern]] power. Hence Southern interpretations of States-Rights directly led to Wilson's ideas of self-determination. Many have criticized both concepts, however, for promoting [[secession]] and division over unity. Further, the key question is at what level do populations have the right to self-determination and the formation or preservation of a state, the empowerment of a local majority, and the formation of a local minority. 
In the United States, southern states' rights to determine their own destiny during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and Civil Rights era were held to be not absolute, especially since significant minorities there were oppressed.

===Lenin on self-determination===

[[Vladimir Lenin]] supported the concept of the right of a culturally distinct grouping to self-determination, albeit within the framework of [[proletarian internationalism]] and, as it turned out in the policy of the [[Soviet Union]]. The policy of [[Korenizatsiya]] seemed to indicate a sincere belief on the part of Lenin  national self-determination. However, Lenin also assumed that the populations of the ethnically diverse [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]s were voluntarily confederated with [[Russia]] in the form of the Soviet Union. By the time the [[Nazis]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union in 1941]], some national minorities were defecting to the Nazi side in the hope of being allowed to create their own [[sovereign state]]s. {{citation needed}}

In regard to a long running argument going on between [[Rosa Luxembourg]], right-wing tendencies within the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], and the [[Bolsheviks]], Lenin said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;...[T]he tendency of every national movement is towards the formation of national states, under which these requirements of modern capitalism are best satisfied. ...  [T]he national state is typical and normal for the capitalist period. Consequently, if we want to grasp the meaning of self-determination of nations ... by examining the historico-economic conditions of the national movements, we must inevitably reach the conclusion that the self-determination of nations means the political separation of these nations from alien national bodies, and the formation of an independent national state. ...[It] would be wrong to interpret the right to self-determination as meaning-anything but the right to existence as a separate state." -Lenin, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/self-det/ch01.htm#v20pp72-395 What Is Meant By The Self-Determination of Nations?]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Australia===
{{main|Self-determination of Australian Aborigines}}
Recently (2003 onwards), self-determination has become a topic of some debate in Australia in relation to Aborigines (indigenous Australians). In the 1980s, the Aboriginal community approached the Federal Government and requested the right to administer their own communities. This encompassed basic local government functions, ranging from land dealings and management of community centres to road maintenance and garbage collection, as well as setting education programmes and standards in their local schools.

=== Self-determination issues of the United States ===
The colonisation of the North American continent and its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population has been the source of legal battles since the early 1800's. The Westward push of European-American settlers eventually brought about the destruction of most Native American cultures, and what few remained were reduced to living on [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. These had been given a certain degree of [[autonomy]], within the United States federal government, which allows for their exclusion from various national legal restrictions.

There is an active [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]] which aims at rectifying the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in the late 19th century which resulted in the incorporation of Hawaii into the United States.  They hold that self-determination was never granted to native Hawaiians after the overthrow and thus a large measure of autonomy or independence should be granted to Hawaii.  Opponents allege that this would violate the self-determination rights of the non-Hawaiian majority living in Hawaii now.

Some historians argue that the South was fighting for self-determination during the [[American Civil War]], however others argue that the point is invalid because the South was not only repressing the self-determination rights of African Americans (a majority in some of the Confederate states) but also basic human rights in the institution of [[slavery]].

Further, there have at times been calls for local self-determination by ethnic minority communities. For example, the [[Young Lords]], a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] internationalist group founded in [[Lincoln Park, Chicago]] in 1968, called not only for independence for Puerto Rico, but also for neighborhood empowerment within cities in the continental United States, which they characterized as self-determination in every ''barrio'' or neighborhood.

=== Israel and Palestine ===
The right to self-determination as outlined in [[public international law]] is often referenced by both sides in the ongoing [[Israel-Palestinian conflict]] &amp;mdash;[[Palestinian]]s assert a nationalist right to self-determination that has been and is currently hindered by Israeli policies in the regions it militarily occupies.  [[Israel]] was, in turn, formed under the right to self-determination as outlined in the U.N. Charter, and still regularly cites this principle in its defence against criticisms of its relations with Palestinians that argue that such relations imply that Israel is not a legitimate state within the international community.

British support for Zionism was originally advanced by [[Lord Palmerston]] as a means by which European [[Jew]]ry would establish an a ''[[colonialism|colonial outpost]]'' in the [[Middle East]] that would be [[Europe]]an in culture, grateful to European power, and therefore friendly to European interests. 
This purpose was in mind when the [[Mandate of Palestine]] was formed, and, according to Israel's critics, remains effective to this day. 
Hence Western [[support for Israel]] is commonly criticised by Palestinians as being ''colonialist'' in nature, and likewise Israel itself is criticised as being colonial both culturally and functionally. These criticisms exist in spite of Israeli claims to territorial precedence [[homeland]], and the anti-colonialist character of the self-determination principle. According to [[Freedom House]], Israel is the only [[liberal democracy]] in the [[Middle East]].  However, Freedom House notes that its governance of the Palestian Territories falls far short in terms of political and civil liberties.

[[Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|Jordan occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem]] (including the [[Jerusalem's Old City|Old City]]) and [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip]] from 1949 through 1967. Throughout those years, the King of Jordan had annexed the West Bank, providing its residents with citizenship, but not with the right of mobility across the Jordan River. The king forbid the use of the word "Palestine" on official documents. The Jordanian position on this was that historically the East and West Bank had been one cultural entity and thus one nationality though Palestinians dispute this.  This led to open fighting between Palestinian refugees and the Jordanian government in 1970. However, in 1988, the Jordanian government relinquished its claim to the West Bank.  Egypt never annexed the Gaza, and denied its residents of citizenship and did not allow its residents to move into Egypt or anywhere else.  Despite this Egypt was not subject to a rebellion. In fact, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] was created in 1964 by the [[Arab League]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], and was controlled by and large by the Egyptian government.  Neither country attempted to relieve the refugee crisis (although Jordan did alleviate this somewhat by granting Palestinians citizenship) and neither allowed (to different extents) self-determination in these territories.  . The PLO stated its goal to be the destruction of the State of Israel through armed struggle, and replacing it with an "independent Palestinian state" between the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  Israelis argue this would deny self-determination by the millions of Israelis now living there.
