'''Self-determination''' is defined as free choice of one’s own acts without external compulsion, and especially as the freedom of the people of a given [[territory]] to determine their own political status or [[independence]] from their current state. In other words, it is the right of the people of a certain nation to decide how they want to be governed without the influence of any other country. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-determination Merriam-Webster online dictionary]; [http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=self-determination Wordnet.Princeton definition];   [http://www.answers.com/topic/self-determination Answers.com definition].&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a complex concept with conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination.&lt;ref name="Unterberger"&gt;Betty Miller Unterberger, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5215/is_2002/ai_n19132482 Self-Determination], Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
===Pre-20th Century===
Just as [[colonisation]] and [[colonialism]] have been practiced throughout human history, political self-determination has been cherished by people through history, the ancient [[Mesopotamian]] and later [[Polis|Greek city-states]] being early examples.&lt;ref name="Unterberger"/&gt;

The revolt of the British colonists in North America has been defined as the first assertion of the right of national and democratic self-determination because of the explicit invocation of natural law, the natural rights of man and consent of, and sovereignty by, the people, ideas inspired particularly by [[John Locke]]’s writings. Thomas Jefferson furthered promoted the notion that the will of the people was supreme, especially through authorship of the [[Declaration of Independence]] which inspired [[Europe]]ans throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Unterberger"/&gt; The French Revolution also was motivated by and legitimatized ideas of self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Chimène Keitner, [[Oxford University]], [http://www.ciaonet.org/isa/woc01/National Self-Determination: The Legacy of the French Revolution], paper presented at International Studies Association Annual Meeting, March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B16FD3D5C147A93C2AB178CD85F4D8185F9 Self-Determination Not a New Expedient; First Plebiscite Was Held in Avignon During the French Revolution&amp;mdash;Forthcoming Book Traces History and Growth of the Movement], [[New York Times]],
[[July 20]], [[1919]], 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1800s most of the nations of [[South America]] achieved [[Hispanic American wars of independence| independence from Spain]]. The American public, organized groups and even Congressional resolutions, often supported such movements, especially the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821-29) and the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848| demands of Hungarian revolutionaries in 1848]]. However, such support never became official government policy. After the [[American Civil War]] the [[United States]] government opposed self-determination for the West Indian islands of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]] and [[St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]] in 1868, the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian Islands]] in 1868. By the conclusion of the [[Spanish-American War]] in 1899 the United States supported its annexation without the consent of the peoples the former Spanish colonies of [[Guam]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Philippines]]; it retained “quasi-suzerainty” over Cuba.&lt;ref name="Unterberger"/&gt;

===World War I and II===
[[Woodrow Wilson]] revived the American commitment to self-determination, at least for European states, during [[World War I]]. When the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in [[Russia]] in November 1917, they called for Russia’s immediate withdrawal as a member of the [[Allies of World War I]]. They also supported the right of all nations, including colonies, to self-determination. (As early as 1914 Lenin wrote: “[It] would be wrong to interpret the right to self-determination as meaning anything but the right to existence as a separate state.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/self-det/ch01.htm#v20pp72-395 "What Is Meant By The Self-Determination of Nations?"]&lt;/ref&gt;) The 1918 [[1918 Soviet Constitution|Constitution of the Soviet Union]] acknowledged the right of [[secession]] for its constituent [[republic]]s.&lt;ref name="Unterberger"/&gt;

This presented a challenge to Wilson’s more limited demands. In January 1918 Wilson issued his [[Fourteen Points]] of January 1918 which, among other things, called for adjustment of colonial claims, as long as the interests of colonial powers had equal weight with the claims of subject peoples.&lt;ref name="Unterberger"/&gt; The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in March 1918 led to Russia's exit from the war and the independence of [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. The end of the war led to the dissolution of the defeated [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the creation by the Allies of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the union of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] as new states. However, this imposition of states where some nationalities (especially Poles, Czechs, and Serbs and [[Romanians]]) were given power over nationalities who disliked and distrusted them eventually helped lead to [[World War II]]. The defeated [[Ottoman empire]] was dissolved into the [[Republic of Turkey]] and several smaller nations, plus the new [[Middle east]] [[Allies of World War I| Allied]] “[[protectorate]]s” of [[Syria]], [[Palestine]], [[Iraq]] and [[Yemen]]. The [[League of Nations]] was proposed as much as a means of consolidating these new states, as a path to [[peace]].&lt;ref name="Rothbard"&gt;[[Murray N. Rothbard]], [http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard134.html National Self-Determination], Rothbard Archives at [[Lewrockwell.com]], August, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s there were some successful movements for self-determination in the beginnings of the process of [[decolonization]]. In the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] the [[Great Britain]] granted independence to [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], the [[Irish Free State]], the Commonwealth of [[Australia]], and the [[Union of South Africa]] after the [[British parliament]] declared itself as incapable of passing laws over them without their consent. [[Egypt]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] also achieved [[independence]] from Britain and [[Lebanon]] from [[France]]. Other efforts were unsuccessful, like the [[Indian independence movement]]. And [[Italy]], [[Japan]] and [[Germany]] all initiated new efforts to bring certain territories under their control, leading to [[World War II]].

===The UN Charter===
{{POV-section|date=May 2008}}
In 1941 [[Allies of World War II]] signed the [[Atlantic Charter]] and accepted the principle of self-determination. In January 1942 twenty-six nations signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]], which accepted those principles. The ratification of the [[United Nations Charter]] in 1945 at then end of World War II placed the right of self-determination into the framework of international law and diplomacy.  
*Chapter 1, Article 1, part 2 states that purpose of the UN Charter is: “To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/ United Nations Charter]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Article 1 in both the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm Text of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm Text of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; Both read: “All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.” 
*The United Nations [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] article 15 states that everyone has the right to a nationality and that no one should be arbitrarily deprived of a nationality or denied the right to change nationality. 

However, the charter and other resolutions did not insist on full independence as the best way of obtaining [[self-government]], nor did they include an enforcement mechanism. Moreover, nations were recognized by the legal doctrine of [[uti possidetis juris]], meaning that old administrative boundaries would become international
boundaries upon independence, even if they had little relevance to linguistic, ethnic, and cultural boundaries.&lt;ref name="Hensel"&gt;Paul R. Hensel and Michael E. Allison, Department of Political Science  [[Florida State University]] and Ahmed Khanani, Department of Political Science, [[Indiana University]], [http://garnet.acns.fsu.edu/~phensel/Research/io05.pdf The Colonial Legacy and Border Stability: Uti Possidetis and Territorial Claims in the Americas], research paper at Paul Hensel’s Florida State university web site.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gudeleviciute"&gt;Vita Gudeleviciute, [http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&amp;id=3aa23ac1-66e8-4193-a3e1-a7286ee6bfd5 Does the Principle of Self-determination Prevail over the Principle of Territorial Integrity?], International Journal of Baltic Law, [[Vytautas Magnus University]] School of Law, Volume 2, No. 2 (April, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, justified by the language of self-determination, between 1946 and 1960, the peoples of thirty-seven new nations freed themselves from colonial status in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name="Unterberger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514|Resolution 1514 (XV) "Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples"]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/independence.htm Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples], General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of [[14 December]] [[1960]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The territoriality issue inevitably would lead to more conflicts and independence movements within many nations and challenges to the assumption that [[territorial integrity]] is as important as self-determination.&lt;ref name="Hensel"/&gt; 

The [[Soviet Union]]’s successful post-war efforts to turn [[East Germany|Eastern Germany]] and the countries of [[Eastern Europe]] into Soviet [[satellite states]] contrasted with decolonization. The additional success of communists in creating the [[People's Republic of China]] led to the [[Cold War]] with western nations. These nations became willing to support authoritarian governments as long as they remained [[anti-communist]] and began to suspect all self-determinations movements of being communist-inspired or controlled. Thus the United States entered into a 10 year war in [[Vietnam]], taking over from [[French colonial empire| French colonialists]], and supported [[Portugal]] in its attempts to hold on to [[Angola]]. The [[Soviet Union]] also violated principles of self-determination by suppressing the [[Hungarian revolution of 1956]] and the [[Prague Spring]] Czechoslovak reforms of 1968.  [[Soviet war in Afghanistan| It invaded Afghanistan]] to support an increasingly unpopular communist government assailed by local tribal groups.&lt;ref name="Unterberger"/&gt;

The Cold War began to wind down after [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] assumed power in March 1985. With the cooperation of U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]], Gorbachev wound down the size of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and reduced nuclear arms in Europe, while liberalizing the [[economy of the Soviet Union| economy]]. In 1989 in rapid succession, communist regimes collapsed in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Romania. In December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as president and the [[Soviet_union#Reforms_of_Gorbachev_and_dissolution| Soviet Union dissolved]] relatively peacefully into fifteen sovereign republics, all of which rejected communism and most of which adopted democratic reforms and free-market economies. [[Yugoslavia#Breakup| Yugoslavia]] began a much more violent break up in 1990.&lt;ref name="Unterberger"/&gt;

==Current Issues==
Since the early 1990s, the legitimatization of the principle of national self-determination has led to an increase in the number of conflicts within states, as sub-groups seek greater self-determination and even full secession, and as their conflicts for leadership within groups and with other groups and with the dominant state become violent.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Griffiths, [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/3.html Self-determination, International Society And World Order], [[Macquarie University]] Law Journal, 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The international reaction to these new movements has been uneven and often dictated more by politics than principle. The year 2000 United Nations Millennium Declaration failed to deal with these new demands, mentioning only “the right to self-determination of peoples which remain under colonial domination and foreign occupation.”&lt;ref name="Gudeleviciute"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted by the UN General Assembly Resolution 55/2 (08 09 2000), paragraph 4.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an issue of [[Macquarie University]] Law Journal Associate professor Aleksandar Pavkovic and Senior Lecturer Peter Radan outlined current legal and political issues in self-determination.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic"&gt; Aleksandar Pavkovic and Peter Radan,  [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/1.html In Pursuit of Sovereignty and Self-determination: Peoples, States and Secession in the International Order], [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/index.html Index of papers], [[Macquerie University]] Law Journal, 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

===Defining “peoples”===
There is not yet a recognized legal definition of “peoples” in international law. Vita Gudeleviciute of [[Vytautas Magnus University]] Law School, reviewing international law and UN resolutions, finds in cases of non-self-governing peoples (colonized and/or indigeneous) and foreign military occupation “a people” is the entire population of the occupied territorial unit, no matter their other differences. In cases where people lack representation by a state’s government, the unrepresented become a separate people. Present international law does not recognize ethnic and other minorities as separate peoples.&lt;ref name="Gudeleviciute"/&gt; Other definitions offered are “peoples” being self-evident (from ethnicity, language, history, etc.), or defined by “ties of mutual affection or sentiment,” i.e. “loyalty,” or by mutual obligations among peoples. Or the definition may be simply that a people is a group of individuals who unanimously choose a separate state. If the “people” are unanimous in their desire for self-determination, it strengthens their claim. For example, the populations of federal units of the Yugoslav federation were considered a people in the breakup of Yugoslavia, even though some of those units had very diverse populations.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic"/&gt; Libertarians who argue for self-determination distinguish between the voluntary nation (the land, the culture, the terrain, the people) and the state, the coercive apparatus, which they have a right to choose or self-determine.&lt;ref name="Rothbard"/&gt;

===Self-Determination versus Territorial Integrity===

National self-determination challenges the principle of territorial integrity (or [[sovereignty]]) of states because it is the will of the people that makes a state legitimate. This implies a people should be free to choose their own state and its territorial boundaries. However, there are far more self-identified nations than there are existing states and there is no legal process to redraw state boundaries according to the will of these peoples.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic"/&gt; 

Pavkovic and Radan describe three theories of international relations relevant to self-determination.
* The realist theory of international relations insists on that territorial sovereignty is more important than national self-determination. This policy was pursued by the major powers during the Cold War.  
* Liberal internationalism has become an alternative since that time. It promotes the abolition of war among states as well as increased individual liberty within states, and holds the expansion of global markets and cross-border cooperation diminishes the significance of territorial integrity, allowing for somewhat greater recognition of greater self-determination of peoples. 
* Cosmopolitan liberalism calls for political power to shift to a world government which would make secession and change of boundaries a relatively easy administrative matter. However, also would mean the de facto end of self-determination of national groups.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic"/&gt; 

[[Allen Buchanan]], author of seven books on self-determination and secession, supports territorial integrity as a moral and legal aspect of constitutional democracy. However, he also advances a “Remedial Rights Only Theory”  where a group has “a general right to secede if and only if it has suffered certain injustices, for which secession is the appropriate remedy of last resort.” He also would recognize secession if the state grants, or the constitution includes, a right to secede.&lt;ref name="Gudeleviciute"/&gt; 

Vita Gudeleviciute holds that in cases of non-self-governing peoples and foreign military occupation the principle of self-determination trumps that of territorial integrity. In cases where people lack representation by a state’s government, they also may be considered a separate people, but under current law cannot claim the right to self-determination. On the other hand, he finds that secession within a single state is a domestic matter not covered by international law. Thus there are no on what groups may constitute a seceding people.&lt;ref name="Gudeleviciute"/&gt;

===Methods of Increasing Minority Rights===
In order to accommodate demands for minority rights and avoid secession and the creation of a separate new state, many states [[decentralization| decentralize]] or [[devolution| devolve]] greater decision-making power to new or existing subunits or even [[autonomous areas]]. More limited measures might include restricting demands to the maintenance of national cultures or granting non-territorial autonomy in the form of national associations which would assume control over cultural matters. This would be available only to groups that abandoned secessionist demands and the territorial state would retain political and judicial control, but only if would remain with the territorially organized state.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic"/&gt;

===Self-determination versus majority rule/equal rights===
Pavković explores how national self-determination, in the form of creation of a new state through secession, could override the principles of [[majority rule]] and of [[equal rights]], which are primary liberal principles. This includes the question of how an unwanted state can be imposed upon a minority. He explores five contemporary theories of secession. In “anarcho-capitalist” theory only landowners have the right to secede. In communitarian theory, only those groups that desire direct or greater political participation have the right, including groups deprived of rights, per Allen Buchanan. In two nationalist theories, only national cultural groups have a right to secede. Australian professor Harry Beran’s democratic theory endorses the equality of the right of secession to all types of groups. Unilateral secession against majority rule is justified if the group allows secession of any other group within its territory.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksandar Pavković, [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2003/5.html Majority Rule and Equal Rights: a Few Questions], [[Macquerie University]] Law Journal, 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Beran, “A Democratic Theory of Political Self-Determination for a New World Order” in Percy Lehning (ed), Theories of Secession (1998) 36, 39, 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional law===
Most sovereign states do not recognize the right to self-determination through secession in their constitutions. Many expressly forbid it. However, there are several existing models of self-determination through greater autonomy and through secession.&lt;ref name="Kreptul"&gt;Andrei Kreptul, [http://mises.org/journals/jls/17_4/17_4_3.pdf The Constitutional Right of Secession in Political Theory and History], [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]], [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], Volume 17, no. 4 (Fall 2003), pp. 39–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In liberal constitutional democracies the principle of [[majority rule]] has dictated whether a minority can secede. In the United States [[Abraham Lincoln]] acknowledged that secession through constitutional amendment. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in [[Texas v White]], held secession could occur “through consent of the States.”  The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom| British Parliament]] in 1933 held that [[Western Australia]] only could secede from Australia upon vote of a majority of the country as a whole; the previous two-thirds majority vote for secession via referendum in Western Australia was insufficient.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic"/&gt; 

The [[Communist Party of China| Chinese Communist Party]] followed the Soviet Union in including the right of secession in its 1931 constitution in order to entice ethnic nationalities and Tibet into joining. However, once in control of the territories the party eliminated the right to secession from the constitution. The 1947 Constitution of the [[Burma| Union of Burma]] contained an express state right to secede from the union under a number of procedural conditions. It was eliminated in the 1974 constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma (officially the “Union of Myanmar”). Burma still allows “local autonomy under central leadership.”&lt;ref name="Kreptul"/&gt;
 
As of 1996 the constitutions of Austria, [[Ethiopia]], France, [[Singapore]], [[Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis| Saint Kitts and Nevis Republics]] have express or implied rights to secession. [[Switzerland]] allows for the secession from current and the creation of new [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]. In the case of proposed [[Quebec]] separation from Canada the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 1998 ruled that only both a clear majority of the province and a constitutional amendment confirmed by all participants in the Canadian federation could allow secession.&lt;ref name="Kreptul"/&gt;

The 2003 draft of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe| European Union Constitution]] allowed for the voluntary withdrawal of member states from the union.&lt;ref name="Kreptul"/&gt; There was much discussion about such self-determination by minorities&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon Contiades, [http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/AUD/s6.htm Sixth Scholarly Panel: Cultural Identity in the New Europe], 1st Global Conference on Federalism and the Union of European Democracies, March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; before the final document underwent the unsuccessful ratification process in 2005.

===International law===
Given the hundreds of minority groups seeking greater autonomy and even full secession into a new state, there is need for a new understanding of the right to self-determination that applies to minority national groups and indigenous populations. At the very least this would encourage states to these groups more internal self-determination to deter secessionist demands.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic"/&gt; 

===Drawing New Borders===
Once groups exercise self-determination through secession, the issue of the proposed borders may prove more controversial than the fact of secession. The bloody Yugoslav wars in the 1990s were related mostly to borders issues because the international community applied a version of “uti possidetis juris” in transforming existing internal borders of the various Yugoslav republics into international borders, despite the conflicts of ethnic groups within those boundaries. The northern two-thirds of Quebec already has made it clear it will resist by force being incorporated into a Quebec nation.&lt;ref name="Pavkovic"/&gt;

The border between [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Irish Free State]] was based on the borders of existing counties and did not include all of historic [[Ulster]].  A Boundary Commission was established to consider re-drawing it. Its proposals, which amounted to a small net transfer to Northern Ireland, were leaked to the press and then not acted upon. In December 1925, the governments of the Irish Free State, Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom agreed to accept the existing border. Most Irish Nationalists and Irish Republicans claim all of Northern Ireland and are not particularly interested in new borders.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

Also see [[list of autonomous areas by country]] and [[list of territorial autonomies]] and [[list of active autonomist and secessionist movements]].
===Australia===
{{main|Self-determination of Australian Aborigines}}
Recently (2003 onwards), self-determination has become the topic of some debate in Australia in relation to Aborigines (indigenous Australians). In the 1970s, the Aboriginal community approached the Federal Government and requested the right to administer their own communities. This encompassed basic local government functions, ranging from land dealings and management of community centres to road maintenance and garbage collection, as well as setting education programmes and standards in their local schools.

=== Israel and the Palestine ===
{{Main|Israel-Palestine conflict}}
The right to self-determination as outlined in [[public international law]] is often referenced by both sides in the ongoing [[Israel-Palestinian conflict]].

=== Kosovo ===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=December 2007}}
{{see|Kosovo status process}}
[[Kosovo]] is a largely ethnic-[[Albania| Albanian]] nation which seeks independence on territories long held by ethnic Serbs, including as part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Conflict between the two culminated in the 1996-1999 [[Kosovo War]] between the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) and the then [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] led by [[Slobodan Milošević]]. This culminated in the 1999 [[United States]]/[[NATO]] [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia| attacks on Serbia]], withdrawal of Serbian troops and entry of the NATO [[Kosovo Force]]. International negotiations to determine the final status of Kosovo were unsuccessful. On [[17 February]] [[2008]], 109 members (10 members including all Kosovo Serbs were absent) of the [[Kosovo Assembly]] voted unanimously for a unilateral declaration of independence. Serbia rejected the decision. See the [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence]].

=== Kurdistan ===
[[Kurdistan]] is the land of the [[Kurdish people]] of the middle east. The territory is currently part of 4 states [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]] and [[Iran]]. There are Kurdish self determination movements in each of the 4 states. Iraqi Kurdistan has to date achieved the largest degree of self-determination through the formation of the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]], an entity recognised by the Iraqi Federal Constitution. 

The right of the creation of a Kurdish state was recognized following [[World War I]] in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. However, the treaty was negated by force on behalf of the newly created [[Republic of Turkey]]. To date two separate Kurdish republics and one Kurdish Kingdom have declared sovereignty. The [[Republic of Ararat]] (Northern Kurdistan/Eastern Turkey), the [[Republic of Mehabad]] (Eastern Kurdistan/Iranian Kurdistan) and the [[Kingdom of Kurdistan]] (Southern Kurdistan/Northern Iraq), each of these fledgling states was crushed by military intervention. The [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]] which currently holds the [[President of Iraq| Iraqi presidency]] and the [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]] which governs the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] both explicitly commit themselves to the development of Kurdish self-determination.

=== Indian Kashmir ===
{{main|Kashmir Conflict|Terrorism in Kashmir}}

There is a democratic movement for independence led by the [[Hurriyat Conference]] in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] which want the application of the [[UN Resolutions]] calling for [[plebiscite]] in Kashmir. [[Terrorism in Kashmir|Insurgent groups]] in [[Indian-controlled Kashmir]] (the Indian state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]) such as [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]] and [[Hizbul Mujahideen]] are currently trying to seek full [[independence]] for the whole region from [[India]] on the claim of its right to self-determination as an [[Islamic republic|Islamic state]]. Both the insurgents and the Indian armed forces stand accused of aggression: insurgent groups are accused of conducting [[ethnic cleansing]] of [[Hindu]]s, while the Indian army being accused of violating human rights of ordinary citizens of Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Evans, "A departure from history: Kashmiri Pandits, 1990–2001," Contemporary South Asia (Volume 11, Number 1, [[1 March]] [[2002]], pp. 19-37)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taiwan ===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=December 2007}}
{{main|Political Status of Taiwan}}
Taiwan is the focus of a self-determination dispute in the [[East Asia]] region. The government of the [[People's Republic of China]] claims the entirety of Taiwan as its territory. However, Taiwanese independence advocates argue that there is no legal claim to Taiwan, as no legally binding treaty ever transferred sovereignty to China following World War II, an assertion that both the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Republic of China]] disagree with. At the same time, the ''de facto'' government of Taiwan, the [[Republic of China]] still has not formally withdrawn its claims to the mainland and several other areas. In practice, however, this claim essentially died off through the 1990s and is no longer pressed by Taiwan's elected government.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

=== Turkish Cypriots ===
{{main|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus}}
Since Turkey's invaision and continued occupation of Cyprus in 1974, an administration recognized by [[Turkey]] only was declared in 1983 - the so-called[[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/1021835.stm BBC Timeline: Cyprus, accessed 2-26-2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is questionable whether it is the [[Turkish Cypriot]] community who claimed the right of self-determination in ending their partnership with the [[Republic of Cyprus]] given that they are greatly out-numbered by the Turkish settlers who were brought to the area by Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:Q0cRQ4qiyroJ:www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/integrating-north-cyprus-eu/article-152509+self+determination+press+release+noth+cyprus&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3 EurActiv.com:Integrating North Cyprus into the EU, accessed 2-26-2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

The colonization of the North American continent and its [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] population has been the source of legal battles since the early 1800s. Surviving Native American were resettled to separate tracts of land ([[Indian reservation|reservations]]) which have been given a certain degree of [[autonomy]] within the United States federal government.

The [[Chicano Movement]] (or [[Chicano nationalism|Chicano nation]]) seeks to recreate [[Aztlán]], the mythical homeland of the [[Aztec]]s comprising the [[Southwestern United States]] which is home to the majority of [[Mexican Americans]].  They include those of mixed Native American and [[Latino]] descent ([[Mestizo]]). They base their claim on the fact that the U.S. seized the territory as a result of the [[Mexican-American War]]

There is an active [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]] which aims at rectifying the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in the late 19th century which resulted in the incorporation of [[Hawai'i]] into the United States. 

Since 1972, the U.N. Decolonization Committee has called for [[Puerto Rico]]'s decolonization and for the U.S. to recognize the island's right to self-determination and independence. In 2007 the Decolonization Subcommittee called for the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to review the political status of Puerto Rico, a power reserved by the 1953 Resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/gacol3160.doc.htm Special Committee on Decolonization Calls on United States to Expedite Puerto Rico’s Self-determination Process - General Assembly GA/COL/3160 - Department of Public Information - [[June 14]], 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; This follows the 1967 passage of a [[plebiscite]] Act that provided for a vote on the status of Puerto Rico with three status options: continued commonwealth, statehood, and independence. In the first plebscite the commonwealth option won with 60.4% of the votes but U.S. congressional committees failed to enact legislation to address the status issue. In subsequent plebiscites in 1993 and 1998 the status quo was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;For complete statistics of these plebiscites, see [http://electionspuertorico.org/cgi-bin/events.cgi Elections in Puerto Rico:Results].&lt;/ref&gt;
