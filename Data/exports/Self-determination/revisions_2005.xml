'''Self-determination''' is a principle in [[international law]] that a people ought to be able to determine their own governmental forms and structure free from outside influence.

==Overview==
This principle was first articulated by [[Woodrow Wilson]] in his [[Fourteen Points]]; and was important in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] for drawing the boundaries of [[Eastern Europe]] and affecting [[decolonization]]. Many of the concepts embodied in the ideal of self-determination, however, can be found in earlier documents such as the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence of the United States]]. 

The right to self-determination has been used in recent decades by people all over the world. In most cases there is an ethnic or religious minority seeking independence from a majority to escape prejudice or persecution. 

The [[constitution of the Soviet Union]] acknowledged this right for its sister [[republic]]s (although not for declared "autonomous" regions), but it was not applied in practice until the [[perestroika]], when it led to the [[collapse of the Soviet Union|breakup of the Soviet Union]].

At the ratification of the [[UN Charter]] in [[1951]], the signatories introduced the right of all people to self-determination into the framework of international law and diplomacy. 

The purpose of the self determination clause was to allow the former [[colony|colonies]] that existed before [[World War II]] to have a say in their future.  However, some felt that after [[decolonization]] the right to self-determination should apply only to states and not to peoples, and to be circumscribed by the principles of [[territorial integrity]] and [[non-interference in internal affairs]]. Territorial Integrity however can only be applied to prevent the cessation of integral parts of a state, and does not apply to decolonisation. It is clear that a colony cannot affect the territorial integrity of a country of which she does not form part. Many of the newly independent former colonies faced secessionist and [[irredentist]] movements and therefore there was an international consensus that self-determination did not apply to these movements. UN Resolution 1514(XV) was adopted and guarantees the right to self-determination of all peoples.

The [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]] in [[1970]] committed the idea of the right for self-determination to the body of international protocol. In essence, all people reserve the right to seek self-determination to address a lack of proper representation or oppression from any given government. 

There is tension between the concept of self-determination and that of [[territorial integrity]].  This conflict has been resolved in practice by defining the notion of "people" entitled to self-determination as persons living in a particular nation-state rather than persons sharing a common culture or language.  Hence, self-determination as it is understood in the early [[21st century]] does not generally promote the political aspirations of oppressed [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]].

Wilson's ideas of self-determination originated in his [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] heritage and sympathies. His favorite movie was [[The Birth of a Nation]], and his [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] beliefs and personal ties were steeped in Southern pride and resentment of [[U.S. Northern states|Northern]] power. Hence Southern interpretations of States-Rights directly led to Wilson's ideas of self-determination. Many have criticized both concepts, however, for promoting secession and division over unity. Further, the key question is at what level do populations have the right to self-determination and the formation or preservation of a state, the empowerment of a local majority, and the formation of a local minority. In the United States, southern states' rights to determine their own destiny during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and Civil Rights era were held to be not absolute, especially since significant minorities there were oppressed. In [[Europe]] after [[World War I]], many of the former Empires destroyed in that war were broken up into ethnic states which themselves were amalgamations of peoples containing their own minorities, in [[Yugoslavia]], the former Russian and Austro-Hungarian provinces, and in the Middle East. In [[History of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jewish]] immigrants would claim self-determination to justify the creation of the state of [[Israel]] in the former lands of the [[Ottoman Empire]], just as [[Palestinian]]s would later claim independence as [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].

Hence, self-determination has been held to be an example of [[democracy]] at work, but also as an example of an abstract theory that when implemented has sometimes led to and fed further ethnic, national, and regional civil conflict.
