'''Racism in Asia''' has roots in events that have happened from thousands of years ago to the present.

==Bangladesh==
In 2015, the ruling [[Awami League]] [[Member of Parliament]], [[Elias Mollah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/politics/2015/08/04/awami-league-mp-elias-mollah-calls-africans-uncivilised-after-un-peacekeeping-mission-tour|title=Awami League MP Elias Mollah calls Africans 'uncivilised' after UN peacekeeping mission tour|date=4 August 2015|publisher=BDNews24.com|access-date=24 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603061844/http://bdnews24.com/politics/2015/08/04/awami-league-mp-elias-mollah-calls-africans-uncivilised-after-un-peacekeeping-mission-tour|archive-date=3 June 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented on his trip to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]: "Our army has gone there (Africa) to civilise those black people. I am sure they will accomplish the task." He constantly referred to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] as "uncivilized black people" and added "People there are yet to become civilised. They take bath every 15 days. After applying soaps before bath, they do not even use water in a bid to retain the aroma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liton|first1=Shakhawat|title=Opinion: Shouldn't AL MP Elias apologise?|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/politics/opinion-shouldn%E2%80%99t-al-mp-elias-apologise-122173|access-date=6 August 2015|agency=The Daily Star|publisher=The Daily Star|date=5 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807212109/http://www.thedailystar.net/politics/opinion-shouldn%E2%80%99t-al-mp-elias-apologise-122173|archive-date=7 August 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhutan==
In 1991–92, [[Bhutan]] is said to have deported between 10,000 and 100,000 ethnic Nepalis ([[Lhotshampa]]). The actual number of refugees who were initially deported is debated by both sides. In March 2008, this population began a multiyear resettlement to third countries including the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=77513|title=IRIN Asia – NEPAL-BHUTAN: Bhutan questions identity of 107,000 refugees in Nepal – Nepal – Refugees/IDPs|work=IRINnews|access-date=17 June 2015|date=2008-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906175743/http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=77513|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the [[United States]] is working towards resettling more than 60,000 of these [[refugee]]s in the US as a condition of its third country settlement programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm | title = Bhutan refugees are 'intimidated' | author = Bhaumik, Subir | date = November 7, 2007 | work = BBC News | access-date = 2008-04-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080819203907/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm | archive-date = August 19, 2008 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myanmar==
[[Ne Win]]'s rise to power in 1962 and his persecution of "resident aliens" (groups of immigrants whose members were not recognized as citizens of the [[Union of Burma]]) led to an exodus of some 300,000 [[Burmese Indians]] and [[Burmese Chinese]] who were victims of Ne Win's discriminatory policies, particularly after the wholesale nationalisation of private enterprise in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin|last=Smith|year=1991|title=Burma – Insurgency and the Politics of Ethnicity|publisher=Zed Books|location=London, New Jersey|pages=43–44,98,56–57,176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma: Asians v.

Bangladesh.
The testimonies which were collected by the OHCHR indicate that the attacks against Rohingya villages
constitute serious human rights violations. As recalled by many victims, the security forces
and Rakhine Buddhist individuals incited hatred, violence and killings of the
Rohingya population within northern Rakhine State through extremely derogatory abuse
which was based on their [[religion]], language, culture and ethnic identity.

==Cambodia==
[[Cambodia]] has disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups. These included ethnic [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Thai people|Thai]], and foreigners who live in Cambodia. Part of this conflict stems from Chinese involvement in Cambodia before the [[Vietnam War]]. In the late 1960s, an estimated 425,000 ethnic Chinese lived in Cambodia, but by 1984, as a result of the [[Khmer Rouge]]'s [[Cambodian genocide|genocide]] and emigration, only about 61,400 Chinese remained in the country. The [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], a Muslim minority group whose members are the descendants of migrants from the old state of [[Champa]], were forced to adopt the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] people's language and customs. A Khmer Rouge order stated that henceforth "The Cham nation no longer exists on Kampuchean soil belonging to the Khmers" (U.N. Doc. A.34/569 at 9). Only about half of the Cham survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia1.html|title=GENOCIDE – CAMBODIA|access-date=17 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030101115/http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia1.html|archive-date=30 October 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genocidewatch.org/aboutgenocide/stantoncambodianlaw.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011031122/http://www.genocidewatch.org/aboutgenocide/stantoncambodianlaw.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Cambodian Genocide and International Law|archive-date=October 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-studies.com/cambodia/the-chinese.html|title=Cambodia the Chinese|access-date=17 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025022108/http://www.country-studies.com/cambodia/the-chinese.html|archive-date=25 October 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the transfer of sovereignty in 1997, there has been greater tension and more conflicts have risen between residents of the PRC (People's Republic of China or the "Mainland") and Hong Kong over a variety of political and [[Socioeconomics|socio-economical]] issues concerning the governance and constitutional autonomy of the territory.

Mainland residents suffered considerable set-backs in the 1960s and 1970s due to catastrophes such as the [[Great Chinese Famine]] that resulted from the poor governance of the PRC. However, since the 1990s, the Mainland has had considerable economic growth, and a large number of mainland tourists have visited Hong Kong in recent years.&lt;ref name="前香港大律師公會主席石永泰──中港爭議源自價值觀分歧" /&gt; There also have been many reports that visiting Mainland parents let their child defecate or urinate openly in the street in busy shopping districts or in public transports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20140419/18694315 |work = The Apple Daily |title = Mainland tourists let their child pee in the street and assaulted Hong Kong resident |access-date = 2015-11-25 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151126044737/http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20140419/18694315 |archive-date = 2015-11-26 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hong Kong–Mainland China conflict|Tensions]] have grown between Hong Kong and mainland China since the handover.

Similarly, with the introduction of China's [[Individual Visit Scheme]] in 2003, which effectively grants Mainland residents an unlimited entry travel visa to Hong Kong, and following the [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]] and other [[food safety incidents in China]] an influx of Mainland residents travel regularly to Hong Kong to buy baby formula and other daily necessities. In the process, this influx caused shortages of supply for Hong Kong parents and escalated rents; it also greatly harmed the commercial diversity of Hong Kong business.

On the other hand, a race discrimination bill has been demanded by human rights groups for the last 10 years, and the government has been accused of putting the issue on the back burner. Last 3 December 2006 was the first time a drafted bill was proposed at the Legislative Council, and was expected to be passed before the end of 2008. However, the bill was criticized for being "too conservative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ahrchk.net/ahrc-in-news/mainfile.php/2004ahrcinnews/222/ |title = Asian Human Rights Commission |access-date = 17 June 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110303051408/http://www.ahrchk.net/ahrc-in-news/mainfile.php/2004ahrcinnews/222/ |archive-date = 3 March 2011 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusion of Mainland Chinese migrants has also been a source of controversy, with the government claiming that they are not considered to be of a different race.

Sinicization of [[Tibet]] is a phrase which is used by critics of Chinese rule in Tibet in reference to the programs and laws which force "cultural unity" in Tibetan areas of [[China]], including the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and surrounding [[Tibetan people|Tibetan-designated]] [[Autonomous administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|autonomous areas]]. The efforts are undertaken by China in order to forcefully assimilate Tibetan culture into mainstream Chinese culture. Another term for [[sinicization]] is ''cultural cleansing'' or ''genocide'', used by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] and by the [[Central Tibetan Administration]] to describe the results of China's sinicization programs and laws in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2011-11-07|title=Dalai Lama: 'Cultural genocide' behind self-immolations|language=en-GB|work=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-15617026|access-date=2020-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

But this new state-sponsored regulation is seen as a desperately contemplated measure to curb the continued resistance of the Tibetan people and their call for the protection of their cultural and linguistic identity, for freedom, human rights, independence, and for the honourable return of His Holiness the Dalai Lama to Tibet." "Central Tibetan Administration’s Information Secretary Mr T.G. Arya condemned the new ethnic identity law, calling it a measure of ethnic cleansing aimed at a complete overtake of the cultural, political and identitary of the Tibetan plateau by the Chinese. The Secretary also criticised the legislation as a gross violation of the international law and the Chinese constitution." " “What China could not achieve through the sixty years of occupation and repression, now they are trying to achieve it through repressive law. The law aims to achieve complete sinicization of the Tibetan plateau through ethnic cleansing. China finds Tibetan language, religion and culture as the main barrier to achieving complete control over the land,” Secretary TG Arya told the Tibet News Bureau.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCP has been accused of [[sinicization]] by gradually replacing Mongolian languages with [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Critics call it [[cultural genocide]] for dismantling people's minority languages and eradicating their minority identities. The implementation of the Mandarin language policy began in [[Tongliao]], because 1 million ethnic [[Mongols]] live there making it the most Mongolian-populated area. The 5 million Mongols are less than 20 percent of the population in [[Inner Mongolia]].&lt;ref name="replacing-ethnic-minorities"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/international/509173-china-is-replacing-languages-of-ethnic-minorities-with-mandarin |title=China is replacing languages of ethnic minorities with Mandarin |website=The Hill |author=Jianli Yang and Lianchao Han |date=7 July 2020 |access-date=1 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731101052/https://thehill.com/opinion/international/509173-china-is-replacing-languages-of-ethnic-minorities-with-mandarin |archive-date=31 July 2020 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism in India first started during the [[Colonial India|colonial era]], when European colonialists, using prevailing theories of [[scientific racism]], formulated racial differences between Europeans and Indians that included [[historical definitions of races in India|dividing various ethnic groups in India]] into different "classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhbwDFfE9J8C&amp;pg=PA99|title=Aryans and British India|access-date=17 June 2015|isbn=9788190227216|last1=Trautmann|first1=Thomas R.|year=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513093320/https://books.google.com/books?id=dhbwDFfE9J8C&amp;pg=PA99|archive-date=13 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;We in India have known [[racialism]] in all its forms ever since the commencement of [[British Raj|British rule]]. The idea of a [[master race]] is inherent in imperialism. India as a nation and Indians as individuals were subjected to insult, humiliation and contemptuous treatment. The English were an imperial race, we were told, with the God-given right to govern us and keep us in subjection; if we protested we were reminded of the 'tiger qualities of an imperial race'.&lt;ref name="NehruIndia"&gt;From [[Discovery of India]] by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], reproduced from "History : Modern India" (p108) by S.N.

In recent years, discrimination against people from [[North-East India]] and from [[South India]] has been reported. In 2007, the ''North East Support Centre &amp; Helpline (NESC&amp;H)'' was started as a separate wing of [[All India Christian Council]].

{{See also|Jakarta Riots of May 1998|Legislation on Chinese Indonesians}}
A number of discriminatory laws against [[Chinese Indonesian#Post-independence and New Order Era|Chinese Indonesians]] were enacted by the government of [[Indonesia]]. In 1959, President [[Sukarno]] approved [[PP 10/1959]], which forced [[Chinese Indonesians]] to close their businesses in rural areas and to relocate to urban areas. Moreover, political pressures in the 1970s and the 1980s restricted the role of Chinese Indonesians in politics, academics, and the military. As a result, they were constrained professionally to becoming entrepreneurs and professional managers in trade, manufacturing, and banking. In the 1960s, after the alleged communist coup attempt in 1965, there was a strong sentiment against Chinese Indonesians, who were accused of being communist collaborators. In 1998, Indonesia riots over higher food prices and rumors of hoarding by merchants and shopkeepers often degenerated into anti-Chinese attacks. There is also discrimination based on religion and belief across the country, especially between [[Muslims]] and [[Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1998/02/24/qanda.t_2.php |title=International Herald Tribune: Q&amp;A / Juwono Sudarsono, Defense Official : Racism in Indonesia Undercuts Unity |access-date=2008-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225205716/http://www.iht.com/articles/1998/02/24/qanda.t_2.php |archive-date=2008-02-25 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysia==
{{main|Racism in Malaysia}}
[[Malaysia]] is a multi–ethnic country, with [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] making up the majority—close to 52% of the 28 million population. About 30% of the population are [[Chinese Malaysians]] (Malaysians of Chinese descent), and [[Indian Malaysian]]s (Malaysians of Indian descent) comprise about 10% of the population. Government policies of positive discrimination often favour the Malay majority with ''[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]]'' status, particularly in areas such as housing, finance and education. Such policies are protected by [[Constitution of Malaysia#Article 153 – Special Position of Bumiputeras and Legitimate Interests of Other Communities|article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia]]. The former long-term ruling party of UMNO also promoted [[Ketuanan Melayu]]: the idea that the Bumiputeras should get special privileges in Malaysia. It was written into The Federation of Malaya Agreement signed on 21 January 1948 at King House by the Malay rulers and by Sir Edward Gent, as the representative of the British government, that Malays would lead the three main races. Malays dominate in: politics at both national and state levels; the civil service; military and security forces. Chinese have traditionally dominated the economy and live in large numbers in urban areas of Malaysia.

For Ramadan 2011, Chinese-language television station [[8TV (Malaysian TV network)|8TV]] had some advertisements featuring a Chinese woman at a Ramadan bazaar. The condescending advertisements were pulled for being racist&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-14385624|title=Malaysia's 8TV pulls 'racist' Ramadan adverts|date=3 August 2011|work=BBC News|access-date=20 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009124520/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-14385624|archive-date=9 October 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; following an online uproar, and the station was expected to apologise. Instead, they claimed the Ramadan advertisements were an "honest mistake" and went on to claim that the viewers misunderstood the clips.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; The Ramadan advertisements – released as public service announcements (PSA) – appeared to be stereotyping Chinese people, depicting a socially inept Chinese woman embarrassing others at a Ramadan bazaar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/8679145/Racist-Ramadan-adverts-pulled-in-Malaysia.html|title='Racist' Ramadan adverts pulled in Malaysia|author=Ian MacKinnon|date=3 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009130038/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/8679145/Racist-Ramadan-adverts-pulled-in-Malaysia.html|archive-date=9 October 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parts of the community claimed that they were "Islamophobic", especially among the Chinese in Malaysia. Quoting Austrian philosopher [[Karl Popper]], the station said in its Facebook note: "It is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood." The PSAs highlighted the clueless behaviour of a Chinese woman played by an actor in scenes to demonstrate what might embarrass Muslim Malay hawkers and bazaar patrons alike.

In the 2010–2014 [[World Values Survey]], 59.7% of Malaysian respondents indicated that they would not want immigrants or foreign workers as neighbours, which was among the highest out of the countries surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSOnline.jsp?WAVE=6&amp;COUNTRY=875|title=WVS Database (question V39)|website=www.worldvaluessurvey.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619195008/http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSOnline.jsp?WAVE=6&amp;COUNTRY=875|archive-date=2019-06-19|access-date=2019-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Job Environment ===
A study by the Centre for Governance and Political Studies (Cent-GPS) made an experiment [https://centgps.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Racism-in-Recruitment-A-Study-on-Racial-Bias-For-Entry-Level-Jobs-in-Malaysia-.pdf Study on 7 fictitious candidates] by sending a small sample size of 7 fictitious resumes representing 7 candidates: male and female Malay, Indian and Chinese candidates, 3,829 times in total to over 500 job vacancies across the [[Klang Valley]]. No fictitious Sabahan nor Sarawakians were involved in this study. Out of these 7 fictitious candidates, the study concluded that employers in the business sector are actively looking for Chinese candidates. 

The study had 3 hypothesis, first ethnic Malay applicants will be discriminated against in Malaysia's business sector compared to their non-Bumiputera peers. The study found out that the fictitious Chinese candidates dominated the callbacks by a huge margin. The two male and female Chinese candidates obtained more job callbacks than their Malay and Indian counterparts combined. No details regarding whether it was a Malay management company, an Indian management company or Chinese management company were included in the study, a confound that would likely lead to a skew in the results given the racial tensions and linguistic barriers in Malaysia.

The second hypothesis was [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] is a key factor in helping or boosting a candidate's chance of securing a job interview. The study finds that when companies list “Mandarin required” in their advertisement, it is actually a filter to hire Chinese candidates. Their third hypothesis was the hijab plays a crucial factor in determining a candidate's successfully job application. The study found out that a Malay girl without a hijab gets more callbacks than a Malay girl who wears a hijab. 

The study concluded that even as candidates had the same qualifications, education and experience, the ethnicity of a candidate still plays a vital role in the success of a job application for a business graduate. Only business graduates were studied in this study, with other fields of study being suitable for an attempt for replication of this study.

===''Ketuanan Melayu''===
The Malaysian government ensures that all Bumiputeras are given preferential treatment when it comes to the number of students placed in government universities. The Education Ministry's matriculation programme allocates 90% for Bumiputeras and 10% for non-Bumiputera students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/04/24/matriculation-quota-dated/|title=Matriculation quota dated|last1=Sekaran|first1=R|date=24 April 2019|work=The Star Online|access-date=30 April 2019|quote=A DAP lawmaker has described the admission into the Education Ministry’s (MOE) matriculation programme as an outdated and regressive policy.  Penang DAP vice-chairman Dr P. Ramasamy (pic) said sticking to the policy of allocating 90% for Bumiputera and 10% for non-Bumiputera students is not good for the future of the country.  “Pakatan Harapan should come up with a progressive system for matriculation admission.  “This is not an issue between me and Bersatu. It is about the unequal ratio of 9:1 in the admission of Bumiputera and non-Bumiputera students,” he said on his Facebook page yesterday.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424034355/https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/04/24/matriculation-quota-dated/|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumiputeras are also given 7% discounts for new houses they purchase, and special Malay status reserved land in most housing settlements. Burial plots in most urban areas are for deceased Bumiputeras, while the rest have to be cremated at such locations. All key government positions are to be held by Malays, including most sporting associations. Other forms of preferential treatment include the requirement of a minimum of a 30% Malay Bumiputera equity to be held in Listed Companies, full funding for mosques and Islamic places of worship (Islam is an official religion in Malaysia), special high earning interest trust funds for Bumiputeras, special share allocation for new share applications for Bumiputeras, and making the Malay language a compulsory examination paper to pass with a high emphasis given to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.fju.edu.tw/worldlit/link/malaysia_chinese.htm|title=Chinese in Malaysia|publisher=[[Fu Jen Catholic University]] Department of English Language and Literature|access-date=17 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924000751/http://www.eng.fju.edu.tw/worldlit/link/malaysia_chinese.htm|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even school textbooks have been criticised as racist, especially from Chinese and Indian-type schools who adopted learning methods from their respective countries. "[[Interlok]]" is a 1971 Malay language novel written by Malaysian national laureate Abdullah Hussain, with Chinese groups today condemning its depiction of Chinese characters as greedy, opium-smoking lechers keen to exploit Malays for profit. Some folks said that the Chinese were trying to "conquer Malaysia" as "they did with Singapore". The Indian community earlier complained over the novel's use of the word "pariah" and "keling". Chinese associations said the book was not only offensive to Indians but Chinese as well, as it depicted the character Kim Lock as a "miserly opium addict and callous adulterer" and his son, Cing Huat, as "cunning, greedy, unscrupulous and someone who would sell his daughters". "Interlok" was written based on the ideology of Ketuanan Melayu. The groups also condemned the "major thread" in the book, which depicts the Chinese "cheating and oppressing" Malays or as "nasty and immoral" communist guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Nut Graph|title=The hypocrisy surrounding Interlok|date=17 January 2011|url=http://www.thenutgraph.com/the-hypocrisy-surrounding-interlok/|accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICERD===
Malaysia is also one of the only few countries (less than 10) in the world not to ratify the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD) at the [[United Nations]] (UN), due to the possibility of "conflicts" with the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] and the "race and religious norms" that may jeopardise the special status of Malays in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/icerd-rally-malaysia-kuala-lumpur-race-mahathir-bersatu-11031060 |title=Commentary: Malaysia's anti-ICERD rally a reality check for Pakatan Harapan|author=Norshahril Saat|date=16 December 2018 |work=Channel NewsAsia}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the core provisions of ICERD, particularly in Article 3, specifically mentions its condemnation of apartheid policies and racial [[Racial segregation|segregation]].

When BN lost its majority after the country's [[2018 Malaysian general election]] there were fears among the Malay population of eventual ratification by the [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH) coalition, which could possibly signal the end of Bumiputera privileges and special positions of the Malays in the country. Race relations eventually severely deteriorated to the point where a [[2018 anti-ICERD rally|mass rally was held in the country's capital]] of Kuala Lumpur to pressure the government against ratification.&lt;ref name="malaysiakini"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/452368|title=PAS and Umno to hold anti-Icerd rally in KL on Dec 8 - Malaysiakini|date=17 November 2018 |publisher=Malaysiakini|accessdate=17 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; PH would eventually lose power just two years later amid the [[2020–22 Malaysian political crisis]] with pro-Bumiputera parties, including BN, regaining government control.

==Nepal==
In Nepal, there are concerns about racism towards [[Dalits]], [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]], [[refugee]]s, and other ethnic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Singh|first=Rishi|date=2006-03-20|title=Day against racial discrimination today|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/day-against-racial-discrimination-today|access-date=2021-08-24|website=The Himalayan Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Melanin and the mind|url=https://kathmandupost.com/opinion/2019/01/04/melanin-and-the-mind|access-date=2021-08-24|website=kathmandupost.com|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singapore==
Since independence, [[Singapore]] has declared itself to be a multi-cultural society. The [[Singapore National Pledge]] is a declaration of anti-racism and the acceptance of all races and religions. [[Racial Harmony Day]] is celebrated in Singapore to mark the progress made since the [[1964 race riots in Singapore]]. 

There is a tendency towards collective cultural identity; that is a tendency to focus on group dynamics more at a societal than individual level. This in turn leads to an increased emphasis on being part of the 'in' group and not part of the 'other'. Many have on their identity document an ethnic classification of ''Other'', although there have been recent reforms in 2011 that allow for double-barrel ethnic identifications like "Indian Chinese" or "Chinese Indian" for individuals of mixed heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ica.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=12443|title=Greater Flexibility With Implementation Of Double-Barrelled Race Option From 1 January 2011|website=Immigration and Checkpoints Authority|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151126071447/http://www.ica.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=12443|archive-date=26 November 2015|access-date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools and the [[Housing and Development Board]] housing estates enforce ethnic quotas based on the race proportions to prevent racial enclaves. The system ensures the majority Chinese live with a certain ratio of Malays and Indians and vice versa. As a result, children grow up with at least some racial mixing both at school and in their residential blocks. For many years, community leaders have been organising cross-visits to celebrate each other's cultural and religious festivals. Nonetheless, a number of young [[bloggers]] and commentators have been charged under the [[Sedition Act (Malaysia)|Sedition Act]] for making disparaging remarks about [[race (classification of humans)|race]] and religion.

However, with racism pretty much impossible to be eradicated in its entirety, there have been cases of racism including the social stigma attached to intermarriage of different ethnic groups. Such racist sentiments have also not escaped those in power. In 1992, former [[People's Action Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[Choo Wee Khiang]] said: "One evening, I drove to Little India and it was pitch dark but not because there was no light, but because there were too many Indians around."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2011-12-24|title=Seng Han Thong's offensive comment reflection of PAP outlook|url=https://yoursdp.org/news/seng_han_thong_s_offensive_comment_reflection_of_pap_outlook|access-date=2020-06-10|website=yoursdp.org|archive-date=2020-06-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200610235228/https://yoursdp.org/news/seng_han_thong_s_offensive_comment_reflection_of_pap_outlook|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, anti-foreigner sentiments have been significant with house-owners and landlords refusing to rent properties to people from China and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26832115|title='No Indians No PRCs': Singapore's rental discrimination problem|last1=Cheung|first1=Helier|date=May 2014|access-date=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124054516/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-26832115|archive-date=24 January 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2019 [[YouGov]] poll has revealed similar results, with Singaporean respondents showing the highest percentage of bias against mainland Chinese and Indian travellers out of all the nations surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yougov.co.uk/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2019/08/30/britons-make-worst-tourists-say-britons-and-spania|title=Britons make worst tourists, say Britons (and Spaniards and Germans) {{!}} YouGov|website=yougov.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225020552/https://yougov.co.uk/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2019/08/30/britons-make-worst-tourists-say-britons-and-spania|archive-date=2019-12-25|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.traveller.com.au/most-disliked-tourists-by-country-revealed-in-new-research-h1i4qq|title=The world's most hated tourists revealed|last=Gebicki|first=Michael|date=2019-09-19|website=Traveller|language=en-au|access-date=2019-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191225020548/https://www.traveller.com.au/most-disliked-tourists-by-country-revealed-in-new-research-h1i4qq|archive-date=2019-12-25|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean ethnic nationalism===
[[Koreans]], both north and south, tend to equate [[nationality]] or [[citizenship]] with membership in a single, homogeneous politicized [[ethnic group]] or "[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]" ([[Korean ethnic nationalism|''minjok'']] in Korean). A common language and culture also are viewed as important elements in Korean identity.

Some South Korean schools have been criticized for preferentially hiring white teachers who apply to teach English, due to perceptions that white teachers are more "Western" and therefore have better English skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11826937|title=Ethnic Bias Seen in South Korea Teacher Hiring|date=9 July 2007|work=NPR.org|access-date=17 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319100858/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11826937|archive-date=19 March 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea lacks an [[anti-discrimination law]], which was recommended by the [[UN Human Rights Committee]] in 2015. The law has been reported stalled due to "lack of public consensus".&lt;ref name=PMID27430432&gt;{{citation|title=Don't ask for fair treatment?

===Treatment of non-Koreans===
Due to the lack of an anti-discrimination law, it is common for people not of Korean ethnicity to be denied service at business establishments or in taxis without consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160221000207|title=[From the scene] Korean-only bars trigger controversy|first=The Korea|last=Herald|date=21 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/03/the-south-korean-businesses-that-ban-foreigners/|title=The South Korean Businesses That Ban Foreigners|date=1 March 2016|last=John Power|work=The Diplomat|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2988812|title=Discrimination flows freely at bars across Seoul|website=Korea JoongAng Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaobserver.com/taxi-drivers-to-lose-license-for-refusing-passengers-25902/|title=Taxi drivers to lose license for refusing passengers|date=28 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a survey conducted by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea among foreign residents in South Korea in 2019, 68.4% of respondents declared they had experienced racial discrimination, and many of them said they experienced it due of their Korean language skills (62.3%), because they were not Korean (59.7%), or due to  their race (44.7%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Herald |first1=The Korea |title=7 in 10 foreign residents say 'racism exists' in S.

In 2009, assistant professor Paul Jambor at [[Korea University]] claimed that Korean college students exhibit discrimination towards non-Korean professors by calling them by their first names and not showing the same amount of respect towards them as students traditionally show towards their Korean professors. He also added that such outright discrimination at South Korean universities is the reason why they are not highly ranked or seen as prestigious in Asia and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jambor|first=Paul|date=2009-07-01|title=Why South Korean Universities Have Low International Rankings – Part II: The Student Side of the Equation|url=https://scholars.fhsu.edu/alj/vol7/iss3/22|journal=Academic Leadership |volume=7|issue=3|issn=1533-7812}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With South Korean society's passion for education, South Koreans can hold a stereotypical view of [[Jews]] as the model of academic excellence as well as Jews being very intelligent. Conversely, a survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] found that 53% of South Koreans show anti-semitic tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global100.adl.org/#country/south-korea/2014|title=ADL Global 100|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|year=2004|access-date=2016-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013190422/http://global100.adl.org/#country/south-korea/2014|archive-date=2018-10-13|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the half-Jewish journalist Dave Hazzan investigated on this result and found very little anti-semitism in South Korea.&lt;ref name="Hazzan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/186194/korean-anti-semitism|title=Seoul Mates: Are Jewish Stereotypes Among Koreans a Source of Hate, or Love?|last=Hazzan|first=Dave|date=2014-11-04|publisher=Tablet|access-date=2016-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804044605/http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/186194/korean-anti-semitism|archive-date=2016-08-04|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Abe Foxman, head of the Anti-Defamation League, admitted that cultural norms affected the respondents' answers which has to be considered in future surveys.&lt;ref name="Hazzan"/&gt;

The status of [[Chinese Filipino|Filipinos of Chinese descent]] varied throughout the colonial period. It is accepted generally, though, that repressive treatment toward Chinese were practised by both Filipinos and Spaniards together with Japanese immigrants and Americans during the colonial period. After independence in 1946, Chinese quickly assumed some of the top posts in finance and business. There were several setbacks, however, such as immigration policies deemed unfair toward migrants from China during President [[Ramon Magsaysay]]'s term, as well as the limiting of hours for studying Chinese subjects in Chinese schools throughout the country, as promulgated by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].

The [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] resulted in the discrimination and consequent migration of [[Vietnam]]'s [[Hoa people|ethnic Chinese]]. Many of these people fled as "[[boat people]]". In 1978–79, some 450,000 ethnic Chinese left Vietnam by boat as refugees (many officially encouraged and assisted) or were expelled across the land border with China.
