After the [[1971 Indo-Pak War]], non-Bengalis, specifically [[Biharis]] and other Muslim refugees from India suffered from active ethnic discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificjournals.org/journals2008/articles/1313.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; They are not considered full-fledged citizens of Bangladesh and until recently were not allowed to vote.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The Bangladesh government now allows Biharis born after 1971 to vote in elections to the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/publication/detail/7828/ Citizens of Nowhere: The Stateless Biharis of Bangladesh - Refugees International 2006 report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhutan==
In 1991-92, [[Bhutan]] is said to have deported between 10,000 to 100,000 ethnic Nepalis ([[Lhotshampa]]). The actual number of refugees that were initially deported are debated by both sides. In March 2008, this population began a multiyear resettlement to third countries including the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=77513 NEPAL-BHUTAN: Bhutan questions identity of 107,000 refugees in Nepal]&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the [[United States]] is working towards resettling more than 60,000 of these [[refugee]]s in the US as third country settlement programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm | title = Bhutan refugees are 'intimidated' | author = Bhaumik, Subir | date = November 7, 2007 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burma==
[[Ne Win|Ne Win's]] rise to power in 1962 and his persecution of "resident aliens" (immigrant groups not recognised as citizens of the [[Union of Burma]]) led to an exodus of some 300,000 [[Burmese Indians]] from discriminatory policies, particularly after wholesale nationalisation of private enterprise a few years later in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Smith|year=1991|title=Burma - Insurgency and the Politics of Ethnicity|publisher=Zed Books|location=London,New Jersey|pages=43–44,98,56–57,176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma: Asians v.

==Cambodia==
The [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] disproportionately targeted ethnic minority groups. These included ethnic [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and [[Thai people|Thai]]. In the late 1960s, an estimated 425,000 ethnic Chinese lived in Cambodia, but by 1984, as a result of Khmer Rouge [[genocide]] and emigration, only about 61,400 Chinese remained in the country. The [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], a Muslim minority who are the descendants of migrants from the old state of [[Champa]], were forced to adopt the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] language and customs. A Khmer Rouge order stated that henceforth "The Cham nation no longer exists on Kampuchean soil belonging to the Khmers" (U.N. Doc. A.34/569 at 9). Only about half of the Cham survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia1.html Genocide - Cambodia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genocidewatch.org/aboutgenocide/stantoncambodianlaw.htm The Cambodian Genocide and International Law]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-studies.com/cambodia/the-chinese.html Cambodia the Chinese]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Racism in the People's Republic of China}}
Several clashes between [[African]] and Chinese students have occurred since the arrival of Africans to Chinese universities in the 1960s. Many African students come to China on a scholarship through the government to study at a university.  The African students were often perceived as threatening and not punctual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/30/world/black-africa-leaves-china-in-quandary.html ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;  A well-documented [[Nanjing anti-African protests|incident in 1988]] featured Chinese students rioting against African students studying in [[Nanjing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEED8153CF933A05751C1A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all ''New York Times'' article by Nicholas Kristof]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, police anti-drug crackdowns in Beijing's [[Sanlitun]] district were reported to target people from [[Africa]] as suspected criminals, though police officials denied targeting any group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beijingnewspeak.com/2007/09/28/sanlitun-saga-update-anti-drug-operation-uncovers-no-drugs Beijing Newspeak :: Sanlitun saga update: anti-drug operation uncovers no drugs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar sentiment has emerged in [[Guangzhou]], where a very [[Africans in Guangzhou|large group of Africans]] have settled.

{{Further2|[[Anti-Japanese sentiment in China]]}}
Anti-Japanese sentiment in China is an issue with old roots. Japan started off like other Western powers by annexing land from China towards the end of the Qing Dynasty. Dissatisfaction with the settlement and the Twenty-One Demands by the Japanese government led to a severe boycott of Japanese products in China. Bitterness in China persists over the atrocities of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], such as the [[Nanjing Massacre]] and Japan's post-war actions. Today, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|textbook revisionism and censorship]] remain contentious issues.

=== Hong Kong ===
[[File:Hk anti-discrimination poster.jpg|thumb|right|An [[racism|anti-discrimination]] poster in a Hong Kong [[MTR|subway]] station. Circa. 2005]]
In a population of almost 7 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/press_release/press_releases_on_statistics/index.jsp?sID=1752&amp;sSUBID=7113&amp;subjectID=&amp;charsetID=&amp;displayMode=D]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hong Kong]] has gained a reputation as international city, while remaining predominantly Chinese. This multi-culturalism has raised issues of racial and sex discrimination, particularly among the 350,000 [[list of ethnic groups|ethnic]] minorities such as Nepalese, Indians, Indonesians, Pakistanis and Filipinos, who have long established minority communities since the founding days of the former colony or have come to Hong Kong recently to work as domestic workers. For example, Filipino females are sometimes addressed by the degratory term "Bun Mui" and Filipino males "Bun Jai" (literally Filipino girl and Filipino boy, respectively).{{Citation needed|reason=Also, need to qualify reference to lack of minimum wage, as certain foreign employees in Hong Kong have been eligible to be protected by minimum wage. See now the new [http://www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/mwo.htm Minimum Wage Ordinance] which will come into force on 1 May 2011.|date=September 2011}} In 2003, the number of complaints filed with the body handling discrimination issues, the Equal Opportunities Commission&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoc.org.hk/eoc/GraphicsFolder/default.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; was up by 31 percent.

Discrimination against Mainland Chinese people runs rife in Hong Kong. Mainlanders were traditionally looked down upon as "bumpkins", or people of lower social standing, due to Hong Kong citizens typically being wealthier. However, in recent years, Mainland Chinese people have been able to catch up. In Hong Kong, Mainlanders are often referred to as "locusts"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21546051 |work=The Economist |title=Dogs and locusts |date=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are seen as invaders who swarm the city and drain its resources, and are heavily discriminated against. As of February 2012, there have been stickers placed around the streets, in newspapers and on the Internet depicting Mainland "locusts" invading the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinawhisper.com/different-versions-of-hong-kongs-locust-ads-appear-on-internet |title=Different versions of Hong Kong’s locust ads appear on Internet |deadurl=no |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A race discrimination bill has been demanded by human rights groups for the last 10 years, and the government has been accused of putting the issue on the back burner.

Last December 3, 2006 was the first time a drafted bill was released onto the Legislative Council, and is expected to be passed before the end of 2008. However, the bill is criticized for being "too conservative".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahrchk.net/ahrc-in-news/mainfile.php/2004ahrcinnews/222/]&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusion of mainland Chinese migrants has also been a source of controversy, with the government claiming that they are not considered to be of a different race. Another issue of the bill has been of language instruction in schools.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The earliest rejection of discrimination spiritually, was made as far back as the Hindu sacred text of [[Bhagavada Gita]], which says that no person, no matter what, is barred from enlightenment.  Even early Hindu texts such as the [[Rig Veda]] discourage the abuse of outcastes.  The text reads, "[[Indra]], you lifted up the outcast who was oppressed, you glorified the blind and the lame." (Rg-Veda 2:13:12).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharatvani.org/books/ait/ch47.htm 4.7. INDRA AND SHIVA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The caste system was equivalent to division of labour and a [[Shudra]]'s son (the lowest caste) could become a [[Brahmin]]. But later this system became hereditary and a Shudra's son would remain a Shudra.
During the [[British Raj]], racist views against Indians based on the systemic [[scientific racism]] practiced in Europe at the time were popularized. Views include dividing linguistic groups into ethnic "classes" (see [[Historical definitions of races in India]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=dhbwDFfE9J8C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=indophobia&amp;source=web&amp;ots=G3Y5MxDQde&amp;sig=yU2htlm28bCIPV_8AnUZRCQ9X70]&lt;/ref&gt; The first Prime minister of India, Pandit [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], wrote
{{Cquote|"we in India have known racialism in all its forms ever since the commencement of [[British Raj|British rule]]. The idea of a [[master race]] is inherent in imperialism ... India as a nation and Indians as individuals were subjected to insult, humiliation and contemptuous treatment. The English were an imperial race, we were told, with the God-given right to govern us and keep us in subjection; if we protested we were reminded of the 'tiger qualities of an imperial race'.}}"&lt;ref name="NehruIndia"&gt;From [[Discovery of India]] by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], reproduced from "History : Modern India" (p108) by S.N. Sen, New Age Publishers, ISBN 81-224-1774-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed by some activists&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/jpc/echoes/echoes-17-04.html]&lt;/ref&gt; that [[casteism]] practised in India is a form of racism, but this is debated by those who believe that casteism has nothing to do with physical attributes, unlike racism. At the UN world conference on racism (August 31 - September 7, 2001) the Indian Government opposed the discussion of caste in the conference, saying that "the caste issue is not the same as racism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1495052.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations that caste amounts to race were addressed and rejected by [[B.R. Ambedkar]], an advocate for Dalit rights and critic of untouchability. He wrote that "The [[Brahmin]] of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] is racially of the same stock as the Chamar ([[Dalit]]) of Punjab, and that the  "Caste system does not demarcate racial division. Caste system is a social division of people of the same race",&lt;ref&gt;[[B. R. Ambedkar|Ambedkar]], The Annihilation of Caste. p.49 of his Writings and Speeches, vol.1, Education Dpt., Government of Maharashtra 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Such allegations have also been rejected by many sociologists such as [[Andre Béteille]], who writes that treating caste as a form of racism is "politically mischievous" and worse, "scientifically nonsense" since there is no discernible difference in the racial characteristics between [[Brahmins]] and [[Scheduled Castes]]. He writes that "Every social group cannot be regarded as a race simply because we want to protect it against prejudice and discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcar.alrc.net/mainfile2.php/For+the+negative/14/] Andre Beteille, Race and Caste,''The Hindu'', 10 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, the view of the caste system as "static and unchanging" (which would indicate a form of racial discrimination) has been disputed by many scholars. Sociologists describe how the perception of the caste system as a static and textual stratification has given way to the perception of the caste system as a more processual, empirical and contextual stratification. Others have applied theoretical models to explain mobility and flexibility in the caste system in India.&lt;ref name="Silverberg Paper"&gt;{{cite journal |author = James Silverberg | year = 1969 |month = November |title = Social Mobility in the Caste System in India: An Interdisciplinary Symposium |journal = The American Journal of Sociology |volume = 75 |issue = 3 |pages = 443–444 |doi= | jstor=2775721}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these scholars, groups of lower-caste individuals could seek to elevate the status of their caste by attempting to emulate the practices of higher castes.

Sociologist [[M. N. Srinivas]] has also debated the question of rigidity in Caste.&lt;ref&gt;Srinivas, M.N, Religion and Society among the Coorgs of South India by MN Srinivas, Page 32 (Oxford, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caste in Modern India; And other essays: Page 48. (Media Promoters &amp; Publishers Pvt. Ltd, Bombay; First Published: 1962, 11th Reprint: 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; For details see [[sanskritization]].

[[Pakistan]]i-American sociologist [[Ayesha Jalal]] also rejects these allegations. In her book, "Democracy and Authoritarianism in [[South Asia]]", she writes that "As for [[Hinduism]], the hierarchical principles of the Brahmanical social order have always been contested from within Hindu society, suggesting that equality has been and continues to be both valued and practiced."&lt;ref&gt;A. Jalal, Democracy and Authoritarianism in [[South Asia]]: A Comparative and Historical Perspective (Contemporary South Asia), Cambridge University Press (May 26, 1995), ISBN 0-521-47862-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, many [[Hindu reform movements]] have actively combated casteism and the practice of untouchability (segregation of the lower castes). In order to curb the practice of caste-based discrimination, numerous laws, including [[Constitution of India|constitutional laws]], have been passed in India outlawing casteist discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Bayly, Susan (July 1999). Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age. Cambridge University Press. {{doi|10.2277/0521264340}}. ISBN 978-0-521-26434-1&lt;/ref&gt;[[Reservation in India|Special quotas]] are provided to the lower castes in access to schools and jobs. Lower caste political parties have achieved increasing prominence in the Indian political landscape since India's independence. The public practice of casteism has diminished significantly among the large urban and cosmopolitan classes in India. Nonetheless, the fight to end casteism is an uphill struggle, especially in rural areas where education and modernity are scarce, and numerous hate crimes have taken place in India that have been attributed to Casteism.

[[India]]'s treatment of its lower-class [[Dalit (outcaste)|Dalits]] has been described by [[UNESCO]] as "India's hidden apartheid".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_09/uk/doss22.htm India’s "hidden apartheid"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Rajeev Dhavan]], of India's leading English-language newspaper ''[[The Hindu]]'', "''casteism'' is India's apartheid which will continue in its most vicious and persistent forms for decades to come."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/08/24/stories/05242523.htm The Hindu : India's apartheid&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[India]]n [[Indian caste system|caste system]], a [[Dalit]], often called an untouchable, is a person who lay outside the [[Indian Caste System]]. Historically,  Hindu Dalits were forbidden to worship in temples and Muslim Dalits forbidden in mosques,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/story/12109.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Dalits who converted to Christianity are frequently discriminated against by upper-caste Catholic priests and nuns.&lt;ref&gt;Kerala Christians and the Caste System C. J. Fuller Man, New Series, Vol. 11, No. 1. (Mar., 1976), pp. 53-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianhope.free.fr/site_eng/article_5.php3]&lt;/ref&gt;
The majority of rural Dalits still live in [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and experience atrocities to the scale of 110,000 registered cases a year according to 2005 statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/03/02/india-dalits.html UN report slams India for caste discrimination]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such allegations of apartheid are regarded by academic sociologists as a [[political epithet]], since apartheid implies state sponsored discrimination, and no such thing exists in India. Anti-dalit prejudice and discrimination is a social malaise that exists primarily in rural areas, where small societies can track the caste lineage of individuals and discriminate accordingly. Sociologists Kevin Reilly, Stephen Kaufman, Angela Bodino, while being critical of casteism, conclude that modern India does not practice any "apartheid" since there is no state sanctioned discrimination.&lt;ref name="Reilley et al."&gt;Kevin Reilly, Stephen Kaufman, Angela Bodino, Racism: A Global Reader P21, M.E. Sharpe, 2003 ISBN 0-7656-1060-4.&lt;/ref&gt; They write that [[Caste]]ism in India is presently "not apartheid. In fact, untouchables, as well as tribal people and members of the lowest castes in India benefit from broad [[Reservation in India|affirmative action programmes]] and are enjoying greater political power."&lt;ref name="Reilley et al."/&gt;

A number of discriminatory laws against [[Chinese Indonesian#Post-independence and New Order Era|Chinese Indonesians]] were enacted by the government of [[Indonesia]]. In 1959, President [[Sukarno]] approved [[PP 10/1959]] that forced Chinese Indonesians to close their businesses in rural areas and relocate into urban areas. Moreover, political pressures in the 1970s and 1980s restricted the role of the Chinese Indonesian in politics, academics, and the military. As a result, they were thereafter constrained professionally to becoming entrepreneurs and professional managers in trade, manufacturing, and banking. In the 1960s, following the failed alleged Communist coup attempt in 1965, there was a strong sentiment against the Chinese Indonesians who were accused of being Communist collaborators. In 1998, Indonesia riots over higher food prices and rumors of hoarding by merchants and shopkeepers often degenerated into anti-Chinese attacks. There were also racism against religion &amp; believe wide across the country, especially between [[Islam]] and [[Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/1998/02/24/qanda.t_2.php International Herald Tribune: Q&amp;A / Juwono Sudarsono, Defense Official : Racism in Indonesia Undercuts Unity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Indonesian rule, the Asian population was estimated at 16,600. Critics suspect that the Transmigration program's purpose is to tip the balance of the province's population from the heavily [[Melanesians|Melanesian]] Papuans toward western Indonesians, thus further consolidating Indonesian control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/cline/papua/transmigration.htm West Papua - Transmigration]&lt;/ref&gt;

Just 305 persons were recognized as refugees by Japan from 1981, when Japan ratified the [[U.N.]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDQ/is_2003_Feb_24/ai_98002254 Japan's refugee policy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwanami.co.jp/jpworld/text/ClosedCountry01.html Questioning Japan's 'Closed Country' Policy on Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt; Former Prime Minister [[Taro Aso]] called Japan a "one race" nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/member/member.html?nn20051018a7.htm Aso says Japan is nation of 'one race']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ainu people]] are an ethnic group indigenous to [[Hokkaidō]], northern [[Honshū]], the [[Kuril Islands]], much of [[Sakhalin]], and the southernmost third of the [[Kamchatka peninsula]]. As Japanese settlement expanded, the Ainu were pushed northward, until by the [[Meiji period]] they were confined by the government to a small area in Hokkaidō, in a manner similar to the placing of American Indians on reservations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/japan/57.htm Japan - Ainu]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philippines ==
In the Philippines, preferential treatment were given to [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] and [[Filipino mestizo|Spanish Mestizos]] during the Spanish colonization of the country. After 1898, control of the islands passed on to the new American overlords, who, together with a new generation of [[Amerasian]]s, form one of the country's social elite. Up to the present-day, descendants of White colonizers of the country still obtain a positive treatment, while in the entertainment industry, the actors and actresses are overwhelmingly of part-[[White]] descent.

Similarly, the status of [[Chinese Filipino|Filipinos of Chinese descent]] varied throughout the colonial powers. It is accepted generally, though, that a repressive treatment toward the Chinese were practised by both Filipinos and Spaniards and/or Japanese immigrants and Americans during the colonial period. After independence on 1946, the Chinese quickly assumed some of the top posts in finance and business. There were several repressions against the Chinese, however, such as immigration policies deemed unfair toward migrants from China during President [[Ramon Magsaysay]]'s term, as well as the limiting of hours for studying Chinese subjects in Chinese schools throughout the country, as promulgated by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. In addition, as recent as 1992 and 1998, there were several anti-Chinese protests led by [[Armando Ducat]], a Filipino businessman, who claimed that the Chinese rose to the top economic ladder through bribery and extortion. This has not been proven, however. To this day, there are still [[Sinophobia|anti-Chinese]] sentiments among a minority of the Philippine population, as manifested in Internet forums and periodic public demonstrations. 

The Philippines is a multicultural country. The majority of the population is [[Malayo-Polynesian]] groups, with small but politically and economically important minorities of Chinese, Spanish, American, Japanese, and Arab descent. The country is also home to an increasing number of immigrants from South Korea, India, Indonesia, Australia, the United Kingdom, and other countries.

The term "[[pogrom]]" became commonly used in English after a large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots swept through south-western [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]] in 1881&amp;ndash;1884. A much bloodier wave of pogroms broke out in 1903&amp;ndash;1906, leaving an estimated 2,000 Jews dead.  By the beginning of the 20th century, most European Jews lived in the so-called [[Pale of Settlement]], the Western frontier of the [[Russian Empire]] consisting generally of the modern-day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and neighboring regions.  Many pogroms accompanied the [[Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]], an estimated 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities throughout the former [[Russian Empire]]; the number of Jewish orphans exceeded 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-215022/anti-Semitism Anti-Semitism in modern Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary L Rubinstein, Daniel C Cohn-Sherbok, Abraham J Edelheit, William D Rubinstein, ''The Jews in the Modern World'', Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism inside Russia is quite a modern post-[[USSR]] phenomenon that has been steadily growing in the past decade. In the 2000s, [[neo-Nazi]] groups inside [[Russia]] have risen to include as many as tens of thousands of people.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/08/14/MNGUSE7N2D1.DTL]&lt;/ref&gt; Racism against the [[peoples of the Caucasus]], Africans, Central Asians and East Asians (Vietnamese, Chinese, etc.) is an ever-increasing problem.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=726]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singapore ==
{{Main|Anti-Malay sentiment}}
The last time Singapore had a racial riot was in 1964, but since then things have been tranquil. Four decades after independence from Britain, a whole new generation of Singaporeans has passed out from schools and universities, more argumentative and articulate.

Yet whilst some things change, others seem to remain the same.  For as long as anyone can remember, many women in Singapore with dark skin have been regarded by men as undesirable dating or marriage partners, hence one can easily find skin whitening products in stores and advertisements in Singaporean newspapers for skin-whitening products.

People who date (or marry) outside their own ethnic group are often socially shunned, so many Singaporeans prefer to stick to their own kind and are not inclined to reach out to have friends or dating partners of another ethnic group even if they have classmates or colleagues of other ethncity, given the social stigma on dating or marrying outside one's ethnic group.

The reasons for this racism in Singapore are multifold and include:

* The failure to fully face up to Singapore's relatively recent colonial past and reconcile that with government policies (e.g. promotion of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] which is one of four official languages, etc.) and cultural and language practices.

* Deeply rooted myths of cultural, ethnic, 'racial' purity, sense of ethnic superiority, etc.

* A collective cultural tendency; that is a tendency to focus on group dynamics more at a societal and individual level, this in turn leads to an increased emphasis on being part of the 'in' group and not part of the 'other'.  Many have on the identity document an ethnic classification of ''Other'', although there have been recent reforms in 2011 that allows for double-barrel ethnic identification like "Indian Chinese" or "Chinese Indian" for individuals of mixed heritage.

* A lack of political will to enact anti-discrimination laws that might support or defend non-Chinese minorities who may encounter discrimation (e.g. in employment) from the majority (Han) Chinese.

* A general lack or disdain for appreciating other cultures at more than a geopolitical level, built partly on overblown 'ethnic' pride.

* In [[Singapore]] there is a certain amount of "victim mentality" with the "white" man being the main culprit.  One can see evidence of a similar mentality in the approach of [[Robert Mugabe]] (President of [[Zimbabwe]]) in blaming all failings on former [[colonialism|colonial]] powers, all racism is done by white, all Western influence is evil etc. etc. - this leads to cultural chauvinism in the short-term, and deeply entrenched racism in the long-term.  The 'white man' is affectionately or unaffectionately called "ang mo" (short for "ang mo kui" or "red-haired devil", or "ang mo kao" or "red-haired dog") in the [[Minnan]] dialect.  Typically, the single white man, whether expatriate or visitor, is seen as the insatiable poacher of Singaporean women of Asian origin.  On a political level, this translates to blaming the 'West' or [[Westerners]] in general for many ills in particular the lack of [[filial piety]] amongst Singaporeans who have allegedly been influenced by the West.

In contrast, some clubs (typically those founded by expatriates) and Western restaurants are sometimes accused of discriminating against local Singaporeans in favour of Western club members and patrons.

Racism has also widened to include recent Chinese migrants from China.   Singaporeans have made insulting remarks about "ugly, rude" Chinese mainlanders who have benefited from Singapore's open-door policy to migrants from China.

In simple terms, [[Singaporeans]] have little desire to confront racism. Singapore is dominated by a single ethno-linguistic group to a much greater extent than most western or even middle eastern countries. Whilst not mono-cultural, Singapore is not multi-cultural as other countries like [[Canada]], [[U.S.A.]] or [[France]] understand it.  This in turn means there a perception of being absolutely no economic, social or cultural benefit to combating discrimination, because put bluntly, the group(s) e.g. minority [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], [[India]]ns, [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]], [[Filipinos]], [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesians]], [[Europeans]], [[Jews]], etc. that would complain are so much smaller as a proportion of the population, or are only non-[[citizens]], so there is much less willingness on the part of political leaders to tap into their aspirations to earn votes, hence the voices of discrimitated minorities are simply less important in Singapore.  A simple gloss that is often used as an easy way out is the phrase "Singapore is a multi-racial society" that appears over and over again in the media and government publications.  The phrase is typically used without going beyond or analysing the circumstances of discriminated minorities including their housing, job and income situations.  The preference is to deal with expressions of extreme racism, e.g. on web sites, by way of the [[Sedition Act (Malaysia)|Sedition Act]].  This, however, curtails freedom of speech in Singapore.

It is still Chinese-Malay animosity that appears to pose the biggest threat in spite of general inter-racial tolerance. The potential dangers become stark under the threat of possible Jemaah Islamiah bombings in Singapore, which could result, it is feared, in some kind of a backlash against innocent Malay [[Muslims]]. The government has put in place plans involving religious and community leaders of all races that will mitigate race violence if the bombs do go off. A [[Racial Harmony Day]] is held every year. Schools and [[Housing Development Board]] [[housing estates]] enforce ethnic quotas based on the race populations to prevent racial enclaves. The system ensures the majority Chinese live with a certain ratio of Malays and Indians and vice-versa. As a result, children grow up with at least some racial mixing both at school and their residential blocks. For many years, [[community leaders]] have been organising cross-visits to celebrate each other's cultural and religious festivals.  However, the result has not eradicated race remarks frequently made by young people who believe that the Internet and free expressions give them the licence to say what they want.   A number of young [[bloggers]] and commentators have been charged under the Sedition Act for making disparaging remarks about [[race (classification of humans)|race]] and [[religion]].  Typically they contain anti-Malay and anti-Muslim comments. Insulting words would be used to describe Malays, satirised their attitudes, social customs and religious prohibitions.  Some more extreme views include suggestions to blow up Muslim holy sites and eliminate [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]].  Hate messages have become a norm amongst young Singaporean net users, a significant number of whom make up the bigots of bloggersphere.

The [[Nationality Law of the Republic of China]] has been criticized&lt;ref&gt;[http://jidanni.org/foreigner/ Not allowed to be Taiwanese]&lt;/ref&gt; for its methods of determining which immigrants get citizenship.

== Vietnam ==
The [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] resulted in the discrimination and consequent migration of [[Vietnam]]'s [[Hoa|ethnic Chinese]]. Many of these people fled as "[[boat people]]". In 1978-79, some 450,000 ethnic Chinese left Vietnam by boat as refugees (many officially encouraged and assisted) or were expelled across the land border with China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovervancouver.com/GVB/vancouver-vietnamese.asp/ Vietnamese], Kevin Griffin&lt;/ref&gt;
