'''''Windsor v. United States''''' is an appellate case pending in the [[United States Supreme Court]] of a lawsuit decided in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. The Court affirmed the decision in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], which found Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA) unconstitutional, as it defines the term ''marriage'' as "a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife" and ''spouse'' as "a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife".

==Background==
In 2007, Edith "Edie" Windsor and Thea Spyer, residents of New York, married in [[Toronto]], Ontario, after 40 years of romantic partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shapiro|first=Lila|title=Edie Windsor vs. DOMA: 83-Year-Old Lesbian Petitions U.S. Supreme Court To Hear Case|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/16/edie-windsor-doma_n_1675983.html|accessdate=July 30, 2012|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spyer died in 2009, at which time New York legally recognized same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |url=http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/windsor-v-united-states-thea-edie-doma |title=''Windsor v.

If federal law accorded their marriage the same status as different-sex marriages recognized by their state, she would have paid no taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=John |title=Gay Couple to Sue over U.S. Marriage Law |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/us/09marriage.html |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Chris |title=Two New Lawsuits Target DOMA |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2010/11/09/two-new-lawsuits-target-doma/ |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Washington Blade]]|date=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial proceedings==
The law firm [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison]], in conjunction with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), filed the case in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]] on behalf of Windsor as executor of Spyer's estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/windsor-v-united-states-complaint ''Windsor v.

On February 23, 2011, Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] released a memo regarding two lawsuits challenging DOMA section 3, ''Windsor'' and ''[[Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management]]''. It explained that the Obama administration had determined that classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to [[heightened scrutiny]], and therefore it could no longer defend the constitutionality of DOMA's section 3.&lt;ref name="HolderPressRelease"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html |title=Statement of the Attorney General on Litigation Involving the Defense of Marriage Act |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=February 23, 2011 |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The administration intends to continue enforcing the law until it is either repealed by Congress or finally declared unconstitutional in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=GLAD |url=http://www.glad.org/current/news-detail/glad-statement-on-dojs-announcement-it-wont-defend-constitutionality-of-dom/ |title=GLAD Statement on DOJ's Announcement it Won't Defend Constitutionality of DOMA in ''Pedersen'' |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 18, [[Paul Clement]], representing the [[Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group]] of the House of Representatives (BLAG), filed a motion asking to be allowed to intervene in the suit "for the limited purpose of defending the constitutionality of Section III" of DOMA. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] attorneys did not oppose the motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Metro Weekly |url=http://www.Metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/04/house-leadership-seeks-to-inte.html |first=Chris |last=Geidner |title=House Leadership Seeks to Intervene in DOMA Case |date=April 18, 2011 |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windsor's attorneys filed a motion for summary judgment on June 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Metro Weekly |url=http://Metroweekly.com/poliglot/MotionSJ.pdf |title=Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment |date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York Attorney General [[Eric Schneiderman]] filed a brief supporting Windsor's claim on July 26, arguing that DOMA Section 3 cannot survive the scrutiny used for classifications based on sex and constitutes "an intrusion on the power of the state to define marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Metro Weekly |url=http://Metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/07/new-york-attorney-general-take.html |first=Chris |last=Geidner |title=New York Attorney General Takes Edith Windsor's Side in DOMA Challenge |date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, BLAG filed its brief seeking summary judgment on the grounds that marriage is not a fundamental right and that classification based on sexual orientation is not subject to heightened scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Metro Weekly |url=http://Metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/08/house-gop-leaders-say-court-sh.html |first=Chris |last=Geidner |title=House GOP Leaders Say Court Should Dismiss Edith Windsor's Lawsuit, Find DOMA Constitutional |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2012, Judge [[Barbara S. Jones]] ruled that, based on [[rational basis review]], section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional as applied in the case as it violated plaintiff's rights under the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and ordered Windsor receive the tax refund due her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/windsor_doma.pdf ''Windsor v. United States''], 833 F. Supp. 2d 394 (S.D.N.Y 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff said afterward, "It's thrilling to have a court finally recognize how unfair it is for the government to have treated us as though we were strangers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Metro Weekly |url=http://www.Metroweekly.com/poliglot/2012/06/another-federal-judge-finds-doma-marriage-definiti.html |first=Chris |last=Geidner |title=Another Federal Judge Finds DOMA Marriage Definition Unconstitutional, Now in Widow's Case |date=June 6, 2012 |accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/08/nyregion/woman-says-same-sex-marriage-bias-cost-her-over-500000.html |first=Jim |last=Dwyer |title=She Waited 40 Years to Marry, Then When Her Wife Died, the Tax Bill Came |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals==
The Justice Department filed a notice of appeal on June 14, 2012, despite its approval of the ruling, to facilitate BLAG's defense of the statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Metro Weekly |url=http://www.Metroweekly.com/poliglot/2012/06/domas-federal-definition-of-marriage-what-is-happe.html |first=Chris |last=Geidner |title=The DOMA Lawsuits: What Is Happening? |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; BLAG filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ's Second Circuit appeal on July 19, claiming the DOJ lacks standing because it prevailed in the District Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Windsor v.

USA: 2nd Circuit oral arguments set for September 27 |work=Prop 8 Trial Tracker |date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DOJ replied to BLAG's motion to dismiss on August 3, asserting (1) its standing as an "aggrieved party" because the District Court's stay prevents DOJ from taking steps to cease enforcement of section 3 of DOMA and (2) that its participation ensures consideration of the constitutional issue if the Second Circuit or the Supreme Court determines that BLAG lacks standing.&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor v.
