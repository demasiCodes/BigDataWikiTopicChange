'''''United States v. Windsor''''', {{scite|570|___|2013}} (Docket No. {{SupremeCourtDocket|12|307}}),&lt;!-- Docket No. can probably be removed once a full SC citation is available --&gt; is a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] case&lt;ref name="NBCNews20130627" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20130627" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mears20130627" /&gt; in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held that restricting U.S. federal interpretation of "marriage" and "spouse" to apply only to [[heterosexual]] unions, by Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), is unconstitutional under the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].

Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer, a [[same-sex couple]] residing in [[New York]], were lawfully married in [[Ontario, Canada]] in 2007. Spyer died in 2009, leaving her entire [[Estate (law)|estate]] to Windsor. Windsor sought to claim the federal [[Inheritance tax|estate tax]] [[Tax exemption|exemption]] for [[Widow|surviving spouse]]s. She was barred from doing so by Section 3 of DOMA (codified at {{usc|1|7}}), which provided that the term "spouse" only applies to a marriage between a man and woman. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] found that the exemption did not apply to [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]s, denied Windsor's claim, and compelled her to pay $363,053 in estate taxes.

On November 9, 2010, a lawsuit was filed against the federal government in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], where Windsor sought a refund because DOMA singled out legally married same-sex couples for "differential treatment compared to other similarly situated couples without justification."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Complaint: Windor v. United States|url=http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-11-9-WindsorvUS-Complaint.pdf|publisher=aclu.org|accessdate=June 27, 2013|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 23, 2011, U.S. Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] issued a statement from the [[Obama administration]] that agreed with the plaintiff's position that DOMA violated the [[U.S. Constitution]] and said he would no longer defend the law in court. On April 18, 2011, [[Paul Clement]], representing the [[Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group]] (BLAG) continued defense of the law. On June 6, 2012, Judge [[Barbara S. Jones]] ruled that Section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional under the due process guarantees of the Fifth Amendment and ordered the federal government to issue the tax refund, including interest. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed the decision on October 18, 2012.

BLAG and the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ) appealed the decision to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]], which granted a [[writ]] of [[certiorari]] in December 2012. On March 27, 2013, the court heard oral arguments. On June 26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a 5–4 decision declaring Section 3 of DOMA to be unconstitutional "as a deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment."&lt;ref name="Opinion"&gt;''United States v. Windsor'', {{ussc|570||June 26, 2013|docket=12-307}}. Retrieved June 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

On the same day, the court also issued a separate 5–4 decision in ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'' — a case related to [[California Proposition 8|California's constitutional amendment initiative barring same-sex marriage]]. The decision effectively allowed [[same-sex marriage in California|same-sex marriages in that state]] to resume after the court ruled that the proponents of the initiative lacked [[Article III]] [[standing (law)|standing]] to appeal in federal court based on its established interpretation of the [[case or controversy clause]].

==Background==
In 2007, Edith "Edie" Windsor and Thea Spyer, residents of New York, married in [[Toronto]], Ontario, under the provisions set forth in the [[Canadian family law#Marriage|Canadian]] [[Civil Marriage Act]], after 40 years of romantic partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shapiro |first=Lila |title=Edie Windsor vs. DOMA: 83-Year-Old Lesbian Petitions U.S. Supreme Court To Hear Case |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/16/edie-windsor-doma_n_1675983.html |accessdate=July 30, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's first openly gay judge, Justice [[Harvey Brownstone]], officiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thea Spyer and Edith Windsor |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/fashion/weddings/27spyer.html |accessdate=January 1, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windsor had first suggested engagement in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ny-plaintiff-gay-benefits-bigger-marriage-18095217#.UOGYuiZGJ5T |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=December 30, 2012 |title=NY Plaintiff: Gay Benefits 'Bigger Than Marriage' |last=Neumeister |first=Larry |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |quote=It was not until the spring of 1965 that they got together.

If federal law had recognized the validity of their marriage, Windsor would have qualified for an unlimited spousal deduction and paid no federal estate taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=John |title=Gay Couple to Sue over U.S. Marriage Law |date=November 8, 2010 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/us/09marriage.html |accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Chris |title=Two New Lawsuits Target DOMA |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2010/11/09/two-new-lawsuits-target-doma/ |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |newspaper=[[Washington Blade]]|date=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, New York Governor [[David Paterson]] had ordered state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions. Some lower-level state courts had made similar rulings, but whether the state's [[New York State Court of Appeals|highest court]] would give such a ruling the force of law, as Windsor's claim for a refund required, remained uncertain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peters |first=Jeremy W.|title=New York to Back Same-Sex Unions From Elsewhere|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/29/nyregion/29marriage.html|accessdate=July 20, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was disputed throughout her lawsuit.

Windsor first found several gay rights advocacy groups unwilling to represent her, until she was referred to Roberta Kaplan, a partner at the law firm of [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP]], who later recalled: "When I heard her story, it took me about five seconds, maybe less" to agree to represent her. Kaplan had unsuccessfully represented the plaintiffs in a 2006 case that challenged the inability of same-sex couples to marry under New York law, ''Hernández v. Robles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Peter Applebome|Applebome, Peter]] |title=Reveling in Her Supreme Court Moment |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/nyregion/edith-windsor-gay-widow-revels-in-supreme-court-fight.html |accessdate=December 13, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===District Court===
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, in conjunction with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), filed the case in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]] on behalf of Windsor as executor of Spyer's estate on November 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/windsor-v-united-states-complaint ''Windsor v.

On February 23, 2011, Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] released a statement regarding two lawsuits challenging DOMA Section 3, ''Windsor'' and ''[[Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management]]''. It explained that the Obama administration had determined that classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to [[heightened scrutiny]], and therefore it could no longer defend the constitutionality of DOMA's Section 3.&lt;ref name="HolderPressRelease"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html |title=Statement of the Attorney General on Litigation Involving the Defense of Marriage Act |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=February 23, 2011 |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] did not oppose the motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Metro Weekly]] |url=http://www.Metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/04/house-leadership-seeks-to-inte.html |first=Chris |last=Geidner |title=House Leadership Seeks to Intervene in DOMA Case |date=April 18, 2011 |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2012, Judge [[Barbara S.

Despite its approval of the ruling, the Justice Department filed a notice of appeal on June 14, 2012 to facilitate BLAG's defense of the statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Metro Weekly]] |url=http://www.Metroweekly.com/poliglot/2012/06/domas-federal-definition-of-marriage-what-is-happe.html |first=Chris |last=Geidner |title=The DOMA Lawsuits: What Is Happening? |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; BLAG filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ's [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]] appeal on July 19, claiming the DOJ lacks standing because it prevailed in the District Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Windsor v.

Thus they were part of a [[Suspect classification#Quasi-suspect class|quasi-suspect class]] that deserves any law restricting its rights to be subjected to [[intermediate scrutiny]]. Because DOMA could not pass that test, Judge Jacobs wrote, it is unconstitutional under the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment.&lt;ref name="Reuters20121018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schwartz |first=John |title=U.S. Marriage Act Is Unfair to Gays, Court Panel Says |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/us/appeals-court-rules-against-defense-of-marriage-act.html |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supreme Court===
[[File:View of Supreme Court on June 26, 2013.JPG|thumb|right|Photo of the steps of the United States Supreme Court building on the morning of June 26, 2013, hours before the court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act.]]
On September 11, 2012, following Windsor's petition for certiorari before judgment and before the Second Circuit's ruling, the Department of Justice filed its own petition for [[certiorari]] before judgment with the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/105738696/12-307-1-DOJ-Petition Petition for Certiorari (No 12-307).] Retrieved December 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; After the appellate ruling on October 18, the parties filed supplemental briefs.&lt;ref name="docket 12-307"&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-307.htm Docket report for ''United States v. Windsor'' (12–307)]. Retrieved December 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 7, the Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] in the case, now ''United States v. Windsor'', accepting the DOJ's petition.

In addition to the question presented by the DOJ &amp;ndash; "Whether Section 3 of DOMA violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection" for same sex partners &amp;ndash; the court also asked the parties to brief and argue two other questions: whether the government's agreement with the Second Circuit's decision deprived the court of a "real dispute" and therefore of jurisdiction to hear the case, and whether BLAG had [[standing (law)|standing]] in its own right, i.e., the legal right to independently ask for the appeal to be heard in the event that the government was not a valid petitioner. [[Article III of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] (the "[[Case or Controversy clause]]")  forbids parties that do not themselves have a ''real'' and ''personal'' ("particularized") complaint from filing a case or appeal in a federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Order List |url=http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/120712zr_3f14.pdf|publisher=United States Supreme Court|accessdate=December 8, 2012|date=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A finding that the government lacked a "real" complaint because of its approval of the prior ruling and that BLAG lacked legal standing to appeal separately, would have automatically led to the appeal being dismissed, as ultimately happened in the parallel same-sex marriage case ''[[Hollingsworth v.

Windsor noted in a statement that when she and her partner met nearly 50 years prior that they both never dreamed their marriage would land before the Supreme Court "as an example of why gay married couples should be treated equally, and not like second-class citizens."

==Opinion of the Court==

===Majority opinion===
In a 5–4 decision issued on June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court found Section 3 of DOMA (codified at {{usc|1|7}}) to be unconstitutional,&lt;ref name="NBCNews20130627"&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act, paves way for gay marriage to resume in California|url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/26/19151971-supreme-court-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act-paves-way-for-gay-marriage-to-resume-in-california?lite|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=29 June 2013|author=Pete Williams and Erin McClam|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20130627"&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Supreme Court Bolsters Gay Marriage With Two Major Rulings|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/us/politics/supreme-court-gay-marriage.html|accessdate=29 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mears20130627"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mears|first=Bill|title=Supreme Court strikes down federal provision on same-sex marriage benefits|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/26/politics/scotus-same-sex-doma/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=29 June 2013|date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurley|first=Lawrence|title=Gay marriage gets big boost in two Supreme Court rulings|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/26/us-usa-court-gaymarriage-idUSBRE95P06W20130626|work=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=29 June 2013|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "as a deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment".&lt;ref name="Opinion"/&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mears|first=Bill|title=Key quotes from Supreme Court ruling on Defense of Marriage Act|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/26/politics/scotus-same-sex-doma-quotes/index.html|accessdate=29 June 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Anthony Kennedy]] authored the majority opinion, joined by Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]], [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]], [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]], and [[Elena Kagan|Kagan]].&lt;ref name="WP20130626"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court/2013/06/26/f0039814-d9ab-11e2-a016-92547bf094cc_story.html |title=Supreme Court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act |newspaper=The Washington Post |first=Robert |last=Barnes |date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy's decision to strike down a central part of DOMA cited the principles of state autonomy, equal protection and liberty,&lt;ref name="WP20130626" /&gt; but the constitutional basis for striking down the law was not entirely clear, as it had elements of [[federalism]], equal protection and due process.&lt;ref name="NYT20130627" /&gt; The Court wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomaston|first=Scottie|title=Analysis: Supreme Court Invalidates Section 3 of DOMA, Paving the Way for Federal Recognition of Same-Sex Marriages|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scottie-thomaston/analysis-supreme-court-in_b_3506136.html|accessdate=29 June 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anthony Kennedy official SCOTUS portrait crop.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]], the author of the Court's opinion.]]

{{quote|DOMA's principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and make them unequal. The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons like governmental efficiency... By this dynamic DOMA undermines both the public and private significance of state-sanctioned same-sex marriages; for it tells those couples, and all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy of federal recognition. This places same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage. The differentiation demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', {{ussc|539|558|2003|source=f}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... and whose relationship the State has sought to dignify. And it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples. The law in question makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', 570 U.S., at 22–23 (slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under DOMA, same-sex married couples have their lives burdened, by reason of government decree, in visible and public ways. By its great reach, DOMA touches many aspects of married and family life, from the mundane to the profound. It prevents same-sex married couples from obtaining government healthcare benefits they would otherwise receive.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Uscsub|5|8901|5}}, {{Uscsub2|5|8905}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... It deprives them of the Bankruptcy Code's special protections for domestic-support obligations.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Uscsub|11|101|14A}}, {{Uscsub2|11|507|a|1|A}}, {{Uscsub2|11|523|a|5}}, {{Uscsub2|11|523|a|15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... It forces them to follow a complicated procedure to file their state and federal taxes jointly.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Bulletin TB–55, 2010 Vt. Tax LEXIS 6 (Oct. 7, 2010); Brief for Federalism Scholars as ''Amici Curiae'' 34.&lt;/ref&gt; ... It prohibits them from being buried together in veterans' cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;National Cemetery Administration Directive 3210/1, p. 37 (June 4, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', 570 U.S., at 23 (slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For certain married couples, DOMA's unequal effects are even more serious. The federal penal code makes it a crime to "assaul[t], kidna[p], or murde[r] ... a member of the immediate family" of "a United States official, a United States judge, [or] a Federal law enforcement officer,"&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|18|115|a|1|A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... with the intent to influence or retaliate against that official.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|18|115|a|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... Although a "spouse" qualifies as a member of the officer's "immediate family,"&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|18|115|c|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... DOMA makes this protection inapplicable to same-sex spouses.&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', 570 U.S., at 23–24 (slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity. By seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute is in violation of the Fifth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', 570 U.S., at 25–26 (slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Dissents===
[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] and Justices [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Samuel Alito]] authored dissenting opinions, which Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] joined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0626/Supreme-Court-strikes-down-DOMA-and-Prop.-8-ban-on-same-sex-marriage |title=Supreme Court strikes down DOMA and Prop. 8 ban on same-sex marriage |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |author=Mark Sherman |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Scalia's dissent, which was joined in full by Justice Thomas and in part by Justice Roberts,&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', {{ussc|570||2013|docket=12-307}}  (Scalia, J., dissenting slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt; opens as follows:
{{quote|This case is about power in several respects. It is about the power of our people to govern themselves, and the power of this Court to pronounce the law. Today's opinion aggrandizes the latter, with the predictable consequence of diminishing the former. We have no power to decide this case. And even if we did, we have no power under the Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation.}}

[[File:Antonin Scalia, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]], the author of the dissenting opinion.]]
He continues:
{{quote|Windsor's injury was cured by the judgment in her favor. [...]  What the petitioner United States asks us to do in the case before us is exactly what the respondent Windsor asks us to do: not to provide relief from the judgment below but to say that that judgment was correct. And the same was true in the Court of Appeals: Neither party sought to undo the judgment for Windsor,  and so that court should have dismissed the appeal (just as we should dismiss) for lack of jurisdiction.}}

Scalia wrote in his dissent that the majority justices, through their opinion, resorted to calling opponents of same-sex marriage "enemies of the human race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scalia: 'High-Handed' Kennedy Has Declared Us 'Enemies of the Human Race' |author=Tim Grieve |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/domesticpolicy/scalia-high-handed-kennedy-has-declared-us-enemies-of-the-human-race-20130626 |newspaper=National Journal |date=June 26, 2013 |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news |title=Scalia's Blistering Dissent on DOMA |author=Time Grieve |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/scalias-blistering-dissent-on-doma/277245/#comments |publisher=''The Atlantic'' |date=June 26, 2013 |accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that the Court's ruling would impact [[Same-sex marriage law in the United States by state|state bans on same-sex marriage]] as well, writing:
{{quote|As far as this Court is concerned, no one should be fooled; it is just a matter of listening and waiting for the other shoe.&lt;p&gt;By formally declaring anyone opposed to same-sex marriage an enemy of human decency, the majority arms well every challenger to a state law restricting marriage to its traditional definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/doma-decision-gay-marriage-ripple-effect-93479.html?hp=t1_3 |title=The DOMA decision ripple effect|last=Gerstein|first=Josh |date=26 June 2013|publisher=Politico.com|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In his concluding paragraph, Scalia wrote that the Supreme Court "has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat." &lt;ref name="Opinion" /&gt;

== Responses and analysis ==

===Presidential response===
After the decision was announced, President Obama hailed the ruling as a "victory for American democracy". On the question of how the ruling would affect bans on same-sex marriage in those states that prohibit it, Obama said: "My personal belief, but I'm speaking now as a president as opposed to as a lawyer, is that if you've been married in Massachusetts and you move someplace else, you're still married, and that under federal law you should be able to obtain the benefits of any lawfully married couple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= DOMA Ruling: 'Victory for American Democracy,' Obama Says |work= ABC News |first= Mary |last= Bruce |date= June 27, 2013 |url= http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/06/doma-ruling-victory-for-american-democracy-obama-says/ |location=Dakar, Senegal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal response to dissent===
[[Laurence Tribe]], a professor of constitutional law at [[Harvard Law School]], described Scalia's response and dissent as "intemperate", "extraordinary", and "at the very least, an exercise in jurisprudential [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]]". He considered that Scalia appeared to have been unable to resist "the temptation to use the occasion to insult the Court's majority, and [[Justice Kennedy]] in particular, in essentially ''[[ad hominem]]'' (and ''ad feminem'' {{sic}}) terms", and that he wrote "principally to highlight the extraordinary character of this particularly vitriolic and internally inconsistent dissent". In his analysis, he comments that Scalia opined "about how the Court should have decided the very controversy that he says wasn't really before it", that "To accuse the majority of arrogance and then reach the merits after saying that the Court lacks jurisdiction to address the case requires no small dose of [[chutzpah]]", and that "Scalia didn't so much as consider the possibility ... that considerations of federalism might point to a particularly rigorous examination of the purported justifications for a measure like Section 3." He concluded that in making his predictive statement about the future precedent of the case, "Justice Scalia was engaging in a [[bait-and-switch]] unworthy of so serious and smart a jurist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/doma-prop-8-and-justice-scalias-intemperate-dissent/ |publisher=SCOTUSBlog |date=June 26, 2013 |first=Laurence |last=Tribe |title=DOMA, Prop 8, and Justice Scalia's intemperate dissent|accessdate=2 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
A day after the decision in ''Windsor'', the federal judge hearing ''[[McLaughlin v. Panetta]]'' asked the parties to explain by July 18 why the logic that found ''Windsor'' unconstitutional did not apply equally to federal regulations that control eligibility for veterans' spousal benefits, which define "spouse" as "a person of the opposite sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Geidner |first=Chris |title=House Republicans Face Decision On Fighting Gay Veterans’ Spousal Benefits |url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/house-republicans-face-decision-on-fighting-gay-veterans-spo|accessdate=July 17, 2013|newspaper=BuzzFeed |date=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2013, [[House Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group|BLAG]] stated in a court filing that in light of ''Windsor'', they would no longer seek to defend this case or similar statutes in court, and sought leave to withdraw from defending the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geidner|first=Chris|title=House Republicans Cave On Marriage Fight|url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/house-republicans-cave-on-marriage-fight|publisher=BuzzFeed|accessdate=24 July 2013|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, a [[New Jersey]] judge ruled that the state's refusal to issue same-sex marriage licenses contradicted ''Windsor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Orders New Jersey to Allow Gay Marriage|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/nyregion/new-jersey-judge-rules-state-must-allow-gay-marriage.html?_r=1&amp;gwh=047E2F9F25970C63346AD0C1103C3820&amp;|accessdate=25 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 September 2013|author=Kate Zernike and Marc Sontora}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Chris Christie]] dropped his appeal of this ruling in October 2013 after the State Supreme Court signaled that they were likely to reject his appeal, making New Jersey the 14th state in the union to permit gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=As Gays Wed in New Jersey, Christie Ends Court Fight|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/nyregion/christie-withdraws-appeal-of-same-sex-marriage-ruling-in-new-jersey.html?src=recg&amp;_r=0|accessdate=25 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 October 2013|author=Kate Zernike and Marc Sontora}}&lt;/ref&gt;
