'''''Windsor v. United States''''' is a [[lawsuit]] filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]]. The [[plaintiff]] in the suit challenges the [[constitutionality]] of section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which defines the terms "marriage" as "a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife" and "spouse" as "a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife."

The law firm [[Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison]], in conjunction with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), filed ''Windsor v. United States'' in District Court in New York on behalf of Edith S. Windsor, the widow of Thea C. Spyer.&lt;ref&gt;ACLU: [http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/windsor-v-united-states-complaint Complaint in ''Windsor v. United States''], accessed March 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On February 23, 2011, Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] released a memo regarding two lawsuits challenging DOMA Section 3, ''Windsor'' and [[Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management]]. It explained that the Obama administration had determined that classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to [[heightened scrutiny]], and therefore it could no longer defend the constitutionality of DOMA's Section 3.&lt;ref name="HolderPressRelease"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html|title=Statement of the Attorney General on Litigation Involving the Defense of Marriage Act |date=February 23, 2011|accessdate=February 23, 2011|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Windsor'' and ''Pedersen'' cases are widely credited as the primary reason for Obama administration's decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Wall Street Journal'':  [http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/02/23/the-lawsuits-behind-obamas-gay-marriage-shift/?KEYWORDS=obama%27s+gay+marriage+shift/ "The Lawsuits Behind Obama’s Gay-Marriage Shift" February 23, 2011], accessed February 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'':  [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2011/02/edie_and_jerry_the_real_people.html/ "Edie and Jerry: The real people behind DOJ's shift on DOMA," February 23, 2011], accessed February 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge James C.
