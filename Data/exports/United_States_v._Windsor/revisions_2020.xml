'''''United States v. Windsor''''', 570 U.S. 744 (2013), is a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] civil rights case&lt;ref name="NBCNews20130627" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT20130627" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mears20130627" /&gt; concerning [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. The Court held that Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which denied federal recognition of same-sex marriages, was a violation of the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].

[[Edith Windsor]] and Thea Spyer, a [[same-sex couple]] residing in [[New York (state)|New York]], had their marriage recognized by the state of New York in 2008; Spyer died in 2009, leaving her entire [[Estate (law)|estate]] to Windsor. Windsor sought to claim the federal [[Inheritance tax|estate tax]] [[Tax exemption|exemption]] for [[Widow|surviving spouse]]s, but was barred from doing so by Section 3 of DOMA. Seeking a refund, Windsor sued the federal government in the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]]. As the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] declined to defend the constitutionality of Section 3 of DOMA, the [[Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group]] (BLAG) intervened to defend the law. District Judge [[Barbara S. Jones]] ruled that Section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional, and her ruling was affirmed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].

The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] in December 2012 and handed down its judgment on June 26, 2013. In the majority opinion, which was joined by four other justices, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] declared Section 3 of DOMA to be unconstitutional "as a deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment". He further wrote: "The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity." Four justices filed dissenting opinions, including Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], who argued that the Court had "no power under the Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation."

On the same day, the Court also issued a separate 5–4 decision in ''[[Hollingsworth v. Perry]]'' that effectively allowed same-sex marriage in California to resume. Following the decision, the [[presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] began to extend other federal rights, privileges, and benefits to married same-sex couples. Two years later, in the case of ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'', the Court struck down all state bans on same-sex marriage, ruling that marriage is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the [[Equal Protection Clause]].

==Background==
Edith "Edie" Windsor (née Schlain) was born in [[Philadelphia]] on June 20, 1929, to a [[Russian Jew]]ish immigrant family of modest means.&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://forward.com/specials/forward-50-2013/edith-windsor/ |title=Forward 50 (2013): Edith Windsor |author=Naomi Zeveloff |publisher=The Forward |accessdate=2014-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her childhood, her father lost both his candy-and-ice-cream store and his house during the [[Great Depression]],&lt;ref name="Amended"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stanford.app.box.com/s/qpihsz3m4giioisu3uv0|title=Box|website=stanford.app.box.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she at times experienced [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://poy.time.com/2013/12/11/runner-up-edith-windsor-the-unlikely-activist/ |title=Edith Windsor, The Unlikely Activist |author=Eliza Gray |magazine=Time |date=2013-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Temple University]], she married Saul Windsor.

She would eventually become one of the first female senior systems programmers at [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt;

Thea Clara Spyer was born in [[Amsterdam]] on October 8, 1931, to a wealthy Jewish family that escaped [[the Holocaust]] by fleeing to the United States before the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Nazi invasion of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amended"/&gt; Spyer enrolled at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], but was expelled after a campus guard saw her and another woman kissing.&lt;ref name="Amended"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; She received a bachelor's degree from the [[New School for Social Research]], and a master's degree and PhD in [[clinical psychology]] from [[City University of New York]] and [[Adelphi University]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Announcement"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thea Spyer and Edith Windsor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/fashion/weddings/27spyer.html|accessdate=January 1, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her private psychology practice in Manhattan, Spyer was an accomplished violinist. She met Windsor in 1963 at a West Village restaurant,&lt;ref name="Reveling"/&gt; and the two began dating after they reconnected in [[the Hamptons]] during Memorial Day weekend of 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liblog.law.stanford.edu/united-states-v-windsor/ Windsor v.

In 2007, the pair, both residents of New York, married in [[Toronto]], Ontario, under the provisions set forth in the [[Canadian family law#Marriage|Canadian]] ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]'', after 40 years of romantic partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shapiro|first=Lila|title=Edie Windsor vs. DOMA: 83-Year-Old Lesbian Petitions U.S. Supreme Court To Hear Case|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/16/edie-windsor-doma_n_1675983.html|accessdate=July 30, 2012|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's first openly gay judge, Justice [[Harvey Brownstone]], officiated.&lt;ref name="Announcement"/&gt; After Spyer's death in 2009, Windsor was required to pay $363,053 in federal estate taxes on her inheritance of her wife's estate.

In May 2008, New York Governor [[David Paterson]] had ordered state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions. Some lower-level state courts had made similar rulings, but whether the state's [[New York State Court of Appeals|highest court]] would give such a ruling the force of law, as Windsor's claim for a refund required, remained uncertain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Peters |first=Jeremy W.|title=New York to Back Same-Sex Unions From Elsewhere|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/29/nyregion/29marriage.html|accessdate=July 20, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was disputed throughout her lawsuit.

Windsor at first asked several gay rights advocacy groups to represent her, but none would take the case. Finally, she was referred to [[Roberta A.

===District Court===
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, in conjunction with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), filed the case in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]] on behalf of Windsor as executor of Spyer's estate on November 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/windsor-v-united-states-complaint ''Windsor v.

On February 23, 2011, Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] released a statement regarding two lawsuits challenging DOMA Section 3, ''Windsor'' and ''[[Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management]]''. He explained that the Department of Justice (DOJ) had previously defended Section 3 of DOMA in several other lawsuits in jurisdictions where precedents required the court to use the [[rational basis review|rational basis standard]] for reviewing laws concerning sexual orientation. Since ''Windsor'' was filed in the jurisdiction of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]], which had no such precedent, the DOJ had identified the proper standard of review in such cases as the more demanding "[[heightened scrutiny]]". Under that standard, it could no longer defend the constitutionality of DOMA Section 3.&lt;ref name="HolderPressRelease"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html |title=Statement of the Attorney General on Litigation Involving the Defense of Marriage Act |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=February 23, 2011 |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309162048/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html |archivedate=March 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders]]|url=http://www.glad.org/current/news-detail/glad-statement-on-dojs-announcement-it-wont-defend-constitutionality-of-dom|title=GLAD Statement on DOJ's Announcement It Won't Defend Constitutionality of DOMA in ''Pedersen''|date=February 23, 2011|accessdate=February 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227090354/http://www.glad.org/current/news-detail/glad-statement-on-dojs-announcement-it-wont-defend-constitutionality-of-dom|archive-date=February 27, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The administration continued enforcing the law until it was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOJ replied to BLAG's motion to dismiss, asserting: (1) its standing as an "aggrieved party", because the District Court's stay prevents the DOJ from taking steps to cease enforcement of Section 3 of DOMA; and (2) that its participation ensures consideration of the constitutional issue if the Second Circuit or the Supreme Court determines that BLAG lacks standing.&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor v.

On September 11, 2012, following Windsor's petition for [[certiorari]] before judgment and before the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit's]] ruling, the Department of Justice filed its own petition for certiorari before judgment with the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/105738696/12-307-1-DOJ-Petition Petition for Certiorari (No 12-307)]; retrieved December 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; After the appellate ruling on October 18, the parties filed supplemental briefs.&lt;ref name="docket 12-307"&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-307.htm Docket report for ''United States v. Windsor'' (12–307)]. Retrieved December 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 7, the Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] in the case, now ''United States v. Windsor'', accepting the DOJ's petition.

In addition to the question presented by the DOJ &amp;ndash; "Whether Section 3 of DOMA violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection" for same sex partners &amp;ndash; the court also asked the parties to brief and argue two other questions: whether the government's agreement with the Second Circuit's decision deprived the court of a "real dispute" and therefore of jurisdiction to hear the case, and whether BLAG had [[standing (law)|standing]] in its own right, i.e., the legal right to independently ask for the appeal to be heard in the event that the government was not a valid petitioner. [[Article III of the United States Constitution|Article III]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] (the "[[Case or Controversy clause]]") forbids parties that do not themselves have a ''real'' and ''personal'' ("particularized") complaint from filing a case or appeal in a federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Order List|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/120712zr_3f14.pdf|publisher=United States Supreme Court|accessdate=December 8, 2012| date=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windsor noted in a statement that when she and her partner met nearly 50 years earlier that they never dreamed their marriage would land before the Supreme Court "as an example of why gay married couples should be treated equally, and not like second-class citizens". Noting that her deceased wife would be proud, Windsor added, "The truth is, I never expected any less from my country."&lt;ref name="WP20121207"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Robert|title=Supreme Court to hear same-sex marriage cases|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/supreme-court-to-hear-same-sex-marriage-cases/2012/12/07/4bf6c366-40ab-11e2-ae43-cf491b837f7b_story.html|accessdate=December 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anthony Kennedy official SCOTUS portrait crop.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]], the author of the Court's opinion.]]

{{quote|DOMA seeks to injure the very class New York seeks to protect. By doing so it violates basic [[Due Process Clause|due process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] principles applicable to the Federal Government. See U.S. Const., Amdt. 5; ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'', 347 U.S. 497 (1954).&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', 570 U.S., at 20 (slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt;

When New York adopted a law to permit same-sex marriage, it sought to eliminate inequality; but DOMA frustrates that objective through a system-wide enactment with no identified connection to any particular area of federal law. DOMA writes inequality into the entire United States Code. The particular case at hand concerns the estate tax, but DOMA is more than a simple determination of what should or should not be allowed as an estate tax refund. Among the over 1,000 statutes and numerous federal regulations that DOMA controls are laws pertaining to Social Security, housing, taxes, criminal sanctions, copyright, and veterans' benefits.&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', 570 U.S., at 22 (slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt;

DOMA's principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and make them unequal. The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons like governmental efficiency. Responsibilities, as well as rights, enhance the dignity and integrity of the person. And DOMA contrives to deprive some couples married under the laws of their State, but not other couples, of both rights and responsibilities. By creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same State, DOMA forces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal law, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of basic personal relations the State has found it proper to acknowledge and protect. By this dynamic DOMA undermines both the public and private significance of state-sanctioned same-sex marriages; for it tells those couples, and all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy of federal recognition. This places same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage. The differentiation demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects,&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', {{ussc|539|558|2003|source=f}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... and whose relationship the State has sought to dignify. And it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples. The law in question makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', 570 U.S., at 22–23 (slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under DOMA, same-sex married couples have their lives burdened, by reason of government decree, in visible and public ways. By its great reach, DOMA touches many aspects of married and family life, from the mundane to the profound. It prevents same-sex married couples from obtaining government healthcare benefits they would otherwise receive.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Uscsub|5|8901|5}}, {{Uscsub2|5|8905}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... It deprives them of the Bankruptcy Code's special protections for domestic-support obligations.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Uscsub|11|101|14A}}, {{Uscsub2|11|507|a|1|A}}, {{Uscsub2|11|523|a|5}}, {{Uscsub2|11|523|a|15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... It forces them to follow a complicated procedure to file their state and federal taxes jointly.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Bulletin TB–55, 2010 Vt. Tax LEXIS 6 (October 7, 2010); Brief for Federalism Scholars as ''Amici Curiae'' 34.&lt;/ref&gt; ... It prohibits them from being buried together in veterans' cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;National Cemetery Administration Directive 3210/1, p. 37 (June 4, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', 570 U.S., at 23 (slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt;

For certain married couples, DOMA's unequal effects are even more serious. The federal penal code makes it a crime to "assaul[t], kidna[p], or murde[r] ... a member of the immediate family" of "a United States official, a United States judge, [or] a Federal law enforcement officer",&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|18|115|a|1|A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... with the intent to influence or retaliate against that official.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|18|115|a|1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... Although a "spouse" qualifies as a member of the officer's "immediate family",&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|18|115|c|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ... DOMA makes this protection inapplicable to same-sex spouses.&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', 570 U.S., at 23–24 (slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause contains within it the prohibition against denying to any person the equal protection of the laws. While the Fifth Amendment itself withdraws from Government the power to degrade or demean in the way this law does, the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment makes that Fifth Amendment right all the more specific and all the better understood and preserved.

The class to which DOMA directs its restrictions and restraints are those persons who are joined in same-sex marriages made lawful by the State. DOMA singles out a class of persons deemed by a State entitled to recognition and protection to enhance their own liberty. It imposes a disability on the class by refusing to acknowledge a status the State finds to be dignified and proper. DOMA instructs all federal officials, and indeed all persons with whom same-sex couples interact, including their own children, that their marriage is less worthy than the marriages of others. The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity. By seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute is in violation of the Fifth Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', 570 U.S., at 25–26 (slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Dissents===
[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] and Justices [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Samuel Alito]] authored dissenting opinions, which Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] joined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0626/Supreme-Court-strikes-down-DOMA-and-Prop.-8-ban-on-same-sex-marriage|title=Supreme Court strikes down DOMA and Prop. 8 ban on same-sex marriage|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|author=Mark Sherman|agency=Associated Press|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Scalia's dissent, which was joined in full by Justice Thomas and in part by Chief Justice Roberts,&lt;ref&gt;''Windsor'', {{ussc|570||2013|docket=12-307}}  (Scalia, J., dissenting slip op.).&lt;/ref&gt; opened:
{{quote|This case is about power in several respects. It is about the power of our people to govern themselves, and the power of this Court to pronounce the law. Today's opinion aggrandizes the latter, with the predictable consequence of diminishing the former. We have no power to decide this case. And even if we did, we have no power under the Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation.}}
[[File:Antonin Scalia, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]], the author of one of the three dissenting opinions.]]
He continued: 
{{quote|Windsor's injury was cured by the judgment in her favor. ... What the petitioner United States asks us to do in the case before us is exactly what the respondent Windsor asks us to do: not to provide relief from the judgment below but to say that that judgment was correct. And the same was true in the Court of Appeals: Neither party sought to undo the judgment for Windsor, and so that court should have dismissed the appeal (just as we should dismiss) for lack of jurisdiction.}}

Scalia argued that the judgment effectively characterized opponents of same-sex marriage as "enemies of the human race":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scalia: 'High-Handed' Kennedy Has Declared Us 'Enemies of the Human Race'|author=Tim Grieve |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/domesticpolicy/scalia-high-handed-kennedy-has-declared-us-enemies-of-the-human-race-20130626 |newspaper=National Journal|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Scalia's Blistering Dissent on DOMA|author=Tim Grieve|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/scalias-blistering-dissent-on-doma/277245/#comments|magazine=The Atlantic|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is one thing for a society to elect change; it is another for a court of law to impose change by adjudging those who oppose it ''hostes humani generis'', enemies of the human race.}}

He argued that the Court's ruling would affect [[Same-sex marriage law in the United States by state|state bans on same-sex marriage]] as well:
{{quote|As far as this Court is concerned, no one should be fooled; it is just a matter of listening and waiting for the other shoe.

By formally declaring anyone opposed to same-sex marriage an enemy of human decency, the majority arms well every challenger to a state law restricting marriage to its traditional definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/doma-decision-gay-marriage-ripple-effect-93479.html?hp=t1_3|title=The DOMA decision ripple effect|last=Gerstein|first=Josh|date=June 26, 2013|publisher=Politico.com|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scalia concluded by saying that the Supreme Court "has cheated both sides, robbing the winners of an honest victory, and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat".&lt;ref name="Opinion"/&gt;

The opinions of Roberts and Scalia offered different interpretations of the majority ruling. Roberts said the majority opinion was based on federalism, finding DOMA unconstitutional because the federal government was interfering with state control of marriage. He wrote: "The dominant theme of the majority opinion is that the Federal Government's intrusion into an area 'central to state domestic relations law applicable to its residents and citizens' is sufficiently 'unusual' to set off alarm bells. ... [I]ts judgment is based on federalism."&lt;ref name="Opinion"/&gt; Scalia was uncertain whether the majority relied upon that federalism argument or based its decision on Equal Protection grounds, writing, "if this is meant to be an equal-protection opinion, it is a confusing one".&lt;ref name="Opinion"/&gt;

On the question of how the ruling would affect bans on same-sex marriage in those states that prohibit it, Obama said: "My personal belief, but I'm speaking now as a president as opposed to as a lawyer, is that if you've been married in Massachusetts and you move someplace else, you're still married, and that under federal law you should be able to obtain the benefits of any lawfully married couple."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DOMA Ruling: 'Victory for American Democracy', Obama Says|work=ABC News|first=Mary|last=Bruce|date=June 27, 2013|url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/06/doma-ruling-victory-for-american-democracy-obama-says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurence Tribe]], a professor of constitutional law at [[Harvard Law School]], described Scalia's response and dissent as "intemperate", "extraordinary", and "at the very least, an exercise in jurisprudential cynicism". He considered that Scalia appeared to have been unable to resist "the temptation to use the occasion to insult the Court's majority, and Justice Kennedy in particular, in essentially [[ad hominem]]&amp;nbsp;... terms".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/doma-prop-8-and-justice-scalias-intemperate-dissent|publisher=SCOTUSBlog|date=June 26, 2013|first=Laurence|last=Tribe|title=DOMA, Prop 8, and Justice Scalia's intemperate dissent|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neil Siegel, a professor of constitutional law at [[Duke Law School]], wrote that Justice Roberts' view that the majority relied on federalism was a fallacy in that the majority did not place any weight on the federalism argument, but rather used "federalism as a waystation" to put off making a decision on the constitutionality of state laws concerning same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|ssrn=2396179|publisher=SSRN|date=February 14, 2014|first=Neil|last=Siegel|title=Federalism as a Way Station: Windsor as Exemplar of Doctrine in Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and implementation==
A day after the decision in ''Windsor'', the federal judge hearing ''[[McLaughlin v.

According to one reporter's assessment in August 2013, despite the foregoing efforts the U.S. federal agencies are not working in concert with respect to the implementation of the ''Windsor'' ruling. Instead "they are creating a patchwork of regulations affecting gay and lesbian couples&amp;nbsp;– and may be raising questions about discrimination and fairness in the way that federal benefits are distributed."&lt;ref name="NYT20130829"/&gt;

In February 2015, the [[United States Department of Labor]] issued its final rule amending the definition of spouse under the FMLA in response to ''Windsor''. The new rule is effective March 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Forman|first1=Shira|title=DOL Issues Final Rule Amending FMLA Definition of "Spouse" to Include Same-Sex Marriages|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dol-issues-final-rule-amending-fmla-definition-spouse-to-include-same-sex-marriages|accessdate=February 28, 2015|publisher=Sheppard Mullin Richter &amp; Hampton LLP|date=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised definition of "spouse" extends FMLA leave rights and job protections to employees in a same-sex marriage or a [[common-law marriage]] entered into in a state where those statuses are legally recognized, regardless of the state in which the employee works or resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trotier|first1=Geoffrey S.|title=FMLA "Spouse" Definition Now Includes Same-Sex Spouses and Common-Law Spouses|journal=The National Law Review|date=February 24, 2015|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/fmla-spouse-definition-now-includes-same-sex-spouses-and-common-law-spouses|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial interpretation==
&lt;!-- DECISIONS THAT CITE WINDSOR ARE NOT INTERESTING FOR THAT REASON ALONE. LOTS DO. 
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS HOW THEY ***INTERPRET*** WINDSOR. FEDERALISM OR NOT FEDERALISM? WHAT LEVEL OF SCRUTINY? --&gt; 
The ruling in ''Windsor'' led to a series of state and federal lawsuits being filed against same-sex marriage bans and affected other discrimination rulings.  A year after the ''Windsor'' ruling was announced, there was at least one state or federal lawsuit against every state same-sex marriage ban.

===State courts===
[[New Jersey Supreme Court]] previously ruled in ''[[Lewis v. Harris]]'' that the denial of marriage benefits violate same-sex couples equal protection under the New Jersey state constitution.  But following ''Windsor'' a New Jersey state judge ruled that the extension of federal benefits to married same-sex couples made New Jersey's civil unions to be lacking the equal protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision on Motion for Summary Judgment |url=http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/samesex/Decision_Summary_Judgment_and%20Order.pdf |publisher=Garden State Equity v. Dow, N.J. Super. Ct. Law Div., Docket MER-L-1729-11 (Sept. 27, 2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal courts===
In several other cases, the ambiguity in the majority decision in ''Windsor'' has produced varying interpretations in later legal decisions that address state regulation of marriage and the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples. Courts have disputed whether ''Windsor'' relied upon federalism or equal protection and what standard of review the Supreme Court applied. Others have used it to dismiss the precedential importance of ''[[Baker v. Nelson]]''.  Within 2 years of the ''Windsor'' decision 28 district courts and 4 appeals court ruled that state level same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional, while only two district courts and one appeals court ruled they did not violate the constitution.

In December 2013, a U.S. District Court judge ruling in ''[[Kitchen v. Herbert]]'' found that ''Baker'' no longer controlled his decision, because the rule is that "doctrinal developments" can obviate the importance of a dismissal like ''Baker'' and given the issues before the court ''Windsor'' was "highly relevant and is therefore a significant doctrinal development". It also read ''Windsor'' as an equal protection case, writing: "The court agrees with Justice Scalia's interpretation of
Windsor and finds that the important federalism concerns at issue here are nevertheless insufficient to save a state-law prohibition that denies the Plaintiffs their rights to due process and equal protection under the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/192796334/Federal-Court-Decision-in-Kitchen-v-Herbert|title=Federal Court Decision in Kitchen v.

District Court Judge [[Arenda L. Wright Allen]] ruling in ''[[Bostic v. Rainey]]'' on February 13, 2014, noted that ''Windsor'' discussed the deference due state laws defining marriage only to assert that "due process and equal protection
guarantees must trump objections to federal intervention". She cited Justice Scalia's prediction that the reasoning of the majority in ''Windsor'' with respect to federal law motivated by a "bare ... desire to harm" would produce the same conclusion with respect to state laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomtomarry.org/page/-/files/pdfs/Bostic-Decision.pdf Bostic v. Rainey, February 13, 2014], accessed October 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Recognition of same-sex unions in Texas#Lawsuit|De Leon v. Perry]]'', [[Orlando Luis Garcia|Orlando Garcia]] on February 26, 2014, framed the lawsuit in terms of ''Windsor'': "Now, the lower courts must apply the Supreme Court's decision in ''Windsor'' and decide whether a state can do what the federal government cannot -– discriminate against same-sex couples." He then made the same point Judge Wright Allen had made, citing ''Windsor'': "While Texas has the 'unquestioned authority' to regulate and define marriage, the State must nevertheless do so in a way that does not infringe on an individual's constitutional rights."

Some courts have agreed with Scalia that the ''Windsor'' decision lacked clarity and proceeded to interpret it with little reference to federalism, just as Scalia had predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/what-antonin-scalia-got-right-about-same-sex-marriage-20140520|title=What Antonin Scalia Got Right on Same-Sex Marriage|date=May 20, 2014|first=Sam|last=Baker|accessdate=May 22, 2014|publisher=NationalJournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ruling Oklahoma's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional on January 14, 2014, in ''[[Bishop v. United States|Bishop v. Oklahoma]]'', U.S. District Judge [[Terence C. Kern]] described the decision as the culmination of a process: "There is no precise legal label for what has occurred in Supreme Court jurisprudence beginning with ''Romer'' in 1996 and culminating in ''Windsor'' in 2013, but this Court knows a rhetorical shift when it sees one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Geidner |first=Chris|title=Oklahoma Ban On Same-Sex Marriages Is Unconstitutional, Federal Judge Rules |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/oklahoma-ban-on-same-sex-marriages-is-unconstitutional-judge|accessdate=January 15, 2014|newspaper=Buzz Feed |date=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When U.S. District Judge [[John E. Jones III|Jone E. Jones]] ruled on May 20, 2014, that Pennsylvania's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional, he read ''Windsor'' as an equal protection decision. He cited Justice Scalia's critique of the lack of clarity in the ''Windsor'' decision, writing: "As Justice Scalia cogently remarked in his dissent, 'if [''Windsor''] is meant to be an equal-protection opinion, it is a confusing one. ... Windsor found DOMA unconstitutional because 'no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://coop.pamd.uscourts.gov/13-1861.pdf ''Whitewood v.

Conversely, U.S. District Judge [[Martin Leach-Cross Feldman|Martin Feldman]], upholding Louisiana's ban on same-sex marriage on September 3, 2014, reviewed the arguments before him and wrote: "Both sides invoke the Supreme Court's decision in ''United States v. Windsor''. ... But ''Windsor'' does little more than give both sides in this case something to hope for." In a footnote, he explained his reading of the case:&lt;ref name=robicheaux&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/238549858/2-13-cv-05090-131 Order and reasons, ''Robicheaux v. Caldwell'', September 3, 2014], accessed October 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{{quote|''Windsor'', in the context of the issues presented to this Court, is unclear (contrary to the conclusions in many recent federal court decisions). It is by its own terms, limited. Its "opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful marriages". However, ''Windsor'' also references an amorphous but alluring "evolving understanding of the meaning of equality". Hence this Court's unease that ''Windsor'' merely offer bits and pieces of hope to both sides. (citations omitted)}}

He quoted Chief Justice Roberts' dissent as a reason not to read ''Windsor'' as a guide for deciding the constitutionality of restrictions on same-sex marriage: "The Court does not have before it", wrote Roberts, "and the logic of its opinion does not decide the distinct question whether the States, in the exercise of their 'historic and essential authority to define the marital relation',&amp;nbsp;... may continue to utilize the traditional definition of marriage". Feldman found nothing in ''Windsor'' to require him to use heightened scrutiny, saying that "Windsor starkly avoids mention of heightened scrutiny". He called the argument that ''Windsor'''s use of the phrase "careful consideration" meant intermediate or heightened scrutiny amounted to "intellectual anarchy". He criticized several recent federal court decisions for failing to specify the appropriate standard of review they used to evaluate the constitutionality of bans on same-sex marriage. Instead he cited ''Windsor'' for its "powerful reminder" that {{"'}}The definition of marriage is the foundation of the State's broader authority to regulate the subject of domestic relations{{'"}}.&lt;ref name=robicheaux/&gt;

===Sexual orientation as a suspect class===
A 3-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in ''[[SmithKline v. Abbott]]'' considered what standard of review to apply when determining whether sexual orientation can be used in selecting the members of a jury. It ruled unanimously on January 21, 2014, based on its reading of ''Windsor'', that distinctions based on sexual orientation are subject to a standard of review higher then rational basis review and that "equal protection prohibits peremptory strikes based on sexual orientation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/alison-frankel/2014/01/22/judges-build-on-supreme-courts-windsor-ruling-to-extend-gay-rights|title=Judges Build on Supreme Court's Windsor ruling to extend gay rights|date=January 22, 2014|first=Alison|last=Frankel|accessdate=May 22, 2014|work=Reuters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616142639/http://blogs.reuters.com/alison-frankel/2014/01/22/judges-build-on-supreme-courts-windsor-ruling-to-extend-gay-rights/|archive-date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ninth Circuit wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geidner |first=Chris|title=Federal Appeals Court Says Jurors Can't Be Excluded Because They Are Gay|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-appeals-court-says-jurors-cant-be-excluded-because-t|accessdate=January 21, 2014|newspaper=Buzz Feed |date=January 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200430030704/https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/chrisgeidner/federal-appeals-court-says-jurors-cant-be-excluded-because-t|archive-date=April 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''Windsor'' review is not rational basis review. In its words and its deed, ''Windsor'' established a level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation that is unquestionably higher than rational basis review. In other words, ''Windsor'' requires that heightened scrutiny be applied to equal protection claims involving sexual orientation.}} 

The Supreme court did not explicitly determine what level of review that classification on the basis of sexual orientation requires, and was overruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' in 2015. Currently, there is circuit split between the second, sixth and ninth circuits regarding the correct level of scrutiny that should be applied to classifications based on sexual orientation. Although the Supreme Court had the opportunity to rule on the level of scrutiny in ''Obergefell v. Hodges'', they decided not to and based their analysis on the fundamental right to marry.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

Many scholars have theorized that the ruling in Windsor have elevated classifications on the basis of sexual orientation to be considered under a 'rational basis with bite' evaluation; and have found the analysis to be closely synonymous with how classification of religion are reviewed. The Ninth Circuit court also observed that the majority in ''Windsor'' shifted the burden from the same-sex couple to the government when it wrote that the government has to "''justify'' disparate treatment of the group".&lt;ref name="Thomaston"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomaston|first=Scottie|title=Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rules jurors can't be kept off a jury because of their sexual orientation |url=http://equalityontrial.com/2014/01/21/ninth-circuit-court-appeals-rules-jurors-cant-kept-jury-sexual-orientation |publisher=Equality on Trial|accessdate=March 11, 2014|date=January 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200430031125/http://www.equalityontrial.com/2014/01/21/ninth-circuit-court-appeals-rules-jurors-cant-kept-jury-sexual-orientation/|archive-date=April 30, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
