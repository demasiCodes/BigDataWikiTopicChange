A '''hate crime''' (also known as a '''bias-motivated crime''' or '''bias crime'''&lt;ref&gt;{cite web| url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hate-crime|website=Dictionary.com|quote="Also called '''bias crime'''."}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[prejudice]]-motivated crime which occurs when a perpetrator targets a victim because of his or her membership (or perceived membership) in a certain [[social group]] or [[race (human categorization)|race]].  

Examples of such groups can include and are almost exclusively limited to: [[sex]], [[ethnicity]], [[disability]], [[language]], [[nationality]], [[Physical appearance#Physiological differences|physical appearance]], [[religion]], [[gender identity]] or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stotzer|first=R.|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Stotzer-Comparison-Hate-Crime-June-2007.pdf|format=PDF|title=Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups|work= [[Williams Institute]]|date= June 2007|accessdate=2012-03-17}} "A hate crime or bias motivated crime occurs when the perpetrator of the crime intentionally selects the victim because of his or her membership in a certain group."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FBI2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2013/resource-pages/methodology/methodology_final|title=Methodology|work=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Streis"&gt;Streissguth, Tom (2003). ''Hate Crimes'' (Library in a Book), p. 3. {{ISBN|0-8160-4879-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-criminal actions that are motivated by these reasons are often called "[[bias incident]]s".

"Hate crime" generally refers to [[crime|criminal acts]] which are seen to have been motivated by [[bias]] against one or more of the social groups listed above, or by bias against their derivatives. Incidents may involve physical assault, damage to property, [[bullying]], [[harassment]], [[verbal abuse]] or [[insult]]s, [[mate crime]] or offensive [[graffiti]] or letters ([[hate mail]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/|title=Home Office {{!}} Hate crime|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126153146/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/|archive-date=26 November 2005|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hate speech laws exist in many countries. In the United States, hate crime laws have been upheld by both the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] &lt;ref&gt;''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'', 315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942)&lt;/ref&gt; and lower courts, especially in the case of [[Fighting words|'fighting' words]] and other violent speech, but they are thought by some people to be in conflict with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech]], but hate crimes are only regulated through threats of injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/do-hate-crime-laws-violate-first-amendment.html|title=Do Hate Crime Laws Violate the First Amendment?|work=www.criminaldefenselawyer.com|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term "hate crime" came into common usage in the United States during the 1980s, but the term is often used retrospectively in order to describe events which occurred prior to that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/civilrights/hate_crimes|title=Hate Crimes|work=FBI|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Roman [[persecution of Christians]] to the [[Final Solution|Nazi slaughter of Jews]], hate crimes were committed by both individuals and governments long before the term was commonly used.&lt;ref name="Streis"/&gt;

As [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] began to [[colonialism|colonize]] the world from the 16th century onwards, [[indigenous peoples]] in the colonized areas, such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] increasingly became the targets of bias-motivated [[intimidation]] and [[violence]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} During the past two centuries, typical examples of hate crimes in the U.S. include [[lynching]]s of [[African Americans]], largely in the [[Southern United States|South]], and lynchings of [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]] and [[Chinese Americans|Chinese]] in the [[Western United States|West]]; [[cross burning]]s to intimidate black activists or to drive black families from predominantly white neighborhoods both during and after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]; [[assault]]s on [[white people]] traveling in predominantly black neighborhoods; assaults on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people; the painting of [[swastika]]s on Jewish [[synagogue]]s; and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] responses to a variety of [[minorities|minority]] [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref name = "tvccce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/162304.pdf |title=A Policymaker's Guide to Hate Crimes |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duluth-lynching-postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard of the [[1920 Duluth lynchings|Duluth lynchings]] of African-American men on June 15, 1920]]

The verb "''to [[Lynching|lynch]]''" is attributed to the actions of [[Charles Lynch (jurist)|Charles Lynch]], an 18th-century [[Virginia]] [[Quaker]]. Lynch, other militia officers, and justices of the peace rounded up [[Tory]] sympathizers who were given a summary trial at an informal court; sentences handed down included whipping, property seizure, coerced pledges of allegiance, and conscription into the military. Originally, the term referred to extrajudicial organized but unauthorized punishment of criminals. It later evolved to describe execution outside "ordinary justice." It is highly associated with white suppression of African Americans in the South, and periods of weak or nonexistent [[police authority]], as in certain frontier areas of the [[Old West]].&lt;ref name="Streis"/&gt;

The [[murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom]] and the [[Wichita Massacre]] were not classified as "hate crimes" by U.S. investigative officials or the media. In the early 21st century, conservative commentators [[David Horowitz]], [[Michelle Malkin]] ([[Fox News]] channel and author) and [[Stuart Taylor Jr.]] (journalist) did describe these events as "hate crimes against whites by blacks."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/05/hate-crimes-and-double-standards/305992/ Stuart Taylor, Jr. "'Hate Crimes' and Double Standards"], ''[[The Atlantic]],'' 29 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==
Hate crimes can have significant and wide-ranging [[Psychology|psychological]] consequences, not only for their direct victims but for others as well. A 1999 U.S. study of lesbian and gay victims of violent hate crimes documented that they experienced higher levels of psychological distress, including symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]], than lesbian and gay victims of comparable crimes which were not motivated by antigay bias.&lt;ref

; Impact on the individual victim: psychological and [[affection|affective]] disturbances; repercussions on the victim's identity and [[self-esteem]]; both reinforced by a specific hate crime's degree of violence, which is usually stronger than that of a common crime.
; Effect on the targeted group: generalized [[fear|terror]] in the group to which the victim belongs, inspiring feelings of vulnerability among its other members, who could be the next hate crime victims.
; Effect on other vulnerable groups: ominous effects on [[minority groups]] or on groups that identify themselves with the targeted group, especially when the referred hate is based on an [[ideology]] or a [[doctrine]] that preaches simultaneously against several groups.
; Effect on the community as a whole: divisions and factionalism arising in response to hate crimes are particularly damaging to [[multiculturalism|multicultural societies]].

Hate crime victims can also develop depression and [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref

A review of European and American research indicates that terrorist bombings cause [[Islamophobia]] and hate crimes to flare up but, in calmer times, they subside again, although to a relatively high level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09596410.2015.1067063?journalCode=cicm20|title = When Is the Time to Hate?

==Laws==
Hate crime laws generally fall into one of several categories:
# laws defining specific bias-motivated acts as distinct crimes;
# criminal penalty-enhancement laws;
# laws creating a distinct civil cause of action for hate crimes; and
# laws requiring administrative agencies to collect hate crime statistics.&lt;ref name="human"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/everyday-fears-080805.pdf |title=Michael McClintock: ''Everyday Fears: A Survey of Violent Hate Crimes in Europe and North America'' |publisher=Humanrightsfirst.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes (as in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), the laws focus on [[war crimes]], [[genocide]], and [[crimes against humanity]] with the prohibition against discriminatory action limited to public officials.

===Eurasia===

====European Union====
Since 2002, with an amendment to the [[Convention on Cybercrime]], the [[European Union]] mandates individual states to punish as a crime [[hate speech]] done through the [[internet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ibls.com/internet_law_news_portal_view.aspx?s=latestnews&amp;id=2422 Arias, Martha L.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Andorra====
Discriminatory acts constituting harassment or infringement of a person's dignity on the basis of origin, citizenship, race, religion, or gender (Penal Code Article 313). Courts have cited bias-based motivation in delivering sentences, but there is no explicit penalty enhancement provision in the Criminal Code. The government does not track hate crime statistics, although they are relatively rare.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Armenia====
[[Armenia]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes with ethnic, racial, or religious motives (Criminal Code Article 63).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Austria====
[[Austria]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for reasons like repeating a crime, being especially cruel, using others helpless state, playing a leading role in a crime, or committing a crime with racist, xenophobic or especially reprehensible motivation (Penal Code section 33(5)).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jusline.at/33_Besondere_Erschwerungsgr%C3%BCnde_StGB.html § 33 StGB Besondere Erschwerungsgründe], StGB, accessed 2015-02-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Azerbaijan====
[[Azerbaijan]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, or religious hatred (Criminal Code Article 61). Murder and infliction of serious bodily injury motivated by racial, religious, national, or ethnic intolerance are distinct crimes (Article 111).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Belarus====
[[Belarus]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, and religious hatred and discord.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.by/webnpa/text.asp?RN=HK9900275 Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus, § 64 (1), para. 9 (translated from the Russian)], June 9, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]]'s Act of 25 February 2003 ("aimed at combating discrimination and modifying the Act of 15 February 1993 which establishes the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism") establishes a penalty-enhancement for crimes involving discrimination on the basis of gender, supposed race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, civil status, birth, fortune, age, religious or philosophical beliefs, current or future state of health and handicap or physical features. The Act also "provides for a civil remedy to address discrimination."&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;  The Act, along with the Act of 20 January 2003 ("on strengthening legislation against racism"), requires the Centre to collect and publish statistical data on racism and discriminatory crimes.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
The Criminal Code of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (enacted 2003) "contains provisions prohibiting discrimination by public officials on grounds, inter alia, of race, skin colour, national or ethnic background, religion and language and prohibiting the restriction by public officials of the language rights of the citizens in their relations with the authorities (Article 145/1 and 145/2)."&lt;ref&gt;Office of the High Representative, [http://www.ohr.int/decisions/judicialrdec/doc/HiRep-dec-101-law-crim-code-bih.doc Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina], January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bulgaria====
[[Bulgaria]]n criminal law prohibits certain crimes motivated by racism and [[xenophobia]], but a 1999 report by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] found that it does not appear that those provisions "have ever resulted in convictions before the courts in Bulgaria."&lt;ref&gt;ECRI, "Second Report on Bulgaria", adopted on June 18, 1999, and made public on March 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Croatia====
The [[Croatia]]n Penal Code explicitly defines hate crime in article 89 as "any crime committed out of hatred for someone's race, skin color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other belief, national or social background, asset, birth, education, social condition, age, health condition or other attribute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2006_06_71_1706.html |title=71 28.6.2006 Zakon o izmjenama i dopunama Kaznenog zakona |publisher=Narodne-novine.nn.hr |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 2013, a new Penal Code was introduced with the recognition of a hate crime based on "race, skin color, religion, national or ethnic background, sexual orientation or gender identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ravnopravnost.hr/web/184/ |title=Centar za LGBT ravnopravnost » Vlada prihvatila prijedloge Centra za LGBT ravnopravnost |publisher=Ravnopravnost.hr |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331011308/http://www.ravnopravnost.hr/web/184/ |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Czech Republic====
The Czech legislation finds its constitutional basis in the principles of equality and non-discrimination contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms. From there, we can trace two basic lines of protection against hate-motivated incidents: one passes through criminal law, the other through civil law.
The current Czech criminal legislation has implications both for decisions about guilt (affecting the decision whether to find a defendant guilty or not guilty) and decisions concerning sentencing (affecting the extent of the punishment imposed). It has '''three levels''', to wit:
* a '''circumstance determining whether an act is a crime''' – hate motivation is included in the basic constituent elements. If hate motivation is not proven, conviction for a hate crime is not possible.
* a '''circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty''' – a hate motivation is included in the qualified constituent elements for some types of crimes (murder, bodily harm). If hate motivation is not proven, the penalty is imposed according to the scale specified for the basic constituent elements of the crime.
* '''general aggravating circumstance''' – the court is obligated to take the hate motivation into account as a general aggravating circumstance and determines the amount of penalty to impose. Nevertheless, it is not possible to add together a general aggravating circumstance and a circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty. (see Annex for details)
Current criminal legislation '''does not provide for special penalties''' for acts that target another by reason of his '''sexual orientation, age or health status'''. Only the constituent elements of the criminal offense of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms, and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such a group of people can then, of course, be also one defined by sexual orientation, age or health status. A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups of people who are victimized by reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are victimized by reason of their sexual orientation, age or health status and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, age or health status cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation. Interpretation by analogy is inadmissible in criminal law, sanctionable motivations being exhaustively enumerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in-ius.cz/dwn/zprava-o-nzn2011/report-web.pdf |title=Zpráva o násilí z nenávisti v České republice za rok 2011 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
Although [[Denmark|Danish]] law does not include explicit hate crime provisions, "section 80(1) of the Criminal Code instructs courts to take into account the gravity of the offence and the offender's motive when meting out penalty, and therefore to attach importance to the racist motive of crimes in determining sentence."&lt;ref&gt;ECRI, “Second Report on Denmark,” adopted on June 16, 2000, and made public on April 3, 2001, para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years judges have used this provision to increase sentences on the basis of racist motives.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chahrokh, Klug, and Bilger, Migrants, Minorities, and Legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, the Danish Civil Security Service (PET) has released statistics on crimes with apparent racist motivation.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Estonia====
Under section 151 of the Criminal Code of [[Estonia]] of 6 June 2001, which entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and as amended by the Law of 8 December 2011, "activities which publicly incite to hatred, violence or discrimination on the basis of nationality, race, colour, sex, language, origin, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, or financial or social status, if this results in danger to the life, health or property of a person, are punishable by a fine of up to 300 fine units or by detention".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/18762 Criminal Code of Estonia of 6 June 2001, entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and latest amendment by the Law of 8 December 2011, published in RT I, 29.12.2011, 1 and entered into force on 1 January 2012 (excerpts)], accessed 27 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
[[Finland|Finnish]] [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] 515/2003 (enacted January 31, 2003) makes "committing a crime against a person, because of his national, racial, ethnical or equivalent group" an aggravating circumstance in sentencing.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EUMC, “Racism and xenophobia in the E.U.,” p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ethnic agitation ({{lang-fi|kiihotus kansanryhmää vastaan}}) is criminalized and carries a fine or a prison sentence of not more than two years. The prosecution need not prove that an actual danger to an ethnic group is caused but only that malicious message is conveyed. A more aggravated hate crime, warmongering ({{lang-fi|sotaan yllyttäminen}}), carries a prison sentence of one to ten years. However, in case of warmongering, the prosecution must prove an [[overt act]] that evidently increases the risk that Finland is involved in a war or becomes a target for a military operation. The act in question may consist of
# illegal violence directed against a foreign country or its citizens,
# systematic dissemination of false information on Finnish foreign policy or defense
# public influence on the public opinion towards a pro-war viewpoint or
# public suggestion that a foreign country or Finland should engage in an aggressive act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Penal Code (39/1889)] as of 1006/2004. §§ 6:5.1.4 (ethnic hatred as an aggravating factor), 11:8 (ethnic agitation) and 12:2 (warmongering).

====France====
In 2003, France enacted penalty-enhancement hate crime laws for crimes motivated by bias against the victim's actual or perceived ethnicity, nation, race, religion, or sexual orientation. The penalties for murder were raised from 30 years (for non-hate crimes) to life imprisonment (for hate crimes), and the penalties for violent attacks leading to permanent disability were raised from 10 years (for non-hate crimes) to 15 years (for hate crimes).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000781920 Loi n° 2003–88 du 3 février 2003 visant à aggraver les peines punissant les infractions à caractère raciste, antisémite ou xénophobe]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgia====
"There is no general provision in Georgian law for racist motivation to be considered an aggravating circumstance in prosecutions of ordinary offenses. Certain crimes involving racist motivation are, however, defined as specific offenses in the Georgian Criminal Code of 1999, including murder motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 109); infliction of serious
injuries motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 117); and torture motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 126). ECRI reported no knowledge of cases in which this law has been enforced. There is no systematic monitoring or data collection on discrimination in Georgia."&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Germany====
The [[German Criminal Code]] does not have hate crime legislation, but instead criminalizes [[hate speech]] under a number of different laws, including [[Volksverhetzung]]. In the German legal framework [[motivation]] is not taken into account while identifying the element of the offence. However, within the sentencing procedure the judge can define certain principles for determining punishment. In section 46 of the German Criminal Code it is stated that "the motives and aims of the perpetrator; the state of mind reflected in the act and the willfulness involved in its commission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#46 |title=Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB) |publisher=Iuscomp.org |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be taken into consideration when determining the [[punishment]]; under this statute, hate and bias have been taken into consideration in sentencing in past cases.&lt;ref name="Marc Coester 2008"&gt;Marc Coester (2008): Das Konzept der Hate Crimes aus den USA unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Rechtsextremismus in Deutschland.

Hate crimes are not specifically tracked by German police, but have been studied separately: a recently published EU "Report on Racism" finds that racially motivated attacks are frequent in Germany, identifying 18,142 incidences for 2006, of which 17,597 were motivated by right wing ideologies, both about a 14% year-by-year increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502471,00.html |title=EU Xenophobia Report: Racism On the Rise in Germany  |work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relative to the size of the population, this represents an eightfold higher rate of hate crimes than reported in the US during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2007/november/hatecrime_111907 |title=2006 Hate Crime in the U.S |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Awareness of hate crimes and right-wing extremism in Germany remains low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502694,00.html |title= Interview with Racism Expert: 'Awareness of Ethnic Discrimination Is Low in Germany' |work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "religious group" is a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief. The specified crimes are assault, criminal damage, offences under the [[Public Order Act 1986]], and offences under the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]].

Sections 145 and 146 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]] require a court to consider whether a crime which is not specified by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is racially or religiously aggravated, and to consider whether the following circumstances were pertinent to the crime:
:(a) that, at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—
::(i) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or
::(ii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim, or
:(b) that the offence is motivated (wholly or partly)—
::(i) by hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or
::(ii) by hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_14#pt12-ch1-pb1-l1g145 Sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hate crime" legislation is distinct from "hate speech" legislation.

The launch was marked by a conference in [[Chelmsford]], hosted by Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh, which brought together 220 delegates from a range of partner organisations involved in the field. The theme of the conference was ‘Report it to Sort it’ and the emphasis was on encouraging people to tell police if they have been a victim of hate crime, whether it be based on race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopthehate.org.uk/2013/12/launch-of-stop-the-hate-initiative |title=Launch of ‘Stop the Hate’ initiative |publisher=Stop the hate |date=2013-12-04 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most high-profile hate crime in modern Britain occurred in [[Eltham]], [[London]], on 24 April 1993, when 18-year-old black student [[Stephen Lawrence]] was stabbed to death in an attack by a gang of white youths. Two white teenagers were later charged with the murder, and at least three other suspects were mentioned in the national media, but the charges against them were dropped within three months after the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. However, a change in the law a decade later allowed a suspect to be charged with a crime twice if new evidence emerged after the original charges were dropped or a "not guilty" verdict was delivered in court. Gary Dobson, who had been charged with the murder in the initial 1993 investigation, was found guilty of Stephen Lawrence's murder in January 2012 and sentenced to life imprisonment, as was David Norris, who had not been charged in 1993. A third suspect, Luke Knight, had been charged in 1993 but was not charged when the case came to court nearly 20 years later.

=====Scotland=====
Under [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scots law#Common law|Common law]]{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} the courts can take any aggravating factor into account when sentencing someone found guilty of an offence.

====Canada====
"In Canada the legal definition of hate crime can be found in sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code".
&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the federal government amended a section of the Criminal Code that pertains to sentencing. Specifically, section 718.2. The section states (with regard to the hate crime):

''A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:

''(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,''

''(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, . . . shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances.''''
&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"/&gt;

A vast majority (84 per cent) of hate crime perpetrators were "male, with an average age of just under 30. Less than 10 of those accused had criminal records, and less than 5 per cent had previous hate crime involvement (ibid O’Grady 2010 page 163.)."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Only 4 percent of hate crimes were linked to an organized or extremist group (Silver et al., 2004)."
&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, Jewish people were the largest ethnic group targeted by hate crimes, followed by blacks, Muslims, South Asians, and homosexuals (Silver et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"/&gt;

During the Nazi regime, anti-Semitism was a cause of hate related violence in Canada. For example, on August 16, 1933 there was a baseball game in Toronto and one team was made up of mostly Jewish players. At the end of the game, a group of Nazi sympathizers unfolded a Swastika flag and shouted ‘Heil Hitler’. That event [[Christie Pits riot|erupted into a brawl]] that had Jews and Italians against Anglo Canadians and the brawl went on for hours.&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"/&gt;

The first time someone was charged with hate speech over the internet occurred on 27 March 1996. "A Winnipeg teenager was arrested by the police for sending an email to a local political activist that contained the message ‘Death to homosexuals’ it's prescribed in the Bible! Better watch out next Gay Pride Week.’ (Nairne, 1996)."&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"/&gt;

Hate crime laws have a long history in the United States. The first hate crime&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final.pdf|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2015|last=|first=|date=Fall 2016|website=ucr.fbi.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; laws were passed after the [[American Civil War]], beginning with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]], to combat the growing number of racially motivated crimes being committed by the Reconstruction era [[Ku Klux Klan]]. The modern era of hate-crime legislation began in 1968 with the passage of federal statute, 18 U.S. 245, part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Civil Rights Act]] which made it illegal to "by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone who is engaged in six specified protected activities, by reason of their [[race (classification of humans)|race]], [[color]], [[religion]], or [[national origin]]." However, "The prosecution of such crimes must be certified by the U.S. attorney general.".&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first state hate-crime statute, California's Section 190.2, was passed in 1978 and provided for penalty enhancement in cases where murder was motivated by prejudice against four "protected status" categories: race, religion, color, and national origin. Washington included [[ancestry]] in a statute passed in 1981. Alaska included [[creed]] and [[sex]] in 1982 and later [[disability]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[ethnicity]]. In the 1990s some state laws began to include [[ageing|age]], [[marital status]], membership in the [[armed forces]], and membership in [[civil rights]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal acts which could be considered hate crimes in various states included [[aggravated assault]], [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[vandalism]], [[rape]], [[threat]]s and [[intimidation]], [[arson]], [[trespassing]], [[stalking]], and various "lesser" acts until in 1987 California state legislation included all crimes as possible hate crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined in the 1999 National Crime Victim Survey, "A hate crime is a criminal offense. In the [[United States]], federal prosecution is possible for hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity." In 2009, the [[Matthew Shepard Act]] added actual or perceived [[gender]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[disability]] to the federal definition, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.

Forty-five states and the [[District of Columbia]] have statutes criminalizing various types of hate crimes. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have statutes creating a [[Legal liability|civil cause of action]] in addition to the criminal penalty for similar acts. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics.&lt;ref name="adl"&gt;[http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/state_hate_crime_laws.pdf State Hate Crime Laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614124916/http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/state_hate_crime_laws.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }}, [[Anti-Defamation League]], June 2006.

Of the 5,449 crimes against persons, 46% were classified as intimidation and 32% as simple assaults. 81% of the 3,593 crimes against property were acts of vandalism or destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics, 2006 [https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2006], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717214828/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/index.html |date=July 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 hate crime statistics show 46.9% were motivated by race and 20.8% by sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakeconews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28459:fbi-releases-2011-hate-crime-statistics&amp;catid=1:latest&amp;Itemid=197 |title=FBI releases 2011 hate crime statistics |publisher=Lakeconews.com |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2013-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517030446/http://www.lakeconews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28459%3Afbi-releases-2011-hate-crime-statistics&amp;catid=1%3Alatest&amp;Itemid=197 |archivedate=2013-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Hate Crimes Statistics report identified 5,818 single-bias incidents involving 6,837 offenses, 7,121 victims, and 5,475 known offenders&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final.pdf|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=ucr.fbi.gov|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutions of hate crimes have been difficult in the United States. Recently though, state governments have attempted to re-investigate and re-try past hate crimes. One prominent example is Mississippi's decision in 1990 to retry [[Byron De La Beckwith]] for the murder of [[Medgar Evers]], a prominent figure in the NAACP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Labuda|first=P.|title=Racial Reconciliation in Mississippi: An Evaluation of the Proposal to Establish a Mississippi Truth and Reconciliation Commission.|journal=Harvard Blackletter Law Journal|year=2011|volume=271|pages=1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would be the first time in U.S. history that an unresolved civil rights case would be re-opened. Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, was tried for the murder on two previous occasions and it resulted with a hung jury. However, he was finally sentenced to life in prison in 1994. Presented with testimony of two FBI informants who had infiltrated the KKK, the missing transcript from the first trial, the relocation of missing witnesses, numerous witness admissions of Beckwith bragging about his role in the murder and Beckwith's own racist writings, a mixed race jury found Beckwith guilty of murder. Even though De La Beckwith was 73 years of age when he was sentenced to life in prison, the 1994 conviction has been interpreted as a way for Mississippi to shed its racist past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alston, A.A. |author2=Dickerson, J.L.|title=Devil’s Sanctuary: An Eye-Witness History of Mississippi Hate Crimes|year=2009|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a November 2016 report issued by the FBI hate crime statistics are on the rise in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latest Hate Crime Statistics Released - Annual Report Sheds Light on Serious Issue|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2015-hate-crime-statistics-released|website=FBI|publisher=FBI|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of hate crimes increased from 5,850 in 2015, to 6,121 hate crime incidents in 2016, an increase of 4.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Licthblau|first1=Eric|title=U.S. Hate Crimes Surge 6%, Fueled by Attacks on Muslims|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/fbi-hate-crimes-muslims.html|accessdate=18 December 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mathias|first1=Christopher|title=Hate Crimes Rose About 5 Percent In 2016, FBI Report Says|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-hate-crimes-report-2016_us_5a08c795e4b01d21c83f46ac|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Hate Crime Statistics|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2016/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses|publisher=FBI|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Victims in the United States=====
One of the largest waves of hate crimes took place during the [[civil rights movement]]. During the 1950s and 1960s, both violence and threats of violence were common against African Americans, and hundreds of lives were lost due to such acts. Members of this [[social class]] faced violence from [[hate groups|groups]] such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] as well as violence from individuals who were committed to maintaining [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/hate-crimes-changed-history.html#|title=Hate Crimes that Changed History {{!}} Criminal Law|newspaper=CriminalDefenseLawyer.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, civil rights leaders such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and their supporters fought hard for the right of African Americans to vote as well as for equality in their everyday lives. African Americans have been the target of hate crimes since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],&lt;ref name="americansperspective.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://americansperspective.com/10-of-the-worst-hate-crimes-and-violence-in-domestic-american-history/#|title=10 Of The Worst Hate Crimes and Violence in Domestic American History|date=2015-06-22|newspaper=americansperspective.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the humiliation of this [[social class]] was also desired by many Anti-black individuals. Other frequently reported bias motivations were bias against a religion, bias against a particular sexual orientation, and bias against a particular ethnicity/national origin.&lt;ref name="fbi 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/narratives/hate-crime-2010-victims |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2010|accessdate=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, these bias motivations overlapped, because violence can be both anti-gay and anti-black, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|title=Evaluating the Severity of Hate-motivated Violence: Intersectional Differences among LGBT Hate Crime Victims|journal=Sociology|year=2010|volume=44|issue=5|pages=980–95|doi=10.1177/0038038510375737|url=http://soc.sagepub.com/content/44/5/980.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts have compared groups in terms of the per capita rate of hate crimes committed against them, to allow for differing populations.
Overall, the total number of hate crimes committed since the first hate crime bill was passed in 1997 is 86,582.&lt;ref name="The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepard|first1=Mathew|last2=Byrd|first2=James Jr.|title=Hate Crimes Law|journal=Human Rights Campaign|date=2011–2014|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/hate-crimes-law}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act]]

Among the groups currently mentioned in the [[Hate Crime Statistics Act|Hate Crimes Statistics Act]], the largest number of hate crimes are committed against African Americans.&lt;ref name="Reports and Curricula"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/cause_for_concern/p8.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/|title=Reports and Curricula|newspaper=The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Civil Rights Movement, some of the most notorious hate crimes included the 1968 [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], the 1964 murders of Charles Moore and Henry Dee, the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]], the 1955 murder of [[Emmett Till]],&lt;ref name="americansperspective.com"/&gt; as well as the burning of crosses, churches, Jewish synagogues and other places of worship of minority religions. Such acts began to take place more frequently after the [[racial integration]] of many schools and public facilities.&lt;ref name="Reports and Curricula"/&gt;

High-profile murders targeting victims based on their sexual orientation have prompted the passage of hate crimes legislation, notably the cases of [[Sean W. Kennedy]] and [[Matthew Shepard]]. Kennedy's murder was mentioned by Senator [[Gordon Smith (politician)|Gordon Smith]] in a speech on the floor of the US Senate while he advocated such legislation.  The [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]] was signed into law in 2009. It included sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, the disabled, and military personnel and their family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Matthew Shepard And James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act Of 2009 {{!}} CRT {{!}} Department of Justice|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/matthew-shepard-and-james-byrd-jr-hate-crimes-prevention-act-2009-0|website=www.justice.gov|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=military and families at least not obvious from linked article|date=June 2013}} This is the first all-inclusive bill ever passed in the United States, taking 45 years to complete.{{clarify|"all-inclusive" how/45 years how?|date=June 2013}}

Gender-based crimes may also be considered hate crimes. This view would designate [[rape]] and [[domestic violence]], as well as non-interpersonal violence against women such as the [[École Polytechnique massacre]] in [[Quebec]], as hate crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2YdCbgXjr-EC&amp;pg=PA405 |chapter=Hate Crime Statutes: A Promising Tool for Fighting Violence Against Women |first=Marguerite |last=Angelari |title=Pornography, Sex Work, and Hate Speech |editor=Karen J.

In May 2018, ''ProPublica'' reviewed police reports for 58 cases of purported anti-heterosexual hate crimes. ''ProPublica'' found that about half of the cases were anti-LGBT hate crimes that had been miscategorized, and that the rest were motivated by hate towards Jews, blacks or women or that there was no element of a hate crime at all. ''ProPublica'' found not a single case of a hate crime spurred by anti-heterosexual bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/police-are-mislabeling-crimes-as-anti-heterosexual-hate-crimes|title=Police Are Mislabeling Anti-LGBTQ and Other Crimes as Anti-Heterosexual — ProPublica|date=2018-05-15|website=ProPublica|language=en-us|others=Rachel Glickhouse, Rahima Nasa|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===

====Brazil====
In [[Brazil]], hate crime laws focus on [[racism]], racial [[injury]], and other special bias-motivated crimes such as, for example, murder by [[death squad]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L8072.htm|title=L8072|website=www.planalto.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genocide]] on the grounds of [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], race or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L2889.htm|title=L2889|website=www.planalto.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murder by death squads and genocide are legally classified as "hideous crimes" (''crimes hediondos'' in Portuguese).&lt;ref&gt;Law 8072/1990 (aforementioned link), Article 1st, I and single paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crimes of racism and racial injury, although similar, are enforced slightly differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boletimjuridico.com.br/doutrina/texto.asp?id=662 |title=Racismo ou injúria racial? - Boletim Jurídico |publisher=Boletimjuridico.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 140, 3rd paragraph, of the [[Penal Code]] establishes a harsher penalty, from a minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 3 years, for injuries motivated by "elements referring to race, color, [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], origin, or the condition of being an aged or [[disability|disabled person]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848compilado.htm |title=DEL2848compilado |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, Law 7716/1989 covers "crimes resulting from [[discrimination]] or [[prejudice]] on the grounds of race, color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L7716.htm |title=L7716 |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Brazilian Constitution defines as a "fundamental goal of the Republic" (Article 3rd, clause IV) "to promote the well-being of all, with no prejudice as to [[nationality|origin]], race, sex, color, age, and any other forms of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao_Compilado.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chile====
In 2012, the Anti-discrimination law amended the Criminal Code adding a new aggravating circumstance of criminal responsibility, as follows: "Committing or participating in a crime motivated by ideology, political opinion, religion or beliefs of the victim; nation, race, ethnic or social group; sex, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], age, affiliation, personal appearance or suffering from illness or disability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1984|title=COD-PENAL 12-NOV-1874 MINISTERIO DE JUSTICIA - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|website=www.leychile.cl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1042092|title=LEY-20609 24-JUL-2012 MINISTERIO SECRETARÍA GENERAL DE GOBIERNO - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|website=www.leychile.cl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel is the only country in the middle east who has hate crime laws. Hate crime, as passed by the Isreli Knesset (Parliament), is defined as crime for reason of race, religion, gender and sexual orientation

==Support for and opposition to hate crime laws==

===Support===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
Justifications for harsher punishments for hate crimes focus on the notion that hate crimes cause greater individual and societal harm.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} It is said&lt;ref&gt;Marian Duggan and Vicky Heap, ''Administrating Victimization: The Politics of AntiSocial Behaviour and Hate Crime Policy'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; that, when the core of a person's identity is attacked, the degradation and [[dehumanization]] is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the [[empowerment|disempowerment]] of a group of people.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The [[1992 Los Angeles riots|riots]] in [[Los Angeles]], California that followed the beating of [[Rodney King]], a Black motorist, by a group of [[white people|White]] police officers are cited as support for this argument.&lt;ref name = "tvccce"/&gt; The beating of white truck driver [[Reginald Oliver Denny|Reginald Denny]] by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.

In ''[[Wisconsin v. Mitchell]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] unanimously found that ''penalty-enhancement'' hate crime statutes do not conflict with [[free speech]] rights, because they do not punish an individual for exercising [[freedom of expression]]; rather, they allow courts to consider [[motive (law)|motive]] when sentencing a criminal for conduct which is not protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/supreme-court-drama/wisconsin-v-mitchell|accessdate=2011-10-12|title=Wisconsin v. Mitchell|publisher=Enotes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst in the case of ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'' the court defined "fighting words" as "those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Sumner | first = L.W. | author-link = L.

===Opposition===
The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found the [[R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul|St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance]] amounted to viewpoint-based discrimination is in conflict with rights of free speech, because it selectively criminalized bias-motivated speech or symbolic speech for disfavored topics while permitting such speech for other topics.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul]]'', 505 U.S. 377 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics further assert that it conflicts with an even more fundamental right: free thought. The claim is that hate-crime legislation effectively makes certain ideas or beliefs, including religious ones, illegal, in other words, [[thought crime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

In their book ''Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics'', [[James B. Jacobs]] and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime legislation for exacerbating conflicts between groups.  They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, rather than as being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as "hate crimes" causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] and thus lead to an actual increase in crime.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, James B. 1998"&gt;Jacobs, James B. &amp; Kimberly Potter. (1998). Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics. New York: Oxford University Press,&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs and Potter also argued that hate crime legislation can end up only covering the victimization of some groups rather than all, which is a form of discrimination itself and that attempts to remedy this by making all identifiable groups covered by hate crime protection thus make hate crimes co-terminus with generic criminal law. The authors also suggest that arguments which attempt to portray hate crimes as worse than normal crimes because they spread fear in a community are unsatisfactory, as normal criminal acts can also spread fear yet only hate crimes are singled out.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, James B. 1998"/&gt; Indeed it has been argued that victims have varied reactions to hate crimes, so it is no necessarily true that hate crimes are regarded as more harmful than other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Iganski, Paul, and Spiridoula Lagou. "Hate crimes hurt some more than others: Implications for the just sentencing of offenders." Journal of interpersonal violence 30.10 (2015): 1696-1718.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mellgren, C., Andersson, M., &amp; Ivert, A.-K. (2017). For Whom Does Hate Crime Hurt More? A Comparison of Consequences of Victimization Across Motives and Crime Types. Journal of Interpersonal Violence. https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260517746131&lt;/ref&gt; Heidi Hurd argues that hate crime represents an effort by the state to encourage a certain moral character in its citizen and thus represents the view that the instillation of virtue and the elimination of vice are legitimate state goals, which she argues is a contradiction of the principles of liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, Heidi. "Why Liberals Should Hate'Hate Crime Legislation'." (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Troy |first=Daniel E. |url=http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |title=AEI – Short Publications |publisher=Aei.org |date=1999-08-04 |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610125417/http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American forensic psychologist [[Karen Franklin]] said that the term ''hate crime'' is somewhat misleading since it assumes there is a hateful motivation which is not present in many occasions;&lt;ref name=twsFrontline&gt;Frontline (PBS),[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/interviews/franklin.html Interviews], Accessed July 26, 2014, "...forensic psychologist, Karen Franklin's dual interests in psychology and the law brought her to question the roots of anti-gay hate crimes... badly needed empirical data on the nature and extent of negative reactions to gays..."&lt;/ref&gt; in her view, laws to punish people who commit hate crimes may not be the best remedy for preventing them because the threat of future punishment does not usually deter such criminal acts.&lt;ref name="twsAdvocate"&gt;{{cite web
