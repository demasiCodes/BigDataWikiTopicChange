In the [[criminal law of the United States]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) defines a hate crime as a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with an added element of bias. Hate itself is not a hate crime but committing a crime motivated by [[bias]] against one or more of the social groups listed above, or by bias against their derivatives constitutes a hate crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/civil-rights/hate-crimes|title=What We Investitgate-Hate Crimes|work=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''hate crime law''' is a law intended to deter bias-motivated violence.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|title=Resisting Hate Crime Discourse: Queer and Intersectional Challenges to Neoliberal Hate Crime Laws|journal=Critical Criminology|volume=22|pages=113–125|doi=10.1007/s10612-013-9228-x|year=2014|s2cid=143546829}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hate]] crime laws are distinct from laws against [[hate speech]]: hate crime laws enhance the [[Sanctions (law)|penalties]] associated with conduct which is already criminal under other laws, while [[Hate speech#Hate speech laws|hate speech laws]] criminalize a category of [[speech]].

==History==
The term "hate crime" came into common usage in the [[United States]] during the 1980s, but it is often used retrospectively in order to describe events which occurred prior to that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/civilrights/hate_crimes|title=Hate Crimes|work=FBI|access-date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|Roman persecution of Christians]] to the [[Final Solution|Nazi slaughter of Jews]], hate crimes were committed by individuals as well as governments long before the term was commonly used.&lt;ref name="Streis"/&gt; A major part of defining crimes as hate crimes is determining that they have been committed against members of historically oppressed groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/1540-4560.00257|title = Understanding the Harm of Hate Crime|journal = Journal of Social Issues|volume = 58|issue = 2|pages = 207–225|year = 2002|last1 = Boeckmann|first1 = Robert J.|last2 = Turpin-Petrosino|first2 = Carolyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Craig |first1=Kellina M. |last2=Waldo |first2=Craig R. |year=1996 |title="So, what's a hate crime anyway?"

As [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] began to [[colonialism|colonize]] the world from the 16th century onwards, [[indigenous peoples]] in the colonized areas, such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], increasingly became the targets of bias-motivated [[intimidation]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woolford |first1=Andrew |last2=Benvenuto |first2=Jeff |last3=Hinton |first3=Alexander Laban |title=Colonial Genocide in Indigenous North America |date=2014 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, NC |isbn=9780822376149 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBPqBQAAQBAJ&amp;q=Colonial+genocide+in+indigenous+North+America&amp;pg=PT6 |access-date=5 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kiernan |first1=Ben |title=BLOOD AND SOIL: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur |date=25 September 2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London, UK |url=https://www.overcominghateportal.org/uploads/5/4/1/5/5415260/blood_and_soil.pdf |access-date=5 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the past two centuries, typical examples of hate crimes in the U.S. include [[lynching]]s of [[African Americans]], largely in the [[Southern United States|South]], and lynchings of [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]] and [[Chinese Americans|Chinese]] in the [[Western United States|West]]; [[cross burning]]s in order to intimidate black activists or drive black families out of predominantly white neighborhoods both during and after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]; assaults on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people; the painting of [[swastika]]s on Jewish [[synagogue]]s; and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] responses to a variety of [[minorities|minority]] [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref name = "tvccce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/162304.pdf |title=A Policymaker's Guide to Hate Crimes |access-date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verb "''to [[Lynching|lynch]]''" is attributed to the actions of [[Charles Lynch (jurist)|Charles Lynch]], an 18th-century [[Virginia]] [[Quaker]]. Lynch, other militia officers, and justices of the peace rounded up [[Tory]] sympathizers who were given a summary trial at an informal court; sentences which were handed down included whipping, property seizure, coerced pledges of allegiance, and conscription into the military. Originally, the term referred to the extrajudicial organized but unauthorized punishment of criminals. It later evolved to describe executions which were committed outside "ordinary justice". It is highly associated with white suppression of African Americans in the South, and periods of weak or nonexistent [[police authority]], as in certain frontier areas of the [[Old West]].&lt;ref name="Streis"/&gt;

Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the violence against people of Chinese origin significantly increased on the background of accusation of spreading the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=They beat, cough and spit.

==Psychological effects==
Hate crimes can have significant and wide-ranging [[Psychology|psychological]] consequences, not only for their direct victims but for others as well. A 1999 U.S. study of lesbian and gay victims of violent hate crimes documented that they experienced higher levels of psychological distress, including symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]], than lesbian and gay victims of comparable crimes which were not motivated by antigay bias.&lt;ref name="Herek et al. (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Herek |first1=Gregory M. |last2= Gillis |first2= J.

; Impact on the individual victim: psychological and [[affection|affective]] disturbances; repercussions on the victim's identity and [[self-esteem]]; both reinforced by a specific hate crime's degree of violence, which is usually stronger than that of a common crime.
; Effect on the targeted group: generalized [[fear|terror]] in the group to which the victim belongs, inspiring feelings of vulnerability among its other members, who could be the next hate crime victims.
; Effect on other vulnerable groups: ominous effects on [[minority groups]] or on groups that identify themselves with the targeted group, especially when the referred hate is based on an [[ideology]] or a [[doctrine]] that preaches simultaneously against several groups.
; Effect on the community as a whole: divisions and factionalism arising in response to hate crimes are particularly damaging to [[multiculturalism|multicultural societies]].

Hate crime victims can also develop depression and [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Cox |first1=William T. L. |last2= Abramson |first2= Lyn Y. |last3= Devine |first3= Patricia G. |last4= Hollon |first4= Steven D. |year= 2012 |title= Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |journal= [[Perspectives on Psychological Science]] |volume= 7 |issue= 5 |pages= 427–49 |doi= 10.1177/1745691612455204 |pmid=26168502|s2cid=1512121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of European and American research indicates that terrorist bombings cause [[Islamophobia]] and hate crimes to flare up but, in calmer times, they subside again, although to a relatively high level. Terrorists' most persuasive message is that of fear; a primary and strong emotion, fear increases risk estimates and has distortive effects on the perception of ordinary Muslims. Widespread Islamophobic prejudice seems to contribute to anti-Muslim hate crimes, but indirectly; terrorist attacks and intensified Islamophobic prejudice serve as a window of opportunity for extremist groups and networks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When Is the Time to Hate?

==Motivation==

Sociologists Jack McDevitt and [[Jack Levin (sociologist)|Jack Levin]]'s 2002 study into the motives for hate crimes found four motives, and reported that "thrill-seeking" accounted for 66 percent of all hate crimes overall in the United States:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hate Crimes Explained |url=https://www.splcenter.org/20180415/hate-crimes-explained#motivation |website=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin McDevitt Hate Crimes"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levin |first1=Jack |last2=McDevitt |first2=Jack |title=Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, &amp; Conflict |date=2008 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=9780123739858 |pages=915–922 |edition=2nd |url=https://jacklevinonviolence.com/articles/HateCrimesencyc92206FINAL.pdf |chapter=Hate Crimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Thrill-seeking'' – perpetrators engage in hate crimes for excitement and drama. Often, there is no greater purpose behind the crimes, with victims being vulnerable because they have an ethnic, religious, sexual or gender background that differs from their attackers. While the actual animosity present in such a crime can be quite low, thrill-seeking crimes were determined to often be dangerous, with 70 percent of thrill-seeking hate crimes studied involving physical attacks. Typically, these attacks are perpetrated by groups of young teenagers or adults seeking excitement. &lt;ref name = "2020chapter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levin|first1=Jack |last2=McDevitt| first2=Jack |date=May 25, 2020 |editor-last=Sternberg |editor-first=Robert J. |title=Perspectives on Hate: How it Orginates, Develops, Manifests, and Spreads|publisher=American Psychological Association|pages=179–201 |chapter=Hate Crimes in Transition |isbn=978-1433832819 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Defensive'' – perpetrators engage in hate crimes out of a belief they are protecting their communities. Often, these are triggered by a certain background event. Perpetrators believe society supports their actions but is too afraid to act and thus they believe they have communal assent in their actions.
* ''Retaliatory'' – perpetrators engage in hate crimes out of a desire for revenge. This can be in response to perceived personal slights, other hate crimes or terrorism. The "avengers" target members of a group whom they believe committed the original crime, even if the victims had nothing to do with it. These kinds of hate crimes are a common occurrence after terrorist attacks.
* ''Mission offenders'' – perpetrators engage in hate crimes out of ideological reasons. They consider themselves to be crusaders, often for a religious or racial cause. They may write complex explanations for their views and target symbolically important sites, trying to maximize damage. They believe that there is no other way to accomplish their goals, which they consider to be justification for excessive violence against innocents. This kind of hate crime often overlaps with terrorism, and is considered by the FBI to be both the rarest and deadliest form of hate crime.

In a later article, Levin and fellow sociologist Ashley Reichelmann found that [[Post-9/11 |following]] the September 11 attacks, thrill motivated hate crimes tended to decrease as the overall rate of violent crime decreased while defensive hate crimes increased substantially. Specifically, they found that 60% of all hate motivated assaults in 2001 were perpetrated against those the offenders perceived to be Middle Eastern and were motivated mainly by a desire for revenge. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levin |first1=Jack |last2=Reichelmann |first2=Ashley |date=2015 |title=From Thrill to Defensive Motivation: The Role of Group Threat in the Changing Nature of Hate-Motivated Assaults |journal= American Behavioral Scientist | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0002764215588812 |volume=59 |issue=12 |pages=1546–1561 |doi= 10.1177/0002764215588812|s2cid=147697229 |access-date=January 15, 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levin and McDevitt also argued that while thrill crimes made up the majority of hate crimes in the 1990s, after September 11, 2001, hate crimes in the United States shifted from thrill offenses by young groups to more defensive oriented and more often perpetrated by older [[Lone wolf attack| individuals]] respond to a precipitating event. &lt;ref name = "2020chapter /&gt;

==Laws==
Hate crime laws generally fall into one of several categories:
# laws defining specific bias-motivated acts as distinct crimes;
# criminal [[aggravation (law)|penalty-enhancement laws]];
# laws creating a distinct civil cause of action for hate crimes; and
# laws requiring administrative agencies to collect hate crime statistics.&lt;ref name="human"&gt;{{cite Q|Q104631957}}&lt;!-- Everyday Fears: A Survey of Violent Hate Crimes in Europe and North America--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes (as in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), the laws focus on [[war crimes]], [[genocide]], and [[crimes against humanity]] with the prohibition against discriminatory action limited to public officials.

====Andorra====
Discriminatory acts constituting harassment or infringement of a person's dignity on the basis of origin, citizenship, race, religion, or gender (Penal Code Article 313). Courts have cited bias-based motivation in delivering sentences, but there is no explicit penalty enhancement provision in the Criminal Code.

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]]'s Act of 25 February 2003 ("aimed at combating discrimination and modifying the Act of 15 February 1993 which establishes the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism") establishes a penalty-enhancement for crimes involving discrimination on the basis of gender, supposed race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, civil status, birth, fortune, age, religious or philosophical beliefs, current or future state of health and handicap or physical features. The Act also "provides for a civil remedy to address discrimination."&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;  The Act, along with the Act of 20 January 2003 ("on strengthening legislation against racism"), requires the centre to collect and publish statistical data on racism and discriminatory crimes.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt; Belgium is a party to the Convention on Cybercrime, but not the Additional Protocol.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
The Criminal Code of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (enacted 2003) "contains provisions prohibiting discrimination by public officials on grounds, inter alia, of race, skin colour, national or ethnic background, religion and language and prohibiting the restriction by public officials of the language rights of the citizens in their relations with the authorities (Article 145/1 and 145/2)."&lt;ref&gt;Office of the High Representative, [http://www.ohr.int/decisions/judicialrdec/doc/HiRep-dec-101-law-crim-code-bih.doc Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina], January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Czech Republic====
The Czech legislation finds its constitutional basis in the principles of equality and non-discrimination contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms. From there, we can trace two basic lines of protection against hate-motivated incidents: one passes through criminal law, the other through civil law.
The current Czech criminal legislation has implications both for decisions about guilt (affecting the decision whether to find a defendant guilty or not guilty) and decisions concerning sentencing (affecting the extent of the punishment imposed). It has three levels, to wit:
* a '''circumstance determining whether an act is a crime''' – hate motivation is included in the basic constituent elements. If hate motivation is not proven, a conviction for a hate crime is not possible.
* a '''circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty''' – hate motivation is included in the qualified constituent elements for some types of crimes (murder, bodily harm). If hate motivation is not proven, the penalty is imposed according to the scale specified for the basic constituent elements of the crime.
* '''general aggravating circumstance''' – the court is obligated to take the hate motivation into account as a general aggravating circumstance and determines the amount of penalty to impose. Nevertheless, it is not possible to add together a general aggravating circumstance and a circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty. (see Annex for details)
Current criminal legislation does not provide for special penalties for acts that target another by reason of his sexual orientation, age or health status. Only the constituent elements of the criminal offence of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such a group of people can then, of course, be also defined by sexual orientation, age or health status. A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups of people who are victimized by reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are victimized by reason of their sexual orientation, age or health status and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, age or health status cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation.

Although [[Denmark|Danish]] law does not include explicit hate crime provisions, "section 80(1) of the Criminal Code instructs courts to take into account the gravity of the offence and the offender's motive when meting out penalty, and therefore to attach importance to the racist motive of crimes in determining sentence."&lt;ref&gt;ECRI, "Second Report on Denmark," adopted on 16 June 2000, and made public on 3 April 2001, para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years judges have used this provision to increase sentences on the basis of racist motives.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chahrokh, Klug, and Bilger, Migrants, Minorities, and Legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, the Danish Civil Security Service (PET) has released statistics on crimes with apparent racist motivation.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Estonia====
Under section 151 of the Criminal Code of [[Estonia]] of 6 June 2001, which entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and as amended by the Law of 8 December 2011, "activities which publicly incite to hatred, violence or discrimination on the basis of nationality, race, colour, sex, language, origin, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, or financial or social status, if this results in danger to the life, health or property of a person, are punishable by a fine of up to 300 fine units or by detention".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/18762 Criminal Code of Estonia of 6 June 2001, entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and latest amendment by the Law of 8 December 2011, published in RT I, 29.12.2011, 1 and entered into force on 1 January 2012 (excerpts)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827084753/http://www.legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/18762 |date=27 August 2017 }}, accessed 27 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
[[Finland|Finnish]] [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] 515/2003 (enacted 31 January 2003) makes "committing a crime against a person, because of his national, racial, ethnical or equivalent group" an aggravating circumstance in sentencing.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EUMC, "Racism and xenophobia in the E.U.," p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ethnic agitation ({{lang-fi|kiihotus kansanryhmää vastaan}}) is criminalized and carries a fine or a prison sentence of not more than two years. The prosecution need not prove that an actual danger to an ethnic group is caused but only that malicious message is conveyed. A more aggravated hate crime, warmongering ({{lang-fi|sotaan yllyttäminen}}), carries a prison sentence of one to ten years. However, in case of warmongering, the prosecution must prove an [[overt act]] that evidently increases the risk that Finland is involved in a war or becomes a target for a military operation. The act in question may consist of
# illegal violence directed against a foreign country or its citizens,
# systematic dissemination of false information on Finnish foreign policy or defense
# public influence on the public opinion towards a pro-war viewpoint or
# public suggestion that a foreign country or Finland should engage in an aggressive act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Penal Code (39/1889)] as of 1006/2004. §§ 6:5.1.4 (ethnic hatred as an aggravating factor), 11:8 (ethnic agitation) and 12:2 (warmongering).

====France====
In 2003, France enacted penalty-enhancement hate crime laws for crimes motivated by bias against the victim's actual or perceived ethnicity, nation, race, religion, or sexual orientation. The penalties for murder were raised from 30 years (for non-hate crimes) to life imprisonment (for hate crimes), and the penalties for violent attacks leading to permanent disability were raised from 10 years (for non-hate crimes) to 15 years (for hate crimes).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000781920 Loi n° 2003–88 du 3 février 2003 visant à aggraver les peines punissant les infractions à caractère raciste, antisémite ou xénophobe]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgia====
"There is no general provision in Georgian law for racist motivation to be considered an aggravating circumstance in prosecutions of ordinary offenses. Certain crimes involving racist motivation are, however, defined as specific offenses in the Georgian Criminal Code of 1999, including murder motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 109); infliction of serious injuries motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 117); and torture motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 126). ECRI reported no knowledge of cases in which this law has been enforced. There is no systematic monitoring or data collection on discrimination in Georgia."&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Germany====
The [[German Criminal Code]] does not have hate crime legislation, instead, it criminalizes [[hate speech]] under a number of different laws, including [[Volksverhetzung]]. In the German legal framework [[motivation]] is not taken into account while identifying the element of the offence. However, within the sentencing procedure the judge can define certain principles for determining punishment. In section 46 of the German Criminal Code it is stated that "the motives and aims of the perpetrator; the state of mind reflected in the act and the willfulness involved in its commission"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#46 |title=Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB) |publisher=Iuscomp.org |access-date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be taken into consideration when determining the [[punishment]]; under this statute, hate and bias have been taken into consideration in sentencing in past cases.&lt;ref name="Marc Coester 2008"&gt;Marc Coester (2008): Das Konzept der Hate Crimes aus den USA unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Rechtsextremismus in Deutschland.

Hate crimes are not specifically tracked by German police, but have been studied separately: a recently published EU "Report on Racism" finds that racially motivated attacks are frequent in Germany, identifying 18,142 incidences for 2006, of which 17,597 were motivated by right-wing ideologies, both about a 14% year-by-year increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502471,00.html |title=EU Xenophobia Report: Racism On the Rise in Germany  |work=Der Spiegel |access-date=14 November 2011|date=28 August 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relative to the size of the population, this represents an eightfold higher rate of hate crimes than reported in the US during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2007/november/hatecrime_111907 |title=2006 Hate Crime in the U.S |publisher=Fbi.gov |access-date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Awareness of hate crimes in Germany remains low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502694,00.html |title= Interview with Racism Expert: 'Awareness of Ethnic Discrimination Is Low in Germany' |work=Der Spiegel |access-date=14 November 2011|date= 29 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 created the offence of inciting hatred against a group of persons on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]] community (an indigenous minority group), or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Irish legislation |year=1989|date=29 November 1989 |number=19 |name=Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frustration at the low number of prosecutions (18 by 2011) was attributed to a misconception that the law addressed hate crimes more generally as opposed to incitement in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Séamus |url=https://www.ihrec.ie/download/doc/responding_to_racist_incidents_and_racist_crimes_in_ireland.doc |title=Responding to Racist Incidents And Racist Crimes in Ireland |date=October 2011 |publisher=Equality Authority |isbn=978-1-908275-29-5 |series=Issues Papers |location=Roscrea |pages=§§5.2.14–5.2.21 |format=MS Word |access-date=7 November 2017 |no-pp=y}}; {{cite web |date=17 July 2013 |title=Clarification on the Prohibition against Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 |url=http://www.integration.ie/website/omi/omiwebv6.nsf/page/AXBN-9B2LU91733429-en |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108151615/http://www.integration.ie/website/omi/omiwebv6.nsf/page/AXBN-9B2LU91733429-en |archive-date=8 November 2017 |access-date=8 November 2017 |work=Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration |publisher=Department of Justice and Equality |location=Dublin |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, a UN rappourteur told Irish representatives at the [[Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]], meeting at [[UN Geneva]], to introduce new hate crime legislation to combat the low prosecution rate for offences under the 1989 act – particularly for [[online hate speech]] – and lack of training for the [[Garda Síochána]] on racially-motivated crimes. The rapporteur's points came during [[Opposition to immigration#Ireland|a rise in anti-immigrant rhetoric]] and racist attacks in Ireland and were based on reccomendations submitted by the [[Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission]] and numerous other [[Social movement organization|civil society organisations]]. Reforms are supported by the [[Irish Network Against Racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Pollak |first=Sorcha |date=2 December 2019 |title=UN official urges Ireland to introduce hate crime legislation |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/un-official-urges-ireland-to-introduce-hate-crime-legislation-1.4102386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
For [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Scotland]], the [[Sentencing Act 2020]] makes racial or religious hostility, or hostility related to disability, sexual orientation, or transgender identity an [[aggravation (legal concept)|aggravation]] in [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] for crimes in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/17/section/66|title=Sentencing Act 2020 section 66|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separately, the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] defines separate offences, with increased sentences, for racially or religiously aggravated assaults, harassment, and a handful of public order offences.

For [[Northern Ireland]], Public Order 1987 (S.I. 1987/463 (N.I. 7)) serves the same purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1987/463/contents/made|title=Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|publisher=UK Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "racial group" is a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins. A "religious group" is a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief.

"Hate crime" legislation is distinct from "hate speech" legislation. See [[Hate speech laws in the United Kingdom]].

The [[Crime Survey for England and Wales]] (CSEW) reported in 2013 that there were an average of 278,000 hate crimes a year with 40 percent being reported according to a victims survey; police records only identified around 43,000 hate crimes a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Arnett| first = George| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/dec/17/how-prevalent-hate-crime-england-wales | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Hate crime in England and Wales: how prevalent is it? | date=17 December 2013|access-date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{needs update|date=August 2020}} It was reported that police recorded a 57-percent increase in hate crime complaints in the four days following the UK's [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|European Union membership referendum]]; however, a press release from the National Police Chief's Council stated that "this should not be read as a national increase in hate crime of 57 percent".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/27/sadiq-khan-muslim-council-britain-warning-of-post-brexit-racism Cameron condemns xenophobic and racist abuse after Brexit vote], ''The Guardian'' 27 June 2016, accessed 29 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/hate-crime-is-unacceptable-in-any-circumstances-say-police|title=Hate crime is unacceptable in any circumstances say police |work=National Police Chief's Council |date=27 June 2016|access-date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2013 [[Essex Police]] launched the 'Stop the Hate' initiative as part of a concerted effort to find new ways to tackle hate crime in Essex. The launch was marked by a conference in [[Chelmsford]], hosted by Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh, which brought together 220 delegates from a range of partner organizations involved in the field. The theme of the conference was 'Report it to Sort it' and the emphasis was on encouraging people to tell police if they have been a victim of hate crime, whether it be based on race, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stopthehate.org.uk/2013/12/launch-of-stop-the-hate-initiative |title=Launch of 'Stop the Hate' initiative |publisher=Stop the hate |date=4 December 2013 |access-date=12 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723012117/http://www.stopthehate.org.uk/2013/12/launch-of-stop-the-hate-initiative/ |archive-date=23 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most high-profile hate crime in modern Britain occurred in [[Eltham]], [[London]], on 24 April 1993, when 18-year-old black student [[Stephen Lawrence]] was stabbed to death in an attack by a gang of white youths. Two white teenagers were later charged with the murder, and at least three other suspects were mentioned in the national media, but the charges against them were dropped within three months after the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. However, a change in the law a decade later allowed a suspect to be charged with a crime twice if new evidence emerged after the original charges were dropped or a "not guilty" verdict was delivered in court. Gary Dobson, who had been charged with the murder in the initial 1993 investigation, was found guilty of Stephen Lawrence's murder in January 2012 and sentenced to life imprisonment, as was David Norris, who had not been charged in 1993. A third suspect, Luke Knight, had been charged in 1993 but was not charged when the case came to court nearly 20 years later.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

A 2021 investigation by ''[[Newsnight]]'' and ''[[The Law Society Gazette]]'' found that alleged hate crimes in which the victim was a police officer were significantly more likely to result in a successful prosecution. The investigation found that in several areas, crimes against police officers and staff constituted up to half of all hate crimes convictions, despite representing a much smaller proportion of reported incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56546490|title=Hate crimes on police 'more likely to be charged'|date=27 March 2021|access-date=12 December 2021|publisher=[[BBC News]]|first1=Melanie|last1=Newman|first2=Richard|last2=Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
"In Canada the legal definition of a hate crime can be found in sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code".&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the federal government amended a section of the Criminal Code that pertains to sentencing. Specifically, section 718.2. The section states (with regard to the hate crime):

{{blockquote|A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:

{{ubl
|(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,{{ubl
|(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, ... shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances.&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"/&gt;}}}}}}

A vast majority (84 percent) of hate crime perpetrators were "male, with an average age of just under 30. Less than 10 of those accused had criminal records, and less than 5 percent had previous hate crime involvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Only 4 percent of hate crimes were linked to an organized or extremist group".&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, Jewish people were the largest ethnic group targeted by hate crimes, followed by black people, Muslims, South Asians, and homosexuals (Silver et al., 2004).&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"/&gt;

During the Nazi regime in Germany, antisemitism was a cause of hate-related violence in Canada. For example, on 16 August 1933, there was a baseball game in Toronto and one team was made up mostly of Jewish players. At the end of the game, a group of Nazi sympathizers unfolded a Swastika flag and shouted "Heil Hitler." That event [[Christie Pits riot|erupted into a brawl]] that pitted Jews and Italians against Anglo Canadians; the brawl went on for hours.&lt;ref name="autogenerated161"/&gt;

The first time someone was charged for hate speech over the internet occurred on 27 March 1996. "A Winnipeg teenager was arrested by the police for sending an email to a local political activist that contained the message "Death to homosexuals...it's prescribed in the Bible! Better watch out next Gay Pride Week.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated162"/&gt;

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Canada|COVID-19 pandemic]], Canada saw a sudden rise in hate crimes based on race, religion, and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | vauthors=((Jain, S.)) | year=2022 | title=Hate crimes surge in Canada during pandemic | website=Reuters |date=August 5, 2022 | url=https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/hate-crimes-surge-canada-during-pandemic-2022-08-05/ | access-date=2 January 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Statistics Canada]] reported there was a 72% increase in hate crimes between 2019 and 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Canada sees surge in hate crimes during pandemic, new data shows | url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/5/canada-sees-surge-in-hate-crimes-during-pandemic-new-data-shows | access-date=2 January 2023 |website=Al Jazeera |date=August 5, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
Alejandro Gertz Manero, [[Attorney General of Mexico]], recommended in August [[2020 in Mexico|2020]] that all murders involving women be investigated as [[Violence against women in Mexico|femicides]]. An average of 11 women are killed every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Breña |first1=Carmen Morán |title=Las feministas saludan la rectificación del fiscal Gertz sobre el tipo penal de feminicidio |url=https://elpais.com/mexico/2020-08-14/las-feministas-saludan-la-rectificacion-del-fiscal-gertz-sobre-el-tipo-penal-de-feminicidio.html |website=EL PAÍS |access-date=August 16, 2020 |language=es |date=14 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hate crime laws have a long history in the United States. The first hate crime&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final.pdf|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2015|date=Fall 2016|website=ucr.fbi.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; laws were passed after the [[American Civil War]], beginning with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]], in order to combat the growing number of racially motivated crimes which were being committed by the [[Reconstruction era]]—[[Ku Klux Klan]]. The modern era of hate-crime legislation began in 1968 with the passage of federal statute, 18 U.S.C.A. § 249, part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Civil Rights Act]] which made it illegal to "by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone who is engaged in six specified protected activities, by reason of their [[race (classification of humans)|race]], [[color]], [[religion]], or [[national origin]]."&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C.S. § 245(b) (Public Law 117-39, approved August 31, 2021).&lt;/ref&gt; However, "The prosecution of such crimes must be certified by the U.S. attorney general."&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first state hate-crime statute, [[California]]'s Section 190.2, was passed in 1978 and provided penalty enhancements in cases when murders were motivated by prejudice against four "protected status" categories: race, religion, color, and national origin. Washington included [[ancestry]] in a statute which was passed in 1981. Alaska included [[creed]] and [[sex]] in 1982, and later [[disability]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[ethnicity]]. In the 1990s some state laws began to include [[ageing|age]], [[marital status]], membership in the [[armed forces]], and membership in [[civil rights]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until California state legislation included all crimes as possible hate crimes in 1987, criminal acts which could be considered hate crimes in various states included [[aggravated assault]], [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[vandalism]], [[rape]], [[threat]]s and [[intimidation]], [[arson]], [[trespassing]], [[stalking]], and various "lesser" acts.&lt;ref&gt;Streissguth (2003), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined in the 1999 National Crime Victim Survey, "A hate crime is a criminal offence. In the [[United States]], federal prosecution is possible for hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity." In 2009, capping a broad-based public campaign lasting more than a decade, President [[Barack Obama]] signed into law the [[Matthew Shepard Act|Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]]. The Act added actual or perceived [[gender]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[disability]] to the federal definition of a hate crime, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity. Led by Shepard's parents and a coalition of civil rights groups, with ADL (the [[Anti-Defamation League]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Michael Lieberman '81|url=https://law.duke.edu/news/michael-lieberman-81/|website=Duke Law News Releases|access-date=21 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Attorney General Loretta E.

Prosecutions of hate crimes have been difficult in the United States. Recently, state governments have attempted to re-investigate and re-try past hate crimes. One notable example was [[Mississippi]]'s decision to retry [[Byron De La Beckwith]] in 1990 for the 1963 murder of [[Medgar Evers]], a prominent figure in the [[NAACP]] and a leader of the [[civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Labuda|first=P.|title=Racial Reconciliation in Mississippi: An Evaluation of the Proposal to Establish a Mississippi Truth and Reconciliation Commission.|journal=Harvard Blackletter Law Journal|year=2011|volume=271|pages=1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first time in U.S. history that an unresolved civil rights case was re-opened. De La Beckwith, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, was tried for the murder on two previous occasions, resulting in [[Hung jury|hung juries]]. A mixed-race jury found Beckwith guilty of murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alston, A. A. |author2=Dickerson, J.

According to a November 2016 report issued by the FBI, hate crimes are on the rise in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latest Hate Crime Statistics Released - Annual Report Sheds Light on Serious Issue|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2015-hate-crime-statistics-released|website=FBI|access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of hate crimes increased from 5,850 in 2015, to 6,121 hate crime incidents in 2016, an increase of 4.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Licthblau|first1=Eric|title=U.S. Hate Crimes Surge 6%, Fueled by Attacks on Muslims|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/fbi-hate-crimes-muslims.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115034006/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/fbi-hate-crimes-muslims.html |archive-date=2016-11-15 |url-access=limited |url-status=live|access-date=18 December 2016|newspaper=New York Times|date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mathias|first1=Christopher|title=Hate Crimes Rose About 5 Percent In 2016, FBI Report Says|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-hate-crimes-report-2016_us_5a08c795e4b01d21c83f46ac|newspaper=The Huffington Post|access-date=14 November 2017|date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Hate Crime Statistics|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2016/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses|publisher=FBI|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khalid Jabara-Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality Act (NO HATE), which was first introduced in 2017, was reintroduced in June 2019 to improve hate crime reporting and expand support for victims as a response to anti-LGBTQ, anti-Muslim and antisemitic attacks. The bill would fund state hate-crime hotlines, and support expansion of reporting and training programs in law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://religionnews.com/2019/06/28/civil-rights-advocates-victims-families-urge-support-for-new-hate-crime-reporting-bill/|title=Civil rights advocates, victims' families urge support for new hate crime reporting bill|date=28 June 2019|website=Religion News Service|language=en-US|access-date=29 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2021 study, in the years between 1992 and 2014, white people were the offenders in 74.5 percent of anti-Asian hate crimes, 99 percent of anti-black hate crimes, and 81.1 percent of anti-Hispanic hate crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Yan|last2=Zhang|first2=Lening|last3=Benton|first3=Francis|date=2021-01-07|title=Hate Crimes against Asian Americans|journal=American Journal of Criminal Justice|volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=441–461|doi=10.1007/s12103-020-09602-9|issn=1066-2316|pmc=7790522|pmid=33437139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Victims in the United States=====
One of the largest waves of hate crimes in the [[history of the United States]] took place during the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Violence and threats of violence were common against [[African Americans]], and hundreds of people died due to such acts. Members of this [[ethnic group]] faced violence from [[Hate groups|groups]] such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]], as well as violence from individuals who were committed to maintaining [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Segregation in America |url=https://eji.org/reports/segregation-in-america/ |website=Equal Justice Initiative |access-date=26 May 2020 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, civil rights leaders such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and their supporters fought hard for the right of African Americans to vote, as well as for equality in their everyday lives. African Americans have been the target of hate crimes since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],&lt;ref name="americansperspective.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://americansperspective.com/10-of-the-worst-hate-crimes-and-violence-in-domestic-american-history/|title=10 Of The Worst Hate Crimes and Violence in Domestic American History|date=22 June 2015|newspaper=americansperspective.com|access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the humiliation of this ethnic group was also desired by many anti-black individuals. Other frequently reported bias motivations were bias against a religion, bias against a particular sexual orientation, and bias against a particular ethnicity/national origin.&lt;ref name="fbi 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/narratives/hate-crime-2010-victims |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2010|access-date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, these bias motivations overlapped, because violence can be both anti-gay and anti-black, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|title=Evaluating the Severity of Hate-motivated Violence: Intersectional Differences among LGBT Hate Crime Victims|journal=Sociology|year=2010|volume=44|issue=5|pages=980–95|doi=10.1177/0038038510375737|s2cid=145147987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts have compared groups in terms of the per capita rate of hate crimes committed against them to allow for differing populations. Overall, the total number of hate crimes committed since the first hate crime bill was passed in 1997 is 86,582.&lt;ref name="The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepard|first1=Mathew|last2=Byrd|first2=James Jr.|title=Hate Crimes Law|journal=Human Rights Campaign|date=2011–2014|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/hate-crimes-law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the groups which are mentioned in the [[Hate Crime Statistics Act|Hate Crimes Statistics Act]], the largest number of hate crimes are committed against African Americans.&lt;ref name="Reports and Curricula"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/cause_for_concern/p8.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/|title=Reports and Curricula|newspaper=The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|access-date=2 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202170025/http://www.civilrights.org/publications/reports/cause_for_concern/p8.html?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F|archive-date=2 December 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Civil Rights Movement, some of the most notorious hate crimes included the 1968 [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], the 1964 murders of Charles Moore and Henry Dee, the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]], the 1955 murder of [[Emmett Till]],&lt;ref name="americansperspective.com"/&gt; and the burning of crosses, churches, [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s, and other places of worship of minority religions. Such acts began to take place more frequently after the [[racial integration]] of many schools and public facilities.&lt;ref name="Reports and Curricula"/&gt;

High-profile murders targeting victims based on their sexual orientation have prompted the passage of hate crimes legislation, notably the cases of [[Sean W. Kennedy]] and [[Matthew Shepard]]. Kennedy's murder was mentioned by Senator [[Gordon Smith (politician)|Gordon Smith]] in a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate while he advocated such legislation. The [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]] was signed into law in 2009. It included sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disably status, and military personnel and their family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Matthew Shepard And James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act Of 2009 {{!}} CRT |publisher=Department of Justice|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/matthew-shepard-and-james-byrd-jr-hate-crimes-prevention-act-2009-0|access-date=29 March 2017|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/hate-crime-laws|title=Hate Crime Laws|date=July 7, 2016|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first all-inclusive bill ever passed in the United States, taking 45 years to complete.{{clarify|reason="all-inclusive" how/45 years how?|date=June 2013}}

Gender-based crimes may also be considered hate crimes.

Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States experienced a spike in overall hate crimes against Muslim individuals. In the year before, only 28 events had been recorded of hate crimes against Muslims; in 2001, this number jumped to 481. While the number decreased in the following years, the number of Muslim hate crimes remains higher than pre-2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kuek Ser|first=Kuang Keng|title=Data: Hate Crimes Against Muslims Increased after 9/11|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-12/data-hate-crimes-against-muslims-increased-after-911|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913031133/http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-09-12/data-hate-crimes-against-muslims-increased-after-911|archive-date=September 13, 2016|url-status=live|access-date=16 March 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, ''[[ProPublica]]'' reviewed police reports for 58 cases of purported anti-heterosexual hate crimes. ''ProPublica'' found that about half of the cases were anti-LGBT hate crimes that had been miscategorized, and that the rest were motivated by hate towards Jews, blacks or women or that there was no element of a hate crime at all. ''ProPublica'' did not find any cases of hate crimes spurred by anti-heterosexual bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/police-are-mislabeling-crimes-as-anti-heterosexual-hate-crimes|title=Police Are Mislabeling Anti-LGBTQ and Other Crimes as Anti-Heterosexual — ProPublica|date=15 May 2018|website=ProPublica|others=Rachel Glickhouse, Rahima Nasa|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Anti-trans hate crime ======

In 2017, shortly after President [[Donald Trump]] took office, hate crimes against [[transgender]] individuals arose. In June 2020, after the death of several African Americans at the hands of police officers – in particular, [[George Floyd]] – triggered protests around the world as part of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Buchanan|first1=Larry|last2=Bui|first2=Quoctrung|last3=Patel|first3=Jugal K.|date=2020-07-03|title=Black Lives Matter May Be the Largest Movement in U.S. History|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html|access-date=2021-05-01|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; hate crimes against the black trans community began to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Paz|first1=Isabella Grullón|last2=Astor|first2=Maggie|date=2020-06-27|title=Black Trans Women Seek More Space in the Movement They Helped Start|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/us/politics/black-trans-lives-matter.html|access-date=2021-05-01|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brazil====
In [[Brazil]], hate crime laws focus on [[racism]], racial [[injury]], and other special bias-motivated crimes such as, for example, murder by [[death squad]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L8072.htm|title=L8072|website=www.planalto.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genocide]] on the grounds of [[nationality]], ethnicity, race or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L2889.htm|title=L2889|website=www.planalto.gov.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murder by death squads and genocide are legally classified as "hideous crimes" ({{Lang|pt|crimes hediondos}} in Portuguese).&lt;ref&gt;Law 8072/1990 (aforementioned link), Article 1st, I and single paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crimes of racism and racial injury, although similar, are enforced slightly differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boletimjuridico.com.br/doutrina/texto.asp?id=662 |title=Racismo ou injúria racial? - Boletim Jurídico |publisher=Boletimjuridico.com.br |access-date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 140, 3rd paragraph, of the [[Penal Code]] establishes a harsher penalty, from a minimum of one year to a maximum of three years, for injuries motivated by "elements referring to race, color, [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], origin, or the condition of being an aged or [[disability|disabled person]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848compilado.htm |title=DEL2848compilado |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |access-date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, Law 7716/1989 covers "crimes resulting from [[discrimination]] or [[prejudice]] on the grounds of race, color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L7716.htm |title=L7716 |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |access-date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Brazilian Constitution defines as a "fundamental goal of the Republic" (Article 3rd, clause IV) "to promote the well-being of all, with no prejudice as to [[nationality|origin]], race, sex, color, age, and any other forms of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao_Compilado.htm| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012234154/http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constitui%C3%A7ao_Compilado.htm| archive-date = 2007-10-12| title = Constitui o-Compilado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Anti-discrimination law amended the Criminal Code adding a new aggravating circumstance of criminal responsibility, as follows: "Committing or participating in a crime motivated by ideology, political opinion, religion or beliefs of the victim; nation, race, ethnic or social group; sex, [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], age, affiliation, personal appearance or suffering from illness or disability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1984|title=COD-PENAL 12-NOV-1874 MINISTERIO DE JUSTICIA - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|website=www.leychile.cl|date=12 November 1874}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1042092|title=LEY-20609 24-JUL-2012 MINISTERIO SECRETARÍA GENERAL DE GOBIERNO - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|website=www.leychile.cl|date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justifications for harsher punishments for hate crimes focus on the notion that hate crimes cause greater individual and societal harm.&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan UK"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Duggan|first1=Marian|title=Prioritized Political Focus: ASB and Hate Crime|date=2014|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/9781137409270_4|work=Administrating Victimization|pages=59–90|place=London|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-349-48857-5|access-date=2021-05-01|last2=Heap|first2=Vicky|doi=10.1057/9781137409270_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 book, author Marian Duggan asserts that when the core of a person's identity is attacked, the degradation and [[dehumanization]] is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Wider society can suffer from the [[empowerment|disempowerment]] of a group of people.&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan UK"/&gt; Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The [[1992 Los Angeles riots|riots]] in [[Los Angeles]], California, that followed the beating of [[Rodney King]], a [[black people|black]] motorist, by a group of [[white people|white]] police officers are cited as support for this argument.&lt;ref name = "tvccce"/&gt; The beating of white truck driver [[Reginald Oliver Denny|Reginald Denny]] by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.

Mitchell]],'' the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] unanimously found that ''penalty-enhancement'' hate crime statutes do not conflict with [[free speech]] rights, because they do not punish an individual for exercising [[freedom of expression]]; rather, they allow courts to consider [[motive (law)|motive]] when sentencing a criminal for conduct which is not protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/supreme-court-drama/wisconsin-v-mitchell|access-date=12 October 2011|title=Wisconsin v.

David Brax argues that critics of hate-crime laws are wrong in claiming that hate crimes punish thoughts or motives; he asserts they do not do this, but instead punish people for choosing these reasons to commit a criminal act.&lt;ref&gt;Brax, David. "Motives, reasons, and responsibility in hate/bias crime legislation." Criminal Justice Ethics 35, no. 3 (2016): 230-248.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Andrew Seidel writes, "Hate crime or bias intimidation crimes are not thoughtcrimes. Most crimes require two things: an act and an intent... If you simply hate someone based on race, sexuality, or creed, that thought is not punishable. Only the thought combined with an illegal action is criminal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seidel |first1=Andrew |title=The Founding Myth |date=14 May 2019 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Co., Inc. |location=United States of America |isbn=978-1-4549-4391-4 |page=338 |edition=2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found the [[R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul|St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance]] amounted to viewpoint-based discrimination in conflict with rights of free speech, because it selectively criminalized bias-motivated speech or symbolic speech for disfavored topics while permitting such speech for other topics.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul]]'', 505 U.S. 377 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics further assert that it conflicts with an even more fundamental right: free thought. The claim is that hate-crime legislation effectively makes certain ideas or beliefs, including religious ones, illegal, in other words, [[thought crime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;'''Sources''':

Hurd argues that whether or not a disposition is worse than another is case sensitive and thus it is difficult to argue that some motivations are categorically worse than others.&lt;ref&gt;David Brax, Christian Munthe [https://www.uclan.ac.uk/research/explore/projects/assets/PT_11_The_Philosophy_of_Hate_Crime_Anthology_Pt_II_munthe_and_brax.pdf "The Philosophy of Hate Crime Anthology."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510041124/http://www.uclan.ac.uk/research/explore/projects/assets/PT_11_The_Philosophy_of_Hate_Crime_Anthology_Pt_II_munthe_and_brax.pdf |date=2016-05-10 }}, ''Introduction to the Philosophy of Hate Crime'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics'', [[James B. Jacobs]] and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime legislation for exacerbating conflicts between groups.  They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, rather than as being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as "hate crimes" causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] and thus lead to an actual increase in crime.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, James B. 1998"&gt;Jacobs, James B. &amp; Kimberly Potter. (1998). Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics. New York: Oxford University Press,&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobs and Potter also argued that hate crime legislation can end up only covering the victimization of some groups rather than all, which is a form of discrimination itself and that attempts to remedy this by making all identifiable groups covered by hate crime protection thus make hate crimes co-terminus with generic criminal law. The authors also suggest that arguments which attempt to portray hate crimes as worse than normal crimes because they spread fear in a community are unsatisfactory, as normal criminal acts can also spread fear yet only hate crimes are singled out.&lt;ref name="Jacobs, James B. 1998"/&gt; Indeed, it has been argued that victims have varied reactions to hate crimes, so it is not necessarily true that hate crimes are regarded as more harmful than other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Iganski, Paul, and Spiridoula Lagou. "Hate crimes hurt some more than others: Implications for the just sentencing of offenders." Journal of interpersonal violence 30.10 (2015): 1696-1718.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/0886260517746131|pmid = 29295032|title = For Whom Does Hate Crime Hurt More?

"Two liberal fallacies in the hate crimes debate." Law and Philosophy (2001): 175-193, pp.183-185&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidi Hurd argues that hate crime represents an effort by the state to encourage a certain moral character in its citizen and thus represents the view that the instillation of virtue and the elimination of vice are legitimate state goals, which she argues is a contradiction of the principles of liberalism. Hurd also argues that increasing punishment for an offence because the perpetrator was motivated by hate compared to some other motivation means that the justice systems is treating the same crime differently, even though treating like cases alike is a cornerstone of criminal justice.&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, Heidi. "Why Liberals Should Hate'Hate Crime Legislation'." (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Troy |first=Daniel E. |url=http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |title=AEI – Short Publications |publisher=Aei.org |date=4 August 1999 |access-date=14 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610125417/http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |archive-date=10 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American forensic psychologist [[Karen Franklin]] said that the term ''hate crime'' is somewhat misleading since it assumes there is a hateful motivation which is not present in many occasions;&lt;ref name=twsFrontline&gt;Frontline (PBS),[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/interviews/franklin.html Interviews], Accessed 26 July 2014, "...forensic psychologist, Karen Franklin's dual interests in psychology and the law brought her to question the roots of anti-gay hate crimes... badly needed empirical data on the nature and extent of negative reactions to gays..."&lt;/ref&gt; in her view, laws to punish people who commit hate crimes may not be the best remedy for preventing them because the threat of future punishment does not usually deter such criminal acts.&lt;ref name="twsAdvocate"&gt;{{cite web
