'''Hate crimes''' (also known as '''bias-motivated crimes''') occur when a perpetrator targets a victim because of his or her perceived membership in a certain [[social group]], usually defined by [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial group]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]], [[disability]], [[Social class|class]], [[ethnicity]], [[nationality]], [[Ageing|age]], [[gender]], [[gender identity]], or [[political affiliation]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;Stotzer, R.:  [https://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/Comparison%20of%20Hate%20Crime%20Formatted.pdf Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups], [[Williams Institute]], 2007–06. Retrieved on 2007-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hate crime" generally refers to [[crime|criminal acts]] that are seen to have been motivated by bias against one or more of the types above, or of their derivatives. Incidents may involve physical [[assault]], damage to property, [[bullying]], [[harassment]], [[verbal abuse]] or [[insults]], or offensive graffiti or letters ([[hate mail]]).&lt;ref name = "ovrbwx"&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/ Hate crime], [[Home Office]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Examples from the past include [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[persecution]] of [[Christianity|Christians]], the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] [[Armenian genocide|genocide]] of [[Armenians]], and various [[Nazi]] [[pogroms]], starting out as locally-sanctioned anti-Jewish activity in the early years of Nazi occupations and eventually reaching its apex in the [[Final Solution]] for the [[Jew]]s.

More recently, ethnic conflicts in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[genocide]] in [[Rwanda]] have been described as mass-based hate crimes, but the term "hate crime" did not really begin to be used until after [[World War II]] and the end of most major government-sanctioned [[Ethnic cleansing|racial cleansing]] projects that had been linked with official [[fascism]]. The term "hate crime" is now used more often than in the past mainly because the groups that used to have official endorsement under fascist-linked regimes have now broken up into smaller grouplets that are still committed to the underlying [[racist]] and [[xenophobic]] ideas, but whose only real outlet for those ideas is individual actions rather than administratively-approved ones. Thus, "hate crime" as that term is most often used today is largely seen as, and dealt with, in a [[law enforcement]] capacity by [[police]] in individual areas, rather than on a larger scale with intergovernmental and/or [[armed forces]] involvement.

Concern about hate crimes has become increasingly prominent among policymakers in many nations and at all levels of [[government]] in recent years. There have been many examples throughout modern-day [[Europe]] by  groups who harass and threaten many different racial groups.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} &lt;!-- Many specific examples of European hate crimes and in other world locations could and should go here; there is no reason to have this article be U.S.-centric. Please add examples and include citations --&gt; In the [[United States]], racial and religious biases have inspired most hate crimes. As [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] began to [[colonialism|colonize]] the New World in the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] increasingly became the targets of bias-motivated [[intimidation]] and [[violence]]. During the past two centuries, some of the more typical examples of hate crimes in the U.S. include [[lynchings]] of [[African Americans]], [[cross burnings]] to drive black families from predominantly white neighborhoods, [[assault]]s on white people traveling in predominantly black neighborhoods, [[assault]]s on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people, the painting of [[swastika]]s on Jewish [[synagogues]] and xenophobic responses to a variety of [[minorities|minority]] [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref name = "tvccce"&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/162304.pdf A Policymaker's Guide to Hate Crimes&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples like the [[murder of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom]] and the [[Wichita Massacre]] tend not to be classified as "hate crimes" by U.S. investigative officials, but they have meanwhile been blasted as "hate crimes against whites by blacks" by [[right-wing]] commentators such as [[David Horowitz]] (a right-wing author and academic) and [[Michelle Malkin]] (a commentator for the [[Fox News]] channel and a prolific [[conservative (politics)|conservative]] author). The [[district attorney]]s in both these cases have specifically stated that while these incidents were indeed horrible, and had tremendous impacts on the communities affected by them, neither displayed evidence of being black-on-white [[racism]], either upon initial or more in-depth review.

==Hate crime victims==
In the United States, [[racist]] anti-[[black people|black]] bias is the most frequently reported hate crime motivation. African-Americans constitute the second-largest minority group with [[Hispanics]] being the first largest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2005/table1.htm Table 1 – Hate Crime Statistics 2005&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the nearly 8,000 hate crimes reported to the FBI in 1995, the most frequently reported motivation was bias against blacks, almost 3,000,&lt;ref name="fbi"&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hatecm.htm#bias FBI – Uniform Crime Reports – Hate Crime Statistics 1995&lt;/ref&gt; other frequently reported bias motivations were anti-white, Jewish, Gay, Muslim, Asian, Native American, and Hispanic.&lt;ref name="fbi" /&gt;

==Psychological effects==
From a [[Psychology|psychological]] standpoint, hate crimes may have extreme consequences. A manual issued by the Attorney-General of the Province of [[Ontario]] in Canada lists the following consequences:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/french/crim/cpm/2005/HateCrimeDiscrimination.pdf |title=MANUEL DES POLITIQUES DE LA COURONNE  |date=21 mars 2005  |format=PDF |language=French |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''effects on people'' – psychological and [[affection|affective]] disturbances; repercussion on the victim's identity and [[self-esteem]]; both reinforced by the degree of violence of a hate crime, usually stronger than that of a common one.

* ''effect on the targeted group'' – generalized [[fear|terror]] in the group to which the victim belongs, inspiring feelings of vulnerability over the other members, who could be the next victims.

* ''effect on other vulnerable groups'' – ominous effects over [[minority group|minoritarian groups]] or over groups that identify themselves with the targeted one, especially when the referred hate is based on an [[ideology]] or [[doctrine]] that preaches simultaneously against several groups. Hate Crime is reported to the FBI

==Hate crime laws==
Hate crime laws generally fall into one of several categories: (1) laws defining specific bias-motivated acts as distinct crimes; (2) criminal penalty-enhancement laws; (3) laws creating a distinct civil cause of action for hate crimes; and (4) laws requiring administrative agencies to collect hate crime statistics.&lt;ref name="human"&gt;[http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/discrimination/pdf/everyday-fears-080805.pdf Microsoft Word – Everyday Fears FINAL for web.doc&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes (as in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), the laws focus on [[war crimes]], [[genocide]], and [[crimes against humanity]] with the prohibition against discriminatory action limited to public officials.

===Eurasia===
==== Andorra ====
Discriminatory acts constituting harassment or infringement of a person's dignity on the basis of origin, citizenship, race, religion, or sex (Penal Code Article 313). Courts have cited bias-based motivation in delivering sentences, but there is no explicit penalty enhancement provision in the Criminal Code. The government does not track hate crime statistics, although they are relatively rare.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Armenia====
[[Armenia]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes with ethnic, racial, or religious motives (Criminal Code Article 63).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Austria====
[[Austria]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes with racist or xenophobic motivation (Penal Code section 33(5)).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Azerbaijan====
[[Azerbaijan]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, or religious hatred (Criminal Code Article 61). Murder and infliction of serious bodily injury motivated by racial, religious, national, or ethnic intolerance are distinct crimes (Article 111).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Belarus====
[[Belarus]] has a penalty-enhancement statute for crimes motivated by racial, national, and religious hatred and discord.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravo.by/webnpa/text.asp?RN=HK9900275 Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus, § 64 (1), para. 9 (translated from the Russian)], June 9, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]]'s Act of 25 February 2003 ("aimed at combating discrimination and modifying the Act of 15 February 1993 which establishes the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism") establishes a penalty-enhancement for crimes involving discrimination on the basis of sex, supposed race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, civil status, birth, fortune, age, religious or philosophical beliefs, current or future state of health and handicap or physical features. The Act also "provides for a civil remedy to address discrimination."&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;  The Act, along with the Act of 20 January 2003 ("on strengthening legislation against racism"), requires the Centre to collect and publish statistical data on racism and discriminatory crimes.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
The Criminal Code of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (enacted 2003) "contains provisions prohibiting discrimination by public officials on grounds, inter alia, of race, skin colour, national or ethnic background, religion and language and prohibiting the restriction by public officials of the language rights of the citizens in their relations with the authorities (Article 145/1 and 145/2)."&lt;ref&gt;Office of the High Representative, [http://www.ohr.int/decisions/judicialrdec/doc/HiRep-dec-101-law-crim-code-bih.doc Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina], January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bulgaria====
[[Bulgaria]]n criminal law prohibits certain crimes motivated by racism and xenophobia, but a 1999 report by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] found that it does not appear that those provisions "have ever resulted in convictions before the courts in Bulgaria."&lt;ref&gt;ECRI, Second Report on Bulgaria, adopted on June 18, 1999, and made public on March 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Croatia====
[[Croatia]]n law allows for consideration of any extenuating or aggravating circumstances in sentencing, but no explicit provision is made for bias-based motivations.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Czech Republic====
"The [[Czech Republic|Czech]] Criminal Code defines racist motivation as a specific aggravating circumstance that judges are required to take into account in sentencing, as well as defining specific racist acts as crimes. Section 196 punishes 'violence against a group of inhabitants and against individuals on the basis of race, nationality, political conviction or religion.'"&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Denmark====
Although [[Denmark|Danish]] law does not include explicit hate crime provisions, "section 80(1) of the Criminal Code instructs courts to take into account the gravity of the offence and the offender's motive when meting out penalty, and therefore to attach importance to the racist motive of crimes in determining sentence."&lt;ref&gt;ECRI, Second Report on Denmark, adopted on June 16, 2000, and made public on April 3, 2001, para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years judges have used this provision to increase sentences on the basis of racist motives.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chahrokh, Klug, and Bilger, Migrants, Minorities, and Legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, the Danish Civil Security Service (PET) has released statistics on crimes with apparent racist motivation.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Finland====
[[Finland|Finnish]] [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] 515/2003 (enacted January 31, 2003) makes "committing a crime against a person, because of his national, racial, ethnical or equivalent group" an aggravating circumstance in sentencing.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EUMC, Racism and xenophobia in the E.U., p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ethnic agitation ({{lang-fi|kiihotus kansanryhmää vastaan}}) is criminalized and carries a fine or a prison sentence of not more than two years. The prosecution need not prove that an actual danger to an ethnic group is caused but only that malicious message is emissioned. A more aggravated hate crime, warmongering ({{lang-fi|sotaan yllyttäminen}}), carries a prison sentence of one to ten years. However, in case of warmongering, the prosecution must prove an [[overt act]] that evidently increases the risk that Finland is involved in a war or becomes a target for a military operation. The act in question may consist of
#illegal violence directed against foreign country or her citizens,
#systematic dissemination of false information on Finnish foreign policy or defence
#public influence on the public opinion towards a pro-war viewpoint or
#public suggestion that a foreign country or Finland should engage in an aggressive act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Penal Code (39/1889)] as of 1006/2004. §§ 6:5.1.4 (ethnic hatred as an aggravating factor), 11:8 (ethnic agitation) and 12:2 (warmongering).

Retrieved 11-23-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In 2003, France enacted penalty-enhancement hate crime laws for crimes motivated by bias against the victim's actual or perceived ethnicity, nation, race, religion, or sexual orientation. The penalties for murder were raised from 30 years (for non-hate crimes) to life imprisonment (for hate crimes), and the penalties for violent attacks leading to permanent disability were raised from 10 years (for non-hate crimes) to 15 years (for hate crimes).&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000781920 Loi n° 2003–88 du 3 février 2003 visant à aggraver les peines punissant les infractions à caractère raciste, antisémite ou xénophobe]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgia====
"There is no general provision in Georgian law for racist motivation to be considered an aggravating circumstance in prosecutions of ordinary offenses. Certain crimes involving racist motivation are, however, defined as specific offenses in the Georgian Criminal Code of 1999, including murder motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 109); infliction of serious
injuries motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 117); and torture motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 126). ECRI reported no knowledge of cases in which this law has been enforced. There is no systematic monitoring or data collection on discrimination in Georgia."&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

====Germany====
Modern-day Germany has very tough [[anti-Nazi]] laws, and [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Germany)|BfV]] monitors the [[neo-Nazi]] groups that choose to defy these laws and take actions in accordance with the ideas of [[Nazism]]. German law specifically states that any group of this type is closely watched and that any attempt on their part to grow to a point where they could have influence in the [[German government]] will be stopped. The German administrative structure is very wary of any group, [[fascist]] or not, that vies for absolute power. That being said, the [[German Criminal Code]] does not specifically acknowledge any direct penalty in connection with [[Hatred|hate]] or [[bias]] more generally. In the German legal framework [[motivation]] is not taken into account while identifying the element of the offence. However, within the sentencing procedure the judge can define certain principles for determining punishment. In section 46 of the German Criminal Code it is stated that "the motives and aims of the perpetrator; the state of mind reflected in the act and the wilfulness involved in its commission."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#46&lt;/ref&gt; can be taken into consideration when determining the [[punishment]]. In the past hate and bias was regarded here.&lt;ref name="Marc Coester 2008"&gt;Marc Coester (2008): Das Konzept der Hate Crimes aus den USA unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Rechtsextremismus in Deutschland. Peter Lang: Frankfurt/Berlin/Bern/Bruxelles/New York/Oxford/Wien&lt;/ref&gt;

The only section in the German Criminal Code where hate and/or bias could be taken into consideration (more or less) directly in case of a violent hate crime is 211 (Murder). The qualification for [[murder]] (imprisonment for life) instead of [[manslaughter]] (imprisonment not less than five years) is stated in paragraph 2 of section 211: "A murderer is, whoever kills a human being out of murderous lust, to satisfy his sexual desires, from greed or otherwise base motives, treacherously or cruelly or with means dangerous to the public or in order to make another crime possible or cover it up."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#211&lt;/ref&gt; In the past judges confirmed racial hate and [[xenophobia]] as being "otherwise base motives" that enhances a manslaughter to murder.&lt;ref&gt;BGH, Decision from 7. September 1993 – 5 StR 455/93&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides that the German Criminal Code holds sections against [[hate speech]]. Sections 86, 86a were introduced to defend against the ideas of [[National Socialism]]. The underlying principle is that propaganda material from forbidden organizations and parties (to which the NSDAP but also modern hate groups belong) can affect the public peace and safety as well as the Free Democratic Basic Order of Germany and therefore may lead to violence.

Section 130 states:
"(1) Whoever, in a manner that is capable of disturbing the public peace:
1. incites hatred against segments of the population or calls for violent or arbitrary measures against them; or
2. assaults the human dignity of others by insulting, maliciously maligning, or defaming segments of the population,
shall be punished with imprisonment from three months to five years.
(...)
(3) Whoever publicly or in a meeting approves of, denies or renders harmless an act committed under the rule of National Socialism of the type indicated in Section 220a subsection (1), in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace shall be punished with imprisonment for not more than five years or a fine."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#130&lt;/ref&gt;

Again the public peace and safety is protected and not the bodily integrity of an individual. Especially paragraph 3 shows a huge difference between Germany and (for example) the U.S. in defining the [[freedom of speech]]. In this case the so called "Auschwitz lie" – denying, approving or rendering harmless the Holocaust – is considered to disrespect the suffering of all victims. The legally protected interest of the human [[dignity]] (in Germany section 1 of the Grundgesetz (constitution)) limits the legally protected interest of freedom of speech (section 5 of the German Grundgesetz). In the U.S. this would be vice versa.&lt;ref name="Marc Coester 2008"/&gt;

====Greece====
Article Law 927/1979 "Section 1,1 penalises incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence towards individuals or groups because of
their racial, national or religious origin, through public written or oral expressions; Section 1,2 prohibits the
establishment of, and membership in, organisations which organise propaganda and activities aimed at racial
discrimination; Section 2 punishes public expression of offensive ideas; Section 3 penalises the act of refusing,
in the exercise of one’s occupation, to sell a commodity or to supply a service on racial grounds."&lt;ref&gt;ECRI, Second Report on Greece, adopted on 1999-12-10, and made public on 2000-06-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Public prosecutors may press charges even if the victim does not file a complaint. However, as of 2003, no convictions had been attained under the law.&lt;ref&gt;Sitaropoulos, N.: [http://europa.eu.int/comm/employment_social/fundamental_rights/pdf/legisln/msracequality/greece.pdf Executive Summary on Race Equality Directive, State of Play in Greece], section 5, 2003-10-12. Retrieved on 2007-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hungary====

====Iceland====
Section 233 of the Icelandic Penal Code states "Anyone who in a ridiculing, slanderous, insulting, threatening or any other manner publicly assaults a person or a group of people on the basis of their nationality, skin colour, race, religion or sexual orientation, shall be fined or jailed for up to 2 years." (The word "assault" in this context does not refer to physical violence, only to expressions of hatred.)

The Criminal Justice Act 2003 compels a court to consider whether a crime which is not specified by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 is racially or religiously aggravated. The Act compels a court also to consider whether the following circumstances were pertinent to the crime:
:(a) that, at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—
::(i) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or
::(ii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim, or
:(b) that the offence is motivated (wholly or partly)—
::(i) by hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or
::(ii) by hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_14#pt12-ch1-pb1-l1g145 Sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hate crime" legislation is distinct from "hate speech" legislation. See [[Hate speech laws in the United Kingdom]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eurasian countries with no hate crime laws====
[[Albania]], [[Cyprus]], [[Estonia]], [[San Marino]], and [[Slovenia]] have no hate crime laws.&lt;ref name="human" /&gt;

===North America===
==== Canada ====
The hate crime provision of the [[Canadian Criminal Code]] is Section 718.2. The section states (with regard to the hate crime):

:A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:
:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
::(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, . . . shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances.

Section 430(4.1) of the Canadian Criminal Code provides an increased penalty for "mischief" when the mischief affects a place of religious worship or religious property or a cemetery and is motivated by "bias, prejudice or hate based on religion, race, colour or national or ethnic origin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/text.html Criminal Code of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

===='''United States'''====
{{Main|Hate crime laws in the United States}}

Defined in the 1999 National Crime Victim Survey, "A hate crime is a criminal offense. In the [[United States]], federal prosecution is possible for hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity." In 2009, the [[Matthew Shepard Act]] added perceived [[gender]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[disability]] to the federal definition, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally-protected activity.

Forty-five states and the [[District of Columbia]] have statutes criminalizing various types of hate crimes. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have statutes creating a [[Legal liability|civil cause of action]] in addition to the criminal penalty for similar acts. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have statutes requiring the state to collect hate crime statistics&lt;ref name="adl"&gt;[http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/state_hate_crime_laws.pdf State Hate Crime Laws], [[Anti-Defamation League]], June 2006. Retrieved 2007-05-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[FBI]] Hate Crime Statistics report for 2006, hate crimes increased nearly 8% nationwide, with a total of 7,722 incidents and 9,080 offenses reported by participating law enforcement agencies.  Of the 5,449 crimes against persons, 46% were classified as intimidation and 31.9% as simple assaults.  81% of the 3,593 crimes against property were acts of vandalism or destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics, 2006 [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2006/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2006], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to the [[FBI]] Hate Crime Statistics for 2007, the number of hate crimes decreased to 7,624 incidents reported by participating law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics, 2007 [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/table_02.htm Hate Crime Statistics, 2007], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents included 9 murders and 2 rapes(out of the almost 17,000 murders and 90,000 forcible rapes committed in the U.S. in 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Statistics, 2007 [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2007/data/table_01.html FBI Crime in the United States 2007], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Attorney General]] Eric Holder said in June 2009 that recent killings show the need for a tougher U.S. hate crimes law to stop "violence masquerading as political activism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31392054/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ Attorney general urges new hate crimes law – Crime &amp; courts- msnbc.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
====Brazil====
In [[Brazil]], hate crime laws focus on [[racism]], racial [[injury]], and other special bias-motivated crimes such as, for example, murder by [[death squad]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{pt}}http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L8072.htm (Law 8072/1990, Article 1st, I)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genocide]] on the grounds of [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], race or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt}}http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L2889.htm (Law 2889/1956, Article 1st)&lt;/ref&gt; Murder by death squads and genocide are legally classified as "hideous crimes" (''crimes hediondos'' in Portuguese).&lt;ref&gt;Law 8072/1990 (aforementioned link), Article 1st, I and single paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crimes of racism and racial injury, although similar, are enforced slightly differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt}}http://www.boletimjuridico.com.br/doutrina/texto.asp?id=662&lt;/ref&gt; Article 140, 3rd paragraph, of the [[Penal Code]] establishes a harsher penalty, from a minimum of 1 year to a maximum of 3 years, for injuries motivated by "elements referring to race, color, [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], origin, or the condition of being an aged or [[disability|disabled person]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{pt}}http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848compilado.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side, Law 7716/1989 covers "crimes resulting from [[discrimination]] or [[prejudice]] on the grounds of race, color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{pt}}http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L7716.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Brazilian Constitution defines as a "fundamental goal of the Republic" (Article 3rd, clause IV) "to promote the wealth of all, with no prejudice as to [[nationality|origin]], race, sex, color, age, and any other forms of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{pt}}http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituiçao_Compilado.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and opposition==
{{Multiple issues|section=June 2009|unbalanced=June, 2009|globalize=June, 2009}}

===Support for hate crime laws===
Justifications for harsher punishments for hate crimes focus on the notion that hate crimes cause greater individual and societal harm. It is said that, when the core of a person’s identity is attacked, the degradation and [[dehumanization]] is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the [[empowerment|disempowerment]] of a group of people. Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The [[riots]] in [[Los Angeles]], California that followed the beating of [[Rodney King]], a Black motorist, by a group of [[white people|White]] police officers are cited as support for this argument.&lt;ref name = "tvccce"/&gt; The beating of white truck driver [[Reginald Oliver Denny|Reginald Denny]] by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that would support this argument.

The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] unanimously found that ''penalty-enhancement'' hate crime statutes do not conflict with [[free speech]] rights because they do not punish an individual for exercising [[freedom of expression]]; rather, they allow courts to consider motive when sentencing a criminal for conduct which is not protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. (However, freedom of religion and expression of one's beliefs are; see below.)&lt;ref name="mitchell"&gt;[[Wisconsin v. Mitchell]], 508 U.S. 476 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

When it enacted the Hate Crimes Act of 2000, the [[New York State]] Legislature found that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hate crimes do more than threaten the safety and welfare of all citizens. They inflict on victims incalculable physical and emotional damage and tear at the very fabric of free society. Crimes motivated by invidious hatred toward particular groups not only harm individual victims but send a powerful message of [[intolerance]] and [[discrimination]] to all members of the group to which the victim belongs. Hate crimes can and do intimidate and disrupt entire communities and vitiate the civility that is essential to healthy [[democracy|democratic]] processes. In a democratic society, citizens cannot be required to approve of the beliefs and practices of others, but must never commit criminal acts on account of them. Current law does not adequately recognize the harm to public order and individual [[safety]] that hate crimes cause. Therefore, our laws must be strengthened to provide clear recognition of the gravity of hate crimes and the compelling importance of preventing their recurrence. Accordingly, the legislature finds and declares that hate crimes should be prosecuted and punished with appropriate severity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://criminaljustice.state.ny.us/legalservices/ch107_hate_crimes_2000.htm Hate Crimes Act – Ch 107, 2000&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Opposition to hate crime laws===
The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance amounted to viewpoint based discrimination in conflict with rights of free speech because it selectively criminalized bias-motivated speech or symbolic speech for disfavored topics while permitting such speech for other topics.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul]], 505 U.S. 377 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics&lt;!--keep reading, refs are there--&gt; further assert that it conflicts with an even more fundamental right: free thought. The claim is that hate-crime legislation effectively makes certain ideas or beliefs, including religious ones, illegal, in other words, [[thought crime]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The Essayist (1998).

In their book ''Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics'', [[James B. Jacobs]] and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime legislation for exacerbating conflicts between groups.  They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, rather than as being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as “hate crimes” causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a backlash and thus lead to an actual increase in crime.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, James B. &amp; Kimberly Potter. (1998). Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 130–144&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 AEI – Short Publications&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that if it is true that all violent crimes are the result of the perpetrator's contempt for the victim, then all crimes are hate crimes. Thus, if there is no alternate rationale for prosecuting some people more harshly for the same crime based on who the victim is, then different defendants are treated unequally under the law, which violates the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/constitutionality.asp Constitutional Challenges to Hate Crimes Statutes&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
