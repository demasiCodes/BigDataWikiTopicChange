It is sometimes used as a pejorative description of systems which discriminate in favour of members of racial minorities, more formally known as [[reverse discrimination]].

Many white people in societies with histories of legal [[white privilege]]—particularly the United States and South Africa—feel that they are now victims of reverse racism.&lt;ref&gt;Amy E. Ansell, "Casting a Blind Eye: The Ironic Consequences of Color-Blindness in South Africa and the United States", ''Critical Sociology'' 32, 2006; DOI: 10.1163/156916306777835349, accessed [http://crs.sagepub.com/content/32/2-3/333 via Sage].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term has not been used exclusively by whites.

==In the United States==
The term "reverse racism" came into use as the struggle for African-American rights became nationally prominent. In 1966, [[Hosea Williams]] of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), publicly accused members of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) of reverse racism in their efforts to bring Blacks into local government in Alabama. Williams argued that SNCC's (unsuccessful) "all-Negro" campaign in Alabama would drive white moderates out of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]].&lt;ref&gt;"Strife on Two Civil Rights Fronts in Alabama: SNCC is Scored by King Group", ''Chicago Daily Defender'', 25 April 1966, p. 1; accessed [http://search.proquest.com/docview/494220221 via ProQuest]. "The move was called 'reverse racism' by Hosea Williams, Southern program director for King's Southern Christian Leadership conference. He described the effort to exclude all whites from public office as being as bad as the custom of doing the same thing to all Negroes. It isn't integration, he indicated, and it isn't likely—in the long run—to help cure the nation's number one headache."&lt;/ref&gt; "Black racism" was a more common term in this era, used to describe SNCC and groups like the Black Panthers.&lt;ref name=SW&gt;Lee Sustar, "The fallacy of 'reverse racism'", ''Socialist Worker'', 12 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term gained widespread use in debates and legal actions concerning [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelefah Sanneh, "[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2009/08/10/090810taco_talk_sanneh Discriminating Tastes]", ''The New Yorker'', 10 August 2009. [[http://www.webcitation.org/6C9DcUQni Archived] 13 November 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared resurgent on the political scene with the successful candidacy of [[Barack Obama]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Wise, "[http://www.laprogressive.com/obama-black-voters-and-the-myth-of-reverse-racism/#sthash.c7LVRkff.dpbs Obama, Black Voters and the Myth of Reverse Racism]", ''L.A. Progressive'', c. March 2008. [[http://www.webcitation.org/6C9DNgijX Archived] 13 November 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study conducted at Tufts and Harvard sought to quantify perceptions of reverse racism by surveying Americans who identified as White or Black. The study's title, "White People See Racism as a Zero-Sum Game That They Are Now Losing", indicates its findings: that Whites feel as though they now suffer disproportionately from racism. (Blacks felt that anti-Black racism had decreased over time, but did not perceive increases in anti-White bias.) These results were constant for people of different ages and levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;Michael I. Norton and Samuel R. Sommers, "[http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20sommers.pdf Whites See Racism as a Zero-Sum Game That They Are Now Losing]", ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'' 6, May 2011; DOI: 10.1177/1745691611406922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael I.

Critics of the term "reverse racism" have called it a myth or an oxymoron, saying that racism entails systemic oppression and inequality. In this view, instances of discrimination or prejudice against a functionally dominant group do not amount to racism. In the United States, these critics argue, African Americans and Native Americans are still not equal to European Americans, let alone able to enslave them, imprison them, or seize their land.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Jackson, "[http://www.thetowerlight.com/2010/04/fiction-of-reverse-racism/ Fiction of reverse racism]", ''The Towerlight'', 29 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Wise, "[http://www.raceandhistory.com/selfnews/viewnews.cgi?newsid1024893033,80611,.shtml A Look at the Myth of Reverse Racism]", 24 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nittle&gt;Nadra Kareem Nittle, "[http://racerelations.about.com/od/understandingrac1/a/Quotes-About-The-Myth-Of-Reverse-Racism.htm Quotes About The Myth of Reverse Racism]", ''About.com: Race Relations'', c. 2011; accessed 13 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Fish, "Reverse Racism, or How the Pot Got to Call the Kettle Black", ''The Atlantic'', November 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that fear of reverse racism has been cynically promoted by the [[Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Robinson, "[http://racerelations.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;zTi=1&amp;sdn=racerelations&amp;cdn=newsissues&amp;tm=256&amp;f=00&amp;su=p284.13.342.ip_&amp;tt=2&amp;bt=0&amp;bts=1&amp;zu=http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/21/AR2010072105169.html Obama needs to stand up to 'reverse racism' ploy]", ''Washington Post'', 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Earl Ofari Hutchinson, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/earl-ofari-hutchinson/the-new-gop-con--obama-th_b_639387.html The New GOP Con—Obama the Reverse Racist]", ''Huffington Post'', 8 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In South Africa==
The term has been used actively by White and Black South Africans after the end of [[apartheid]]. Accusations of reverse racism have been leveled particularly at government efforts to transform the demographics of South Africa's white-dominated civil service.&lt;ref&gt;Susan de Villiers and Stefan Simanowitz, "[http://www.questia.com/library/1G1-288429746/south-africa-the-anc-at-100 South Africa: The ANC at 100]", ''Contemporary Review'' 294, March 2012; accessed [http://search.proquest.com/docview/1013463231 via ProQuest].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nelson Mandela]] in 1995 described "racism in reverse" when Black students demonstrated in favor changing the racial makeup of staff at South African universities.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Mac Gregor, "[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=97135&amp;sectioncode=26 Mandela slams `reverse racism']", ''Times Higher Education", 24 March 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; But students denied Mandela's claim and argued that in fact a great deal of ongoing actual racism persisted from apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Abiola Sinclair, "MEDIA WATCH: All is not well, disappointments, racial clashes", ''New York Amsterdam News'', 16 September 1995; accessed [http://search.proquest.com/docview/390340787 via ProQuest]. "The students maintained that the university was living in the apartheid past with the upper echelons reserved for whites. The students are demanding that some jobs be reserved for Blacks. AZASM had denied the charge of reverse racism. They maintain it is unfair for thousands of Black teachers to be out of work while white teachers sit up in good jobs in Black schools."&lt;/ref&gt; Some charged that Mandela's government moved slowly in other areas of social change, due to fears of being perceived as "reverse racist."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Taylor, "Black Capitalists Rare In New South Africa; Apartheid's Legacy, Cultural Ethos Cited", ''Washington Post'', 19 March 1995; accessed [http://search.proquest.com/docview/307803664 via ProQuest]. "So far Mandela's government has moved slowly on that front. 'I think the government is still looking over its shoulder, afraid of the tag of reverse racism,' said Thami Mazwai, editor of Enterprise, a glossy monthly magazine devoted to black businesses. He noted that earlier this year a white ad agency and the nation's only black ad agency competed for a major government contract to publicize the public hearing process for the writing of a new constitution. Although the black agency has won several industry awards, the white agency got the contract."&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela was later himself charged with reverse racism—during 1997 proceedings of the national [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;Dean Murphy, "Apartheid-Era Leader Defies Subpoena; S. Africa: Truth commission urges contempt charges against former President Pieter W. Botha", ''Washington Post'', 20 December 1997; accessed [http://search.proquest.com/docview/421209639 via ProQuest]. "The move to charge Botha is particularly sensitive because it comes just days after President Nelson Mandela, in a racially charged address to the ruling African National Congress, harshly criticized white South Africans for protecting their positions of privilege and doing little to reconcile with the black majority. The speech, hailed as accurate by blacks, brought calls of reverse racism from many whites."&lt;/ref&gt; and for supporting the 1998 [[Employment Equity Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gumisai Mutume", "[http://www.ipsnews.net/1998/04/politics-south-africa-racism-spoils-it-for-new-democracy/ Racism Spoils It for New Democracy]", ''Inter-Press Service'', 3 April 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kate Dunn, "[http://www.csmonitor.com/1998/0226/022698.intl.intl.6.html Mandela Hits White Wealth]", ''Christian Science Monitor'', 26 February 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of reverse racism continued into the 21st century. [[Helen Suzman]] a prominent white anti-apartheid politician, has charged the [[African National Congress]] and the Mbeki administration of reverse racism since Mandela's departure in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Calvert, "[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-05-14/news/0505140451_1_helen-suzman-apartheid-white-liberals Against apartheid, at odds with blacks]", ''Baltimore Sun'', 14 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a group of young white members of the "Solidarity Trade Union" locked themselves into a zoo to protest discrimination against whites.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.amren.com/news/2004/12/youth_cage_them/ Youth Cage Themselves in Zoo to Protest Against Discrimination]", ''The Statesman'' (Press Trust of India), 27 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

South African critics of the "reverse racism" concept use similar arguments as Americans. Accusations of "reverse racism" have been described as a defense mechanism, and attributed to white people's refusal to take responsibility for apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;Yolisa Dalamba, "Towards An African Renaissance: Identity, Race And Representation In Post-Apartheid South Africa", ''Journal of Cultural Studies'' 2(1), 2000; accessed [http://search.proquest.com/docview/847122412 via ProQuest]. "These Whites are 'African' when it suits their individual needs, but it is an identity which can be put on and removed without a second thought. It is this very chameleon-like behaviour which leads to the very existence of such terms as 'reverse racism.' The largely unnamed fear and guilt that Whites consciously or unconsciously betray through their attitudes and body language is worthy of some analysis, hooks articulates this in the following statement: 'I was weary of the way in which white people want to deflect attention away from their accountability for anti-racist change by making it seem that everyone has been socialised to be racist against their will. My fear is that this often becomes another apology for racism, one which seeks to erase a vision of accountability and responsibility which could truly empower' (1992: 14)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Mixed-race South Africans (designed as "Coloured" during apartheid) have also sometimes claimed to be victimized by reverse racism of the new Black government.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia Polgreen, "[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/27/world/for-mixed-race-south-africans-equity-is-elusive.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm For Mixed-Race South Africans, Equity Is Elusive]", ''New York Times'', 27 July 2003. [[http://www.webcitation.org/6C9BBHNcM Archived] 13 November 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar accusations have been leveled by Indian and Afrikaner groups, who feel that they have not been dominant historically but now suffer from discrimination by the Black government.&lt;ref&gt;Danna Harman, "[http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0926/p01s03-woaf.html South Africans try to 'beat' a segregated past]", ''Christian Science Monitor'', 26 September 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
