'''Reverse racism''', sometimes referred to as [[reverse discrimination]],{{r|Yee 2008}} is the concept that [[affirmative action]] and similar [[color-conscious]] programs for redressing [[racial inequality]] are forms of anti-white [[racism]].{{r|Ansell p135}} The concept is often associated with [[conservative]] social movements,{{r|Ansell p135|Garner 2017}} and reflects a belief that social and economic gains by [[Black people]] and other [[people of color]] cause disadvantages for [[white people]].{{sfnp|Ansell|2013|p=137}}{{r|Mazzocco p91|Roussell 2019}}

Belief in reverse racism is widespread in the United States; however, there is little to no empirical evidence that [[white Americans]] as a group are disadvantaged.{{refn|group=Note | {{bulleted list | {{harvp|Ansell|2013|p=137}}: "Not much sober empirical study has been applied to the subject, but the studies that do exist find little evidence that reverse racism in fact exists." | {{harvp|Garner|2017|p=185}}: "[T]here is no evidence that [reverse racism] is a social fact, or that a pattern of disadvantageous outcomes for white people [[wikt:qua|qua]] white people exists." | {{harvp|Spanierman|Cabrera|2014|p=16}}: "While there is no empirical basis for white people experiencing 'reverse racism', this view is held by a large number of Americans." | {{harvp|Bax|2018|p=117}}: "Many Americans{{emdash}}including some people of color{{emdash}}staunchly believe in the existence of reverse racism, or racism against whites.

Allegations of reverse racism by opponents of affirmative action began to emerge in the 1970s,{{r|Ansell p135|Bonilla-Silva p211}} and have formed part of a [[White backlash|racial backlash]] against social gains by people of color.{{sfnp|Ansell|2013|pp=17, 137}} While the U.S. dominates the debate over the issue, the concept of reverse racism has been used internationally to some extent wherever [[white supremacy]] has diminished, such as in post-[[apartheid]] South Africa.{{sfnp|Ansell|2013|p=137}}

===Overview===
The concept of ''reverse racism'' in the United States is commonly associated with [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] opposition to color-conscious policies aimed at addressing racial inequality, such as [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]]. Amy E. Ansell of [[Emerson College]] identifies three main claims about reverse racism: (1) that government programs to redress racial inequality create "invisible victims" in [[White Americans|white]] men; (2) that racial preferences violate the individual right of [[Equal protection clause|equal protection]] before the law; and (3) that [[color consciousness]] itself prevents moving beyond the legacy of racism.{{r|Ansell p135}} The concept of reverse racism has also been used in relation to various expressions of hostility, prejudice or discrimination toward white people by members of minority groups.{{r|Cashmore 2004}}

===History===
Concerns that the advancement of [[African Americans]] might cause harm to [[white Americans]] date back as far as the [[Reconstruction Era]] in the context of debates over providing [[reparations for slavery]].{{r|Ansell p135}} Claims of reverse racism in the early 21st century tend to rely on individual [[anecdote]]s, often based on third- or fourth-hand reports, such as of a white person losing a job to a Black person.{{r|Dennis 2004}}

Allegations of reverse racism emerged prominently in the 1970s, building on the [[Racial color blindness|racially color-blind]] view that any preferential treatment linked to membership in a racial group was morally wrong.{{r|Ansell p135}} Sociologist [[Bob Blauner]] argues that reverse racism had become the primary meaning of ''racism'' among whites by the late 1970s, suggesting that conservatives and [[Centrism in the United States|centrist liberals]] in the U.S. had effectively "won the battle over the meaning of racism".{{r|Blauner p23}} Where past race-conscious policies such as [[Jim Crow]] have been used to maintain [[white supremacy]], modern programs such as affirmative action aim to reduce racial inequality.{{sfnp|Ansell|2013|pp=4, 46}} Despite affirmative-action programs' successes in doing so, conservative opponents claimed that such programs constituted a form of anti-white racism.{{r|McBride 2005}} For example, sociologist [[Nathan Glazer]] argued in his 1975 book ''Affirmative Discrimination'' that affirmative action was a form of reverse racism{{sfnp|Mazzocco|2017|p=23}}{{r|Blauner p346}} violating white people's right to equal protection under the law.{{sfnp|Ansell|2013|p=57}} This view was boosted by the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'' (1978), which said that [[racial quota]]s for minority students were discriminatory against [[white people]].{{r|McBride 2005}}

Legal cases concerning so-called "reverse racism" date back as far as the 1970s, for instance ''Regents of the University of California v. Bakke''; ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]''; and ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'' (regarding discrimination in higher education admissions) and ''[[Ricci v. DeStefano]]'' (regarding employment discrimination).{{r|Norton 2011a}} Such cases are rare; out of almost half a million complaints filed with the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) between 1987 and 1994, four percent were about reverse discrimination.{{r|Desmond p197}} Sociologist [[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]] writes that the actual number of reverse discrimination cases filed with the EEOC is quite small, and the vast majority are dismissed as unfounded.{{sfnp|Bonilla-Silva|2010|p=83}} Between 1990 and 1994, courts in the U.S. rejected all reverse discrimination cases as without merit.{{r|Desmond p197}}

Since 2020, conservative activists such as [[Stephen Miller (political advisor)|Stephen Miller]] and [[Edward Blum (litigant)|Edward Blum]] have challenged [[diversity, equity, and inclusion]] (DEI) programs as being discriminatory towards whites. Following the 2023 Supreme Court ruling against race-conscious affirmative action in college admissions, US courts have seen an increase in reverse discrimination claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Telford |first=Taylor |date=2023-12-27 |title=2024 might be do-or-die for corporate diversity efforts.

===Public attitudes===
While not empirically supported, belief in reverse racism is widespread in the United States,{{r|Bax 2018|Spanierman p16}} primarily among white people.{{r|Roussell 2019}} Psychological studies with white Americans have shown that belief in anti-white discrimination is linked with support for the existing racial hierarchy in the U.S.{{sfnp|Mazzocco|2017|p=85}}{{r|Wilkins 2013a}} as well as the belief that "hard work" and meritocracy explain any racial disparities.{{r|Cyr p24|Wilkins 2013b}} The idea that whites have become a socially disadvantaged group has contributed to the rise of conservative social movements such as the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] and support for [[Donald Trump]].{{r|Garner 2017}} Conservatives in the U.S. tend to believe that affirmative action based on membership in a designated racial group threatens the American system of individualism and [[meritocracy]].{{sfnp|Ansell|2013|p=17}} Ansell associates the idea of reverse racism with that of the "[[angry white male]]"{{r|Ansell p135}} and a [[White backlash|backlash]] against government actions meant to remedy racial discrimination.{{sfnp|Ansell|2013|pp=17, 137}}

The perception of decreasing anti-Black discrimination has been correlated with white people's belief in rising anti-white discrimination.{{r|Mazzocco p91}} A survey in [[Pennsylvania]] in the mid-1990s found that most white respondents (80%) thought it was likely that a white worker might lose a job or a promotion to a less qualified Black worker, while most Black respondents (57%) thought this was unlikely.{{r|Feagin p127}} A majority (57%) of white respondents to a 2016 survey by the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] said they believed discrimination against white people was as significant a problem as discrimination against Black people, while only a minority of African Americans (29%) and Hispanics (38%) agreed.{{r|Massie 2016|Jones 2016}} Researchers at [[Tufts University]] and [[Harvard]] report that as of the early 2010s many white Americans feel as though they suffer the greatest discrimination among racial groups, despite data to the contrary.{{r|Spanierman p16|Fletcher 2014|Ingraham 2017}} Whereas Black respondents see anti-Black racism as a continuing problem, white ones tend to think it has largely disappeared, to the point that they see prejudice against white people as being more prevalent.{{r|Norton 2011a|Norton 2011b}} Among white respondents since the 1990s:

{{quote|Whites have replaced Blacks as the primary victims of discrimination. This emerging perspective is particularly notable because by nearly any metric [...] statistics continue to indicate drastically poorer outcomes for Black than White Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Norton|Sommers|2011a|p=215}}, quoted in {{harvp|Garner|2017|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bonilla-Silva describes the "anti–affirmative action and 'reverse racism' mentality" that has become dominant since the 1980s as part of a "mean-spirited white racial animus".{{r|Bonilla-Silva p211}} He argues that this results from a new dominant ideology of "[[color-blind racism]]", which treats racial inequality as a thing of the past, thereby allowing it to continue by opposing concrete efforts at reform.{{sfnp|Garner|2017|p=186}} Journalist [[Vann R. Newkirk II]] writes that white people's belief in reverse racism has steadily increased since the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1960s.{{r|Newkirk 2017}} Using data from the 2006 [[Portraits of American Life Study]], Damon Mayrl and Aliya Saperstein find that whites who claim to have experienced racial discrimination are "more likely to be racially self-aware, to be pessimistic about the future, and to have a recent history of unemployment compared to their non-discrimination-reporting peers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mayrl |first1=Damon |last2=Saperstein |first2=Aliya |date=2013 |title=When white people report racial discrimination: The role of region, religion, and politics |url= |journal=Social Science Research |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=742–754 |doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2012.12.007 |issn=0049-089X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=September 2024 |reason=primary research study}}

===Scholarly analysis===
While there has been little empirical study on the subject of reverse racism, the few existing studies have found little evidence that white males, in particular, are victimized by affirmative-action programs.{{sfnp|Ansell|2013|p=137}} [[Race relations in the United States]] have been historically shaped by [[European imperialism]] and long-standing oppression of Blacks by whites,{{r|Cashmore 2004}} who remain the dominant group.{{r|Dennis 2004}} Such disparities in power and authority are seen by scholars as an essential component of [[racism]]; in this view, isolated examples of favoring disadvantaged people do not constitute racism.{{r|Yee 2008|McKinney p147}} In a widely reprinted article, legal scholar [[Stanley Fish]] wrote that {{" '}}Reverse racism' is a cogent description of affirmative action only if one considers the cancer of racism to be morally and medically indistinguishable from the therapy we apply to it".{{r|Fish}}

Sociologist [[Ellis Cashmore]] writes that the terms ''reverse racism'' and ''reverse discrimination'' imply that racism is defined solely by individual beliefs and prejudices, ignoring the material relations between different groups.{{r|Cashmore 2004}} Sociologist [[Joe Feagin]] argues that the term ''reverse discrimination'' is an [[oxymoron]] in the context of U.S. race relations in that it obscures the "central issue of [[systemic racism]]" disadvantaging people of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Feagin|2001|p=250|ps=.}} Cited in {{harvp|Cashmore|2004|p=373|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical race theorist [[David Theo Goldberg]] says the notion of reverse racism represents a denial of the historical and contemporary reality of racial discrimination.{{r|Pinder 2015}} Sociologist [[Karyn McKinney]] writes, "most claims that whites are victimized {{em|as whites}}&lt;!--emphasis in original--&gt; rely on false parallels, as they ignore the power differences between whites and people of color at the group level".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McKinney|2005|p=146|ps=.}} Cited in {{harvp|Bax|2018|p=117|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[Jane H. Hill]] argues that charges of reverse racism tend to deny the existence of [[white privilege]] and power in society.{{r|Hill p15}} Linguist [[Mary Bucholtz]] says the concept of reverse racism, which she calls ''racial reversal'', "runs counter to or ignores empirically observable racial asymmetries regarding material resources and structural power".{{r|Bucholtz 2011}} 

According to sociologist [[Rutledge Dennis]], individual members of minority groups in the United States "may be racists" toward white people, but cannot wield institutional power or shape the opportunities available to the majority as the white majority does in relation to minorities.{{r|Dennis 2004}} Sociologists [[Matthew Desmond]] and [[Mustafa Emirbayer]] distinguish between ''[[institutional racism]]'' and ''interpersonal racism'',{{sfnp|Desmond|Emirbayer|2010|p=30}} arguing that while "members of all racial groups can harbor negative attitudes toward members of other groups", there is no "black institutional racism" or "reverse institutional racism" since people of color have not created a socially ingrained system of racial domination over white people.{{sfnp|Desmond|Emirbayer|2010|p=32}} Psychologist and educator [[Beverly Daniel Tatum]] argues that racial bigotry or prejudices held by people of color are not comparable to white racism since "there is no systematic cultural and institutional support or sanction" for them.{{r|Tatum p129}} Tatum writes, "In my view, reserving the term ''racist'' only for behaviors committed by Whites in the context of a White-dominated society is a way of acknowledging the ever-present power differential afforded Whites by the culture and institutions that make up the system of advantage and continue to reinforce notions of White superiority."&lt;ref name="Tatum p129"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tatum |first1=Beverly Daniel |editor1-last=Rothenberg |editor1-first=Paula S. |title=Race, Class and Gender in the United States: An Integrated Study |date=2004 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7167-5515-9 |page=129 |edition=6th |chapter=Defining Racism: ''{{'}}Can We Talk?{{'}}{{thin space}}''}} Cited in {{harvp|McKinney|2005|p=147|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''reverse racism'' has been used by some white South Africans concerned about "reverse apartheid" following the end of [[Apartheid|white-supremacist rule]].{{sfnp|Ansell|2013|p=137}} Affirmative action in South Africa's white-dominated civil service was also met with charges of "reverse racism".&lt;ref name="de Villiers 2012"&gt;{{cite magazine |first1=Susan |last1=de Villiers |first2=Stefan |last2=Simanowitz |date=March 2012 |title=South Africa: The ANC at 100 |magazine=The Contemporary Review |volume=294 |issue=1704 |pages=39–45 |issn=0010-7565 |url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/1013463231 |id={{ProQuest|1013463231}} |via=ProQuest |quote=[A]ffirmative action and black economic empowerment were controversial and often misrepresented.
