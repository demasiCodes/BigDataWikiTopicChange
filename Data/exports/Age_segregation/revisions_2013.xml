Examples of institutionalized age segregation include [[age segregation in schools]] and [[age-segregated housing]].

'''Age segregation in schools''', '''age grading''', or '''graded education''' is the separation of [[student]]s into years of education ([[educational stages|grade]]s, [[form (education)|form]]s) by approximately the same [[Ageing|age]].

In the [[United States]], graded education was introduced during 1848 to 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Dean McClusky, ''Introduction of Grading into the Public Schools of New England, Part II'',The Elementary School Journal, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Oct., 1920), pp. 132-145&lt;/ref&gt;

Age grading in schools has significant impact on '''age segregation''' among [[adolescent]] [[peer group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/l7v2217501w40440/ SpringerLink - Journal Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
