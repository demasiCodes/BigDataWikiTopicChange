Examples of institutionalized age segregation include [[age segregation in schools]] and [[age-segregated housing]].

There are studies of informal age segregation among [[adolescent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/l7v2217501w40440/ SpringerLink - Journal Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=OiyN52CQgbcC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=%22age+segregation%22+adolescents&amp;source=web&amp;ots=d2dX349Neu&amp;sig=clyC0WKSkHUH_6Q3oLdzDMyr-qc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Age segregation in schools''', '''age grading''', or '''graded education''' is the separation of [[student]]s into years of education ([[educational stages|grade]]s, [[form (education)|form]]s) by approximately the same [[Ageing|age]].

In the [[United States]], graded education was introduced during 1848 to 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Dean McClusky, ''Introduction of Grading into the Public Schools of New England, Part II'',The Elementary School Journal, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Oct., 1920), pp. 132-145&lt;/ref&gt;

Age grading in schools has significant impact on '''age segregation''' among [[adolescent]] [[peer group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/l7v2217501w40440/ SpringerLink - Journal Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Age segregation in the U.S. was a product of industrialization, Western formal schooling, [[child labor]] laws, social services agencies, and the rise of disciplines such as Psychology and Education. A combination of these caused a shift from family working as a unit to separation of economic activities and childcare emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, B., Glida, M. and Chavajay, P. (2010). Children's Integration in Communities and Segregation From People of Differing Ages. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 5(4), pp.431-440&lt;/ref&gt; Some communities have different cultural practices and [[Child Integration|integrate children]] into mature activities of the family and community. This is common among Indigenous American communities.
