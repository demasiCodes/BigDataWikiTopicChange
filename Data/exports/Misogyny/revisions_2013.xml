'''Misogyny''' {{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|s|ɒ|dʒ|ɪ|n|i}} is the hatred or dislike of [[women]] or [[girls]]. Misogyny can be manifested in numerous ways, including [[sexual discrimination]], denigration of women, [[violence against women]], and [[sexual objectification]] of women.&lt;ref name=Code2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Code|first=Lorraine|title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-13274-6|edition=1st|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramarae2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Kramarae|first=Cheris|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92088-4|pages=1374–1377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misogyny has been characterised as a prominent feature of the mythologies of the ancient world as well as of various religions. In addition, many influential [[Western philosophy|Western philosophers]] have been described as misogynistic.&lt;ref name=Code2000/&gt; The counterpart of misogyny is [[misandry]], the hatred or dislike of men; the [[antonym]] of misogyny is [[philogyny]], the love or fondness of women.

==Definitions==
According to sociologist Allan G. Johnson, "misogyny is a cultural attitude of hatred for females because they are female." Johnson argues that:
{{quote|"Misogyny .... is a central part of sexist prejudice and ideology and, as such, is an important basis for the oppression of females in male-dominated societies. Misogyny is manifested in many different ways, from jokes to pornography to violence to the self-contempt women may be taught to feel toward their own bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=allan+johnson+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: A user's guide to sociological language | isbn = 978-0-631-21681-0 | author1 = Johnson | first1 = Allan G | year = 2000 | accessdate = November 21, 2011}}, ("ideology" in all small capitals in original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Michael Flood]] defines misogyny as the hatred of women, and notes:
{{quote|"Though most common in men, misogyny also exists in and is practiced by women against other women or even themselves. Misogyny functions as an ideology or belief system that has accompanied patriarchal, or male-dominated societies for thousands of years and continues to place women in subordinate positions with limited access to power and decision making. [...] Aristotle contended that women exist as natural deformities or imperfect males [...] Ever since, women in [[Western culture]]s have internalised their role as societal scapegoats, influenced in the twenty-first century by multimedia objectification of women with its culturally sanctioned self-loathing and fixations on plastic surgery, anorexia and bulimia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=michael+flood+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 978-0-415-33343-6 | author1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dictionaries define ''misogyny'' as 'hatred of women'&lt;ref&gt;''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press (Oxford Univ. Press), [4th] ed. 1993 (ISBN 0-19-861271-0)) (''SOED'') ("[h]atred of women").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin, 1992 (ISBN 0-395-44895-6)) ("[h]atred of women").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged'' (G. &amp; C.

== Classical Greece ==
[[File:Seated Euripides Louvre Ma343.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Euripides]]]]

In his book ''City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens'', J.W. Roberts argues that older than tragedy and comedy was a misogynistic tradition in Greek literature, reaching back at least as far as [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=73kTsV4FdrQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Sokrates+misogyny+misogynist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens | isbn = 978-0-203-19479-9 | author1 = Roberts | first1 = J.W | date = 2002-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Misogyny'' comes into English from the ancient Greek word, ''misogunia'' ({{lang|grc|μισογυνία}}), which survives in two passages.&lt;ref name="Liddell"&gt;[[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (''LSJ''), revised and augmented by Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940). ISBN 0-19-864226-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier, longer and more complete passage comes from a [[Stoicism|stoic]] philosopher called [[Antipater of Tarsus]] in a moral tract known as ''On Marriage'' (''c''. 150 BC).&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[editio princeps]]'' is on page 255 of volume three of ''[[Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta]]'' (''SVF'', Old Stoic Fragments), see [[Misogyny#External links|External links]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;A recent critical text with translation is in [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JlCnsyRBGf&amp;sig=7zsKzMVEBnV3tHag9z7E4cWCeLs&amp;hl=en Appendix A] to Will Deming, ''Paul on Marriage and Celibacy: The Hellenistic Background of 1 Corinthians 7'', pp. 221–226.

''Misogunia'' appears in the [[accusative case]] on page 224 of Deming, as the fifth word in line 33 of his Greek text.

It is split over lines 25–26 in von Arnim.&lt;/ref&gt; Antipater argues that marriage is the foundation of the state, and considers it to be based on divine ([[Polytheism|polytheistic]]) decree. Antipater uses ''misogunia'' to describe [[Euripides]]' usual writing—''tēn misogunian en tō graphein '' (τὴν μισογυνίαν ἐν τῷ γράφειν "the misogyny in the writing").&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

However, he mentions this by way of contrast. He goes on to quote Euripides at some length, writing in praise of wives. Antipater does not tell us what it is about Euripides' writing that he believes is misogynistic, he simply expresses his belief that even a man thought to hate women (namely Euripides) praises wives, so concluding his argument for the importance of marriage. He says, "This thing is truly heroic."&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

Euripides' reputation as a misogynist is known from another source. [[Athenaeus]], in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' or ''Banquet of the Learned'', has one of the diners quoting [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] who confirms the view was widespread, while offering [[Sophocles]]' comment on the matter.

{{quote|Euripides the poet, also, was much addicted to women: at all events Hieronymus in his Historical Commentaries speaks as follows,—"When some one told Sophocles that Euripides was a woman-hater, 'He may be,' said he, 'in his tragedies, but in his bed he is very fond of women.'"|Athenaeus|''Deipnosophists'', 2nd/3rd century.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''[[The Deipnosophists]]'', Book 13 [http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081202152211/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV3.p0080&amp;q1=hieronymus&amp;pview=hide Book 13]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite Euripides' reputation, Antipater is not the only writer to see appreciation of women in his writing. Katherine Henderson and Barbara McManus consider he "showed more empathy for women than any other ancient writer", citing "relatively modern critics" to support their claim.&lt;ref&gt;"Although Euripides showed more empathy for women than any other ancient writer, many of his lines out of context sound misogynistic; only relatively modern critics have been able to rescue him from his centuries-old reputation as a woman-hater." Katherine Usher Henderson and [http://www.cnr.edu/home/bmcmanus/ Barbara F. McManus], ''Half Humankind: Contexts and Texts of the Controversy about Women in England, 1540-1640'', ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1985), p. 6. ISBN 978-0-252-01174-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The other surviving use of the original Greek word is by [[Chrysippus]], in a fragment from ''On affections'', quoted by [[Galen]] in ''[[Hippocrates]] on Affections''.&lt;ref&gt;''SVF'' 3:103. ''Mysogyny'' is the first word on the page.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''misogyny'' is the first in a short list of three "disaffections"—women (''misogunian''), wine (''misoinian'', μισοινίαν) and humanity (''misanthrōpian'', μισανθρωπίαν).

Chrysippus' point is more abstract than Antipater's, and Galen quotes the passage as an example of an opinion contrary to his own. What is clear, however, is that he groups hatred of women with hatred of humanity generally, and even hatred of wine. "It was the prevailing medical opinion of his day that wine strengthens body and soul alike."&lt;ref name=Tieleman&gt;Teun L. Tieleman, ''[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=BBiw96gj8gkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chrysippus+on+affections&amp;sig=6f6Y84rR_VZzorWxiGfFMYViuvM Chrysippus' on Affections:] Reconstruction and Interpretations'', (Leiden: [[Brill Publishers]], 2003), p. 162. ISBN 90-04-12998-7&lt;/ref&gt;

So, as with his fellow stoic, Antipater, misogyny is viewed negatively, a [[disease]], a dislike of something that is good. It is this issue of conflicted or alternating emotions that was philosophically contentious to the ancient writers. Ricardo Salles suggests the general stoic view was that, "A man may not only alternate between philogyny and misogyny, philanthropy and misanthropy, but be prompted to each by the other."&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Salles, ''Metaphysics, Soul, and Ethics in Ancient Thought: Themes from the Work of Richard Sorabji'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005), 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]

[[Aristotle]] has also been accused of being a misogynist; He has written that women were inferior to men. For example, to cite Cynthia Freeland's catalogue: "Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that "matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful;" that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or "as it were, a deformity": which contributes only matter and not form to the generation of offspring; that in general "a woman is perhaps an inferior being"; that female characters in a tragedy will be inappropriate if they are too brave or too clever" (Freeland 1994: 145-46)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/#Mis |title=Feminist History of Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic'', Nickolas Pappas describes the "problem of misogyny" and states

{{quote|"In the ''Apology'', Socrates calls those who plead for their lives in court "no better than women" (35b)... The ''Timaeus'' warns men that if they live immorally they will be reincarnated as women (42b-c; cf. 75d-e). The ''Republic'' contains a number of comments in the same spirit (387e, 395d-e, 398e, 431b-c, 469d), evidence of nothing so much as of contempt toward women. Even Socrates' words for his bold new proposal about marriage... suggest that the women are to be "held in common" by men. He never says that the men might be held in common by the women... We also have to acknowledge Socrates' insistence that men surpass women at any task that both sexes attempt (455c, 456a), and his remark in Book 8 that one sign of democracy's moral failure is the sexual equality it promotes (563b)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=VujWajIWxkUC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Socrates+misogyny+misogynist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic | isbn = 978-0-415-29996-1 | author1 = Pappas | first1 = Nickolas | date = 2003-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Misogynist'' is also found in the Greek—''misogunēs'' ({{lang|grc|μισογύνης}})—in ''Deipnosophistae'' (above) and in [[Plutarch]]'s ''Parallel Lives'', where it is used as the title of [[Heracles]] in the history of [[Phocion]].

It was also the title of a play by [[Menander]], which we know of from book seven (concerning [[Alexandria]]) of [[Strabo]]'s 17 volume ''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'',&lt;ref name=Liddell /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]],''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'', Book 7 [Alexandria] Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and quotations of Menander by [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Stobaeus]] that relate to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Menander]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=JC11wYBkrhkC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=The+Misogynist+(Misogynes)&amp;sig=y98In1TUseOWVGHrcOOMQ0Vx1dU ''The Plays and Fragments''], translated by Maurice Balme, contributor Peter Brown{{disambiguation needed|{{subst:DATE}}|date=December 2011}}, [[Oxford University Press]], 2002. ISBN 0-19-283983-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Menander also wrote a play called ''Misoumenos'' (Μισούμενος) or ''The Man (She) Hated''. Another Greek play with a similar name, ''Misogunos'' (Μισόγυνος) or ''Woman-hater'', is reported by Cicero (in Latin) and attributed to [[Atilia (gens)#Members of the gens#Marcus Atilius|(Marcus) Atilius (poet)]].&lt;ref&gt;He is supported (or followed) by [[Theognostus the Grammarian]]'s 9th century ''Canones'', edited by [[John Antony Cramer]], ''Anecdota Graeca e codd. manuscriptis bibliothecarum Oxoniensium'', vol. 2, ([[Oxford University Press]], 1835), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] reports that Greek philosophers considered misogyny to be caused by [[gynophobia]], a fear of women.&lt;ref name="Cicero"&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', Book 3, Chapter 11. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[A Greek-English Lexicon|LSJ]]'' typo has Book 4]&lt;/ref&gt; The context is worth quoting in full, because it deals directly with matters already discussed in this article.

{{quote|It is the same with other diseases; as the desire of glory, a passion for women, to which the Greeks give the name of ''philogyneia'': and thus all other diseases and sicknesses are generated.

In summary, Greek literature considered misogyny to be a [[disease]], an [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] condition, in that it ran contrary to their perceptions of the value of women as wives, and of the family as the foundation of society. These points are widely noted in the secondary literature.&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

== In legislation ==
[[Petty treason]] in [[England|English]] [[common law]] included the murder of a husband by his wife, but not the murder of a wife by her husband.

Female criminals were also more likely to be [[burned at the stake]] as opposed to being hanged during execution.

===Ancient Greek===
In ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', Jack Holland sees evidence of misogyny in the [[mythology]] of the ancient world. In [[Greek mythology]] according to Hesiod, the human race had already existed before the creation of women — a peaceful, autonomous existence as a companion to the gods. When [[Prometheus]] decides to steal the secret of fire from the gods, [[Zeus]] becomes infuriated and decides to punish humankind with an "evil thing for their delight" — [[Pandora]], the first woman, who carried a jar (usually described — incorrectly — as a box) she was told to never open. [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]] (the brother of Prometheus) is overwhelmed by her beauty, disregards Prometheus' warnings about her, and marries her. Pandora cannot resist peeking into the jar, and by opening it all evil is unleashed into the world — [[childbirth|labour]], [[Illness|sickness]], [[old age]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J: "Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice," pp. 12-13. Avalon Publishing Group, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Women in Buddhism}}
In his book ''The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender'', professor Bernard Faure of [[Columbia University]] argued generally that "Buddhism is paradoxically neither as sexist nor as egalitarian as is usually thought." He remarked, "Many feminist scholars have emphasized the misogynistic (or at least androcentric) nature of Buddhism." He emphasised that Buddhism morally exalts its male monks while the mothers and wives of the monks also have important roles. He wrote as well:
{{quote|"While some scholars see Buddhism as part of a movement of emancipation, others see it as a source of oppression. Perhaps this is only a distinction between optimists and pessimists, if not between idealists and realists... As we begin to realize, the term "Buddhism" does not designate a monolithic entity, but covers a number of doctrines, ideologies, and practices--some of which seem to invite, tolerate, and even cultivate "otherness" on their margins".&lt;ref name=bernard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7538.html |title=Sample Chapter for Faure, B.: The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender |publisher=Press.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Judaism===
Jack Holland also sees evidence of misogyny in the Old Testament story of the [[Fall of Man]] from the [[Book of Genesis]]. In ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', he characterizes the Fall of Man as "a myth that blames woman for the ills and sufferings of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Jack|title=Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice|year=2006|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York|isbn=0-7867-1823-4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Original Sin]].)

Rabbis explaining the two biblical accounts of the creation of man explained that before God created Eve, he created Lilith as Adam’s first wife. Lilith was created along with Adam and formed from the earth, just as he had been; however,
God used filth and sediment instead of pure dust to create her.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves and Raphael Patai, Hebrew Myths: The Book of Genesis, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;
Adam and Lilith never had a harmonious relationship because she often
challenged his authority. Lilith took offense to having to lie beneath
Adam during sexual intercourse, often retorting, ‘Why must I lie
beneath you, I was also made of dust, and am therefore your equal.’
Lilith eventually deserts Adam and becomes a demoness who from her
union with Adam produces innumerable demons who continue to
plague mankind. As the story goes, Yahweh later avoids the problem
of a woman’s defiance and claim of equality by creating Eve from
Adam’s rib, an insignificant part of the human anatomy.

Besides the creation of Eve from Adam’s rib establishing male
authority, the Bible further establishes this relationship through Eve’s role in the
temptation of Adam and the “fall of man.” After eating fruit from the
forbidden Tree of Knowledge, Yahweh asks Adam if he had eaten the
fruit and Adam replies, ‘Eve gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.’
God then curses Eve, saying ‘I will multiply your labour and sorrow;
you will bear children in pain; you will yearn for your husband, and be
ruled by him! Eve’s action introduced death into the world of humanity, 
but she also convinced the other animals to partake
of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and initiated death into their
world as well. Eve is the Hebrew version of the Greek Pandora.
Unlike all the other religions of the area Judaism lacked female angels
and priestesses thereby disavowing any notion of divine femininity or
power derived therefrom.

Bible archaeologist and priest Roland de Vaux relates:
The social and legal position of an Israelite wife was inferior to the
position a wife occupied in the great countries round about. . . . A
husband could divorce his wife . . . women on the other hand could
not ask for a divorce . . . the wife addressed her husband Ba’al or
master; she also called him adon or lord; she addressed him in fact as
a slave addressed his master or subject, his king. The Decalogue
includes a man’s wife among his possessions . . . all her life she
remains a minor. The wife does not inherit from her husband, nor
daughters from their father, except when there is no male heir.&lt;ref&gt;Roland de Vaux, Ancient Israel, quoted in Stone, When God was a Woman, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in tradition and interpretations of scripture have caused sects of Christianity to differ in their beliefs with regard misogyny.

Katharine M. Rogers in ''The Troublesome Helpmate'' alleges [[Christianity]] to be misogynistic, listing what she says are specific examples from the [[New Testament]] [[Pauline epistles|letters]] of the Christian apostle [[Paul of Tarsus]]. She argues that the legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called "Fathers" of the Church, like [[Tertullian]], who thought a woman was not only "the gateway of the devil" but also "a temple built over a sewer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=clOT7Hg2CfAC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=christian+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=christian%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = Feminist literary studies: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-521-39852-7 | author1 = Ruthven | first1 = K. K | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers states:

Other scholars, however, have argued that Christianity does or should not include misogynistic principles. David M. Scholer, a Biblical scholar at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], stated that the verse Galatians 3:28 ("There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.") is "the fundamental Pauline theological basis for the inclusion of women and men as equal and mutual partners in all of the ministries of the church."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbmw.org/Journal/Vol-8-No-1/Galatians-3-28-Prooftext-or-Context ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hove, Richard.

===Islam===
{{Main|Islam and women}}
{{See also|Namus|Islam and domestic violence}}

The fourth chapter (or ''[[sura]]'') of the [[Qur'an]] is called Women ([[An-Nisa]]). The 34th verse is a key verse in feminist criticism of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;"Verse 34 of Chapter 4 is an oft-cited Verse in the Qur’an used to demonstrate that Islam is structurally patriarchal, and thus Islam internalizes male dominance."
Dahlia Eissa, "[http://www.wluml.org/node/443#_ftn42 Constructing the Notion of Male Superiority over Women in Islam]: The influence of sex and gender stereotyping in the interpretation of the Qur’an and the implications for a modernist exegesis of rights", Occasional Paper 11 in ''Occasional Papers'' (Empowerment International, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
The verse reads: "Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great."

Taj Hashmi discusses misogyny in relation to Muslim culture, and [[Bangladesh]] specifically, in the book ''Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh''.

{{quote|[T]hanks to the subjective interpretations of the Quran (almost exclusively by men), the preponderance of the misogynic mullahs and the regressive Shariah law in most “Muslim” countries, Islam is synonymously known as a promoter of misogyny in its worst form. Although there is no way of defending the so-called “great” traditions of Islam as libertarian and egalitarian with regard to women, we may draw a line between the Quranic texts and the corpus of avowedly misogynic writing and spoken words by the mullah having very little or no relevance to the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Hashmi, Taj.

In a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, Asra Q. Nomani discussed [[An-Nisa, 34]] and stated that "Domestic violence is prevalent today in non-Muslim communities as well, but the apparent religious sanction in Islam makes the challenge especially difficult." She further wrote that although "Islamic historians agree that the prophet Muhammad never hit a woman, it is also clear that Muslim communities face a domestic violence problem." Nomani notes that in his book ''[[No god but God]]'', [[University of Southern California]] professor [[Reza Aslan]] wrote that "misogynistic interpretation" has dogged An-Nisa, 34 because Koranic commentary "has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men."&lt;ref name=issue&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261.html|publisher=Washington Post|title=Clothes Aren't the Issue|date=October 22, 2006|first=Asra Q.|last=Nomani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[L. Ron Hubbard]] wrote the following passages in his 1965 book ''Scientology: A New Slant on Life'':
{{quote|"A society in which women are taught anything but the management of a family, the care of men, and the creation of the future generation is a society which is on its way out."&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}
{{quote|"The historian can peg the point where a society begins its sharpest decline at the instant when women begin to take part, on an equal footing with men, in political and business affairs, since this means that the men are decadent and the women are no longer women.

===Weininger===
[[Otto Weininger]] has been accused of misogyny in his book ''[[Sex and Character]]'', in which he characterizes the "woman" part of each individual as being essentially "nothing," and having no real existence, having no effective consciousness or rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Izenberg |first=Gerald N. |year=2001 | month = June |title=Review of Chandak Sengoopta's Otto Weininger: Sex, Science, and Self in Imperial Vienna | journal = The American Historical Review | volume = 106 | issue = 3 |pages=1074–1075| doi = 10.2307/2692497 |publisher=The American Historical Review, Vol. 106, No. 3 |last2=Sengoopta |first2=Chandak | jstor=2692497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schopenhauer===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] has been accused of misogyny for his essay "On Women" (Über die Weiber), in which he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" on female affairs. He claimed that "woman is by nature meant to obey." He also noted that "Men are by nature merely indifferent to one another; but women are by nature enemies."

===Nietzsche===
{{Main|Friedrich Nietzsche's views on women}}
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] stated that every higher form of civilization implied stricter controls on women (''[[Beyond Good and Evil (book)|Beyond Good and Evil]]'', 7:238).

{{quote|"Women are capable of education, but they are not made for activities which demand a universal faculty such as the more advanced sciences, philosophy and certain forms of artistic production... Women regulate their actions not by the demands of universality, but by arbitrary inclinations and opinions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=rJqm5iQcsqoC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Hegel+misogyny+misogynistic#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Feminist reflections on the history of philosophy | isbn = 978-1-4020-2488-7 | author1 = Alanen | first1 = Lilli | last2 = Witt | first2 = Charlotte | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; G.W.F Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', quoted in Alanen, Lilli and Witt, Charlotte, ''Feminist reflections on the history of philosophy'''}}

==Feminist theory==
In the late 20th century, [[second wave feminism]] theorists claimed that misogyny is both a cause and result of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] social structures.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Kate Millet's ''Sexual Politics'', adapted from her doctoral dissertation is normally cited as the originator of this viewpoint; though Katharine M Rogers had also published similar ideas previously.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional feminist theorists{{Who|date=April 2012}} describe many different attitudes as misogyny. According to feminists,{{Who|date=April 2012}} in its most overt expression, a misogynist will openly hate all women simply because they are female.

In [[feminist theory]],{{clarify|date=April 2012}} other forms of misogyny may be less overt. Some misogynists may simply be prejudiced against all women, or may hate women who do not fall into one or more acceptable categories. Subscribers to one model claim that some misogynists think in terms of the [[Madonna-whore complex|mother/whore dichotomy]], where they hold that women can only be "mothers" or "whores." Another variant model is the one alleging that certain men think in terms of a [[virgin]]/whore dichotomy, in which women who do not adhere to an Abrahamic standard of moral purity are considered "whores".{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

The term ''misogynist'' is frequently used in a looser sense as a term of derision to describe anyone who is considered to hold a prejudiced view about women as a group. Therefore, someone like [[Schopenhauer]] who proposes that women are naturally subservient to men, has been criticised by some scholars{{who|date=April 2012}} as a misogynist. As another example, a man who is considered by many to be a "womanizer", is often regarded as being misogynist. Examples of this type of man would be [[Giacomo Casanova]] and [[Don Juan]], who were both reputed to have had many libertine affairs with women.

In feminist theory,{{clarify|date=April 2012}} misogyny is a negative attitude towards women as a group, and so need not fully determine a misogynist's attitude towards each individual woman. The fact that someone holds misogynist views may not prevent him or her from having positive relationships with some women. Conversely, simply having negative relationships with some women does not necessarily mean someone holds misogynistic views. The term, like most negative descriptions of attitudes, is applied to a wide variety of behaviors and attitudes.

Feminist theorist [[Marilyn Frye]] claims that misogyny is [[Phallogocentrism|phallogocentric]] and [[homoerotic]] at its root. In ''Politics of Reality'', Frye analyzes the alleged misogyny characteristic of the fiction and Christian apologetics of [[C.S. Lewis]]. Frye argues that such misogyny privileges the masculine as a subject of erotic attention. She compares the alleged misogyny characteristic of Lewis' ideal of gender relations to underground [[male prostitution]] rings, which allegedly share the quality of men seeking to dominate subjects seen as less likely to take on submissive roles by a patriarchal society, but in both cases doing so as a theatrical mockery of women.&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Marilyn. ''The Politics of Reality: Essays in Feminist Theory''. Trumansburg, NY: Crossing, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparing misogyny with [[misandry]], sociologist [[Michael Flood]], at the [[University of Wollongong]], has argued that "[[misandry]] lacks the systemic, transhistoric, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny.",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=michael+flood+misandry#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misandry&amp;f=false | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 978-0-415-33343-6 | author1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Dr. [[Warren Farrell]] and others point out that almost universally, men have been considered the 'disposable' gender, and that misandry has likewise been embodied in all cultures for all times, as for example by society's willingness to force men but not women to serve as soldiers to defend their culture when it comes under military attack. 

[[Camille Paglia]],&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille (1991). ''[[Sexual Personae]]'', NY:Vintage, Chapter 1 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; a self-described "dissident feminist" who has often been at odds with other academic feminists, argues that the Marxist-inspired interpretation of misogyny so prevalent in second-wave feminism is seriously flawed. In contrast, Paglia argues that a close reading of historical texts find that men do not ''hate'' women but ''fear'' them.
