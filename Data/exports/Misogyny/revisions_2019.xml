'''Misogyny''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|s|ɒ|dʒ|ɪ|n|i}}) is the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against [[Woman|women]] or [[girl]]s. Misogyny manifests in numerous ways, including [[social exclusion]], [[sex discrimination]], [[hostility]], [[androcentrism]], [[patriarchy]], [[male privilege]], belittling of women, disenfranchisement of women, [[violence against women]], and [[sexual objectification]].&lt;ref name=Code2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Code|first=Lorraine|title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-13274-9|edition=1st|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramarae2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Kramarae|first=Cheris|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-92088-9|pages=1374–1377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misogyny can be found within [[Religious text|sacred texts]] of [[religion]]s, [[Mythology|mythologies]], and [[Western philosophy]]&lt;ref name=Code2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clack1999 /&gt; and [[Eastern philosophy]].

The inverse is [[misandry]]; the hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against men or boys.

According to sociologist Allan G. Johnson, "misogyny is a cultural attitude of hatred for females because they are female". Johnson argues that:
{{quote|Misogyny .... is a central part of sexist prejudice and ideology and, as such, is an important basis for the [[oppression]] of females in male-dominated societies. Misogyny is manifested in many different ways, from jokes to pornography to violence to the self-contempt women may be taught to feel toward their own bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=allan+johnson+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: A user's guide to sociological language | isbn = 978-0-631-21681-0 | author1 = Johnson | first1 = Allan G | year = 2000 | accessdate = November 21, 2011}}, ("ideology" in all small capitals in original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sociologist [[Michael Flood]] at the [[University of Wollongong]] defines misogyny as the hatred of women, and notes:
{{quote|Though most common in men, misogyny also exists in and is practiced by women against other women or even themselves. Misogyny functions as an ideology or belief system that has accompanied patriarchal, or male-dominated societies for thousands of years and continues to place women in subordinate positions with limited access to power and decision making. […] Aristotle contended that women exist as natural deformities or imperfect males […] Ever since, women in [[Western culture]]s have internalised their role as societal scapegoats, influenced in the twenty-first century by multimedia objectification of women with its culturally sanctioned self-loathing and fixations on plastic surgery, anorexia and bulimia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=michael+flood+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 978-0-415-33343-6 | author1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = July 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dictionaries define misogyny as "hatred of women"&lt;ref&gt;''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press (Oxford Univ. Press), [4th] ed. 1993 ({{ISBN|0-19-861271-0}})) (''SOED'') ("[h]atred of women").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin, 1992 ({{ISBN|0-395-44895-6}})) ("[h]atred of women").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged'' (G. &amp; C.

== Historical usage ==

=== Classical Greece ===
[[File:Seated Euripides Louvre Ma343.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Euripides]]]]

In his book ''City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens'', J.W. Roberts argues that older than tragedy and comedy was a misogynistic tradition in Greek literature, reaching back at least as far as [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=73kTsV4FdrQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Sokrates+misogyny+misogynist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens | isbn = 978-0-203-19479-9 | author1 = Roberts | first1 = J.W | date = 2002-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''misogyny'' itself comes directly into English from the Ancient Greek word ''misogunia'' ({{lang|grc|μισογυνία}}), which survives in several passages.

The earlier, longer, and more complete passage comes from a moral tract known as ''On Marriage'' (''c''. 150 BC) by the [[Stoicism|stoic]] philosopher [[Antipater of Tarsus]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[editio princeps]]'' is on page 255 of volume three of ''[[Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta]]'' (''SVF'', Old Stoic Fragments), see [[Misogyny#External links|External links]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;A recent critical text with translation is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JlCnsyRBGf&amp;sig=7zsKzMVEBnV3tHag9z7E4cWCeLs&amp;hl=en Appendix A] to Will Deming, ''Paul on Marriage and Celibacy: The Hellenistic Background of 1 Corinthians 7'', pp. 221–226.

''Misogunia'' appears in the [[accusative case]] on page 224 of Deming, as the fifth word in line 33 of his Greek text.
It is split over lines 25–26 in von Arnim.&lt;/ref&gt; Antipater argues that marriage is the foundation of the state, and considers it to be based on divine ([[Polytheism|polytheistic]]) decree. He uses ''misogunia'' to describe the sort of writing the tragedian [[Euripides]] eschews, stating that he "reject[s] the hatred of women in his writing" (ἀποθέμενος τὴν ἐν τῷ γράφειν μισογυνίαν).  He then offers an example of this, quoting from a lost play of Euripides in which the merits of a dutiful wife are praised.&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;38-43, fr. 63, in von Arnim, J. (ed.). ''Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta.'' Vol. 3. Leipzig: Teubner, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The other surviving use of the original Greek word is by [[Chrysippus]], in a fragment from ''On affections'', quoted by [[Galen]] in ''[[Hippocrates]] on Affections''.&lt;ref&gt;''SVF'' 3:103. ''Misogyny'' is the first word on the page.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''misogyny'' is the first in a short list of three "disaffections"—women (''misogunia''), wine (''misoinia'', μισοινία) and humanity (''misanthrōpia'', μισανθρωπία). Chrysippus' point is more abstract than Antipater's, and Galen quotes the passage as an example of an opinion contrary to his own. What is clear, however, is that he groups hatred of women with hatred of humanity generally, and even hatred of wine. "It was the prevailing medical opinion of his day that wine strengthens body and soul alike."&lt;ref name=Tieleman&gt;Teun L. Tieleman, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BBiw96gj8gkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chrysippus+on+affections&amp;sig=6f6Y84rR_VZzorWxiGfFMYViuvM Chrysippus' on Affections:] Reconstruction and Interpretations'', (Leiden: [[Brill Publishers]], 2003), p. 162. {{ISBN|90-04-12998-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; So Chrysippus, like his fellow stoic Antipater, views misogyny negatively, as a [[disease]]; a dislike of something that is good. It is this issue of conflicted or alternating emotions that was philosophically contentious to the ancient writers. Ricardo Salles suggests that the general stoic view was that "[a] man may not only alternate between philogyny and misogyny, philanthropy and misanthropy, but be prompted to each by the other."&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Salles, ''Metaphysics, Soul, and Ethics in Ancient Thought: Themes from the Work of Richard Sorabji'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005), 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] has also been accused of being a misogynist; he has written that women were inferior to men. According to [[Cynthia Freeland]] (1994):

{{quote|Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity': which contributes only matter and not form to the generation of offspring; that in general 'a woman is perhaps an inferior being'; that female characters in a tragedy will be inappropriate if they are too brave or too clever[.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/#Mis |title=Feminist History of Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic'', Nickolas Pappas describes the "problem of misogyny" and states:

{{quote|In the ''Apology'', Socrates calls those who plead for their lives in court "no better than women" (35b)... The ''Timaeus'' warns men that if they live immorally they will be reincarnated as women (42b-c; cf. 75d-e). The ''Republic'' contains a number of comments in the same spirit (387e, 395d-e, 398e, 431b-c, 469d), evidence of nothing so much as of contempt toward women. Even Socrates' words for his bold new proposal about marriage... suggest that the women are to be "held in common" by men. He never says that the men might be held in common by the women... We also have to acknowledge Socrates' insistence that men surpass women at any task that both sexes attempt (455c, 456a), and his remark in Book 8 that one sign of democracy's moral failure is the sexual equality it promotes (563b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=VujWajIWxkUC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Socrates+misogyny+misogynist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic | isbn = 978-0-415-29996-1 | author1 = Pappas | first1 = Nickolas | date = 2003-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Misogynist'' is also found in the Greek—''misogunēs'' ({{lang|grc|μισογύνης}})—in ''Deipnosophistae'' (above) and in [[Plutarch]]'s ''Parallel Lives'', where it is used as the title of [[Heracles]] in the history of [[Phocion]]. It was the title of a play by [[Menander]], which we know of from book seven (concerning [[Alexandria]]) of [[Strabo]]'s 17 volume ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'',&lt;ref name="Liddell"&gt;[[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'' (''LSJ''), revised and augmented by Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940). {{ISBN|0-19-864226-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]],''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'', Book 7 [Alexandria] Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and quotations of Menander by [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Stobaeus]] that relate to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Menander]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JC11wYBkrhkC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=The+Misogynist+(Misogynes)&amp;sig=y98In1TUseOWVGHrcOOMQ0Vx1dU ''The Plays and Fragments''], translated by Maurice Balme, contributor [[Peter G. McC. Brown|Peter Brown]], [[Oxford University Press]], 2002. {{ISBN|0-19-283983-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Greek play with a similar name, ''Misogunos'' (Μισόγυνος) or ''Woman-hater'', is reported by [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (in Latin) and attributed to the poet [[Atilia (gens)#Members of the gens|Marcus Atilius]].&lt;ref&gt;He is supported (or followed) by [[Theognostus the Grammarian]]'s 9th century ''Canones'', edited by [[John Antony Cramer]], ''Anecdota Graeca e codd. manuscriptis bibliothecarum Oxoniensium'', vol. 2, ([[Oxford University Press]], 1835), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
Cicero reports that Greek philosophers considered misogyny to be caused by [[gynophobia]], a fear of women.&lt;ref name="Cicero"&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', Book 4, Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is the same with other diseases; as the desire of glory, a passion for women, to which the Greeks give the name of ''philogyneia'': and thus all other diseases and sicknesses are generated. But those feelings which are the contrary of these are supposed to have fear for their foundation, as a hatred of women, such as is displayed in the ''Woman-hater'' of Atilius; or the hatred of the whole human species, as Timon is reported to have done, whom they call the Misanthrope. Of the same kind is inhospitality. And all these diseases proceed from a certain dread of such things as they hate and avoid.&lt;ref name="Cicero" /&gt;|Cicero|''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', 1st century BC.}}

In summary, Greek literature considered misogyny to be a [[disease]]—an [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] condition—in that it ran contrary to their perceptions of the value of women as wives and of the family as the foundation of society. These points are widely noted in the secondary literature.&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt;

=== Ancient Greek ===
In ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', [[Jack Holland (writer)|Jack Holland]] argues that there is evidence of misogyny in the [[mythology]] of the ancient world. In [[Greek mythology]] according to Hesiod, the human race had already experienced a peaceful, autonomous existence as a companion to the gods before the creation of women. When [[Prometheus]] decides to steal the secret of fire from the gods, [[Zeus]] becomes infuriated and decides to punish humankind with an "evil thing for their delight". This "evil thing" is [[Pandora]], the first woman, who carried a jar (usually described—incorrectly—as a box) which she was told to never open. [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]] (the brother of Prometheus) is overwhelmed by her beauty, disregards Prometheus' warnings about her, and marries her. Pandora cannot resist peeking into the jar, and by opening it she unleashes into the world all evil; [[childbirth|labour]], [[Illness|sickness]], [[old age]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J: ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', pp. 12–13. Avalon Publishing Group, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main article|Women in Buddhism}}
In his book ''The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender'', professor Bernard Faure of [[Columbia University]] argued generally that "Buddhism is paradoxically neither as sexist nor as egalitarian as is usually thought." He remarked, "Many feminist scholars have emphasized the misogynistic (or at least androcentric) nature of Buddhism" and stated that Buddhism morally exalts its male monks while the mothers and wives of the monks also have important roles. Additionally, he wrote:
{{quote|While some scholars see Buddhism as part of a movement of emancipation, others see it as a source of oppression. Perhaps this is only a distinction between optimists and pessimists, if not between idealists and realists... As we begin to realize, the term "Buddhism" does not designate a monolithic entity, but covers a number of doctrines, ideologies, and practices--some of which seem to invite, tolerate, and even cultivate "otherness" on their margins.&lt;ref name=bernard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7538.html |title=Sample Chapter for Faure, B.: The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender |publisher=Press.princeton.edu |accessdate=2013-10-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005011657/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7538.html |archivedate=2013-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Differences in tradition and interpretations of scripture have caused sects of Christianity to differ in their beliefs with regard their treatment of women.

In ''The Troublesome Helpmate'', Katharine M. Rogers argues that Christianity is misogynistic, and she lists what she says are specific examples of misogyny in the [[Pauline epistles]]. She states:

{{quote|The foundations of early Christian misogyny — its guilt about sex, its insistence on female subjection, its dread of female seduction — are all in St. Paul's epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katharine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In K. K. Ruthven's ''Feminist Literary Studies: An Introduction'', Ruthven makes reference to Rogers' book and argues that the "legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called 'Fathers' of the Church, like [[Tertullian]], who thought a woman was not only 'the gateway of the devil' but also 'a temple built over a sewer'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=clOT7Hg2CfAC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=christian+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=christian%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = Feminist literary studies: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-521-39852-7 | author1 = Ruthven | first1 = K.

However, some other scholars have argued that Christianity does not include misogynistic principles, or at least that a proper interpretation of Christianity would not include misogynistic principles. David M. Scholer, a biblical scholar at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], stated that the verse Galatians 3:28 ("There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus") is "the fundamental Pauline theological basis for the inclusion of women and men as equal and mutual partners in all of the ministries of the church."&lt;ref name=CBMW&gt;{{cite web|title=Galatians 3:28 – prooftext or context?|url=http://cbmw.org/staff/|publisher=The council on biblical manhood and womanhood|accessdate= January 6, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206045217/http://cbmw.org/staff/|archivedate= February 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hove, Richard. ''Equality in Christ? Galatians 3:28 and the Gender Dispute'' (Wheaton: Crossway, 1999), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Equality in Christ? Galatians 3:28 and the Gender Dispute'', Richard Hove argues that—while Galatians 3:28 does mean that one's sex does not affect salvation—"there remains a pattern in which the wife is to emulate the church's submission to Christ ({{bibleverse||Eph|5:21-33|KJV}}) and the husband is to emulate Christ's love for the church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=WcyqvWfJnyYC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=ken+campbell+3:28+Rochard+Hove#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Marriage and family in the biblical world | isbn = 978-0-8308-2737-4 | author1 = Campbell | first1 = Ken M | date = October 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Christian Men Who Hate Women'', clinical psychologist Margaret J. Rinck has written that Christian social culture often allows a misogynist "misuse of the biblical ideal of submission". However, she argues that this a distortion of the "healthy relationship of mutual submission" which is actually specified in Christian doctrine, where "[l]ove is based on a deep, mutual respect as the guiding principle behind all decisions, actions, and plans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christian Men Who Hate Women: Healing Hurting Relationships|first=Margaret J.|last=Rinck

=== Islam ===
{{Main article|Women in Islam}}
{{See also|Namus|Islam and domestic violence}}

The fourth chapter (or ''[[sura]]'') of the [[Quran]] is called "Women" ([[An-Nisa]]). The [[An-Nisa, 34|34th verse]] is a key verse in feminist criticism of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;"Verse 34 of Chapter 4 is an oft-cited Verse in the Qur'an used to demonstrate that Islam is structurally patriarchal, and thus Islam internalizes male dominance."
Dahlia Eissa, "[http://www.wluml.org/node/443#_ftn42 Constructing the Notion of Male Superiority over Women in Islam]: The influence of sex and gender stereotyping in the interpretation of the Qur'an and the implications for a modernist exegesis of rights", Occasional Paper 11 in ''Occasional Papers'' (Empowerment International, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
The verse reads: "Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great."

In his book ''Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh'', Taj Hashmi discusses misogyny in relation to Muslim culture (and to [[Bangladesh]] in particular), writing:

{{quote|[T]hanks to the subjective interpretations of the Quran (almost exclusively by men), the preponderance of the misogynic mullahs and the regressive Shariah law in most "Muslim" countries, Islam is synonymously known as a promoter of misogyny in its worst form. Although there is no way of defending the so-called "great" traditions of Islam as libertarian and egalitarian with regard to women, we may draw a line between the Quranic texts and the corpus of avowedly misogynic writing and spoken words by the mullah having very little or no relevance to the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Hashmi, Taj.

In his book ''[[No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam|No god but God]]'', [[University of Southern California]] professor [[Reza Aslan]] wrote that "misogynistic interpretation" has been persistently attached to An-Nisa, 34 because commentary on the Quran "has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men".&lt;ref name=issue&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261.html|newspaper=Washington Post|title=Clothes Aren't the Issue|date=October 22, 2006|first=Asra Q.|last=Nomani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Scientology: A New Slant on Life'', [[L. Ron Hubbard]] wrote the following passage:
{{quote|A society in which women are taught anything but the management of a family, the care of men, and the creation of the [[future generation]] is a society which is on its way out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

In the same book, he also wrote:

{{quote|The historian can peg the point where a society begins its sharpest decline at the instant when women begin to take part, on an equal footing with men, in political and business affairs, since this means that the men are decadent and the women are no longer women. This is not a sermon on the role or position of women; it is a statement of bald and basic fact.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

These passages, along with other ones of a similar nature from Hubbard, have been criticised by Alan Scherstuhl of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' as expressions of hatred towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Church of Scientology does not want you to see L.

Gordon Melton]] has written that Hubbard later disregarded and abrogated much of his earlier views about women, which Melton views as merely echoes of common prejudices at the time. Melton has also stated that the [[Church of Scientology]] welcomes both genders equally at all levels—from leadership positions to [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] and so on—since Scientologists view people as [[Thetan|spiritual beings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Scientology/Ethics-Morality-Community/Gender-and-Sexuality.html |title=Gender and Sexuality |publisher=Patheos.com |date=2012-07-26 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misogynistic ideas among prominent western thinkers ==
Numerous influential [[Western philosophy|Western philosophers]] have been expressed ideas that can be characterized as misogynistic, including [[Aristotle's views on women|Aristotle]], [[René Descartes]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Otto Weininger]], [[Oswald Spengler]], and [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]].&lt;ref name=Clack1999&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clack|first1=Beverley|title=Misogyny in the Western Philosophical Tradition: A Reader|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-92182-4|pages=95–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the influence of these thinkers, feminist scholars trace misogyny in western culture to these philosophers and their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Witt|first=Charlotte|title=Feminist History of Philosophy|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/feminism-femhist/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-08-21|last2=Shapiro|first2=Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aristotle ===
Aristotle believed women were inferior and described them as "deformed males".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Spring 2016|title = Feminist History of Philosophy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/feminism-femhist/|date = 2016-01-01|first = Charlotte|last = Witt|first2 = Lisa|last2 = Shapiro|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 467–478"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plato and Aristotle on the Nature of Women|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236725862|journal = Journal of the History of Philosophy|pages = 467–478|volume = 21|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/hph.1983.0090|first = Nicholas D.|last = Smith|year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''Politics'', he states 

&lt;blockquote&gt;as regards the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject 4 (1254b13-14).&lt;ref name="Smith 467–478"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is ''Cynthia's catalog'' where Cynthia states "Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Aristotle believed that men and women naturally differed both physically and mentally. He claimed that women are "more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive ... more compassionate[,] ... more easily moved to tears[,] ... more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike[,] ... more prone to despondency and less hopeful[,] ... more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, of more retentive memory [and] ... also more wakeful; more shrinking [and] more difficult to rouse to action" than men.&lt;ref&gt;History of Animals, 608b. 1–14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] is well known for his views against equal rights for women for example in his treatise ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'', he writes: "Always justify the burdens you impose upon girls but impose them anyway... . They must be thwarted from an early age... . They must be exercised to constraint, so that it costs them nothing to stifle all their fantasies to submit them to the will of others." Other quotes consist of "closed up in their houses", "must receive the decisions of fathers and husbands like that of the church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Rousseau and Feminist Revision|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241893904|journal = Eighteenth-Century Life|pages = 51–54|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1215/00982601-2010-012|first = C.|last = Blum|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arthur Schopenhauer ===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] has been noted as a misogynist by many such as the philosopher, critic, and author Tom Grimwood.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Limits of Misogyny: Schopenhauer, "On Women"|url = http://philpapers.org/rec/GRITLO|journal = Kritike: An Online Journal of Philosophy|date = 2008-01-01|pages = 131–145|volume = 2|issue = 2|first = Tom|last = Grimwood|doi=10.3860/krit.v2i2.854}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 article Grimwood wrote published in the philosophical journal of ''Kritique,'' Grimwood argues that Schopenhauer's misogynistic works have largely escaped attention despite being more noticeable than those of other philosophers such as Nietzsche.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, he noted Schopenhauer's works where the latter had argued women only have "meagre" reason comparable that of "the animal" "who lives in the present". Other works he noted consisted of Schopenhauer's argument that women's only role in nature is to further the species through childbirth and hence is equipped with the power to seduce and "capture" men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He goes on to state that women's cheerfulness is chaotic and disruptive which is why it is crucial to exercise obedience to those with rationality. For her to function beyond her rational subjugator is a threat against men as well as other women, he notes. Schopenhauer also thought women's cheerfulness is an expression of her lack of morality and incapability to understand abstract or objective meaning such as art.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is followed up by his quote "have never been able to produce a single, really great, genuine and original achievement in the fine arts, or bring to anywhere into the world a work of permanent value".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Arthur Schopenhauer also blamed women for the fall of King Louis XIII and triggering the French Revolution, in which he was later quoted as saying:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"At all events, a false position of the female sex, such as has its most acute symptom in our lady-business, is a fundamental defect of the state of society. Proceeding from the heart of this, it is bound to spread its noxious influence to all parts."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Schopenhauer has also been accused of misogyny for his essay "On Women" (Über die Weiber), in which he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" on female affairs. He argued that women are "by nature meant to obey" as they are "childish, frivolous, and short sighted".&lt;ref name="Clack1999" /&gt; He claimed that no woman had ever produced great art or "any work of permanent value".&lt;ref name="Clack1999" /&gt; He also argued that women did not possess any real beauty:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|title=The Story of Philosophy|date=1983|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-671-20159-3|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is only a man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual impulse that could give the name of the ''fair sex'' to that under-sized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short-legged race; for the whole beauty of the sex is bound up with this impulse. Instead of calling them beautiful there would be more warrant for describing women as the unaesthetic sex.}}

=== Nietzsche ===
{{Main article|Friedrich Nietzsche's views on women}}
In ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] stated that stricter controls on women was a condition of "every elevation of culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|year=1886|title=Beyond Good and Evil|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4363/4363-h/4363-h.htm|location=Germany|accessdate= January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', he has a female character say "You are going to women? Do not forget the whip!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burgard |first=Peter J. |title=Nietzsche and the Feminine |date=May 1994 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville, VA |isbn=978-0-8139-1495-4 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', Nietzsche writes "Women are considered profound. Why? Because we never fathom their depths. But women aren't even shallow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|year=1889|title=Twilight of the Idols|url=http://www.handprint.com/SC/NIE/GotDamer.html|location=Germany|isbn=978-0-14-044514-5|accessdate= January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is controversy over the questions of whether or not this amounts to misogyny, whether his polemic against women is meant to be taken literally, and the exact nature of his opinions of women.&lt;ref name="Holub"&gt;Robert C. Holub, ''Nietzsche and The Women's Question''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060907092224/http://www-learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/teaching/syllabi/Lecture_Nietzsche_Women.pdf Coursework for Berkley University.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hegel ===
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] view of women can be characterized as misogynistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Shaun|title=Hegel, history, and interpretation|year=1997|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3381-2|page=235|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdlvNHnC6KMC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=Hegel+misogyny+misogynistic#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passages from Hegel's ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'' illustrate the criticism:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=rJqm5iQcsqoC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Hegel+misogyny+misogynistic#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title =Feminist Reflections on the History of Philosophy | isbn = 978-1-4020-2488-7 | author1 = Alanen | first1 = Lilli | last2 = Witt | first2 = Charlotte | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online misogyny ==
Misogynistic rhetoric is prevalent online and has grown rhetorically more aggressive. The public debate over gender-based attacks has increased significantly, leading to calls for policy interventions and better responses by social networks like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=jane&gt;{{cite journal |last= Jane |first= Emma Alice |title= 'Back to the kitchen, cunt': speaking the unspeakable about online misogyny |journal= [[Continuum: Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Studies]] |volume= 28 |issue= 4 |year= 2014 |pages= 558–570 |doi= 10.1080/10304312.2014.924479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Philipovic |first= Jill |title= Blogging While Female: How Internet Misogyny Parallels Real-World Harassment| journal = Yale Journal of Law and Feminism |volume= 19 |issue= 2|pages= 295–303 |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study conducted by the [[Demos (UK think tank)|think tank Demos]] concluded that 50% of all misogynistic tweets on [[Twitter]] come from women themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36380247 Twitter abuse - '50% of misogynistic tweets from women'], ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Most targets are women who are visible in the public sphere, women who speak out about the threats they receive, and women who are perceived to be associated with [[feminism]] or feminist gains. Authors of misogynistic messages are usually anonymous or otherwise difficult to identify. Their rhetoric involves misogynistic epithets and graphic and sexualized imagery, centers on the women's physical appearance, and prescribes sexual violence as a corrective for the targeted women. Examples of famous women who spoke out about misogynistic attacks are [[Anita Sarkeesian]], [[Laurie Penny]], [[Caroline Criado Perez]], [[Stella Creasy]], and [[Lindy West]].&lt;ref name=jane /&gt;

The insults and threats directed at different women tend to be very similar. [[Sady Doyle]] who has been the target of online threats noted the "overwhelmingly impersonal, repetitive, stereotyped quality" of the abuse, the fact that "all of us are being called the same things, in the same tone".&lt;ref name=jane /&gt;

== Psychological impact ==

=== Internalized misogyny ===
{{Main article|Internalized sexism}}
Internalized sexism is when an individual enacts sexist actions and attitudes towards themselves and people of their own sex.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Bearman, Steve, Neill Korobov, and Avril Thorne. "The fabric of internalized sexism." ''Journal of Integrated Social Sciences'' 1, no. 1 (2009): 10-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  On a larger scale, internalized sexism falls under the broad topic of [[internalized oppression]], which "consists of oppressive practices that continue to make the rounds even when members of the oppressor group are not present".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Women who experience internalized misogyny may express it through minimizing the value of women, mistrusting women, and believing gender bias in favor of men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Szymanski, Gupta, and Carr. 2009. "Internalized Misogyny as a Moderator of the Link between Sexist Events and Women’s Psychological Distress." ''Sex Roles'' 16, no. 1-2: 101–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Women, after hearing men demean the value and skills of women repeatedly, eventually internalize their beliefs and apply the misogynistic beliefs to themselves and other women.&lt;ref&gt;Bearman, Steve; Korobov, Neill; Thorne, Avril. 2009. "The fabric of internalized sexism." ''Journal of Integrated Social Sciences'' 1, no. 1: 10-47.&lt;/ref&gt; A common manifestation of internalized misogyny is [[lateral violence]].

== Feminist theory ==
Subscribers to one model say that some misogyny results from the [[Madonna–whore complex]], which is the inability to see women as anything other than "mothers" or "whores"; people with this complex place each encountered woman into one of these categories. Another variant model alleges that one cause of misogyny is some men thinking in terms of a virgin/whore dichotomy, which results in them considering as "whores" any women who do not adhere to an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] standard of moral purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Leah M. |last=Wyman |first2=George N. |last2=Dionisopolous |year=2000 |title=Transcending The Virgin/Whore Dichotomy: Telling Mina's Story in ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'' |journal=[[Women's Studies in Communication]] |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=209–237 |doi=10.1080/07491409.2000.10162569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] theorists argued that misogyny is both a cause and a result of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Kate Millet's ''Sexual Politics'', adapted from her doctoral dissertation is normally cited as the originator of this viewpoint; though Katharine M Rogers had also published similar ideas previously.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Michael Flood]] has argued that "misandry lacks the systemic, trans-historic, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=michael+flood+misandry#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misandry&amp;f=false | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 978-0-415-33343-6 | author1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== British legal situation ==
In recent years, there has been increasing discussion in the UK of misogyny being added to the list of aggravating factors that are commonly referred to by the media as “[[hate crime]]s”. Aggravating factors in criminal sentencing currently include hostility to a victim due to characteristics such as sexuality, race or disability.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/explanatory-material/item/aggravating-and-mitigating-factors/ "Aggravating and mitigating factors"], Sentencing Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Nottinghamshire Police began a pilot project to record misogynistic behaviour as either hate crime or hate incidents, depending on whether the action was a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Libby, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/09/uk-police-chiefs-urged-to-adopt-harassment-of-women-as-hate "UK police chiefs urged to adopt harassment of women as hate crime"], ''The Guardian'', July 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Over two years (April 2016-March 2018) there were 174 reports made, of which 73 were classified as crimes and 101 as incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-44740362 "Misogyny hate crime in Nottinghamshire gives 'shocking' results"], BBC News, July 9, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018 it was announced that the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] would conduct a review into whether misogynistic conduct, as well as hostility due to [[ageism]], [[misandry]] or towards groups such as [[goth subculture|goths]], should be treated as a hate crime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45423789 "Misogyny could become hate crime as legal review is announced"], BBC News, September 6, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, Jamie, [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/16/review-of-uk-hate-law-to-consider-misogyny-and-ageism "Review of UK hate crime law to consider misogyny and ageism"], ''The Guardian'', October 16, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, two senior police officers, [[Sara Thornton (police officer)|Sara Thornton]], chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, and [[Cressida Dick]], Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, stated that police forces should focus on more serious crimes such as burglary and violent offences, and not on recording incidents which are not crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, Olivia, [https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/met-police-chief-cressida-dick-backs-top-cop-sara-thornton-on-tackling-burglars-and-violence-not-a3978526.html "Met chief Cressida Dick backs senior police officer Sara Thornton on tackling burglars and violence ahead of hate crimes"], ''Evening Standard'', November 2, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton said that "treating misogyny as a hate crime is a concern for some well-organised campaigning organisations", but that police forces "do not have the resources to do everything".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46053069 "Focus on violent crime not misogyny, says police chief"], BBC News, November 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept ==

[[Camille Paglia]], a self-described "dissident feminist" who has often been at odds with other academic feminists, argues that there are serious flaws in the [[Marxism]]-inspired&lt;ref&gt;"Marxist feminists reduced the historical cult of woman’s virginity to her property value, her worth on the male marriage market.", Paglia, 1991, ''Sexual Persona'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; interpretation of misogyny that is prevalent in [[second-wave feminism]]. In contrast, Paglia argues that a close reading of historical texts reveals that men do not ''hate'' women but ''fear'' them.&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille (1991). ''[[Sexual Personae]]'', NY: Vintage, Chapter 1 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Groes-Green has argued that misogyny must be seen in relation to its opposite which he terms philogyny. Criticizing [[R. W. Connell]]'s theory of hegemonic masculinities, he shows how philogynous masculinities play out among youth in Maputo, Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Groes-Green |first=Christian |date=2011 |title=Philogynous Masculinities: Contextualizing Alternative Manhood in Mozambique |journal=Men and Masculinities |language=en |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=91–111 |doi=10.1177/1097184x11427021}}&lt;/ref&gt;
