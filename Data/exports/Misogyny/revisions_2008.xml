'''Misogyny''' ({{pronEng|m&lt;s&gt;ɪ&lt;/s&gt;ˈsɒdʒ&lt;s&gt;ɪ&lt;/s&gt;ni}}) is hatred (or contempt)&lt;ref&gt;
[[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]], ''[[Glossographia]]'', 1656.&lt;/ref&gt;
of women.&lt;ref&gt;
OED1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
An entry for ''misogyny'' also exists in [[Edward Phillips]], ''A New World in Words, or a General Dictionary'', 1658.&lt;/ref&gt; Misogyny is parallel to [[misandry]] — the hatred of men. Misogyny is also comparable with [[misanthropy]],&lt;ref&gt;
See [[Chrysippus]] below.&lt;/ref&gt;
which is the hatred of humanity generally. The [[antonym]] of ''misogyny'' is ''[[philogyny]]'', love towards women. [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] reports that Greek philosophers considered misogyny to be caused by [[gynophobia]], a fear of women.&lt;ref name="Cicero"&gt;
[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', Book 3, Chapter 11. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[A Greek-English Lexicon|LSJ]]'' typo has Book 4]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the late 20th century, feminist theorists proposed misogyny as both a cause and result of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] social structures.&lt;ref&gt;
Kate Millet's ''Sexual Politics'', adapted from her doctoral dissertation is normally cited as the originator; though Katharine M Rogers had also published substantially, regarding her reading of misogyny in literature prior to this.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

''Misogyny'' is sometimes confused with the similar looking word—''misogamy'' (μισογαμία)—which means "hatred of marriage", hence the following error.&lt;ref&gt;Listed under both ''misogyny'' and ''misogamy'' by OED1, but cited in full only in the latter.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Any doubt he may have ever cherished in his ''misogamic'' breast concerning a woman's creative capacity. — ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', [[7 January]] [[1889]]
An example of correct use, from the same period is:
*He ... walked the banks apart, a thing of ''misogyny'', in a suit of flannel. — [[Herman Charles Merivale]], ''Faucit of Balliol'', 1882
A clearer example of the sense, also from the same era but using the related word '''misogynist''', is provided by Thackeray.
*Confound all women, I say, muttered the young ''misogynist''. — [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], ''The Virginians'', 1878
In the second act of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', [[Oscar Wilde]] humorously has [[Miss Prism]] referring to Dr Chasuble as a ''womanthrope'', but intending ''misogynist'' or ''misogamist'':
*You should get married. A misanthrope I can understand—a womanthrope, never! — Oscar Wilde, ''The Importance of Being Earnest'', 1895
Occasionally writers play on the similarity of sound between ''misogyny'' and ''[[miscegeny]]'' (mixed-race marriage).
*This psychosocial analysis of the murder of a white civil rights activist by her mulatto lover ([[Joe Christmas]]) is replete with themes of fate, free will, sociopathy, family violence, ''misogyny'', ''miscegeny'', and isolation versus community. — Karl Kirkland, 'On the Value of [[William Faulkner]] to Graduate Medical Education', 2001&lt;ref&gt;

== Misogyny in Greek literature ==
[[Image:Seated Euripides Louvre Ma343.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Euripides]]]]
''Misogyny'' comes into English from the ancient Greek word, ''misogunia'' ({{Polytonic|μισογυνία}}), which survives in two passages.&lt;ref name="Liddell"&gt;
[[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott]], ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (''LSJ''), revised and augmented by Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940). ISBN 0198642261&lt;/ref&gt;
The earlier, longer and more complete passage comes from a [[stoic]] philosopher called [[Antipater of Tarsus]] in a moral tract known as ''On Marriage'' (''c''. 150 BC).&lt;ref&gt;
The ''[[editio princeps]]'' is on page 255 of volume three of ''Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta'' (''[[SVF]]'', Old Stoic Fragments), see [[Misogyny#External links|External links]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;
A recent critical text with translation is in [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JlCnsyRBGf&amp;sig=7zsKzMVEBnV3tHag9z7E4cWCeLs&amp;hl=en Appendix A] to Will Deming, ''Paul on Marriage and Celibacy: The Hellenistic Background of 1 Corinthians 7'', pp. 221–226.
''Misogunia'' appears in the [[accusative case]] on page 224 of Deming, as the fifth word in line 33 of his Greek text.
It is split over lines 25–26 in von Arnim.&lt;/ref&gt;
Antipater argues that marriage is the foundation of the state, and considers it to be based on divine ([[Polytheism|polytheistic]]) decree.&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;
Antipater uses ''misogunia'' to describe [[Euripides]]' usual writing—''tēn en to graphein misogunian'' (τὴν μισογυνίαν ἐν τῷ γράφειν "the misogyny in the writing").&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;
However, he mentions this by way of contrast. He goes on to quote Euripides at some length, writing in praise of wives.&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;
Antipater doesn't tell us what it is about Euripides' writing that he believes is misogynistic,&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;
he simply expresses his belief that even a man thought to hate women (namely Euripides) praises wives, so concluding his argument for the importance of marriage. He says, "This thing is truly heroic."&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

Euripides' reputation as a misogynist is known from another source. [[Athenaeus]], in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' or ''Banquet of the Learned'', has one of the diners quoting [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] who confirms the view was widespread, while offering [[Sophocles]]' comment on the matter.
{{Cquote|Euripides the poet, also, was much addicted to women: at all events Hieronymus in his Historical Commentaries speaks as follows,—"When some one told Sophocles that Euripides was a woman-hater, 'He may be,' said he, 'in his tragedies, but in his bed he is very fond of women.' " — Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophists'', 2nd/[[3rd century]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''[[The Deipnosophists]]'', Book 13 [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV3.p0080&amp;q1=hieronymus&amp;pview=hide §5.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The other surviving use of the original Greek word is by [[Chrysippus]], in a fragment from ''On affections'', quoted by [[Galen]] in ''[[Hippocrates]] on Affections''.&lt;ref&gt;''SVF'' 3:103. ''Mysogyny'' is the first word on the page.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''misogyny'' is the first in a short list of three "disaffections"—women (''misogunian''), wine (''misoinian'', μισοινίαν) and humanity (''misanthrōpian'', μισανθρωπίαν). Chrysippus' point is more abstract than Antipater's, and Galen quotes the passage as an example of an opinion contrary to his own. What is clear, however, is that he groups hatred of women with hatred of humanity generally, and even hatred of wine. "It was the prevailing medical opinion of his day that wine strengthens body and soul alike."&lt;ref name=Tieleman&gt;
Teun L. Tieleman, ''[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=BBiw96gj8gkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chrysippus+on+affections&amp;sig=6f6Y84rR_VZzorWxiGfFMYViuvM Chrysippus' on Affections:] Reconstruction and Interpretations'', (Leiden: [[Brill]], 2003), p. 162. ISBN 9004129987&lt;/ref&gt;
So, as with his fellow stoic, Antipater, misogyny is viewed negatively, a [[disease]], a dislike of something that is good. It is this issue of conflicted or alternating emotions that was philosophically contentious to the ancient writers. Ricardo Salles suggests the general stoic view was that, "A man may not only alternate between philogyny and misogyny, philanthropy and misanthropy, but be prompted to each by the other."&lt;ref&gt;
Ricardo Salles, ''Metaphysics, Soul, and Ethics in Ancient Thought: Themes from the Work of Richard Sorabji'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005), 485.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
''Misogynist'' is also found in the Greek—''misogunēs'' ({{Polytonic|μισογύνης}})—in ''Deipnosophistae'' (above) and in [[Plutarch]]'s ''Parallel Lives'', where it is used as the title of [[Heracles]] in the history of [[Phocion]]. It was also the title of a play by [[Menander]], which we know of from book seven (concerning [[Alexandria]]) of [[Strabo]]'s 17 volume ''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]],''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'', Book 7 [Alexandria] Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Liddell /&gt; and quotations of Menander by [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Stobaeus]] that relate to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;

Menander also wrote a play called ''Misoumenos'' (Μισούμενος) or ''The Man (She) Hated''. Another Greek play with a similar name, ''Misogunos'' (Μισόγυνος) or ''Woman-hater'', is reported by Cicero (in Latin) and attributed to [[Atilius]].&lt;ref&gt;
He is supported (or followed) by [[Theognostus the Grammarian]]'s [[9th century]] ''Canones'', edited by [[John Antony Cramer]], ''Anecdota Graeca e codd. manuscriptis bibliothecarum Oxoniensium'', vol. 2, ([[Oxford University Press]], 1835), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
The context is worth quoting in full, because it deals directly with matters already discussed in this article.
{{Cquote|It is the same with other diseases; as the desire of glory, a passion for women, to which the Greeks give the name of ''philogyneia'': and thus all other diseases and sicknesses are generated. But those feelings which are the contrary of these are supposed to have fear for their foundation, as a hatred of women, such as is displayed in the ''Woman-hater'' of Atilius; or the hatred of the whole human species, as Timon is reported to have done, whom they call the Misanthrope. Of the same kind is inhospitality. And all these diseases proceed from a certain dread of such things as they hate and avoid. — Cicero, ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', 1st century BC.&lt;ref name=Cicero /&gt;}}
The more common form of this general word for woman hating is ''misogunaios'' ({{Polytonic|μισογύναιος}}).&lt;ref name=Liddell /&gt;

In summary, Greek literature considered misogyny to be a disease, an anti-social condition, in that it ran contrary to their perceptions of the value of women as wives, and of the family as the foundation of society. These points are widely noted in the secondary literature.&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

== Misogyny in feminist theory ==
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
Traditional feminist theorists propose many different forms of misogyny. In its most overt expression, a misogynist will openly hate all women simply because they are female.
Other forms of misogyny may be less overt. Some misogynists may simply be prejudiced against all women, or may hate women who do not fall into one or more acceptable categories. Entire cultures may be said to be misogynist if they treat women in ways that can be seen as harmful. Examples include forcing women to tend to all domestic responsibilities, not allowing women to take jobs outside the home, or beating women. Subscribers to one model, the [[Madonna-whore complex|mother/whore dichotomy]], hold that women can only be "mothers" or "whores." Another variant is the [[virgin]]/whore dichotomy, in which women who do not adhere to a saintly standard of moral purity (Abrahamic) are considered "whores".{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

Frequently, the term ''misogynist'' is used in a looser sense as a term of derision to describe anyone who holds an unpopular or distasteful view about women as a group. A man who considers himself "a great lover of women," therefore, might somewhat paradoxically be termed a misogynist by those who consider his treatment of women sexist, such as [[Anti-pornography_movement#Feminist_objections|sex-negative feminists]]. Archetypes of this type of man might be [[Giacomo Casanova]] and [[Don Juan]], who were both reputed for their many libertine affairs with women.

Misogyny is a negative attitude towards women as a group, and so need not fully determine a misogynist's attitude towards each individual woman. The fact that someone holds misogynist views may not prevent him or her from having positive relationships with some women. Conversely, simply having negative relationships with some women does not necessarily mean someone holds misogynistic views. The term, like most negative descriptions of attitudes, is used as an epithet and applied to a wide variety of behaviors and attitudes. As with other terms, the more antipathetic one's position is in regards to misogyny, the larger the number of misogynists and the greater variety of attitudes and behaviors who fall into one's perception of "misogynist".{{Specify|date=January 2007}} This is, of course, the subject of much controversy and debate with opinions ranging widely as to the extent and breadth of misogyny in society.

Feminist theorist [[Marilyn Frye]] argues that misogyny is phallocentric and [[homoerotic]] at its root. In ''Politics of Reality'', Fyre analyzes the alleged misogyny characteristic of the fiction and Christian apologetics of [[C.S. Lewis]]. Frye argues that such misogyny privileges the masculine as a subject of erotic attention. She compares the misogyny characteristic of Lewis' ideal of gender relations to underground [[male prostitution]] rings, which share the same quality of men seeking to dominate subjects seen as less likely to take on submissive roles by a patriarchal society, but in both cases doing so as a theatrical mockery of women.&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Marilyn.

J Holland sees evidence of misogyny in the [[mythology]] of the ancient world. In [[Greek mythology]], the human race had already existed before the creation of women — a peaceful, autonomous existence as a companion to the gods. When [[Prometheus]] decides to steal the secret of fire from the gods, [[Zeus]] becomes infuriated and decides to punish humankind with an "evil thing for their delight" — [[Pandora]], the first woman, who carried a jar (usually described — incorrectly — as a box) she was told to never open. [[Epimetheus]] (the brother of Prometheus) is overwhelmed by her beauty, disregards Prometheus' warnings about her, and marries her. Pandora cannot resist peeking into the jar, and by opening it unveils all evil into the world — [[childbirth|labour]], [[sickness]], [[old age]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J: "Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice," pp. 12-13. Avalon Publishing Group, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

J Holland also sees evidence of misogyny in the [[Christian]] view on the [[Fall of Man]] based on the Book [[Genesis]], which according to Christian interpretation brought tragedy and death into the world by a woman. (See also [[Original Sin]].)

Katherine M. Rogers in ''The Troublesome Helpmate'' argues that the [[Pauline epistles]] in the New Testament contain texts that have historically been used by some Christian misogynists.
:"The foundations of early Christian misogyny — its guilt about sex, its insistence on female subjection, its dread of female seduction — are all in St. Paul's epistles. They provided a convenient supply of divinely inspired misogynistic texts for any Christian writer who chose to use them; his statements on female subjection were still being quoted in the twentieth century opponents of equality for women."&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katherine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taj Hashmi discusses misogyny in relation to Muslim culture, and Bangladesh specifically, in ''Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh''. 

:"[T]hanks to the subjective interpretations of the Quran (almost exclusively by men), the preponderance of the misogynic mullahs and the regressive Shariah law in most “Muslim” countries, Islam is synonymously known as a promoter of misogyny in its worst form. Although there is no way of defending the so-called “great” traditions of Islam as libertarian and egalitarian with regard to women, we may draw a line between the Quranic texts and the corpus of avowedly misogynic writing and spoken words by the mullah having very little or no relevance to the Quran."&lt;ref&gt; Hashmi, Taj.

== Misogyny in Philosophy ==
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] has been accused of misogyny for his essay "On Women" (Über die Weiber), in which he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" on female affairs. He claimed that "woman is by nature meant to obey." The essay does give two compliments however: that "women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [[man|men]] are" and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others. However, the latter was discounted as weakness rather than humanitarian virtue.

[[Nietzsche]] is known for arguing that every higher form of civilization implied stricter controls on women (''[[Beyond Good and Evil (book)|Beyond Good and Evil]]'', 7:238); he frequently insulted women, but is best known for phrases such as "Women are less than shallow," and "Are you going to women? Do not forget the whip!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burgard |first=Peter J. |title=Nietzsche and the Feminine |origdate= |year=1994 |month=May |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville, VA |isbn=0-8139-1495-7 |pages=p. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche's reputation as a misogynist is disputed by some, pointing out that he also made unflattering statements about men. Nietzsche can easily be interpreted as [[anti-feminist]], believing that women were primarily mothers and opposing the modern notion of [[women's liberation]] on the grounds that he considered it a form of [[slave morality]]. Whether or not this amounts to misogyny, whether his polemic statements against women are meant to be taken literally, and the exact nature of his opinions of women, are more controversial.&lt;ref name="Holub"&gt;Robert C. Holub, ''Nietzsche and The Women's Question''. [http://www-learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/teaching/syllabi/Lecture_Nietzsche_Women.pdf Coursework for Berkley University]&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Otto Weininger]] has been accused of misogyny for his 1903 book ''Sex and Character'', in which he characterizes the "woman" part of each individual as being essentially "nothing," and having no real existence, having no effective consciousness or rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Izenberg |first=Gerald N. |year=2001 | month = June |title=Review of Chandak Sengoopta's Otto Weininger: Sex, Science, and Self in Imperial Vienna | journal = The American Historical Review | volume = 106 | issue = 3 |pages=pp. 1074–1075 |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8762%28200106%29106%3A3%3C1074%3AOWSSAS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5 |accessdate=2007-01-08 | doi = 10.2307/2692497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weininger says, "No men who really think deeply about women retain a high opinion of them; men either despise women or they have never thought seriously about them." The author [[August Strindberg]] praised Weininger for probably having solved the hardest of all problems, the "woman problem."
