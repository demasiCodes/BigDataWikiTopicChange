'''Misogyny''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|m|ɪ|ˈ|s|ɒ|dʒ|ɪ|n|i}}) is the hatred or dislike of [[women]] or [[girls]]. ''[[Philogyny]]'', meaning fondness, love or admiration towards women, is the antonym of misogyny. The term ''[[misandry]]'' is the term for men that is parallel (equivalent except for gender) to ''misogyny''. The word's origin is from Greek words μῖσος (misos, "hatred") and γυνή (gyne, "woman").

==Definitions==
According to sociologist Allan G. Johnson, "misogyny is a cultural attitude of hatred for females because they are female." Johnson argues that:
{{quote|"[Misogyny] is a central part of sexist prejudice and ideology and, as such, is an important basis for the oppression of females in male-dominated societies. Misogyny is manifested in many different ways, from jokes to pornography to violence to the self-contempt women may be taught to feel for their own bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=allan+johnson+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: A user's guide to sociological language | isbn = 9780631216810 | author1 = Johnson | first1 = Allan G | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Michael Flood]] defines misogyny as the hatred of women, and notes:
{{quote|"Though most common in men, misogyny also exists in and is practiced by women against other women or even themselves. Misogyny functions as an ideology or belief system that has accompanied patriarchal, or male-dominated societies for thousands of years and continues to place women in subordinate positions with limited access to power and decision making. [...] Aristotle contended that women exist as natural deformities or imperfect males [...] Ever since, women in Western cultures have internalised their role as societal scapegoats, influenced in the twenty-first century by multimedia objectification of women with its culturally sanctioned self-loathing and fixations on plastic surgery, anorexia and bulimia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=michael+flood+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 9780415333436 | author1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Classical Greece ==
[[File:Seated Euripides Louvre Ma343.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Euripides]]]]

In his book ''City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens'', J.W. Roberts argues that older than tragedy and comedy was a misogynistic tradition in Greek literature, reaching back at least as far as [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=73kTsV4FdrQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Sokrates+misogyny+misogynist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens | isbn = 9780203194799 | author1 = Roberts | first1 = J.W | date = 2002-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Misogyny'' comes into English from the ancient Greek word, ''misogunia'' ({{Polytonic|μισογυνία}}), which survives in two passages.&lt;ref name="Liddell"&gt;[[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (''LSJ''), revised and augmented by Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940). ISBN 0-19-864226-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier, longer and more complete passage comes from a [[stoic]] philosopher called [[Antipater of Tarsus]] in a moral tract known as ''On Marriage'' (''c''. 150 BC).&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[editio princeps]]'' is on page 255 of volume three of ''[[Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta]]'' (''SVF'', Old Stoic Fragments), see [[Misogyny#External links|External links]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;A recent critical text with translation is in [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JlCnsyRBGf&amp;sig=7zsKzMVEBnV3tHag9z7E4cWCeLs&amp;hl=en Appendix A] to Will Deming, ''Paul on Marriage and Celibacy: The Hellenistic Background of 1 Corinthians 7'', pp. 221–226.

''Misogunia'' appears in the [[accusative case]] on page 224 of Deming, as the fifth word in line 33 of his Greek text.

It is split over lines 25–26 in von Arnim.&lt;/ref&gt; Antipater argues that marriage is the foundation of the state, and considers it to be based on divine ([[Polytheism|polytheistic]]) decree. Antipater uses ''misogunia'' to describe [[Euripides]]' usual writing—''tēn misogunian en tō graphein '' (τὴν μισογυνίαν ἐν τῷ γράφειν "the misogyny in the writing").&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

However, he mentions this by way of contrast. He goes on to quote Euripides at some length, writing in praise of wives. Antipater does not tell us what it is about Euripides' writing that he believes is misogynistic, he simply expresses his belief that even a man thought to hate women (namely Euripides) praises wives, so concluding his argument for the importance of marriage. He says, "This thing is truly heroic."&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

Euripides' reputation as a misogynist is known from another source. [[Athenaeus]], in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' or ''Banquet of the Learned'', has one of the diners quoting [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] who confirms the view was widespread, while offering [[Sophocles]]' comment on the matter.

{{quote|Euripides the poet, also, was much addicted to women: at all events Hieronymus in his Historical Commentaries speaks as follows,—"When some one told Sophocles that Euripides was a woman-hater, 'He may be,' said he, 'in his tragedies, but in his bed he is very fond of women.'"|Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophists'', 2nd/3rd century.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''[[The Deipnosophists]]'', Book 13 [http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081202152211/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV3.p0080&amp;q1=hieronymus&amp;pview=hide Book 13]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite Euripides' reputation, Antipater is not the only writer to see appreciation of women in his writing. Katherine Henderson and Barbara McManus consider he "showed more empathy for women than any other ancient writer", citing "relatively modern critics" to support their claim.&lt;ref&gt;"Although Euripides showed more empathy for women than any other ancient writer, many of his lines out of context sound misogynistic; only relatively modern critics have been able to rescue him from his centuries-old reputation as a woman-hater." Katherine Usher Henderson and [http://www.cnr.edu/home/bmcmanus/ Barbara F. McManus], ''Half Humankind: Contexts and Texts of the Controversy about Women in England, 1540-1640'', ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1985), p. 6. ISBN 978-0-252-01174-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The other surviving use of the original Greek word is by [[Chrysippus]], in a fragment from ''On affections'', quoted by [[Galen]] in ''[[Hippocrates]] on Affections''.&lt;ref&gt;''SVF'' 3:103. ''Mysogyny'' is the first word on the page.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''misogyny'' is the first in a short list of three "disaffections"—women (''misogunian''), wine (''misoinian'', μισοινίαν) and humanity (''misanthrōpian'', μισανθρωπίαν).

Chrysippus' point is more abstract than Antipater's, and Galen quotes the passage as an example of an opinion contrary to his own. What is clear, however, is that he groups hatred of women with hatred of humanity generally, and even hatred of wine. "It was the prevailing medical opinion of his day that wine strengthens body and soul alike."&lt;ref name=Tieleman&gt;Teun L. Tieleman, ''[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=BBiw96gj8gkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chrysippus+on+affections&amp;sig=6f6Y84rR_VZzorWxiGfFMYViuvM Chrysippus' on Affections:] Reconstruction and Interpretations'', (Leiden: [[Brill Publishers]], 2003), p. 162. ISBN 90-04-12998-7&lt;/ref&gt;

So, as with his fellow stoic, Antipater, misogyny is viewed negatively, a [[disease]], a dislike of something that is good. It is this issue of conflicted or alternating emotions that was philosophically contentious to the ancient writers. Ricardo Salles suggests the general stoic view was that, "A man may not only alternate between philogyny and misogyny, philanthropy and misanthropy, but be prompted to each by the other."&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Salles, ''Metaphysics, Soul, and Ethics in Ancient Thought: Themes from the Work of Richard Sorabji'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005), 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]

[[Aristotle]] has also been accused of being a misogynist; He has written that women were inferior to men. For example, to cite Cynthia Freeland's catalogue: "Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that "matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful;" that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or "as it were, a deformity": which contributes only matter and not form to the generation of offspring; that in general "a woman is perhaps an inferior being"; that female characters in a tragedy will be inappropriate if they are too brave or too clever"(Freeland 1994: 145-46)&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/#Mis&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic'', Nickolas Pappas describes the "problem of misogyny" and states

{{quote|"In the ''Apology'', Socrates calls those who plead for their lives in court "no better than women" (35b)... The ''Timaeus'' warns men that if they live immorally they will be reincarnated as women (42b-c; cf. 75d-e). The ''Republic'' contains a number of comments in the same spirit (387e, 395d-e, 398e, 431b-c, 469d), evidence of nothing so much as of contempt toward women. Even Socrates' words for his bold new proposal about marriage... suggest that the women are to be "held in common" by men. He never says that the men might be held in common by the women... We also have to acknowledge Socrates' insistence that men surpass women at any task that both sexes attempt (455c, 456a), and his remark in Book 8 that one sign of democracy's moral failure is the sexual equality it promotes (563b)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=VujWajIWxkUC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Socrates+misogyny+misogynist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic | isbn = 9780415299961 | author1 = Pappas | first1 = Nickolas | date = 2003-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Misogynist'' is also found in the Greek—''misogunēs'' ({{Polytonic|μισογύνης}})—in ''Deipnosophistae'' (above) and in [[Plutarch]]'s ''Parallel Lives'', where it is used as the title of [[Heracles]] in the history of [[Phocion]].

It was also the title of a play by [[Menander]], which we know of from book seven (concerning [[Alexandria]]) of [[Strabo]]'s 17 volume ''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'',&lt;ref name=Liddell /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]],''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'', Book 7 [Alexandria] Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and quotations of Menander by [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Stobaeus]] that relate to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Menander]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=JC11wYBkrhkC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=The+Misogynist+(Misogynes)&amp;sig=y98In1TUseOWVGHrcOOMQ0Vx1dU ''The Plays and Fragments''], translated by Maurice Balme, contributor [[Peter Brown]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}}, [[Oxford University Press]], 2002. ISBN 0-19-283983-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Menander also wrote a play called ''Misoumenos'' (Μισούμενος) or ''The Man (She) Hated''. Another Greek play with a similar name, ''Misogunos'' (Μισόγυνος) or ''Woman-hater'', is reported by Cicero (in Latin) and attributed to [[Atilia (gens)#Members of the gens#Marcus Atilius|(Marcus) Atilius (poet)]].&lt;ref&gt;He is supported (or followed) by [[Theognostus the Grammarian]]'s 9th century ''Canones'', edited by [[John Antony Cramer]], ''Anecdota Graeca e codd. manuscriptis bibliothecarum Oxoniensium'', vol. 2, ([[Oxford University Press]], 1835), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] reports that Greek philosophers considered misogyny to be caused by [[gynophobia]], a fear of women.&lt;ref name="Cicero"&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', Book 3, Chapter 11. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[A Greek-English Lexicon|LSJ]]'' typo has Book 4]&lt;/ref&gt; The context is worth quoting in full, because it deals directly with matters already discussed in this article.

{{quote|It is the same with other diseases; as the desire of glory, a passion for women, to which the Greeks give the name of ''philogyneia'': and thus all other diseases and sicknesses are generated.

In summary, Greek literature considered misogyny to be a [[disease]], an [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] condition, in that it ran contrary to their perceptions of the value of women as wives, and of the family as the foundation of society. These points are widely noted in the secondary literature.&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

== Mythology ==
{{Unbalanced section|date=June 2011}}
In ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', Jack Holland sees evidence of misogyny in the [[mythology]] of the ancient world. In [[Greek mythology]] according to Hesiod, the human race had already existed before the creation of women — a peaceful, autonomous existence as a companion to the gods.

When [[Prometheus]] decides to steal the secret of fire from the gods, [[Zeus]] becomes infuriated and decides to punish humankind with an "evil thing for their delight" — [[Pandora]], the first woman, who carried a jar (usually described — incorrectly — as a box) she was told to never open.

[[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]] (the brother of Prometheus) is overwhelmed by her beauty, disregards Prometheus' warnings about her, and marries her. Pandora cannot resist peeking into the jar, and by opening it all evil is unleashed into the world — [[childbirth|labour]], [[Illness|sickness]], [[old age]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J: "Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice," pp. 12-13. Avalon Publishing Group, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

These examples of misogyny in Greek myths contradict the claims made by many that Greek literature looked down upon misogyny. It could mean that the notion of misogyny that was ridiculed by Greek literature is not the same as the modern concept of misogyny.

In his book ''The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender'', professor Bernard Faure of [[Columbia University]] argued generally that "Buddhism is paradoxically neither as sexist nor as egalitarian as is usually thought." He remarked, "Many feminist scholars have emphasized the misogynistic (or at least androcentric) nature of Buddhism." He emphasised that Buddhism morally exalts its male monks while the mothers and wives of the monks also have important roles. He wrote as well:
{{quote|"While some scholars see Buddhism as part of a movement of emancipation, others see it as a source of oppression. Perhaps this is only a distinction between optimists and pessimists, if not between idealists and realists... As we begin to realize, the term "Buddhism" does not designate a monolithic entity, but covers a number of doctrines, ideologies, and practices--some of which seem to invite, tolerate, and even cultivate "otherness" on their margins".&lt;ref name=bernard&gt;http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7538.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Katharine M. Rogers in ''The Troublesome Helpmate'' alleges [[Christianity]] to be misogynistic, listing what she says are specific examples from the [[New Testament]] [[Pauline epistles|letters]] of the Christian apostle [[Paul of Tarsus]]. She argues that the legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called "Fathers" of the Church, like [[Tertullian]], who thought a woman was not only "the gateway of the devil" but also "a temple built over a sewer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=clOT7Hg2CfAC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=christian+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=christian%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = Feminist literary studies: An introduction | isbn = 9780521398527 | author1 = Ruthven | first1 = K.

{{quote|The foundations of early Christian misogyny — its guilt about sex, its insistence on female subjection, its dread of female seduction — are all in St. Paul's epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katharine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The verse Galatians 3:28 has attracted much attention during the modern gender role debate. It says:

{{quote|"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."}}

David M. Scholer, a Biblical scholar at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], stated that the verse Gal 3:28 is "the fundamental Pauline theological basis for the inclusion of women and men as equal and mutual partners in all of the ministries of the church."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbmw.org/Journal/Vol-8-No-1/Galatians-3-28-Prooftext-or-Context&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hove, Richard.

Galatians 3.28 and the Gender Dispute'', Richard Hove argues that while Galatians 3:28 means that one's sex does not affect salvation, "there remains a pattern of in which the wife is to emulate the church's submission to Christ ({{bibleverse||Eph|5:21-33|KJV}}) and the husband is to emulate Christ's love for the church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=WcyqvWfJnyYC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=ken+campbell+3:28+Rochard+Hove#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Marriage and family in the biblical world | isbn = 9780830827374 | author1 = Campbell | first1 = Ken M | date = 2003-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Holland also sees evidence of misogyny in the Old Testament story of the [[Fall of Man]] from the [[Book of Genesis]]. In ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', he characterizes the Fall of Man as "a myth that blames woman for the ills and sufferings of mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Jack|title=Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice|year=2006|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York|isbn=0786718234|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Original Sin]].)

Clinical psychologist Margaret J. Rinck has written in ''Christian Men Who Hate Women'' that Christian social culture often allows misogynists to "misuse of the biblical ideal of submission". However, she argues this a distortion of "a healthy relationship of mutual submission" actually specified in Christian doctrine where "[l]ove is based on a deep, mutual respect as the guiding principle behind all decisions, actions, and plans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christian Men Who Hate Women: Healing Hurting Relationships|first=Margaret J.|last=Rinck

The fourth chapter (or ''[[sura]]'') of the [[Qur'an]] is called Women ([[An-Nisa]]). The 34th verse is a key verse in feminist criticism of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;"Verse 34 of Chapter 4 is an oft-cited Verse in the Qur’an used to demonstrate that Islam is structurally patriarchal, and thus Islam internalizes male dominance."
Dahlia Eissa, "[http://www.wluml.org/node/443#_ftn42 Constructing the Notion of Male Superiority over Women in Islam]: The influence of sex and gender stereotyping in the interpretation of the Qur’an and the implications for a modernist exegesis of rights", Occasional Paper 11 in ''Occasional Papers'' ([[Empowerment International]], 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
The verse reads: "Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great."

Taj Hashmi discusses misogyny in relation to Muslim culture, and [[Bangladesh]] specifically, in the book ''Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh''.

Nomani notes that in his book ''[[No god but God]]'', [[University of Southern California]] professor [[Reza Aslan]] wrote that "misogynistic interpretation" has dogged An-Nisa, 34 because Koranic commentary "has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men."&lt;ref name=issue&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261.html|publisher=Washington Post|title=Clothes Aren't the Issue|date=October 22, 2006|first=Asra Q.|last=Nomani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[L. Ron Hubbard]] wrote the following passages in his 1965 book ''Scientology: A New Slant on Life'':
{{quote|"A society in which women are taught anything but the management of a family, the care of men, and the creation of the future generation is a society which is on its way out."&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}
{{quote|"The historian can peg the point where a society begins its sharpest decline at the instant when women begin to take part, on an equal footing with men, in political and business affairs, since this means that the men are decadent and the women are no longer women. This is not a sermon on the role or position of women; it is a statement of bald and basic fact."&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}
These have been criticized by Alan Scherstuhl of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' as expressions of hatred towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=The Church of Scientology does not want you to see L. Ron Hubbard's woman-hatin' book chapter|publisher=[[The Village Voice]]|first=Alan|last=Scherstuhl|date=June 21, 2010|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/06/the_church_of_s.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Baylor University]] professor [[J. Gordon Melton|Dr. J. Gordon Melton]] has written that Hubbard disregarded and abrogated much of his earlier views about women, which Melton views as merely echos of common prejudices at the time. Melton has also stated that the [[Church of Scientology]] welcomes both genders equally at all levels from leadership positions to [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] and so on since Scientologists view people as [[Thetan|spiritual beings]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patheos.com/Library/Scientology/Ethics-Morality-Community/Gender-and-Sexuality.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weininger===
[[Otto Weininger]] freely admits his misogyny in his book ''[[Sex and Character]]'', in which he characterizes the "woman" part of each individual as being essentially "nothing," and having no real existence, having no effective consciousness or rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Izenberg |first=Gerald N. |year=2001 | month = June |title=Review of Chandak Sengoopta's Otto Weininger: Sex, Science, and Self in Imperial Vienna | journal = The American Historical Review | volume = 106 | issue = 3 |pages=1074–1075| doi = 10.2307/2692497 |publisher=The American Historical Review, Vol. 106, No. 3 |last2=Sengoopta |first2=Chandak | jstor=2692497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schopenhauer===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] has been accused of misogyny for his essay "On Women" (Über die Weiber), in which he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" on female affairs. He claimed that "woman is by nature meant to obey." He also noted that "Men are by nature merely indifferent to one another; but women are by nature enemies."

===Nietzsche===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] stated that every higher form of civilization implied stricter controls on women (''[[Beyond Good and Evil (book)|Beyond Good and Evil]]'', 7:238). He frequently insulted women, and is known to have said "Women are less than shallow," and "Are you going to women? Do not forget the whip!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burgard |first=Peter J. |title=Nietzsche and the Feminine |year=1994 |month=May |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville, VA |isbn=0-8139-1495-7 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not this amounts to misogyny, whether his polemic statements against women are meant to be taken literally, and the exact nature of his opinions of women, are controversial.&lt;ref name="Holub"&gt;Robert C. Holub, ''Nietzsche and The Women's Question''. [http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060907092224/http://www-learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/teaching/syllabi/Lecture_Nietzsche_Women.pdf Coursework for Berkley University]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Kant===
Charlotte Witt wrote that Kant's and Aristotle's writings contained overt statements of sexism and racism.  She found derogatory remarks about women in Kant's ''Observations on the Beautiful and Sublime''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/ Feminist History of Philosophy], Charlotte Witt, 2007, [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hegel===
Hegel's view of women has been said to be misogynist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Shaun|title=Hegel, history, and interpretation|year=1997|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791433812|page=235|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OdlvNHnC6KMC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=Hegel+misogyny+misogynistic#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passages from Hegel's ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'' are frequently used to illustrate Hegel's supposed misogyny:
{{quote|"Women are capable of education, but they are not made for activities which demand a universal faculty such as the more advanced sciences, philosophy and certain forms of artistic production... Women regulate their actions not by the demands of universality, but by arbitrary inclinations and opinions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=rJqm5iQcsqoC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Hegel+misogyny+misogynistic#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Feminist reflections on the history of philosophy | isbn = 9781402024887 | author1 = Alanen | first1 = Lilli | last2 = Witt | first2 = Charlotte | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; G.W.F Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', quoted in Alanen, Lilli and Witt, Charlotte, ''Feminist reflections on the history of philosophy'''}}

== Feminist theory ==
In the late 20th century, feminist theorists claim that misogyny is both a cause and result of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] social structures.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Millet's ''Sexual Politics'', adapted from her doctoral dissertation is normally cited as the originator; though Katharine M Rogers had also published substantially, regarding her reading of misogyny in literature prior to this.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional feminist theorists describe many different attitudes as misogyny. According to feminists, in its most overt expression, a misogynist will openly hate all women simply because they are female.

In [[feminist theory]], other forms of misogyny may be less overt. Some misogynists may simply be prejudiced against all women, or may hate women who do not fall into one or more acceptable categories. Subscribers to one model claim that some misogynists think in terms of the [[Madonna-whore complex|mother/whore dichotomy]], where they hold that women can only be "mothers" or "whores." Another variant model is the one alleging that certain men think in terms of a [[virgin]]/whore dichotomy, in which women who do not adhere to an Abrahamic standard of moral purity are considered "whores".{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

The term ''misogynist'' is frequently used in a looser sense as a term of derision to describe anyone who holds a distasteful view about women as a group. Therefore, someone like [[Schopenhauer]] who proposes that women are naturally subservient to men is often regarded as a misogynist. As another example, a man who is considered by many including himself to be "a great lover of women", is often regarded as being misogynist. Examples of this type of man would be [[Giacomo Casanova]] and [[Don Juan]], who were both reputed to have had many libertine affairs with women.

In feminist theory, misogyny is a negative attitude towards women as a group, and so need not fully determine a misogynist's attitude towards each individual woman. The fact that someone holds misogynist views may not prevent him or her from having positive relationships with some women.

Conversely, simply having negative relationships with some women does not necessarily mean someone holds misogynistic views. The term, like most negative descriptions of attitudes, is applied to a wide variety of behaviors and attitudes.

As with other terms, the more antipathetic one's position is in regards to misogyny, the larger the number of misogynists and the greater variety of attitudes and behaviors who fall into one's perception of "misogynist".{{Specify|date=January 2007}} This is, of course, the subject of much controversy and debate with opinions ranging widely as to the extent and breadth of misogyny in society.

Feminist theorist [[Marilyn Frye]] claims that misogyny is [[Phallogocentrism|phallogocentric]] and [[homoerotic]] at its root. In ''Politics of Reality'', Frye analyzes the alleged misogyny characteristic of the fiction and Christian apologetics of [[C.S. Lewis]]. Frye argues that such misogyny privileges the masculine as a subject of erotic attention. She compares the alleged misogyny characteristic of Lewis' ideal of gender relations to underground [[male prostitution]] rings, which allegedly share the quality of men seeking to dominate subjects seen as less likely to take on submissive roles by a patriarchal society, but in both cases doing so as a theatrical mockery of women.&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Marilyn. ''The Politics of Reality: Essays in Feminist Theory''. Trumansburg, NY: Crossing, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Flood]], an Australian sociologist at the [[University of Wollongong]], has argued that "misandry lacks the systemic, transhistoric, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=michael+flood+misandry#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misandry&amp;f=false | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 9780415333436 | author1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
