'''Misogyny''' ({{pron-en|mɪˈsɒdʒɪni}}) is hatred (or contempt) of [[women]] or [[girls]].  Misogyny comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''misogunia'' (μισογυνία) from ''misos'' (μῖσος, "hatred") and ''gynē'' (γυνή, "woman"). It is parallel to [[misandry]]—the hatred of men or boys. Misogyny is also comparable with (but not the same as) [[misanthropy]] which is the hatred of humanity in general. The prefix [[miso-]], meaning 'Hatred' or 'To hate' applies in many other words, such as [[misandrist|misandry]], misocapny, [[wikt:misogamy|misogamy]], misarchy and misoxeny.

[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] reports that Greek philosophers considered misogyny to be caused by [[gynophobia]], a fear of women.&lt;ref name="Cicero"&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', Book 3, Chapter 11. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[A Greek-English Lexicon|LSJ]]'' typo has Book 4]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, feminist theorists proposed misogyny as both a cause and result of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] social structures.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Millet's ''Sexual Politics'', adapted from her doctoral dissertation is normally cited as the originator; though Katharine M Rogers had also published substantially, regarding her reading of misogyny in literature prior to this.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

''Misogyny'' is sometimes confused with the similar looking word—''misogamy'' (μισογαμία)—which means "hatred of marriage", hence the following error.&lt;ref&gt;Listed under both ''misogyny'' and ''misogamy'' by OED1, but cited in full only in the latter.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Any doubt he may have ever cherished in his ''misogamic'' breast concerning a woman's creative capacity.|''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''|[[7 January]] [[1889]]}}

An example of correct use, from the same period is:

{{quote|He ... walked the banks apart, a thing of ''misogyny'', in a suit of flannel.|[[Herman Charles Merivale]]|''Faucit of Balliol'', 1882}}

A clearer example of the sense, also from the same era but using the related word '''misogynist''', is provided by Thackeray.

{{quote|Confound all women, I say, muttered the young ''misogynist''.|[[William Makepeace Thackeray]]|''The Virginians'', 1878}}

Occasionally writers play on the similarity between ''misogyny'' and ''[[miscegeny]]'' (mixed-race marriage).

== Greek literature ==

[[File:Seated Euripides Louvre Ma343.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Euripides]]]]

''Misogyny'' comes into English from the ancient Greek word, ''misogunia'' ({{Polytonic|μισογυνία}}), which survives in two passages.&lt;ref name="Liddell"&gt;[[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott]], ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (''LSJ''), revised and augmented by Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940). ISBN 0198642261&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier, longer and more complete passage comes from a [[stoic]] philosopher called [[Antipater of Tarsus]] in a moral tract known as ''On Marriage'' (''c''. 150 BC).&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[editio princeps]]'' is on page 255 of volume three of ''Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta'' (''[[SVF]]'', Old Stoic Fragments), see [[Misogyny#External links|External links]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;A recent critical text with translation is in [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JlCnsyRBGf&amp;sig=7zsKzMVEBnV3tHag9z7E4cWCeLs&amp;hl=en Appendix A] to Will Deming, ''Paul on Marriage and Celibacy: The Hellenistic Background of 1 Corinthians 7'', pp. 221–226.

''Misogunia'' appears in the [[accusative case]] on page 224 of Deming, as the fifth word in line 33 of his Greek text.

It is split over lines 25–26 in von Arnim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipater argues that marriage is the foundation of the state, and considers it to be based on divine ([[Polytheism|polytheistic]]) decree.&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

Antipater uses ''misogunia'' to describe [[Euripides]]' usual writing—''tēn en tō graphein misogunian'' (τὴν μισογυνίαν ἐν τῷ γράφειν "the misogyny in the writing").&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

However, he mentions this by way of contrast. He goes on to quote Euripides at some length, writing in praise of wives.&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt; Antipater doesn't tell us what it is about Euripides' writing that he believes is misogynistic,&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;
he simply expresses his belief that even a man thought to hate women (namely Euripides) praises wives, so concluding his argument for the importance of marriage. He says, "This thing is truly heroic."&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

Euripides' reputation as a misogynist is known from another source. [[Athenaeus]], in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' or ''Banquet of the Learned'', has one of the diners quoting [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] who confirms the view was widespread, while offering [[Sophocles]]' comment on the matter.

{{quote|Euripides the poet, also, was much addicted to women: at all events Hieronymus in his Historical Commentaries speaks as follows,—"When some one told Sophocles that Euripides was a woman-hater, 'He may be,' said he, 'in his tragedies, but in his bed he is very fond of women.'"|Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophists'', 2nd/3rd century.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''[[The Deipnosophists]]'', Book 13 [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV3.p0080&amp;q1=hieronymus&amp;pview=hide §5.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite Euripides' reputation, Antipater is not the only writer to see appreciation of women in his writing. Katherine Henderson and Barbara McManus consider he "showed more empathy for women than any other ancient writer", citing "relatively modern critics" to support their claim.&lt;ref&gt;"Although Euripides showed more empathy for women than any other ancient writer, many of his lines out of context sound misogynistic; only relatively modern critics have been able to rescue him from his centuries-old reputation as a woman-hater." Katherine Usher Henderson and [http://www.cnr.edu/home/bmcmanus/ Barbara F. McManus], ''Half Humankind: Contexts and Texts of the Controversy about Women in England, 1540-1640'', ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1985), p. 6. ISBN 9780252011740&lt;/ref&gt;

The other surviving use of the original Greek word is by [[Chrysippus]], in a fragment from ''On affections'', quoted by [[Galen]] in ''[[Hippocrates]] on Affections''.&lt;ref&gt;''SVF'' 3:103. ''Mysogyny'' is the first word on the page.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''misogyny'' is the first in a short list of three "disaffections"—women (''misogunian''), wine (''misoinian'', μισοινίαν) and humanity (''misanthrōpian'', μισανθρωπίαν). 

Chrysippus' point is more abstract than Antipater's, and Galen quotes the passage as an example of an opinion contrary to his own. What is clear, however, is that he groups hatred of women with hatred of humanity generally, and even hatred of wine. "It was the prevailing medical opinion of his day that wine strengthens body and soul alike."&lt;ref name=Tieleman&gt;Teun L. Tieleman, ''[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=BBiw96gj8gkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chrysippus+on+affections&amp;sig=6f6Y84rR_VZzorWxiGfFMYViuvM Chrysippus' on Affections:] Reconstruction and Interpretations'', (Leiden: [[Brill]], 2003), p. 162. ISBN 9004129987&lt;/ref&gt;

So, as with his fellow stoic, Antipater, misogyny is viewed negatively, a [[disease]], a dislike of something that is good. It is this issue of conflicted or alternating emotions that was philosophically contentious to the ancient writers. Ricardo Salles suggests the general stoic view was that, "A man may not only alternate between philogyny and misogyny, philanthropy and misanthropy, but be prompted to each by the other."&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Salles, ''Metaphysics, Soul, and Ethics in Ancient Thought: Themes from the Work of Richard Sorabji'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005), 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]

''Misogynist'' is also found in the Greek—''misogunēs'' ({{Polytonic|μισογύνης}})—in ''Deipnosophistae'' (above) and in [[Plutarch]]'s ''Parallel Lives'', where it is used as the title of [[Heracles]] in the history of [[Phocion]]. 

It was also the title of a play by [[Menander]], which we know of from book seven (concerning [[Alexandria]]) of [[Strabo]]'s 17 volume ''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'',&lt;ref name=Liddell /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]],''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'', Book 7 [Alexandria] Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and quotations of Menander by [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Stobaeus]] that relate to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Menander]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=JC11wYBkrhkC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=The+Misogynist+(Misogynes)&amp;sig=y98In1TUseOWVGHrcOOMQ0Vx1dU ''The Plays and Fragments'',] translated by Maurice Balme, contributor [[Peter Brown]], [[Oxford University Press]], 2002. ISBN 0192839837&lt;/ref&gt;

Menander also wrote a play called ''Misoumenos'' (Μισούμενος) or ''The Man (She) Hated''. Another Greek play with a similar name, ''Misogunos'' (Μισόγυνος) or ''Woman-hater'', is reported by Cicero (in Latin) and attributed to [[Atilius]].&lt;ref&gt;He is supported (or followed) by [[Theognostus the Grammarian]]'s 9th century ''Canones'', edited by [[John Antony Cramer]], ''Anecdota Graeca e codd. manuscriptis bibliothecarum Oxoniensium'', vol. 2, ([[Oxford University Press]], 1835), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The context is worth quoting in full, because it deals directly with matters already discussed in this article.

In summary, Greek literature considered misogyny to be a disease, an anti-social condition, in that it ran contrary to their perceptions of the value of women as wives, and of the family as the foundation of society. These points are widely noted in the secondary literature.&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

== Feminist theory ==

{{Original research|date=September 2007}}
{{Too few opinions|date=September 2009}}

Traditional feminist theorists propose many different forms of misogyny. In its most overt expression, a misogynist will openly hate all women simply because they are female.

Other forms of misogyny may be less overt. Some misogynists may simply be prejudiced against all women, or may hate women who do not fall into one or more acceptable categories. Subscribers to one model, the [[Madonna-whore complex|mother/whore dichotomy]], hold that women can only be "mothers" or "whores." Another variant is the [[virgin]]/whore dichotomy, in which women who do not adhere to a saintly standard of moral purity (Abrahamic) are considered "whores".{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Frequently, the term ''misogynist'' is used in a looser sense as a term of derision to describe anyone who holds an unpopular or distasteful view about women as a group. A man who considers himself "a great lover of women," therefore, might somewhat paradoxically be termed a misogynist by those who consider this treatment of women to be sexist. Archetypes of this type of man might be [[Giacomo Casanova]] and [[Don Juan]], who were both reputed for their many libertine affairs with women.

Misogyny is a negative attitude towards women as a group, and so need not fully determine a misogynist's attitude towards each individual woman. The fact that someone holds misogynist views may not prevent him or her from having positive relationships with some women. 

Conversely, simply having negative relationships with some women does not necessarily mean someone holds misogynistic views. The term, like most negative descriptions of attitudes, is used as an epithet and applied to a wide variety of behaviors and attitudes. 

As with other terms, the more antipathetic one's position is in regards to misogyny, the larger the number of misogynists and the greater variety of attitudes and behaviors who fall into one's perception of "misogynist".{{Specify|date=January 2007}} This is, of course, the subject of much controversy and debate with opinions ranging widely as to the extent and breadth of misogyny in society.

Feminist theorist [[Marilyn Frye]] argues that misogyny is [[Phallogocentrism|phallogocentric]] and [[homoerotic]] at its root. In ''Politics of Reality'', Frye analyzes the alleged misogyny characteristic of the fiction and Christian apologetics of [[C.S. Lewis]]. Frye argues that such misogyny privileges the masculine as a subject of erotic attention. She compares the misogyny characteristic of Lewis' ideal of gender relations to underground [[male prostitution]] rings, which share the same quality of men seeking to dominate subjects seen as less likely to take on submissive roles by a patriarchal society, but in both cases doing so as a theatrical mockery of women.&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Marilyn.

J Holland sees evidence of misogyny in the [[mythology]] of the ancient world. In [[Greek mythology]], the human race had already existed before the creation of women — a peaceful, autonomous existence as a companion to the gods. 

When [[Prometheus]] decides to steal the secret of fire from the gods, [[Zeus]] becomes infuriated and decides to punish humankind with an "evil thing for their delight" — [[Pandora]], the first woman, who carried a jar (usually described — incorrectly — as a box) she was told to never open. 

[[Epimetheus]] (the brother of Prometheus) is overwhelmed by her beauty, disregards Prometheus' warnings about her, and marries her. Pandora cannot resist peeking into the jar, and by opening it all evil is unleashed into the world — [[childbirth|labour]], [[sickness]], [[old age]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J: "Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice," pp. 12-13. Avalon Publishing Group, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

J Holland also sees evidence of misogyny in the [[Christian]] view on the [[Fall of Man]] based on the Book [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], which according to Christian interpretation brought tragedy and death into the world by a woman. (See also [[Original Sin]].)

[[Katherine M. Rogers]] in ''The Troublesome Helpmate'' argues that the [[Pauline epistles]] in the New Testament contain texts that have historically been used by some Christian misogynists.

{{quote|The foundations of early Christian misogyny — its guilt about sex, its insistence on female subjection, its dread of female seduction — are all in St. Paul's epistles. |&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katherine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Quran declares that "Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means." (Sura al-Nisa´ 4:34) 

Taj Hashmi discusses misogyny in relation to Muslim culture, and Bangladesh specifically, in the rather biased ''Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh''. 

{{quote|[T]hanks to the subjective interpretations of the Quran (almost exclusively by men), the preponderance of the misogynic mullahs and the regressive Shariah law in most “Muslim” countries, Islam is synonymously known as a promoter of misogyny in its worst form.

However, in the Arabic Quranic scripture, "Qawamoon", which is translated as manager or responsible for, also means that it is the man's responsibility to take care of the woman, feeding and clothing her and her children, and providing them with a place to live.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In contrast to this somewhat polar view there are instances within the Qu'ran that, for its time of revelation, put it far ahead of many other religions and societies of the same era and for some time after. The Qu'ran explicitly institutes the protection of a woman's inheritance, allows them the right to divorce and fair provision of assets upon divorce in ''Surat At-Talaq''. Also within the Qu'ran the figure of Eve is relieved of the blame for Man's downfall, unlike Christianity, as both Eve and Adam are stated as equally responsible for succumbing to the Devil's influence.

== Philosophy ==
===Schopenhauer===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] has been accused of misogyny for his essay "On Women" (Über die Weiber), in which he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" on female affairs. He claimed that "woman is by nature meant to obey." 

The essay does give two compliments however: that "women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [[man|men]] are" and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others. However, the latter was discounted as weakness rather than humanitarian virtue.

===Nietzsche===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is known for arguing that every higher form of civilization implied stricter controls on women (''[[Beyond Good and Evil (book)|Beyond Good and Evil]]'', 7:238); he frequently insulted women, but is best known for phrases such as "Women are less than shallow," and "Are you going to women? Do not forget the whip!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burgard |first=Peter J. |title=Nietzsche and the Feminine |origdate= |year=1994 |month=May |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville, VA |isbn=0-8139-1495-7 |pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nietzsche's reputation as a misogynist is disputed by some, pointing out that he also made unflattering statements about men. Nietzsche can easily be interpreted as [[anti-feminist]], believing that women were primarily mothers and opposing the modern notion of [[women's liberation]] on the grounds that he considered it a form of [[slave morality]]. 

Whether or not this amounts to misogyny, whether his polemic statements against women are meant to be taken literally, and the exact nature of his opinions of women, are more controversial.&lt;ref name="Holub"&gt;Robert C. Holub, ''Nietzsche and The Women's Question''. [http://www-learning.berkeley.edu/robertholub/teaching/syllabi/Lecture_Nietzsche_Women.pdf Coursework for Berkley University]&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche had advised his readers to 'read him well' (i.e. not necessarily at face value) as to not misunderstand his statements and see the reality and fact of his words.

===Weininger===
The philosopher [[Otto Weininger]] has been accused of misogyny for his 1903 book ''[[Sex and Character]]'', in which he characterizes the "woman" part of each individual as being essentially "nothing," and having no real existence, having no effective consciousness or rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Izenberg |first=Gerald N. |year=2001 | month = June |title=Review of Chandak Sengoopta's Otto Weininger: Sex, Science, and Self in Imperial Vienna | journal = The American Historical Review | volume = 106 | issue = 3 |pages=1074–1075 |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8762%28200106%29106%3A3%3C1074%3AOWSSAS%3E2.0.CO%3B2-5 |accessdate=2007-01-08 | doi = 10.2307/2692497}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Weininger says, "No men who really think deeply about women retain a high opinion of them; men either despise women or they have never thought seriously about them." The author [[August Strindberg]] praised Weininger for probably having solved the hardest of all problems, the "woman problem."
