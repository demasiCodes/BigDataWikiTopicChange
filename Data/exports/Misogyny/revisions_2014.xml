'''Misogyny''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|s|ɒ|dʒ|ɪ|n|i}}) is the hatred or dislike of [[women]] or [[girl]]s. Misogyny can be manifested in numerous ways, including [[sexual discrimination]], denigration of women, [[violence against women]], and [[sexual objectification]] of women.&lt;ref name=Code2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Code|first=Lorraine|title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-13274-6|edition=1st|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kramarae2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Kramarae|first=Cheris|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92088-4|pages=1374–1377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misogyny can be found within many mythologies of the ancient world as well as various religions. In addition, many influential [[Western philosophy|Western philosophers]] have been described as misogynistic.&lt;ref name=Code2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clack1999/&gt;

==Definitions==
According to sociologist Allan G. Johnson, "misogyny is a cultural attitude of hatred for females because they are female." Johnson argues that:
{{quote|Misogyny .... is a central part of sexist prejudice and ideology and, as such, is an important basis for the oppression of females in male-dominated societies. Misogyny is manifested in many different ways, from jokes to pornography to violence to the self-contempt women may be taught to feel toward their own bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=allan+johnson+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: A user's guide to sociological language | isbn = 978-0-631-21681-0 | author1 = Johnson | first1 = Allan G | year = 2000 | accessdate = November 21, 2011}}, ("ideology" in all small capitals in original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sociologist [[Michael Flood]], at the [[University of Wollongong]], defines misogyny as the hatred of women, and notes:
{{quote|Though most common in men, misogyny also exists in and is practiced by women against other women or even themselves. Misogyny functions as an ideology or belief system that has accompanied patriarchal, or male-dominated societies for thousands of years and continues to place women in subordinate positions with limited access to power and decision making. [...] Aristotle contended that women exist as natural deformities or imperfect males [...] Ever since, women in [[Western culture]]s have internalised their role as societal scapegoats, influenced in the twenty-first century by multimedia objectification of women with its culturally sanctioned self-loathing and fixations on plastic surgery, anorexia and bulimia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA444&amp;dq=michael+flood+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 978-0-415-33343-6 | author1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dictionaries define misogyny as "hatred of women"&lt;ref&gt;''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press (Oxford Univ. Press), [4th] ed. 1993 (ISBN 0-19-861271-0)) (''SOED'') ("[h]atred of women").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin, 1992 (ISBN 0-395-44895-6)) ("[h]atred of women").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged'' (G. &amp; C. Merriam, 1966) ("a hatred of women").&lt;/ref&gt; and as "hatred, dislike, or mistrust of women".&lt;ref&gt;''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary'' (N.Y.: Random House, 2d ed. 2001 (ISBN 0-375-42566-7)).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, primarily in response to events occurring in the [[Australian Parliament]], the [[Macquarie Dictionary]] (which documents [[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]]) expanded the definition to include not only hatred of women but also "entrenched prejudices against women".&lt;ref name=Macquarie&gt;{{cite news|last=Daley|first=Gemma|title=Macquarie Dictionary has last word on misogyny|url=http://www.afr.com/p/national/macquarie_dictionary_has_last_word_NzrQFdWcPJG6G8qLRRiZtK|accessdate=21 October 2012|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counterpart of misogyny is [[misandry]], the hatred or dislike of men; the [[antonym]] of misogyny is [[philogyny]], the love or fondness of women.

== Classical Greece ==
[[File:Seated Euripides Louvre Ma343.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Euripides]]]]

In his book ''City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens'', J.W. Roberts argues that older than tragedy and comedy was a misogynistic tradition in Greek literature, reaching back at least as far as [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=73kTsV4FdrQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Sokrates+misogyny+misogynist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens | isbn = 978-0-203-19479-9 | author1 = Roberts | first1 = J.W | date = 2002-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Misogyny'' comes into English from the ancient Greek word ''misogunia'' ({{lang|grc|μισογυνία}}), which survives in two passages.&lt;ref name="Liddell"&gt;[[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'' (''LSJ''), revised and augmented by Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940). ISBN 0-19-864226-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier, longer, and more complete passage comes from a moral tract known as ''On Marriage'' (''c''. 150 BC) by the [[Stoicism|stoic]] philosopher [[Antipater of Tarsus]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[editio princeps]]'' is on page 255 of volume three of ''[[Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta]]'' (''SVF'', Old Stoic Fragments), see [[Misogyny#External links|External links]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;A recent critical text with translation is in [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JlCnsyRBGf&amp;sig=7zsKzMVEBnV3tHag9z7E4cWCeLs&amp;hl=en Appendix A] to Will Deming, ''Paul on Marriage and Celibacy: The Hellenistic Background of 1 Corinthians 7'', pp. 221–226.

''Misogunia'' appears in the [[accusative case]] on page 224 of Deming, as the fifth word in line 33 of his Greek text.

It is split over lines 25–26 in von Arnim.&lt;/ref&gt; Antipater argues that marriage is the foundation of the state, and considers it to be based on divine ([[Polytheism|polytheistic]]) decree. Antipater uses ''misogunia'' to describe [[Euripides]]' usual writing—''tēn misogunian en tō graphein '' (τὴν μισογυνίαν ἐν τῷ γράφειν "the misogyny in the writing").&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt; However, he mentions this by way of contrast. He goes on to quote Euripides at some length, writing in praise of wives. Antipater does not tell us what it is about Euripides' writing that he believes is misogynistic, he simply expresses his belief that even a man thought to hate women (namely Euripides) praises wives, so concluding his argument for the importance of marriage. He says, "This thing is truly heroic."&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

Euripides' reputation as a misogynist is also evidenced in another source; in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' (''Banquet of the Learned''), [[Athenaeus]] has one of the diners quoting [[Hieronymus of Cardia]], who confirms that the view was widespread, while offering [[Sophocles]]' comment on the matter:
{{clear}}
{{quote|Euripides the poet, also, was much addicted to women: at all events Hieronymus in his Historical Commentaries speaks as follows,—"When some one told Sophocles that Euripides was a woman-hater, 'He may be,' said he, 'in his tragedies, but in his bed he is very fond of women.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''[[The Deipnosophists]]'', Book 13 [http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081202152211/http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV3.p0080&amp;q1=hieronymus&amp;pview=hide Book 13]&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Athenaeus]]|source=''[[The Deipnosophists]]'', Book 13}}

Despite Euripides' reputation, Antipater is not the only writer to see appreciation of women in his writing. Katherine Henderson and Barbara McManus state that he "showed more empathy for women than any other ancient writer", citing "relatively modern critics" to support their claim.&lt;ref&gt;"Although Euripides showed more empathy for women than any other ancient writer, many of his lines out of context sound misogynistic; only relatively modern critics have been able to rescue him from his centuries-old reputation as a woman-hater." Katherine Usher Henderson and [http://www.cnr.edu/home/bmcmanus/ Barbara F. McManus], ''Half Humankind: Contexts and Texts of the Controversy about Women in England, 1540-1640'', ([[University of Illinois Press]], 1985), p. 6. ISBN 978-0-252-01174-0&lt;/ref&gt;

The other surviving use of the original Greek word is by [[Chrysippus]], in a fragment from ''On affections'', quoted by [[Galen]] in ''[[Hippocrates]] on Affections''.&lt;ref&gt;''SVF'' 3:103. ''Mysogyny'' is the first word on the page.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''misogyny'' is the first in a short list of three "disaffections"—women (''misogunian''), wine (''misoinian'', μισοινίαν) and humanity (''misanthrōpian'', μισανθρωπίαν). Chrysippus' point is more abstract than Antipater's, and Galen quotes the passage as an example of an opinion contrary to his own. What is clear, however, is that he groups hatred of women with hatred of humanity generally, and even hatred of wine. "It was the prevailing medical opinion of his day that wine strengthens body and soul alike."&lt;ref name=Tieleman&gt;Teun L. Tieleman, ''[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=BBiw96gj8gkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chrysippus+on+affections&amp;sig=6f6Y84rR_VZzorWxiGfFMYViuvM Chrysippus' on Affections:] Reconstruction and Interpretations'', (Leiden: [[Brill Publishers]], 2003), p. 162. ISBN 90-04-12998-7&lt;/ref&gt; So Chrysippus, like his fellow stoic Antipater, views misogyny negatively, as a [[disease]]; a dislike of something that is good. It is this issue of conflicted or alternating emotions that was philosophically contentious to the ancient writers. Ricardo Salles suggests that the general stoic view was that "[a] man may not only alternate between philogyny and misogyny, philanthropy and misanthropy, but be prompted to each by the other."&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Salles, ''Metaphysics, Soul, and Ethics in Ancient Thought: Themes from the Work of Richard Sorabji'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005), 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] has also been accused of being a misogynist; he has written that women were inferior to men. According to Cynthia Freeland (1994):

{{quote|Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity': which contributes only matter and not form to the generation of offspring; that in general 'a woman is perhaps an inferior being'; that female characters in a tragedy will be inappropriate if they are too brave or too clever[.]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/#Mis |title=Feminist History of Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic'', Nickolas Pappas describes the "problem of misogyny" and states:

{{quote|In the ''Apology'', Socrates calls those who plead for their lives in court "no better than women" (35b)... The ''Timaeus'' warns men that if they live immorally they will be reincarnated as women (42b-c; cf. 75d-e). The ''Republic'' contains a number of comments in the same spirit (387e, 395d-e, 398e, 431b-c, 469d), evidence of nothing so much as of contempt toward women. Even Socrates' words for his bold new proposal about marriage... suggest that the women are to be "held in common" by men. He never says that the men might be held in common by the women... We also have to acknowledge Socrates' insistence that men surpass women at any task that both sexes attempt (455c, 456a), and his remark in Book 8 that one sign of democracy's moral failure is the sexual equality it promotes (563b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=VujWajIWxkUC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Socrates+misogyny+misogynist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic | isbn = 978-0-415-29996-1 | author1 = Pappas | first1 = Nickolas | date = 2003-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Misogynist'' is also found in the Greek—''misogunēs'' ({{lang|grc|μισογύνης}})—in ''Deipnosophistae'' (above) and in [[Plutarch]]'s ''Parallel Lives'', where it is used as the title of [[Heracles]] in the history of [[Phocion]]. It was the title of a play by [[Menander]], which we know of from book seven (concerning [[Alexandria]]) of [[Strabo]]'s 17 volume ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'',&lt;ref name=Liddell /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]],''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'', Book 7 [Alexandria] Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and quotations of Menander by [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Stobaeus]] that relate to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Menander]], [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=JC11wYBkrhkC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=The+Misogynist+(Misogynes)&amp;sig=y98In1TUseOWVGHrcOOMQ0Vx1dU ''The Plays and Fragments''], translated by Maurice Balme, contributor Peter Brown{{disambiguation needed|{{subst:DATE}}|date=December 2011}}, [[Oxford University Press]], 2002. ISBN 0-19-283983-7&lt;/ref&gt; Menander also wrote a play called ''Misoumenos'' (Μισούμενος) or ''The Man (She) Hated''. Another Greek play with a similar name, ''Misogunos'' (Μισόγυνος) or ''Woman-hater'', is reported by [[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (in Latin) and attributed to the poet [[Atilia (gens)#Members of the gens|Marcus Atilius]].&lt;ref&gt;He is supported (or followed) by [[Theognostus the Grammarian]]'s 9th century ''Canones'', edited by [[John Antony Cramer]], ''Anecdota Graeca e codd. manuscriptis bibliothecarum Oxoniensium'', vol. 2, ([[Oxford University Press]], 1835), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]

Cicero reports that Greek philosophers considered misogyny to be caused by [[gynophobia]], a fear of women.&lt;ref name="Cicero"&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', Book 3, Chapter 11. &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''[[A Greek–English Lexicon|LSJ]]'' typo has Book 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is the same with other diseases; as the desire of glory, a passion for women, to which the Greeks give the name of ''philogyneia'': and thus all other diseases and sicknesses are generated. But those feelings which are the contrary of these are supposed to have fear for their foundation, as a hatred of women, such as is displayed in the ''Woman-hater'' of Atilius; or the hatred of the whole human species, as Timon is reported to have done, whom they call the Misanthrope. Of the same kind is inhospitality. And all these diseases proceed from a certain dread of such things as they hate and avoid.&lt;ref name="Cicero"/&gt;|Cicero|''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', 1st century BC.}}

The more common form of this general word for woman hating is ''misogunaios'' ({{lang|grc|μισογύναιος}}).&lt;ref name=Liddell /&gt;

In summary, Greek literature considered misogyny to be a [[disease]]—an [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] condition—in that it ran contrary to their perceptions of the value of women as wives and of the family as the foundation of society. These points are widely noted in the secondary literature.&lt;ref name=Deming /&gt;

===Ancient Greek===
In ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', [[Jack Holland (writer)|Jack Holland]] claims that there is evidence of misogyny in the [[mythology]] of the ancient world. In [[Greek mythology]] according to Hesiod, the human race had already experienced a peaceful, autonomous existence as a companion to the gods before the creation of women. When [[Prometheus]] decides to steal the secret of fire from the gods, [[Zeus]] becomes infuriated and decides to punish humankind with an "evil thing for their delight". This "evil thing" is [[Pandora]], the first woman, who carried a jar (usually described—incorrectly—as a box) which she was told to never open. [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]] (the brother of Prometheus) is overwhelmed by her beauty, disregards Prometheus' warnings about her, and marries her. Pandora cannot resist peeking into the jar, and by opening it she unleashes into the world all evil; [[childbirth|labour]], [[Illness|sickness]], [[old age]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J: ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', pp. 12-13. Avalon Publishing Group, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Women in Buddhism}}
In his book ''The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender'', professor Bernard Faure of [[Columbia University]] argued generally that "Buddhism is paradoxically neither as sexist nor as egalitarian as is usually thought." He remarked, "Many feminist scholars have emphasized the misogynistic (or at least androcentric) nature of Buddhism" and stated that Buddhism morally exalts its male monks while the mothers and wives of the monks also have important roles. Additionally, he wrote:
{{quote|While some scholars see Buddhism as part of a movement of emancipation, others see it as a source of oppression. Perhaps this is only a distinction between optimists and pessimists, if not between idealists and realists... As we begin to realize, the term "Buddhism" does not designate a monolithic entity, but covers a number of doctrines, ideologies, and practices--some of which seem to invite, tolerate, and even cultivate "otherness" on their margins.&lt;ref name=bernard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7538.html |title=Sample Chapter for Faure, B.: The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender |publisher=Press.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', Jack Holland writes also of evidence of misogyny in the [[Old Testament]] story of the [[fall of man]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].

Differences in tradition and interpretations of scripture have caused sects of Christianity to differ in their beliefs with regard to misogyny.

In ''The Troublesome Helpmate'', Katharine M. Rogers claims that Christianity is misogynistic, and she lists what she says are specific examples of misogyny in the [[Pauline epistles]]. She states:

{{quote|The foundations of early Christian misogyny — its guilt about sex, its insistence on female subjection, its dread of female seduction — are all in St. Paul's epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katharine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In K. K. Ruthven's ''Feminist Literary Studies: An Introduction'', Ruthven makes reference to Rogers' book and argues that the "legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called 'Fathers' of the Church, like [[Tertullian]], who thought a woman was not only 'the gateway of the devil' but also 'a temple built over a sewer'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=clOT7Hg2CfAC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=christian+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=christian%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = Feminist literary studies: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-521-39852-7 | author1 = Ruthven | first1 = K.

However, some other scholars have argued that Christianity does not include misogynistic principles, or at least that a proper interpretation of Christianity would not include misogynistic principles. David M. Scholer, a biblical scholar at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], stated that the verse Galatians 3:28 ("There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus") is "the fundamental Pauline theological basis for the inclusion of women and men as equal and mutual partners in all of the ministries of the church."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbmw.org/Journal/Vol-8-No-1/Galatians-3-28-Prooftext-or-Context ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hove, Richard. ''Equality in Christ? Galatians 3:28 and the Gender Dispute''. (Wheaton: Crossway, 1999) Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Equality in Christ? Galatians 3.28 and the Gender Dispute'', Richard Hove argues that—while Galatians 3:28 does mean that one's sex does not affect salvation—"there remains a pattern in which the wife is to emulate the church's submission to Christ ({{bibleverse||Eph|5:21-33|KJV}}) and the husband is to emulate Christ's love for the church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=WcyqvWfJnyYC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=ken+campbell+3:28+Rochard+Hove#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Marriage and family in the biblical world | isbn = 978-0-8308-2737-4 | author1 = Campbell | first1 = Ken M | date = 2003-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Christian Men Who Hate Women'', clinical psychologist Margaret J. Rinck has written that Christian social culture often allows a misogynist "misuse of the biblical ideal of submission". However, she argues that this a distortion of the "healthy relationship of mutual submission" which is actually specified in Christian doctrine, where "[l]ove is based on a deep, mutual respect as the guiding principle behind all decisions, actions, and plans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christian Men Who Hate Women: Healing Hurting Relationships|first=Margaret J.|last=Rinck

===Islam===

{{See also|Namus|Islam and domestic violence}}

The fourth chapter (or ''[[sura]]'') of the [[Quran]] is called "Women" ([[An-Nisa]]). The [[An-Nisa, 34|34th verse]] is a key verse in feminist criticism of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;"Verse 34 of Chapter 4 is an oft-cited Verse in the Qur'an used to demonstrate that Islam is structurally patriarchal, and thus Islam internalizes male dominance."
Dahlia Eissa, "[http://www.wluml.org/node/443#_ftn42 Constructing the Notion of Male Superiority over Women in Islam]: The influence of sex and gender stereotyping in the interpretation of the Qur'an and the implications for a modernist exegesis of rights", Occasional Paper 11 in ''Occasional Papers'' (Empowerment International, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
The verse reads: "Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great."

In his book ''Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh'', Taj Hashmi discusses misogyny in relation to Muslim culture (and to [[Bangladesh]] in particular), writing:

{{quote|[T]hanks to the subjective interpretations of the Quran (almost exclusively by men), the preponderance of the misogynic mullahs and the regressive Shariah law in most "Muslim" countries, Islam is synonymously known as a promoter of misogyny in its worst form. Although there is no way of defending the so-called "great" traditions of Islam as libertarian and egalitarian with regard to women, we may draw a line between the Quranic texts and the corpus of avowedly misogynic writing and spoken words by the mullah having very little or no relevance to the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Hashmi, Taj. ''[http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/taj_hashmi/Popular_Islam_and_Misogyn1.pdf Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh]''. Retrieved August 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his book ''[[No god but God]]'', [[University of Southern California]] professor [[Reza Aslan]] wrote that "misogynistic interpretation" has been persistently attached to An-Nisa, 34 because commentary on the Quran "has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men".&lt;ref name=issue&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261.html|publisher=Washington Post|title=Clothes Aren't the Issue|date=October 22, 2006|first=Asra Q.|last=Nomani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
[[File:Sikh Gurus with Bhai Bala and Bhai Mardana.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guru Nanak]] in the center, amongst other Sikh figures]]
{{See also|Women in Sikhism}}

Scholars William M. Reynolds and Julie A. Webber have written that [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of the [[Sikh]] faith tradition, was a "fighter for women's rights" that was "in no way misogynistic" in contrast to some of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=87|title=Expanding curriculum theory: dis/positions and lines of flight |author=Julie A.

===Scientology===
{{See also|Scientology and marriage}}
In his book ''Scientology: A New Slant on Life'', [[L. Ron Hubbard]] wrote the following passage:
{{quote|A society in which women are taught anything but the management of a family, the care of men, and the creation of the future generation is a society which is on its way out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

In the same book, he also wrote:

{{quote|The historian can peg the point where a society begins its sharpest decline at the instant when women begin to take part, on an equal footing with men, in political and business affairs, since this means that the men are decadent and the women are no longer women. This is not a sermon on the role or position of women; it is a statement of bald and basic fact.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

These passages, along with other ones of a similar nature from Hubbard, have been criticised by Alan Scherstuhl of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' as expressions of hatred towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Church of Scientology does not want you to see L. Ron Hubbard's woman-hatin' book chapter|publisher=[[The Village Voice]]|first=Alan|last=Scherstuhl|date=June 21, 2010|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/06/the_church_of_s.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Baylor University]] professor [[J. Gordon Melton]] has written that Hubbard later disregarded and abrogated much of his earlier views about women, which Melton views as merely echoes of common prejudices at the time. Melton has also stated that the [[Church of Scientology]] welcomes both genders equally at all levels—from leadership positions to [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] and so on—since Scientologists view people as [[Thetan|spiritual beings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Scientology/Ethics-Morality-Community/Gender-and-Sexuality.html |title=Gender and Sexuality |publisher=Patheos.com |date=2012-07-26 |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophers (17th to 20th century)==
Numerous influential [[Western philosophy|Western philosophers]] have been accused of being misogynist, including [[René Descartes]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F.

===Weininger===
[[Otto Weininger]] has been accused of misogyny for his book ''[[Sex and Character]]'', in which he characterizes the "woman" part of each individual as being essentially "nothing", as having no real existence, and as having no effective consciousness or rationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Izenberg |first=Gerald N. |date=June 2001 |title=Review of Chandak Sengoopta's Otto Weininger: Sex, Science, and Self in Imperial Vienna | journal = The American Historical Review | volume = 106 | issue = 3 |pages=1074–1075| doi = 10.2307/2692497 |publisher=The American Historical Review, Vol. 106, No. 3 |last2=Sengoopta |first2=Chandak | jstor=2692497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schopenhauer===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] has been accused of misogyny for his essay "On Women" (Über die Weiber), in which he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" on female affairs. He argued that women are "by nature meant to obey" as they are "childish, frivolous, and short sighted".&lt;ref name=Clack1999/&gt; He claimed that no woman had ever produced great art or "any work of permanent value".&lt;ref name=Clack1999/&gt; He also argued that women did not possess any real beauty:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|title=The Story of Philosophy|date=1983|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=067120159X|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is only a man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual impulse that could give the name of the ''fair sex'' to that under-sized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short-legged race; for the whole beauty of the sex is bound up with this impulse.

===Nietzsche===
{{Main|Friedrich Nietzsche's views on women}}
In ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] stated that stricter controls on women was a condition of "every elevation of culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche|first=Friedrich|year=1886|title=Beyond Good and Evil|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4363/4363-h/4363-h.htm|location=Germany||accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', he has a female character say "You are going to women?

===Kant===
In the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', [[Charlotte Witt]] wrote  that the writings of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and of [[Aristotle]] contain overt statements of sexism and racism.

==Feminist theory==
{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Waves}}
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2014}}
Traditional feminist theorists{{Who|date=April 2012}} describe many different attitudes as misogyny. According to feminists,{{Who|date=April 2012}} the most overt expression of misogyny is the open hatred of all women based purely on the fact that they are female. Feminists{{Who|date=April 2012}} further claim that there are also other, less overt forms of misogyny. Some misogynists may simply be prejudiced against all women, or may hate women who do not fall into one or more acceptable categories. The term, like most negative descriptions of attitudes, is applied to a wide variety of behaviors and attitudes.

Subscribers to one model claim that some misogyny results from the [[Madonna–whore complex]], which is the inability to see women as anything other than "mothers" or "whores"; people with this complex place each encountered woman into one of these categories. Another variant model is the one alleging that one cause of misogyny is some men thinking in terms of a virgin/whore dichotomy, which results in them considering as "whores" any women who do not adhere to an [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] standard of moral purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07491409.2000.10162569#.U8QlTmdOXcs |first=Leah M. |last=Wyman |first2=George N. |last2=Dionisopolous |year=2000 |title=Transcending The Virgin/Whore Dichotomy: Telling Mina's Story in ''Bram Stoker's Dracula'' |journal=[[Women's Studies in Communication]] |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=209-237 |doi=10.1080/07491409.2000.10162569 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''misogynist'' is frequently used in a loose sense as a derogatory term for anyone who is considered to hold a prejudiced view about women as a group. Some scholars{{who|date=April 2012}} apply the term to some individuals, such as Schopenhauer, who propose that women are naturally subservient to men. The term is also used by some to refer to men who are considered by many to be "[[wiktionary:womanizer|womanizers]]".

In feminist theory,{{clarify|date=April 2012}} misogyny is a negative attitude towards women as a group, and as such it does not necessarily fully determine a misogynist's attitude towards each individual woman. The fact that someone holds misogynistic views does not necessarily prevent that person from having positive relationships with some women. Conversely, the fact that someone has negative relationships with some women does not necessarily mean that that person holds misogynistic views.

Feminist theorist [[Marilyn Frye]] claims that misogyny is, at its root, [[Phallogocentrism|phallogocentric]] and [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]]. In ''[[The Politics of Reality]]'', Frye says that there is a misogynistic character to [[C. S. Lewis]]' fiction and Christian apologetics, and argues that such misogyny privileges the masculine as a subject of erotic attention. She compares Lewis' ideal of gender relations to underground [[male prostitution]] rings, contending that they share the quality of men seeking to dominate subjects seen as less likely to take on submissive roles by a patriarchal society, but do so as a theatrical mockery of women.&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Marilyn. ''The Politics of Reality: Essays in Feminist Theory''. Trumansburg, NY: Crossing, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2012}}

In the late 20th century, [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] theorists claimed that misogyny is both a cause and a result of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Kate Millet's ''Sexual Politics'', adapted from her doctoral dissertation is normally cited as the originator of this viewpoint; though Katharine M Rogers had also published similar ideas previously.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Michael Flood]] has argued that "misandry lacks the systemic, transhistoric, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=michael+flood+misandry#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misandry&amp;f=false | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 978-0-415-33343-6 | author1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = 2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept ==

[[Camille Paglia]], a self-described "dissident feminist" who has often been at odds with other academic feminists, argues that there are serious flaws in the [[Marxism]]-inspired interpretation of misogyny that is prevalent in second-wave feminism. In contrast, Paglia argues that a close reading of historical texts reveals that men do not ''hate'' women but ''fear'' them.&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille (1991). ''[[Sexual Personae]]'', NY:Vintage, Chapter 1 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt;
