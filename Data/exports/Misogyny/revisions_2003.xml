Misogyny is usually regarded as directed against women by some men, but women can also harbor misogynist views. In [[feminist]] theory, misogyny is recognised as a political ideology similar to [[racism]] or [[anti-semitism]], existing to justify and reproduce the subordination of women by men.

Interestingly, in common usage the term "misogynist" can be applied to anyone who holds an unpopular or distasteful view about women as a group. Therefore it is quite possible for a man who is a great lover of women, with many female lovers, to be a "misogynist".
