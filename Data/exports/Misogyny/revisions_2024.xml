'''Misogyny''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|ˈ|s|ɒ|dʒ|ᵻ|n|i}}) is hatred of, contempt for, or prejudice against [[Woman|women]] or [[girl]]s. It is a form of [[sexism]] that can keep women at a lower [[social status]] than [[Man|men]], thus maintaining the social roles of [[patriarchy]]. Misogyny has been widely practised for thousands of years. It is reflected in [[art]], [[literature]], human societal structure, historical events, [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], and [[religion]] worldwide.

An example of misogyny is [[violence against women]], which includes [[domestic violence]] and, in its most extreme forms, [[misogynist terrorism]] and [[femicide]]. Misogyny also often operates through [[sexual harassment]], coercion, and psychological techniques aimed at controlling women, and by legally or [[social exclusion|socially excluding]] women from full citizenship. In some cases, misogyny rewards women for accepting an inferior status.

Misogyny can be understood both as an attitude held by individuals, primarily by men, and as a widespread cultural custom or system. Sometimes misogyny manifests in obvious and bold ways; other times it is more subtle or disguised in ways that provide plausible deniability. 

In [[feminist]] thought, misogyny also includes the rejection of feminine qualities. It holds in contempt institutions, work, hobbies, or habits associated with women. It rejects any aspects of men that are seen as feminine or unmanly.{{Undue weight inline|date=September 2023|reason=There are only a few sources which back up this and are often opinions}} [[Racism]] and other prejudices may reinforce and overlap with misogyny.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' the English word "misogyny" was coined in the middle of the 17th century from the Greek misos 'hatred' + gunē 'woman'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.lexico.com/definition/misogyny| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200226091051/https://www.lexico.com/definition/misogyny| url-status = dead| archive-date = 26 February 2020| title = MISOGYNY {{!}} Meaning &amp; Definition for UK English {{!}} Lexico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was rarely used until it was popularised by [[second wave feminism|second-wave feminism]] in the 1970s.

The American ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'' distinguishes misogyny, "a hatred of women", from [[sexism]], which denotes sex-based discrimination, and "behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/misogyny#note-1|title=Definition of MISOGYNY|date=11 August 2023|access-date=12 October 2021|archive-date=17 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117042928/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/misogyny#note-1|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social psychology research{{vague|date=October 2023}} describes overt misogyny as "blatant hostile sexism" that raises resistance in women, as opposed to "manifestations of benevolent sexism" or [[chivalry]] that lead women to behave in a manner perpetuating patriarchal arrangements.&lt;ref name="The Madonna-Whore Dichotomy Is Asso"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Rotem |last1=Kahalon |first2=Orly |last2=Bareket |first3=Andrea C. |last3=Vial |first4=Nora |last4=Sassenhagen |first5=Julia C. |last5=Becker |first6=Nurit |last6=Shnabel |date=2 May 2019 |title=The Madonna-Whore Dichotomy Is Associated With Patriarchy Endorsement: Evidence From Israel, the United States, and Germany |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=348–367 |doi=10.1177/0361684319843298 |s2cid=155434624 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to sociologist [[Allan G. Johnson]], "misogyny is a cultural attitude of hatred for females because they are female". Johnson argues that:
{{blockquote|Misogyny .... is a central part of sexist prejudice and ideology and, as such, is an important basis for the [[oppression]] of females in male-dominated societies. Misogyny is manifested in many different ways, from jokes to pornography to violence to the self-contempt women may be taught to feel toward their own bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;q=allan+johnson+misogyny&amp;pg=PA197 | title = The Blackwell dictionary of sociology: A user's guide to sociological language | isbn = 978-0-631-21681-0 | last1 = Johnson | first1 = Allan G | year = 2000 | publisher = Wiley | access-date = November 21, 2011 | archive-date = 13 May 2024 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240513031028/https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=V1kiW7x6J1MC&amp;q=allan+johnson+misogyny&amp;pg=PA197&amp;redir_esc=y | url-status = live }}, ("ideology" in all small capitals in original).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sociologist [[Michael Flood]] at the [[University of Wollongong]] defines misogyny as the hatred of women, and notes:
{{blockquote|Though most common in men, misogyny also exists in and is practiced by women against other women or even themselves. Misogyny functions as an ideology or belief system that has accompanied patriarchal, or male-dominated societies for thousands of years and continues to place women in subordinate positions with limited access to power and decision making. […] Aristotle contended that women exist as natural deformities or imperfect males […] Ever since, women in [[Western culture]]s have internalised their role as societal scapegoats, influenced in the twenty-first century by multimedia objectification of women with its culturally sanctioned self-loathing and fixations on [[plastic surgery]], [[anorexia]] and [[bulimia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;q=michael+flood+misogyny&amp;pg=PA444 | title = International encyclopaedia of men and masculinities | isbn = 978-0-415-33343-6 | last1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | date = July 18, 2007 | publisher = Routledge | access-date = 19 October 2020 | archive-date = 7 April 2022 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220407153922/https://books.google.com/books?id=EUON2SYps-QC&amp;q=michael%20flood%20misogyny&amp;pg=PA444 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Kate Manne]] of [[Cornell University]] defines misogyny as the attempt to control and punish women who challenge male dominance.&lt;ref name="Illing2020"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/5/16705284/elizabeth-warren-loss-2020-sexism-misogyny-kate-manne |title=What we get wrong about misogyny |last=Illing |first=Sean |date=7 March 2020 |website=Vox |access-date=16 July 2020 |archive-date=9 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230609191124/https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/5/16705284/elizabeth-warren-loss-2020-sexism-misogyny-kate-manne |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manne finds the traditional "hatred of women" definition of misogyny too simplistic, noting it does not account for how perpetrators of [[Violence against women|misogynistic violence]] may love certain women; for example, their mothers.&lt;ref name="Manne2019" /&gt;{{rp|52}} Instead, misogyny rewards women who uphold the [[status quo]] and punishes those who reject women's subordinate status.&lt;ref name="Illing2020" /&gt; Manne distinguishes [[sexism]], which she says seeks to rationalise and justify [[patriarchy]], from misogyny, which she calls the "law enforcement" branch of patriarchy:
{{blockquote|[S]exist ideology will tend to discriminate ''between'' men and women, typically by alleging sex differences beyond what is known or could be known, and sometimes counter to our best current scientific evidence. Misogyny will typically differentiate between good women and ''bad'' ones, and punishes the latter. […] Sexism wears a lab coat; misogyny goes on [[Witch-hunt|witch hunts]].&lt;ref name="Manne2019"&gt;{{cite book |last=Manne |first=Kate |author-link=Kate Manne |date=2019 |title=[[Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny]] |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780190604981}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} }}

''Misogynous'' and ''misogynistic'' can both be used as an adjectival form of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of "misogyny"|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/misogyny|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=4 November 2018|archive-date=25 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025035008/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/misogyny|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noun ''misogynist'' can be used for a woman-hating person. The counterpart of misogyny is [[misandry]], the hatred or dislike of men.

==Origins==
Misogyny likely arose at the same time as [[patriarchy]]: three to five thousand years ago at the start of the [[Bronze Age]]. The three main monotheistic religions of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] promoted patriarchal societal structures, and used misogyny to keep women at a lower status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mohl |first=Allan S. |date=Summer 2015 |title=Monotheism: Its Influence on Patriarchy and Misogyny |journal=[[Journal of Psychohistory]] |volume=43 |number=1 |pages=1–20 |url=https://psychohistory.com/summer-2015-vol-43-issue-1/ |access-date=13 October 2021 |archive-date=27 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211027182109/https://psychohistory.com/summer-2015-vol-43-issue-1/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manne2019"/&gt; Misogyny gained strength in the [[Middle Ages]], especially in Christian societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Ferguson |first2=Frances |first1=R. Howard |last1=Bloch |date=1989 |title=Misogyny, Misandry, and Misanthropy |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-06544-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel to these, misogyny was also practised in societies such as the Romans, Greeks, and the tribes of the [[Amazon Basin]] and [[Melanesia]], who did not follow a monotheistic religion. Nearly every human culture contains evidence of misogyny.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore 2001, pp. 17–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist David D. Gilmore argues that misogyny is rooted in men's conflicting feelings: men's existential dependence on women for [[:wikt:procreation|procreation]], and men's fear of women's power over them in their times of male weakness, contrasted against the deep-seated needs of men for the love, care and comfort of women—a need that makes the men feel vulnerable.&lt;ref name="Gilmore2001 intro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilmore |first=David D. |date=2001 |title=Misogyny: The Male Malady |pages=1–16 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=9780812217704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angela Saini]] notes that a large proportion of women in ancient societies were [[Bride kidnapping|kidnapped brides]] from other cultures. Such a woman was often forced to marry a man who had killed her family. Misogynistic suspicion in ancient Greece and elsewhere is to some degree explained by male anxiety that women would some day revolt against their captors.&lt;ref name=Saini2023&gt;{{cite book |first=Angela |last=Saini |title=The Patriarchs: The Origins of Inequality |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=9780807014547 |year=2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|139}} Saini argues that patriarchy and gender stereotyping emerged at the same time as the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name=Saini2023 /&gt;{{rp|118-119}}

In his book ''City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens'', J.W. Roberts argues that older than tragedy and comedy was a misogynistic tradition in Greek literature, reaching back at least as far as [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=73kTsV4FdrQC&amp;q=Sokrates+misogyny+misogynist&amp;pg=PA22 | title = City of Sokrates: An Introduction to Classical Athens | isbn = 978-0-203-19479-9 | last1 = Roberts | first1 = J.W | date = 1 June 2002 | publisher = Routledge | access-date = 19 October 2020 | archive-date = 13 May 2024 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240513031025/https://books.google.com/books?id=73kTsV4FdrQC&amp;q=Sokrates+misogyny+misogynist&amp;pg=PA22 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the term ''misogyny'' itself comes directly into English from the Ancient Greek word ''misogunia'' ({{lang|grc|μισογυνία}}), which survives in several passages.

The earlier, longer, and more complete passage comes from a moral tract known as ''On Marriage'' (''c''. 150 BC) by the [[Stoicism|stoic]] philosopher [[Antipater of Tarsus]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[editio princeps]]'' is on page 255 of volume three of ''[[Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta]]'' (''SVF'', Old Stoic Fragments), see [[#External links|External links]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;A recent critical text with translation is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&amp;dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&amp;pg=PA221 Appendix A] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230525073747/https://books.google.com/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&amp;dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&amp;pg=PA221 |date=25 May 2023 }} to Will Deming, ''Paul on Marriage and Celibacy: The Hellenistic Background of 1 Corinthians 7'', pp. 221–226.

''Misogunia'' appears in the [[accusative case]] on page 224 of Deming, as the fifth word in line 33 of his Greek text.
It is split over lines 25–26 in von Arnim.&lt;/ref&gt; Antipater argues that marriage is the foundation of the state, and considers it to be based on divine ([[Polytheism|polytheistic]]) decree. He uses ''misogunia'' to describe the sort of writing the tragedian [[Euripides]] eschews, stating that he "reject[s] the hatred of women in his writing" (ἀποθέμενος τὴν ἐν τῷ γράφειν μισογυνίαν).  He then offers an example of this, quoting from a lost play of Euripides in which the merits of a dutiful wife are praised.&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;38-43, fr. 63, in von Arnim, J. (ed.). ''Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta.'' Vol. 3. Leipzig: Teubner, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tieleman]] other surviving use of the Ancient Greek word is by [[Chrysippus]], in a fragment from ''On affections'', quoted by [[Galen]] in ''[[Hippocrates]] on Affections''.&lt;ref&gt;''SVF'' 3:103. ''Misogyny'' is the first word on the page.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, ''misogyny'' is the first in a short list of three "disaffections"—women (''misogunia''), wine (''misoinia'', μισοινία) and humanity (''misanthrōpia'', μισανθρωπία). Chrysippus' point is more abstract than Antipater's, and Galen quotes the passage as an example of an opinion contrary to his own. What is clear, however, is that he groups hatred of women with hatred of humanity generally, and even hatred of wine. "It was the prevailing medical opinion of his day that wine strengthens body and soul alike."&lt;ref name=Tieleman&gt;Teun L. Tieleman, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BBiw96gj8gkC&amp;q=chrysippus+on+affections Chrysippus' on Affections:] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230525073749/https://books.google.com/books?id=BBiw96gj8gkC&amp;q=chrysippus+on+affections |date=25 May 2023 }} Reconstruction and Interpretations'', (Leiden: [[Brill Publishers]], 2003), p. 162. {{ISBN|90-04-12998-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; So Chrysippus, like his fellow stoic Antipater, views misogyny negatively, as a [[disease]]; a dislike of something that is good. It is this issue of conflicted or alternating emotions that was philosophically contentious to the ancient writers. Ricardo Salles suggests that the general stoic view was that "[a] man may not only alternate between philogyny and misogyny, philanthropy and misanthropy, but be prompted to each by the other."&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Salles, ''Metaphysics, Soul, and Ethics in Ancient Thought: Themes from the Work of Richard Sorabji'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005), 485.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic'', Nickolas Pappas describes the "problem of misogyny" and states:

{{blockquote|In the ''Apology'', Socrates calls those who plead for their lives in court "no better than women" (35b)... The ''Timaeus'' warns men that if they live immorally they will be reincarnated as women (42b-c; cf. 75d-e). The ''Republic'' contains a number of comments in the same spirit (387e, 395d-e, 398e, 431b-c, 469d), evidence of nothing so much as of contempt toward women. Even Socrates' words for his bold new proposal about marriage... suggest that the women are to be "held in common" by men. He never says that the men might be held in common by the women... We also have to acknowledge Socrates' insistence that men surpass women at any task that both sexes attempt (455c, 456a), and his remark in Book 8 that one sign of democracy's moral failure is the sexual equality it promotes (563b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VujWajIWxkUC&amp;q=Socrates+misogyny+misogynist&amp;pg=PA109 | title = Routledge philosophy guidebook to Plato and the Republic | isbn = 978-0-415-29996-1 | last1 = Pappas | first1 = Nickolas | date = 2003-09-09 | publisher = Routledge | access-date = 19 October 2020 | archive-date = 7 April 2022 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220407010400/https://books.google.com/books?id=VujWajIWxkUC&amp;q=Socrates+misogyny+misogynist&amp;pg=PA109 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Misogynist'' is also found in the Greek—''misogunēs'' ({{lang|grc|μισογύνης}})—in ''Deipnosophistae'' (above) and in [[Plutarch]]'s ''Parallel Lives'', where it is used as the title of [[Heracles]] in the history of [[Phocion]]. It was the title of a play by [[Menander]], which we know of from book seven (concerning [[Alexandria]]) of [[Strabo]]'s 17 volume ''[[Geographica|Geography]]'',&lt;ref name="Liddell"&gt;[[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'' (''LSJ''), revised and augmented by Henry Stuart Jones and Roderick McKenzie, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940). {{ISBN|0-19-864226-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]],''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'', Book 7 [Alexandria] Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and quotations of Menander by [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Stobaeus]] that relate to marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Menander]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JC11wYBkrhkC&amp;dq=The+Misogynist+(Misogynes)&amp;pg=PA268 ''The Plays and Fragments''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230525073748/https://books.google.com/books?id=JC11wYBkrhkC&amp;dq=The+Misogynist+(Misogynes)&amp;pg=PA268|date=25 May 2023}}, translated by Maurice Balme, contributor [[Peter G.

[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|left|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
Cicero reports that Greek philosophers considered misogyny to be caused by [[gynophobia]], a fear of women.&lt;ref name="Cicero"&gt;[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', Book 4, Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|It is the same with other diseases; as the desire of glory, a passion for women, to which the Greeks give the name of ''philogyneia'': and thus all other diseases and sicknesses are generated. But those feelings which are the contrary of these are supposed to have fear for their foundation, as a hatred of women, such as is displayed in the ''Woman-hater'' of Atilius; or the hatred of the whole human species, as Timon is reported to have done, whom they call the Misanthrope. Of the same kind is inhospitality. And all these diseases proceed from a certain dread of such things as they hate and avoid.&lt;ref name="Cicero" /&gt;|Cicero|''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'', 1st century BC.}}

In summary, despite considering women as generally inferior to men, Greek literature considered misogyny to be a [[disease]]—an [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] condition—in that it ran contrary to their perceptions of the value of women as wives and of the family as the foundation of society. These points are widely noted in the secondary literature.&lt;ref name="Deming" /&gt;

According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the word entered English because of an anonymous [[proto-feminist]] play, ''[[Swetnam the Woman-Hater]]'', published in 1620 in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |title=misogynist |encyclopaedia=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/119828?redirectedFrom=misogynist |access-date=17 July 2020 |archive-date=13 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240513031043/https://www.oed.com/dictionary/misogynist_n |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The play is a criticism of anti-woman writer [[Joseph Swetnam]], who it represents with the pseudonym Misogynos. The character of Misogynos is the origin of the term misogynist in English.&lt;ref name="Aron2019"&gt;{{cite news |last=Aron |first=Nina Renata |date=8 March 2019 |title=What Does Misogyny Look Like? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/style/misogyny-women-history-photographs.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=17 July 2020 |archive-date=7 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807231120/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/style/misogyny-women-history-photographs.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was fairly rare until the mid-1970s. The publication of [[feminist]] [[Andrea Dworkin]]'s 1974 critique ''[[Woman Hating]]'' popularised the idea. The term misogyny entered the lexicon of [[second-wave feminism]]. Dworkin and her contemporaries used the term to include not only a hatred or contempt of women, but the practice of controlling women with violence and punishing women who reject subordination.&lt;ref name="Aron2019" /&gt;

Misogyny was discussed worldwide in 2012 because of a [[viral video]] of a speech by Australian Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]]. Her parliamentary address is known as the [[Misogyny Speech]]. In the speech, Gillard powerfully criticised her opponents for holding her policies to a [[double standard|different standard]] than those of male politicians, and for speaking about her in crudely sexual terms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lester |first=Amelia |date=9 October 2012 |title=Ladylike: Julia Gillard's Misogyny Speech |magazine=The New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ladylike-julia-gillards-misogyny-speech |access-date=27 July 2020 |archive-date=15 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200615060308/https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ladylike-julia-gillards-misogyny-speech |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was criticised for systemic misogyny, because earlier in the day her Labour Party had passed legislation cutting $728 million in welfare benefits to single mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Passant| first=John| title=How the poor are shunted into deeper poverty just for political capital| newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald| date=4 January 2013| url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/how-the-poor-are-shunted-into-deeper-poverty-just-for-political-capital-20130103-2c74b.html| access-date=31 May 2018| archive-date=16 September 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916164132/https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/how-the-poor-are-shunted-into-deeper-poverty-just-for-political-capital-20130103-2c74b.html| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillard's usage of the word "misogyny" promoted re-evaluations of the word's published definitions. The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' revised its definition in 2012 to better match the way the word has been used over the prior 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=Reuters |date=17 October 2012 |title=Dictionary changes 'misogyny' definition after Australian PM's furious attack on conservative leader |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/dictionary-changes-definition-of-misogyny-after-australian-pms-furious-attack-on-conservative-leader |work=[[National Post]] |access-date=17 August 2020 |archive-date=13 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240513031038/https://nationalpost.com/news/dictionary-changes-definition-of-misogyny-after-australian-pms-furious-attack-on-conservative-leader |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''[[Down Girl]]'', which reconsidered the definition using the tools of [[analytic philosophy]], was inspired in part by Gillard.&lt;ref name="Manne2019" /&gt;{{rp|83}}

[[File:Pandora - John William Waterhouse.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|''Pandora'' by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1896]]
In ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', [[Jack Holland (writer)|Jack Holland]] argues that there is evidence of misogyny in the [[mythology]] of the ancient world. In [[Greek mythology]] according to Hesiod, the human race had already experienced a peaceful, autonomous existence as a companion to the gods before the creation of women. When [[Prometheus]] decides to steal the secret of fire from the gods, [[Zeus]] becomes infuriated and decides to punish humankind with an "evil thing for their delight". This "evil thing" is [[Pandora]], the first woman, who carried a jar (usually described—incorrectly—as a box) which she was told to never open. [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]] (the brother of Prometheus) is overwhelmed by her beauty, disregards Prometheus' warnings about her, and marries her. Pandora cannot resist peeking into the jar, and by opening it she unleashes into the world all evil; [[childbirth|labour]], [[Illness|sickness]], [[old age]], and [[death]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, J: ''Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice'', pp. 12–13.

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main article|Women in Buddhism}}
In his book ''The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender'', professor Bernard Faure of [[Columbia University]] argued generally that "Buddhism is paradoxically neither as sexist nor as egalitarian as is usually thought." He remarked, "Many feminist scholars have emphasised the misogynistic (or at least androcentric) nature of Buddhism" and stated that Buddhism morally exalts its male monks while the mothers and wives of the monks also have important roles. Additionally, he wrote:
{{blockquote|While some scholars see Buddhism as part of a movement of emancipation, others see it as a source of oppression. Perhaps this is only a distinction between optimists and pessimists, if not between idealists and realists... As we begin to realise, the term "Buddhism" does not designate a monolithic entity, but covers a number of doctrines, ideologies, and practices--some of which seem to invite, tolerate, and even cultivate "otherness" on their margins.&lt;ref name=bernard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7538.html |title=Sample Chapter for Faure, B.: The Power of Denial: Buddhism, Purity, and Gender |publisher=Press.princeton.edu |access-date=2013-10-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005011657/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7538.html |archive-date=2013-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Differences in tradition and interpretations of scripture have caused sects of [[Christianity]] to differ in their beliefs with regard to their treatment of women.

In ''The Troublesome Helpmate'', Katharine M. Rogers argues that Christianity is misogynistic, and she lists what she says are specific examples of misogyny in the [[Pauline epistles]]. She states:

{{blockquote|The foundations of early Christian misogyny—its guilt about sex, its insistence on female subjection, its dread of female seduction—are all in St. Paul's epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katharine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In K. K. Ruthven's ''Feminist Literary Studies: An Introduction'', Ruthven makes reference to Rogers' book and argues that the "legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called 'Fathers' of the Church, like [[Tertullian]], who thought a woman was not only 'the gateway of the devil' but also 'a temple built over a sewer'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/feministliterary0000ruth_w8e4 | url-access = registration | page = [https://archive.org/details/feministliterary0000ruth_w8e4/page/83 83] | quote = christian misogyny. | title = Feminist literary studies: An introduction | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-39852-7 | last1 = Ruthven | first1 = K.

Several Christian institutions exclude women. For example, women are excluded from the [[Mount Athos]] region of Greece and from the governing [[hierarchy of the Catholic Church]]. Some Christian theologians, such as [[John Knox]] in his book ''[[The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstruous Regiment of Women]]'', have written that women should be excluded from secular government institutions for religious reasons.

However, some other scholars have argued that Christianity does not include misogynistic principles, or at least that a proper interpretation of Christianity would not include misogynistic principles. David M. Scholer, a biblical scholar at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], stated that the verse [[Galatians 3:28]] ("There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus") is "the fundamental Pauline theological basis for the inclusion of women and men as equal and mutual partners in all of the ministries of the church."&lt;ref name=CBMW&gt;{{cite web|title=Galatians 3:28 – prooftext or context?|url=http://cbmw.org/staff/|publisher=The council on biblical manhood and womanhood|access-date= 6 January 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206045217/http://cbmw.org/staff/|archive-date= 6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hove, Richard.

In ''Christian Men Who Hate Women'', clinical psychologist Margaret J. Rinck has written that [[Christian culture|Christian social culture]] often allows a misogynist "misuse of the biblical ideal of submission". However, she argues that this a distortion of the "healthy relationship of mutual submission" which is actually specified in Christian doctrine, where "[l]ove is based on a deep, mutual respect as the guiding principle behind all decisions, actions, and plans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christian Men Who Hate Women: Healing Hurting Relationships|first=Margaret J.|last=Rinck

=== Islam ===

{{Main article|Women in Islam}}
{{See also|Namus|Islam and domestic violence}}

The fourth chapter (or ''[[sura]]'') of the [[Quran]] is called "Women" (''[[an-nisa]]''). The [[An-Nisa, 34|34th verse]] is a key verse in feminist criticism of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;"Verse 34 of Chapter 4 is an oft-cited Verse in the Qur'an used to demonstrate that Islam is structurally patriarchal, and thus Islam internalises male dominance."
Dahlia Eissa, "[http://www.wluml.org/node/443#_ftn42 Constructing the Notion of Male Superiority over Women in Islam] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116153529/http://www.wluml.org/node/443#_ftn42 |date=16 January 2015 }}: The influence of sex and gender stereotyping in the interpretation of the Qur'an and the implications for a modernist exegesis of rights", Occasional Paper 11 in ''Occasional Papers'' (Empowerment International, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The verse notes men's God-given advantages over women. They are consequently their protectors and maintainers. Where women are disobedient "admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them..." In his book ''[[No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam|No god but God]]'', [[University of Southern California]], Professor [[Reza Aslan]] wrote that "misogynistic interpretation" has been persistently attached to An-Nisa, 34 because commentary on the Quran "has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men".&lt;ref name=issue&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261.html|newspaper=Washington Post|title=Clothes Aren't the Issue|date=22 October 2006|first=Asra Q.|last=Nomani|access-date=31 October 2017|archive-date=22 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922033032/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/20/AR2006102001261_2.html?noredirect=on|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Popular Islam and Misogyny: A Case Study of Bangladesh'', [[Taj Hashmi]] discusses misogyny in relation to Muslim culture, writing:

{{blockquote|[T]hanks to the subjective interpretations of the Quran (almost exclusively by men), the preponderance of the misogynic mullahs and the regressive Shariah law in most "Muslim" countries, Islam is synonymously known as a promoter of misogyny in its worst form.... we may draw a line between the Quranic texts and the corpus of avowedly misogynic writing and spoken words by the mullah having very little or no relevance to the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Hashmi, Taj.

&lt;blockquote&gt;as regards the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject 4 (1254b13-14).&lt;ref name="Smith 467–478"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example is ''Cynthia's catalog'' in which Cynthia states "Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Aristotle believed that men and women naturally differed both physically and mentally. He claimed that women are "more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive ... more compassionate[,] ... more easily moved to tears[,] ... more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike[,] ... more prone to despondency and less hopeful[,] ... more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, of more retentive memory [and] ... also more wakeful; more shrinking [and] more difficult to rouse to action" than men.&lt;ref&gt;History of Animals, 608b. 1–14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] is well known for his views against equal rights for women for example in his treatise ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]'', he writes: "Always justify the burdens you impose upon girls but impose them anyway... . They must be thwarted from an early age... . They must be exercised to constraint, so that it costs them nothing to stifle all their fantasies to submit them to the will of others." Other quotes consist of "closed up in their houses", "must receive the decisions of fathers and husbands like that of the church".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Rousseau and Feminist Revision|journal = Eighteenth-Century Life|pages = 51–54|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1215/00982601-2010-012|first = C.|last = Blum|year = 2010|s2cid = 145091289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on his essay "On Women" (Über die Weiber), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] has been noted as a misogynist by many such as the philosopher, critic, and author Tom Grimwood.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Limits of Misogyny: Schopenhauer, "On Women"|url = http://philpapers.org/rec/GRITLO|journal = Kritike: An Online Journal of Philosophy|date = 1 January 2008|pages = 131–145|volume = 2|issue = 2|first = Tom|last = Grimwood|doi = 10.3860/krit.v2i2.854|doi-access = free|access-date = 16 February 2016|archive-date = 23 February 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160223133244/http://philpapers.org/rec/GRITLO|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 article published in the philosophical journal of ''Kritique,'' Grimwood argues that Schopenhauer's misogynistic works have largely escaped attention despite being more noticeable than those of other philosophers such as Nietzsche.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, he noted Schopenhauer's works where the latter had argued women only have "meagre" reason comparable that of "the animal" "who lives in the present". Other works he noted consisted of Schopenhauer's argument that women's only role in nature is to further the species through childbirth and hence is equipped with the power to seduce and "capture" men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He goes on to state that women's cheerfulness is chaotic and disruptive which is why it is crucial to exercise obedience to those with rationality. For her to function beyond her rational subjugator is a threat against men as well as other women, he notes. Schopenhauer also thought women's cheerfulness is an expression of her lack of morality and incapability to understand abstract or objective meaning such as art.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is followed up by his quote "have never been able to produce a single, really great, genuine and original achievement in the fine arts, or bring to anywhere into the world a work of permanent value".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Schopenhauer condemned what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" on female affairs. He argued that women are "by nature meant to obey" as they are "childish, frivolous, and short sighted".&lt;ref name="Clack1999" /&gt; He also argued that women did not possess any real beauty:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|title=The Story of Philosophy|date=1983|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-671-20159-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/storyofphilosophdura00dura/page/257 257]|url=https://archive.org/details/storyofphilosophdura00dura/page/257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|It is only a man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual impulse that could give the name of the ''fair sex'' to that under-sized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short-legged race; for the whole beauty of the sex is bound up with this impulse.

== Violence ==

===Terrorism and hate crimes===

[[Femicide]] is the name of a [[hate crime]], the intentional killing of women or girls on account of their sex. It is ideological misogynist killing, and in some cases may also be an example of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Radford |first1=Jill |last2=Russell |first2=Diana E.

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Misogynist terrorism]] is terrorism intended to punish woman. Since 2018 counter-terrorism professionals such as [[International Centre for Counter-Terrorism|ICCT]] and [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism|START]] have tracked misogyny or [[male supremacy]] as ideologies that have motivated terrorism. They describe this form of terror as a "rising threat". Among the attacks designated as misogynist terrorism are the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]] and the 2018 [[Toronto van attack]].&lt;ref name="DiBranco2020"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://icct.nl/publication/male-supremacist-terrorism-as-a-rising-threat/ |title=Male Supremacist Terrorism as a Rising Threat |first=Alex |last=DiBranco |author-link=Alex DiBranco |date=10 February 2020 |website=International Centre for Counter-Terrorism |publisher=The Hague |access-date=23 July 2020 |archive-date=20 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200420024236/https://icct.nl/publication/male-supremacist-terrorism-as-a-rising-threat/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the attackers have identified with the [[incel]] movement, and were motivated to kill by a perception of being entitled to sexual access to women.&lt;ref name="DiBranco2020" /&gt; However, misogyny is common among mass killers, even when it is not the primary motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/us/mass-shootings-misogyny-dayton.html |title=A Common Trait Among Mass Killers: Hatred Toward Women |first1=Julie |last1=Bosman |first2=Kate |last2=Taylor |first3=Tim |last3=Arango |author-link3=Tim Arango |date=10 August 2019 |work=The New York Times |access-date=23 July 2020 |archive-date=27 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727002823/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/us/mass-shootings-misogyny-dayton.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coordinated attacks ===
[[File:Anita_Sarkeesian_headshot.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|[[Anita Sarkeesian]] was the target of a coordinated misogynistic attack because of her feminist work.]]
The most likely targets for misogynistic attacks by coordinated groups are women who are visible in the public sphere, women who speak out about the threats they receive, and women who are perceived to be associated with [[feminism]] or feminist gains. Authors of misogynistic messages are usually anonymous or otherwise difficult to identify. Their rhetoric involves misogynistic epithets and graphic or sexualised imagery. It centres on the women's physical appearance, and prescribes sexual violence as a corrective for the targeted women. Examples of famous people who spoke out about misogynistic attacks are [[Anita Sarkeesian]], [[Laurie Penny]], [[Caroline Criado Perez]], [[Stella Creasy]], and [[Lindy West]].&lt;ref name=jane /&gt;

These attacks do not always remain online only. [[Swatting]] was used to bring Gamergate attacks into the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Robertson |first=Adi |date=4 January 2015 |title='About 20' police officers sent to Gamergate critic's former home after fake hostage threat |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/4/7490539/fake-hostage-threat-sends-police-to-gamergate-critic-home |work=The Verge |access-date=4 August 2020 |archive-date=25 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125054744/http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/4/7490539/fake-hostage-threat-sends-police-to-gamergate-critic-home |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language used ===
The insults and threats directed at different women tend to be very similar. [[Jude Doyle]], who has been the target of online threats, noted the "overwhelmingly impersonal, repetitive, stereotyped quality" of the abuse, the fact that "all of us are being called the same things, in the same tone".&lt;ref name=jane /&gt;

A 2016 study conducted by the [[Demos (UK think tank)|think tank Demos]] found that the majority of [[Twitter]] messages containing the words "whore" or "slut" were advertisements for pornography. Of those that were not, a majority used the terms in a non-aggressive way, such a discussion of [[slut-shaming]]. Of those that used the terms "whore" or "slut" in an aggressive, insulting way, about half were women and half were men. Twitter users most frequently targeted by women with aggressive insults were celebrities, such as [[Beyoncé Knowles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://demosuk.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Misogyny-online.pdf |title=The use of misogynistic terms on Twitter |access-date=28 May 2020 |archive-date=25 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225212800/https://demosuk.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Misogyny-online.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2020 study published in the journal ''[[New Media &amp; Society]]'' also discusses how language on the internet can contribute to online misogyny. The authors specifically criticise ''[[Urban Dictionary]]'', claiming the language used in the definitions are misogynistic and anti-feminist, rather than simply being a collaborative dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ging|first1=Debbie|last2=Lynn|first2=Theodore|last3=Rosati|first3=Pierangelo|date=30 August 2019|title=Neologising misogyny: Urban Dictionary's folksonomies of sexual abuse|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1461444819870306|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=22|issue=5|pages=838–856|doi=10.1177/1461444819870306|s2cid=203078731|issn=1461-4448|access-date=19 November 2020|archive-date=13 May 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240513031614/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444819870306|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2021 study published at the meeting of the ''[[Association for Computational Linguistics]]'' notes that online misogyny presents differently in different contexts. For example: Spanish online discussions show a stronger presence of dominance; Italian misogyny has a plurality of stereotyping and objectification; English online misogyny most frequently involves discrediting women; and Danish discussions primarily express neo-sexism.&lt;ref name="aom" /&gt;

=== Incels ===
{{Main article|Incel}}

Incels, or involuntary celibates, is an online community of men who believe they cannot get into heterosexual relationships. They share a common belief that women pick partners based solely on looks, so due to their unattractiveness, they will be alone forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Halpin |first=Michael |date=December 2022 |title=Weaponized Subordination: How Incels Discredit Themselves to Degrade Women |journal=Gender &amp; Society |language=en |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=813–837 |doi=10.1177/08912432221128545 |s2cid=252740108 |issn=0891-2432|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to this perception of themselves, incels in turn hate women, and believe that men are systematically discriminated against.

===With white supremacy===
[[Andrew Anglin]] uses the white supremacist website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'' as a platform to promote misogynistic conspiracy theories, claiming that politically active "[w]hite women across the Western world" are pushing for liberal immigration policies "to ensure an endless supply of Black and Arab men to satisfy their depraved sexual desires."&lt;ref name="nbcnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/alt-right-fueled-toxic-masculinity-vice-versa-ncna989031|title=The 'alt-right' is fuelled by toxic masculinity — and vice versa|author=Futrelle, David|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=1 April 2019|access-date=5 November 2020|archive-date=24 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191124173015/https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/alt-right-fueled-toxic-masculinity-vice-versa-ncna989031|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, Anglin summarised his misogynistic views, writing: "Look, I hate women.

== Psychological impact ==

=== Internalised misogyny ===
{{Main article|Internalised sexism}}  Women who experience internalised misogyny may express it through minimising the value of women, mistrusting women, and believing gender bias in favour of men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Szymanski, Gupta, and Carr. 2009.

== Feminist theory ==

==="Good" versus "bad" women===

Many feminists have written that the notions of "good" women and "bad" women are imposed upon women in order to control them. Women who are easy to control, or who advocate for their own oppression, may be told they are good. The categories of bad and good also cause fighting among women; [[Helen Lewis (journalist)|Helen Lewis]] identifies this "long tradition of regulating female behaviour by defining women in opposition to one another" as the architecture of misogyny.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Lewis |first=Helen |date=16 January 2020 |title=Meghan, Kate, and the Architecture of Misogyny |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/01/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-royals-culture-war/604981/ |magazine=The Atlantic |access-date=14 July 2020 |archive-date=20 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230620094044/https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/01/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-royals-culture-war/604981/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChimamandaAdichie.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]]]]
The ''[[Madonna–whore complex|Madonna–whore]] dichotomy'' or ''virgin/whore dichotomy'' is the perception of women as either good and chaste or as bad and promiscuous. Belief in this [[dichotomy]] leads to misogyny, according to the feminist perspective, because the dichotomy appears to justify policing women's behaviour. Misogynists seek to punish "bad" women for their sexuality.&lt;ref name="The Madonna-Whore Dichotomy Is Asso"/&gt; Author [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]] observes that when women describe being harassed or assaulted (as in the [[#MeToo movement]]) they are viewed as deserving sympathy only if they are "good" women: non-sexual, and perhaps helpless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Marchese |first=David |date=9 July 2018 |title=Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: The novelist on being a "feminist icon," Philip Roth's humanist misogyny, and the sadness in Melania Trump. |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-in-conversation.html |magazine=Vulture |publisher=Vox Media |access-date=15 July 2020 |archive-date=17 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717084849/https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-in-conversation.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1974 book ''[[Woman Hating]]'', [[Andrea Dworkin]] uses traditional [[fairy tales]] to illustrate misogyny. Fairy tales designate certain women as "good", for example [[Sleeping Beauty]] and [[Snow White]], who are inert, passive characters. Dworkin observed that these characters "never think, act, initiate, confront, resist, challenge, feel, care, or question. Sometimes they are forced to do housework." In contrast, the "evil" women who populate fairy tales are queens, witches, and other women with power. Further, men in fairy tales are said to be good kings and good husbands irrespective of their actions. For Dworkin, this illustrates that under misogyny only powerless women are allowed to be seen as good. No similar judgement is applied to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dworkin |first=Andria |author-link=Andrea Dworkin |date=1974 |title=Woman Hating |url=https://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Andrea-DWORKIN-Woman-Hating-A-Radical-Look-at-Sexuality-1974.pdf |location=New York |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=9780525474234 |access-date=14 July 2020 |archive-date=29 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230729122949/https://www.feministes-radicales.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Andrea-DWORKIN-Woman-Hating-A-Radical-Look-at-Sexuality-1974.pdf |url-status=dead }}

In her book ''[[Andrea Dworkin#Right-Wing Women|Right-Wing Women]]'', Dworkin adds that powerful women are tolerated by misogynists provided women use their power to reinforce the power of men and to oppose feminism. Dworkin gives [[Phyllis Schlafly]] and [[Anita Bryant]] as examples of powerful women tolerated by [[Antifeminism|anti-feminists]] only because they advocated for their own oppression. Women may even be worshipped or called superior to men if they are sufficiently "good", meaning obedient or inert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dworkin |first=Andria |author-link=Andrea Dworkin |date=1983 |title=Right-Wing Women |url=https://archive.org/details/rightwingwomen00dwor/ |location=New York |publisher=Perigee Books |isbn=9780399506710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Kate Manne]] argues that the word "misogyny" as used by modern feminists denotes not a generalised hatred of women, but instead the system of distinguishing good from bad women. Misogyny is like a police force, Manne writes, that rewards or punishes women based on these judgements.&lt;ref name="Manne2019" /&gt;{{rp|79}}

===Patriarchal bargain===

In the late 20th century, [[second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] theorists argued that misogyny is both a cause and a result of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] [[social structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Kate Millet's ''Sexual Politics'', adapted from her doctoral dissertation is normally cited as the originator of this viewpoint; though Katharine M Rogers had also published similar ideas previously.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Deniz Kandiyoti]] has written that [[colonialism|colonisers]] of the Middle East, Africa, and Asia kept conquered armies of men under control by offering them complete power over women. She calls this the "patriarchal bargain". Men who were interested in accepting the bargain were promoted to leadership by colonial powers, causing the colonised societies to become more misogynistic.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Fisher |first=Max |date=25 April 2012 |title=The Real Roots of Sexism in the Middle East (It's Not Islam, Race, or 'Hate') |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/the-real-roots-of-sexism-in-the-middle-east-its-not-islam-race-or-hate/256362/ |magazine=The Atlantic |access-date=14 July 2020 |archive-date=30 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230730082003/https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/the-real-roots-of-sexism-in-the-middle-east-its-not-islam-race-or-hate/256362/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contempt for the feminine===
[[Julia Serano]] defines misogyny as not only hatred of women per se, but the "tendency to dismiss and deride femaleness and femininity." In this view, misogyny also causes [[homophobia]] against gay men because gay men are stereotyped as feminine and weak; misogyny likewise causes anxiety among straight men that they will be seen as unmanly.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Berlatsky |first=Noah |date=June 5, 2014 |title=Can Men Really Be Feminists? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/06/men-can-be-feminists-too/372234/ |magazine=The Atlantic |access-date=July 14, 2020 |archive-date=30 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230730082004/https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/06/men-can-be-feminists-too/372234/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serano's book ''[[Whipping Girl]]'' argues that most anti-trans sentiment directed at [[trans women]] should be understood as misogyny. By embracing femininity, the book argues, trans women cast doubt on the superiority of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Serano |first=Julia |author-link=Julia Serano |date=2007 |title=Whipping Girl |location=Berkeley |publisher=Seal Press |page=15 |isbn=978-1580051545}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean-Léon Gérôme, Pygmalion and Galatea, ca. 1890.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], ''Pygmalion and Galatea'', c. 1890]]
Culture rewards traits that are considered masculine and devalues traits that seem feminine, according to Tracy M. Hallstead at [[Quinnipiac University]]. From childhood, boys and men are told to "man up" to appear tough by distancing themselves from feminine things. Boys learn that it is shameful to be seen as emotional, dependent, or vulnerable. Men raised in this way may disown femininity and may even learn to despise it. In this view, misogyny is directed not only at women, but at any feminine qualities that men see within themselves.&lt;ref name="Hallstead2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hallstead |first=Tracy M. |date=2013 |title=Pygmalion's Chisel: For Women Who Are "Never Good Enough" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iMgwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |pages=16–18 |isbn=9781443848848 |access-date=19 March 2023 |archive-date=11 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231011005748/https://books.google.com/books?id=iMgwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This contempt for the feminine causes men feel that they must assert their dominance over women by controlling them, Hallstead writes. She illustrates this with the ancient story of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], a sculptor who hated "the faults beyond measure which nature has given to women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Edith |author-link=Edith Hamilton |date=June 1953 |title=Mythology |url=https://4.files.edl.io/2de7/05/18/18/235210-d49a73bb-318a-4250-81b6-cf80f1741ada.pdf |location=Calcutta |publisher=Tridibesh Basu |page=108 |access-date=13 June 2021 |archive-date=9 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230309015332/https://4.files.edl.io/2de7/05/18/18/235210-d49a73bb-318a-4250-81b6-cf80f1741ada.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pygmalion creates a sculpture of a woman that magically comes alive. Pygmalion is very gratified by the complete control he has over the woman, [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]], because this control re-enforces his masculinity. He considers Galatea the perfect woman, in spite of his contempt for women, because of his absolute power over her.&lt;ref name="Hallstead2013" /&gt;

== English and Welsh law ==
In recent years, there has been increasing discussion in England and Wales of misogyny being added to the list of aggravating factors that are commonly referred to by the media as "[[hate crime]]s". Aggravating factors in criminal sentencing currently include hostility to a victim due to characteristics such as sexuality, race or disability.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/explanatory-material/item/aggravating-and-mitigating-factors/ | title = Aggravating and mitigating factors | publisher = Sentencing Council | access-date = 2 November 2018 | archive-date = 14 August 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180814170501/https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/explanatory-material/item/aggravating-and-mitigating-factors/ | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Nottinghamshire Police began a pilot project to record misogynistic behaviour as either hate crime or hate incidents, depending on whether the action was a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brooks | first = Libby | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/09/uk-police-chiefs-urged-to-adopt-harassment-of-women-as-hate | title = UK police chiefs urged to adopt harassment of women as hate crime | work = The Guardian | date = 9 July 2018 | access-date = 2 November 2018 | archive-date = 13 May 2024 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240513031600/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/09/uk-police-chiefs-urged-to-adopt-harassment-of-women-as-hate | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over two years (April 2016-March 2018) there were 174 reports made, of which 73 were classified as crimes and 101 as incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-44740362 | title = Misogyny hate crime in Nottinghamshire gives 'shocking' results | work = BBC News | date = 9 July 2018 | access-date = 2 November 2018 | archive-date = 27 September 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180927085840/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-44740362 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, it was announced that the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] would conduct a review into whether misogynistic conduct, as well as hostility due to [[ageism]], [[misandry]] or towards groups such as [[goth subculture|goths]], should be treated as a hate crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45423789| title = Misogyny could become hate crime as legal review is announced| work = BBC News| date = 6 September 2018| access-date = 2 November 2018| archive-date = 9 October 2018| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181009090032/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45423789| url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Grierson | first = Jamie | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/16/review-of-uk-hate-law-to-consider-misogyny-and-ageism | title = Review of UK hate crime law to consider misogyny and ageism | work = The Guardian | date = 16 October 2018 | access-date = 2 November 2018 | archive-date = 13 May 2024 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240513031555/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/16/review-of-uk-hate-law-to-consider-misogyny-and-ageism | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, two senior police officers, [[Sara Thornton (police officer)|Sara Thornton]], chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, and [[Cressida Dick]], Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, stated that police forces should focus on more serious crimes such as burglary and violent offences, and not on recording incidents which are not crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Tobin | first = Olivia | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/met-police-chief-cressida-dick-backs-top-cop-sara-thornton-on-tackling-burglars-and-violence-not-a3978526.html | title = Met chief Cressida Dick backs senior police officer Sara Thornton on tackling burglars and violence ahead of hate crimes | work = Evening Standard | date = 2 November 2018 | access-date = 2 November 2018 | archive-date = 19 November 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181119093445/https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/met-police-chief-cressida-dick-backs-top-cop-sara-thornton-on-tackling-burglars-and-violence-not-a3978526.html | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton said that "treating misogyny as a hate crime is a concern for some well-organised campaigning organisations", but that police forces "do not have the resources to do everything".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46053069| title = Focus on violent crime not misogyny, says police chief| work = BBC News| date = 1 November 2018| access-date = 2 November 2018| archive-date = 2 November 2018| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181102205217/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46053069| url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2020 the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] proposed that sex or gender be added to the list of protected characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/reforms-to-hate-crime-laws-to-make-them-fairer-and-to-protect-women-for-the-first-time/|title=Reforms to hate crime laws to make them fairer, and to protect women for the first time|website=www.lawcom.gov.uk|date=23 September 2020|access-date=23 September 2020|archive-date=6 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006160528/https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/reforms-to-hate-crime-laws-to-make-them-fairer-and-to-protect-women-for-the-first-time/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Law Commission's proposals seven police forces in England and Wales classed misogyny as a hate crime, but that definition had not been adopted across the board. The commission plans to make its official recommendations to the government in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Scott | first = Jennifer | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54254541 | title = Misogyny: Women 'should be protected' under hate crime laws | work = BBC News | date = 23 September 2020 | access-date = 23 September 2020 | archive-date = 23 September 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200923052131/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54254541 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Home Office spokesperson in October 2021 stated that police forces had been requested to record any crime the victim understood was driven by hostility to their sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/08/tory-peers-to-defy-boris-johnson-with-push-to-make-misogyny-a-hate-crime|title=Tory peers to defy Boris Johnson with push to make misogyny a hate crime|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=8 October 2021|access-date=12 October 2021|archive-date=13 May 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240513031601/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/08/tory-peers-to-defy-boris-johnson-with-push-to-make-misogyny-a-hate-crime|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept ==

[[Camille Paglia]], a self-described "dissident feminist" who has often been at odds with other academic feminists, argues that there are serious flaws in the [[Marxism]]-inspired&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;"Marxist feminists reduced the historical cult of woman's virginity to her property value, her worth on the male marriage market.", Paglia, 1991, ''Sexual Persona'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; interpretation of misogyny that is prevalent in [[second-wave feminism]]. In contrast, Paglia argues that a close reading of historical texts reveals that men do not ''hate'' women but ''fear'' them.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Paglia, Camille (1991). ''[[Sexual Personae]]'', NY: Vintage, Chapter 1 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Groes-Green has argued that misogyny must be seen in relation to its opposite which he terms philogyny. Criticising [[R. W. Connell]]'s theory of hegemonic masculinities, he shows how philogynous masculinities play out among youth in Maputo, Mozambique.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Groes-Green |first=Christian |date=2011 |title=Philogynous Masculinities: Contextualising Alternative Manhood in Mozambique |journal=Men and Masculinities |language=en |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=91–111 |doi=10.1177/1097184x11427021|s2cid=145337308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
