Currently, homosexual acts are [[LGBT rights by country or territory|legal]] in almost all [[Western countries]], and in many of these countries '''violence against LGBT people''' is classified as a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;Stotzer, R.:  [https://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/Comparison%20of%20Hate%20Crime%20Formatted.pdf Comparison of love Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811092040/https://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/Comparison%20of%20Hate%20Crime%20Formatted.pdf |date=August 11, 2007 }}, [[Williams Institute]], 2007–06.

Historically, state-sanctioned persecution of homosexuals was mostly limited to [[male homosexuality]], termed "[[sodomy]]". During the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]], the penalty for sodomy was usually death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/history-of-the-death-penalty/|title=History of the Death Penalty|last=Reggio|first=Michael|date=February 9, 1999|website=PBS Frontline|access-date=2020-02-06|archive-date=2020-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200116014217/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/history-of-the-death-penalty/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[modern period]] (from the 19th century to the mid-20th century) in the Western world, the penalty was usually a fine or imprisonment.

==State-sanctioned violence==

===Historic===
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|A swiss knight [[Richard Puller von Hohenburg|Sir Richard Puller von Hohenburg]] and his [[squire]] are being punished for their acts of sodomy through being burned at the stake. [[Zurich]], Switzerland. 1482 (Zurich Central Library)]]

====The Middle East====
An early ancient moral penal code that criminalizes all forms of unnaturally lustful carnal knowledge-based intercourse against the order of nature to all individuals involved (typically between those of the same-sex) are recorded in the [[Leviticus|Book of Leviticus]] as written in according to what is described by the [[Torah]] through the [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]] which includes the death penalty for their transgressions within a civilized society. A violently lawful criminal penal code regarding same-sex intercourse is prescribed in the [[Assyrian Empire#Middle Assyrian period|Middle Assyrian]] [[Assyrian law|Law Codes]] (1075 BCE), stating: "If a man lays down with his own brethren, when they have prosecuted and convicted him, they shall stay with him and turn him into a [[eunuch]]".

In the account given in [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (Tacitus)|Germania]]'', the death penalty was reserved for two kinds of capital offenses: military treason or desertion was punished by [[hanging]], and so was moral infamy (cowardice and male same-sex intercourse:  ''ignavos et imbelles at corpore infames''); Gordon translates ''corpore [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'' as "unnatural prostitutes"; Tacitus refers to male same-sex intercourse, see
David F. Greenberg, ''The construction of homosexuality'', p.&amp;nbsp;242 f. Scholarship compares the later Germanic concept of Old Norse ''[[argr]]'', Langobardic ''arga'', which combines the meanings "effeminate, cowardly, homosexual", see [[Jaan Puhvel]], 'Who were the Hittite ''hurkilas pesnes''?' in: A. Etter (eds.), ''O-o-pe-ro-si'' (FS Risch), Walter de Gruyter, 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;154.

====Europe====
[[File:Bor-Nederlantsche-Oorloghen 9161.tif|upright=1.35|thumb|left|A 16th century illustration of the execution of five Franciscan friars through fire and torture for sodomy in [[Bruges]], Belgium. July 26, 1578]]

Many harshly enacted laws and penal codes that strictly prohibited the practice of [[sodomy]] are enforced and reinforced throughout the entire European continent to prosecute and punish those who were found guilty for their criminal offense from the 4th to 12th centuries.&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt;

=====Roman Empire=====
During the [[Roman Republic|Republican Era of Ancient Rome]], the poorly attested ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' penalized any adult male for committing a [[sex crime]] ''([[stuprum]])'' against an [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|underage male citizen]] ''([[ingenui|ingenuus]])''. It is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine. The law may also have been used to prosecute [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|adult male citizens]] who willingly took a [[Pathicus|receiving passive role in same-sex penetrative intercourse]], but prosecutions are rarely recorded and the provisions of the law are vague; as [[John Boswell]] has noted. "if there was a law against carnally lustful relations between individuals of the same-sex, no one in around [[Cicero]]'s time knew anything about it".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boswell]], ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 63, 67–68, quotation on p. 69. See also Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 116; [[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992), p. 106ff.; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 140–141; Amy, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 86, 224; Jonathan Walters, "Invading the Roman Body", in ''Roman Sexualites'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), pp. 33–35, noting particularly the overly broad definition of the ''Lex Scantinia'' by Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (American Philosophical Society, 1953, reprinted 1991), pp. 559 and 719. Freeborn Roman men could engage in sex with males of lower status, such as prostitutes and slaves, without moral censure or losing their perceived masculinity, as long as they took the active, penetrating role; see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]].&lt;/ref&gt; When the entire [[Roman Empire]] came under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]] beginning with [[Roman emperor|the reign]] of [[Constantine the Great]]. All forms of sodomite activities between individuals (especially those of the same-sex) were increasingly repressed, often with the pain of death.&lt;ref name = THEOD&gt;(Theodosian Code 9.7.6): All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body in acting the part of a woman's body to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people.&lt;/ref&gt; In 342 CE, the Christian roman emperors [[Constantius II|Constantius]] and [[Constans]] declared sodomite marriage to be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodosian Code]] 9.8.3: ''"When a man marries and is about to offer himself to men in womanly fashion (quum vir nubit in feminam viris porrecturam), what does he wish, when sex has lost all its significance; when the crime is one which it is not profitable to know; when Venus is changed to another form; when love is sought and not found? We order the statutes to arise, the laws to be armed with an avenging sword, that those infamous persons who are now, or who hereafter may be, guilty may be subjected to exquisite punishment.''&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after around the year 390 CE. The roman emperors [[Valentinian II]], [[Theodosius I]] and [[Arcadius]] declared all acts of sodomy to be an illegal criminal offense against the order of human nature in a civilized society and those who were found guilty of it are severely reprimanded and condemned to be publicly [[death by burning|burned to death]].&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt; Roman emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565 CE) made sodomites a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] for problems such as "famines, earthquakes, and pestilences."&lt;ref&gt;Justinian ''Novels'' 77, 144; Michael Brinkschröde, "Christian Homophobia: Four Central Discourses", in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Switzerland =====
The earliest known execution for sodomy was recorded in the annals of the city of [[Basel]] in 1277. The mention is only one sentence: "''King [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolph]] burned Lord Haspisperch for the vice of sodomy.''" The executed was an obscure member of the German-Swiss aristocracy; it is unknown if there was a political motivation behind the execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Crompton |first=Louis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&amp;q=Haspisperch&amp;pg=PA449 |title=Homosexuality and Civilization |date=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03006-0 |language=en |access-date=2022-04-15 |archive-date=2023-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230323020425/https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&amp;q=Haspisperch&amp;pg=PA449 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====France and Florence=====
During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Florence|City of Florence]] also instated the death penalty. In Florence, a young boy named [[Giovanni di Giovanni]] (1350–1365?) was castrated and burned between the thighs with a red-hot iron by court order under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forbidden Friendships, Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/forbiddenfriends00rock/page/24 24, 227, 356, 360]|last=Rocke|first=Michael|isbn=0-19-512292-5|url=https://archive.org/details/forbiddenfriends00rock/page/24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="litandhomo"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Literature and Homosexuality |first=Michael J |last=Meyer |year=2000 |publisher=Rodopi |page=206|isbn=90-420-0519-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; These punishments continued into the [[Renaissance]], and spread to the Swiss [[canton of Zürich]]. Knight [[Richard Puller von Hohenburg|Richard von Hohenberg]] (died 1482) was burned at the stake together with his lover, his young squire, during this time. In France, French writer [[Jacques Chausson]] (1618–1661) was also burned alive for attempting to seduce the son of a nobleman.

=====England=====

In [[Timeline of LGBT history in Britain|England]], the [[Buggery Act 1533]] made sodomy and [[bestiality]] punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-buggery-act-1533 |title=The Buggery Act 1533 |website=British Library |access-date=April 5, 2021 |archive-date=September 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200930040201/https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-buggery-act-1533 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This act was superseded in 1828, but sodomy remained punishable by death under the new act until 1861, although the [[James Pratt and John Smith|last executions]] were in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bl.uk/lgbtq-histories/articles/the-men-killed-under-the-buggery-act |title=The Men Killed Under the Buggery Act |last=Dryden |first=Steven |website=British Library |access-date=April 5, 2021 |archive-date=November 28, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128012058/https://www.bl.uk/lgbtq-histories/articles/the-men-killed-under-the-buggery-act |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Malta=====
In seventeenth century [[Malta]], Scottish voyager and author [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]], writing in his diary in March 1616, claims a Spanish soldier and a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] teenage boy were publicly burnt to [[ash]]es for confessing to have practiced sodomy together.&lt;ref name="buttigieg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Melita Historica|last=Brincat|first=Joseph M.|title=Book reviews|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2007)4/07.pdf|date=2007|volume=14|page=448|access-date=2018-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416145141/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2007)4/07.pdf|archive-date=2016-04-16|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; To escape this fate, Lithgow further claimed that a hundred ''bardassoes'' (boy prostitutes) sailed for [[Sicily]] the following day.&lt;ref name="buttigieg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buttigieg|first=Emanuel|date=2011|title=Nobility, Faith and Masculinity: The Hospitaller Knights of Malta, c.1580-c.1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DVqd_gb2tmMC&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=A &amp; C Black|isbn=9781441102430|page=156|access-date=2020-05-06|archive-date=2023-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230323020425/https://books.google.com/books?id=DVqd_gb2tmMC&amp;pg=PA156|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghanistan, where such acts remain punishable with fines and a prison sentence, dropped the death penalty after the fall of the [[Taliban]] in 2001, who had mandated it from 1996.

Even in countries where homosexuality is legal (most countries outside of Africa and the Middle East), there are reports of homosexual people being targeted with bullying or physical assault or even homicide.

According to the {{ill|Grupo Gay da Bahia|pt}} (GGB), Brazil's oldest gay rights NGO, the rate of murders of homosexuals in [[LGBT rights in Brazil|Brazil]] is particularly high, with a reported 3,196 cases over the 30-year period of 1980 to 2009 (or about 0.7 cases per 100,000 population per annum).&lt;ref name="globo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/eleicoes2010/mat/2010/10/16/numero-de-assassinatos-de-gays-no-pais-cresceu-62-desde-2007-mas-tema-fica-fora-da-campanha-922804348.asp |title=Número de assassinatos de gays no país cresceu 62% desde 2007, mas tema fica fora da campanha – Jornal O Globo |date=October 16, 2010 |publisher=Oglobo.globo.com |access-date=2012-08-14 |archive-date=2010-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020105353/http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/eleicoes2010/mat/2010/10/16/numero-de-assassinatos-de-gays-no-pais-cresceu-62-desde-2007-mas-tema-fica-fora-da-campanha-922804348.asp |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 387 LGBT Brazilians were murdered in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Violent deaths of LGBT people in Brazil hit all-time high |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/brazil-lgbt-violence-deaths-all-time-high-new-research |work=The Guardian |date=January 22, 2018 |access-date=September 9, 2020 |archive-date=October 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201006164713/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/22/brazil-lgbt-violence-deaths-all-time-high-new-research |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GGB reported 190 documented alleged homophobic murders in Brazil in 2008, accounting for about 0.5% of intentional homicides in Brazil ([[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate]] 22 per 100,000 population as of 2008). 64% of the victims were gay men, 32% were [[trans women]] or transvestites, and 4% were lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46596 Gay-Bashing Murders Up 55 Percent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030115100/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46596 |date=October 30, 2010 }} (ipsnews.net, April 22, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
By comparison, the FBI reported five homophobic murders in the [[History of violence against LGBT people in the United States|United States]] during 2008, corresponding to 0.03% of intentional homicides (homicide rate 5.4 per 100,000 population as of 2008).

The numbers produced by the Grupo Gay da Bahia (GGB) have occasionally been contested on the grounds that they include all murders of LGBT people reported in the media – that is, not only those motivated by bias against homosexuals. Reinaldo de Azevedo, in 2009, columnist of the right-wing [[Veja (magazine)|''Veja'']] magazine, Brazil's most read weekly publication, called the GGB's methodology "unscientific" based on the above objection: that they make no distinction between murders motivated by bias and those that were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = UM VERMELHO-E-AZUL PARA DISSECAR UMA NOTÍCIA.

In many parts of the world, including much of the European Union and [[LGBT rights in the United States|United States]], acts of violence are legally classified as hate crimes, which entail harsher sentences if convicted. In some countries, this form of legislation extends to [[verbal abuse]] as well as physical violence.

Violent hate crimes against LGBT people tend to be especially brutal, even compared to other hate crimes: "an intense rage is present in nearly all homicide cases involving gay male victims".
It is rare for a victim to just be shot; he is more likely to be stabbed multiple times, mutilated, and strangled. "They frequently involved [[torture]], cutting, mutilation... showing the absolute intent to rub out the human being because of his (sexual) preference".&lt;ref name="ALTS"/&gt;
In a particularly brutal case in the United States, on March 14, 2007, in [[Wahneta, Florida]], 25-year-old [[Ryan Keith Skipper]] was found dead from 20 stab wounds and a slit throat. His body had been dumped on a dark, rural road less than 2 miles from his home. His two alleged attackers, William David Brown Jr., 20, and Joseph Eli Bearden, 21, were indicted for robbery and first-degree murder. Highlighting their [[malice (legal term)|malice]] and contempt for the victim, the accused killers allegedly drove around in Skipper's blood-soaked car and bragged of killing him. According to a sheriff's department affidavit, one of the men stated that Skipper was targeted because "he was a faggot."&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

In [[LGBT rights in Canada|Canada]] in 2008, police-reported data found that approximately 10% of all hate crimes in the country were motivated by sexual orientation. Of these, 56% were of a violent nature. In comparison, 38% of all racially motivated offenses were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf |title=Violence Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Bias: 2008 Hate Crime Survey |author=Stahnke, Tad| publisher=[[Human Rights First]] |year=2008 |display-authors=etal |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827144817/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org//pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf |archive-date=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year in the United States, according to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] data, though 4,704 crimes were committed due to racial bias and 1,617 were committed due to sexual orientation, only one murder and one [[forcible rape]] were committed due to racial bias, whereas five murders and six rapes were committed based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="FBI Table 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2008/index.html|title=Hate Crime Statistics: Offense Type by Bias Motivation|year=2008|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|access-date=2010-11-15|archive-date=2020-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002082939/https://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2008/index.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Northern Ireland]] in 2008, 160 [[homophobic]] incidents and 7 [[transphobic]] incidents were reported. Of those incidents, 68.4% were violent crimes; significantly higher than for any other bias category. By contrast, 37.4% of racially motivated crimes were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

People's ignorance of and prejudice against LGBT people can contribute to the spreading of misinformation about them and subsequently to violence. In 2018, a transgender woman was killed by a mob in Hyderabad, India, following false rumors that transgender women were sex trafficking children. Three other transgender women were injured in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suri|first1=Manveena|title=Indian mob kills transgender woman over fake rumors spread on WhatsApp|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/28/asia/india-transgender-whatsapp-mob-intl/index.html|access-date=May 28, 2018|publisher=CNN|date=May 28, 2018|archive-date=October 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030095407/https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/28/asia/india-transgender-whatsapp-mob-intl/index.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research on university-level students indicated the importance of queer visibility and its impact in creating a positive experience for LGBTIQ+ members of a campus community, this can reduce the impact and effect of incidents on youth attending university. When there is a poor climate – students are much less likely to report incidents or seek help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Waling|first1=Andrea|last2=Roffee|first2=James A|date=March 30, 2018|title=Supporting LGBTIQ+ students in higher education in Australia: Diversity, inclusion and visibility|journal=Health Education Journal|language=en|volume=77|issue=6|pages=667–679|doi=10.1177/0017896918762233|s2cid=80302675|issn=0017-8969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence at universities ===
In the United States since the early 2010s, colleges and universities have taken major steps to prevent sexual harassment from taking place on campus, but students have still reported violence due to their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Pérez"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED564604|title=A Hidden Crisis: Including the LGBT Community When Addressing Sexual Violence on College Campuses|last1=Pérez|first1=Zenen Jaimes|last2=Hussey|first2=Hannah|date=September 19, 2014|publisher=Center for American Progress|language=en|access-date=2019-02-26|archive-date=2020-11-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111201148/https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED564604|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment can include "non-contact forms" such as making jokes or comments and "contact forms" like forcing students to commit sexual acts.&lt;ref name="Pérez"/&gt; Even though little information exists with LGBT violence taking place at higher learning institutions, different communities are taking a stand against the violence. Many LGBT rape survivors said they experienced their first assault before the age of 25, and that many arrive on campus with this experience. Almost half of bisexual women experience their first assault between the ages of 18 and 24, and most of these take place unreported on college campuses.&lt;ref name="Pérez"/&gt; In 2012, though the Federal Bureau of Investigation changed what the "federal" definition of what rape means (for reporting purposes), local state governments still determine how campus violence cases are treated. Catherine Hill and Elana Silva said in ''Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus,'' "Students who admit to harassing other students generally don't see themselves as rejected suitors, rather misunderstood comedians."&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED489850|title=Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus|last1=Hill|first1=Catherine|last2=Silva|first2=Elena|date=2005|publisher=American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, 1111 Sixteenth St|isbn=9781879922358|language=en|access-date=2019-02-26|archive-date=2020-10-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201001005730/https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED489850|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most students who commit sexual violence towards other students do it to boost their own ego, believing that their actions are humorous. More than 46% of sexual harassment towards LGBT people still goes unreported.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; National resources have been created to deal with the issue of sexual violence and various organizations such as The American Association of University Women and the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence are established to provide information and resources for those who have been sexually harassed.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

===Legislation against homophobic hate crimes===
Members of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] began describing hate crimes based on sexual orientation (as opposed to generic [[anti-discrimination]] legislation) to be counted as aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bello|first1=Barbara Giovanna|editor1-last=Stange|editor1-first=Mary Zeiss|editor2-last=Oyster|editor2-first=Carol K.|editor3-last=Sloan|editor3-first=Jane E.|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, Volume 1|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412976855|pages=662–665|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA664|access-date=February 22, 2018|chapter=Hate Crimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hate speech laws in Australia]] provide protection in all states against racial vilification, with some additional protections on the grounds of sexual orientation in New South Wales, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania. In [[New South Wales]], 'homosexual vilification' is prohibited under the umbrella of the [[Anti-Discrimination Act 1977]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://antidiscrimination.nsw.gov.au/anti-discrimination-nsw/discrimination/vilification/homosexual-vilification.html ''Homosexual vilification'']. Australia. [[NSW Anti-Discrimination Act]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] had reported that there was no federal law protecting LGBT+ Australians from discrimination or vilification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/section-9-protection-vilification-and-harassment-basis-sexual-orientation-and-sex-andor ‘’ Addressing sexual orientation and sex and/or gender identity discrimination: Consultation Report 2011’’]. [[Australian Human Rights Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the legalisation of [[same-sex marriage in Australia]] in 2017, and sexual orientation anti-discrimination protections in all states, [[LGBT rights in Australia]] are now among the most progressive in the world.

====Scotland====
In 2009, Scotland passed the ''Offences (Aggravation by Prejudice (Scotland) Act'', which made acts of prejudice against Disability, Sexual Orientation and Transgender Status specific offences. This Act requires only a single source of evidence, and those convicted under it must be told upon sentencing both what their sentence will be and what it would have been had prejudice not been a factor.

In July 2017, James Chalmers and Fiona Leverick of the [[University of Glasgow]], submitted their report ''A Comparative Analysis of Hate Crime Legislation'' to the Hate Crime Legislation Review&lt;ref&gt;James Chalmers and Fiona Leverick. (July 2017). [https://consult.gov.scot/hate-crime/independent-review-of-hate-crime-legislation/supporting_documents/495517_APPENDIX%20%20ACADEMIC%20REPORT.pdf ''A Comparative Analysis of Hate Crime Legislation A Report to the Hate Crime Legislation Review''].

While homophobia is still an issue in modern Scotland, particularly in schools,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.equality-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/The-Scottish-LGBT-Equality-Report.pdf ''THE SCOTTISH LGBT EQUALITY REPORT'']. June 2015. [[Equality Network]]. Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; social attitudes towards LGBT+ persons have changed significantly, helped by every Scottish political party leader being vocally in support of [[Same-sex marriage in Scotland|equal marriage]] throughout that campaign. Former leaders of both Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives have been "out" lesbians and current co-leader of the Scottish Greens, [[Patrick Harvie]] is openly gay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://greens.scot/team/patrick-harvie-msp PATRICK HARVIE MSP].

====USA====
The [[LGBT history in the United States|United States]] does not have federal legislation marking sexual orientation as criterion for hate crimes, but several states, including the District of Columbia, enforce harsher penalties for crimes where real or perceived sexual orientation may have been a motivator. Among these 12 countries as well, only the United States has criminal law that specifically mentions gender identity, and even then only in 11 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; In November 2010, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted 79–70 to remove "sexual orientation" from the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, a list of unjustified reasons for executions, replacing it with "discriminatory reasons on any basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/11/18/un-deletes-gay-reference-from-anti-execution-measures/|title=UN deletes gay reference from anti-execution measures|first=Jessica|last=Geen|newspaper=Pink News|date=November 18, 2010|access-date=November 21, 2010|archive-date=October 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022123943/https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/11/18/un-deletes-gay-reference-from-anti-execution-measures/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution specifically mentions a large number of groups, including race, religion, linguistic differences, refugees, [[street children]] and [[indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theusdaily.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=1261706&amp;type=World|title=U.N. panel cuts gay reference from violence measure|publisher=U.S. Daily|date=November 17, 2010|access-date=2018-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603081710/http://www.theusdaily.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=1261706&amp;type=World|archive-date=2016-06-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal and police response to these types of hate crimes is hard to gauge, however. Lack of reporting by authorities on the statistics of these crimes and under-reporting by the victims themselves are factors for this difficulty.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; Often a victim will not report a crime as it will shed unwelcome light on their orientation and invite more victimization.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/gay-community-troubled-by-release-of-killer-in-stanley-park-death-1.776449|title=Gay community troubled by release of killer in Stanley Park death|date=February 5, 2009|publisher=[[CBC News]]|access-date=September 13, 2010|archive-date=June 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613035153/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/gay-community-troubled-by-release-of-killer-in-stanley-park-death-1.776449|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gay Panic Defense]] has at times been adduced to plea for more lenient punishments for people accused of assaulting or killing homosexuals because of their actual or perceived orientation. This defense posits that the attacker was so enraged by their victim's alleged advances as to cause [[temporary insanity]], rendering them unable to stop themselves. If the loss of faculties is proven, or sympathized to the jury, a sentence may be mitigated. In several [[common law countries]], the mitigatory defense of [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]] has been used in violent attacks against LGBT persons, which has led Australian states progressively to abolish the Gay Panic Defense, now effective nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://equalityaustralia.org.au/gaypanicabolished/ ''‘Gay panic’ defence to murder abolished Australia-wide'']. December 2, 2020. Equality Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

People convicted of violence against LGBT people have in several cases received shorter sentences under the Gay Panic Defense plea:
* On September 30, 1997, Kenneth Brewer met Stephen Bright at a local gay bar, where he bought the younger man drinks and they later went back to Brewer's apartment. While there, Brewer made a sexual advance toward Bright, who then beat him to death. Bright was initially charged with [[second-degree murder]], but he was eventually convicted of third-degree assault and was sentenced to one year in prison.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reasonable"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Cynthia|title=Murder and the Reasonable Man: Passion and Fear in the Criminal Courtroom|url=https://archive.org/details/murderreasonable0000leec |url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/murderreasonable0000leec/page/91 91]|publisher=[[NYU Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8147-5115-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2001, [[Aaron Webster]] was beaten to death by a group of youths armed with baseball bats and a pool cue while in an area of [[Stanley Park]] frequented by gay men. Ryan Cran was convicted of [[manslaughter]] in the case in 2004 and released on parole in 2009 after serving 4 years of his six-year sentence.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; Two youths were tried under Canada's [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]] and sentenced to three years after pleading guilty. A fourth assailant was acquitted.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

There have also been criticisms concerning the impartiality of judges. In 1988 in [[LGBT rights in Texas|Texas]], in handing down a 30-year sentence to a man for killing two gay men, instead of the life sentence requested by the prosecutor, Judge Jack Hampton said: "I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teenage boys ...[I] put prostitutes and gays at about the same level ... and I'd be hard put to give somebody life for killing a prostitute."&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/1998/10/23news.html|title=Asking for it|last=Stryker|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Salon Magazine]]|date=October 23, 1998|access-date=September 17, 2010|archive-date=February 7, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207102207/http://salon.com/news/1998/10/23news.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, a [[LGBT rights in Florida|Florida]] judge trying a case concerning the beating to death of a gay man asked the prosecutor, "That's a crime now, to beat up a homosexual?"  The prosecutor responded, "Yes, sir. And it's also a crime to kill them."  "Times have really changed," the judge replied. The judge, Daniel Futch, maintained that he was joking, but was removed from the case.&lt;ref name="ALTS"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Hate Crimes: a reference handbook |last=Altschiller |first=Donald |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2005 |pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;

[[Gay pride parade|LGBT Pride Parades]] in East European, Asian and South American countries often attract violence because of their public nature. Though many countries where such events take place attempt to provide police protection to participants, some would prefer that the parades not happen, and police either ignore or encourage violent protesters. The country of [[LGBT rights in Moldova|Moldova]] has shown particular contempt to marchers, shutting down official requests to hold parades and allowing protesters to intimidate and harm any who try to march anyway. In 2007, after being denied a request to hold a parade, a small group of LGBT people tried to hold a small gathering. They were surrounded by a group twice their size who shouted derogatory things at them and pelted them with eggs. The gathering proceeded even so, and they tried to lay flowers at the Monument to the Victims of Repression. They were denied the opportunity, however, by a large group of police claiming they needed permission from [[city hall]].&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

The following year, a parade was again attempted. A bus carried approximately 60 participants to the capital, but before they could disembark, an angry crowd surrounded the bus. They shouted things like "let's get them out and beat them up", and "beat them to death, don't let them escape" at the frightened passengers. The mob told the activists that if they wanted to leave the bus unharmed, they would have to destroy all of their pride materials. The passengers complied and the march was called off. All the while, police stood passively about 100 meters away, taking no action even though passengers claimed at least nine emergency calls were made to police while on the bus.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Christian|title=Gay Pride Parade Trapped on Bus|publisher=SameSame|date=May 12, 2008|url=http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028012532/http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm|archive-date=October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=67 GenderDoc-M|title=Moldovan Gay Pride Threatened, Cops Refuse Protection for Marchers|date=May 11, 2008|url=http://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/2008/05/moldovan-gay-pride-threatened-cops.html|access-date=September 17, 2010|archive-date=April 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200406205658/http://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/2008/05/moldovan-gay-pride-threatened-cops.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia's officials are similarly averse to [[LGBT culture in Russia|Pride Parades]]. [[Mayor of Moscow]] [[Yury Luzhkov]] has repeatedly banned marches, calling them "[[satan]]ic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ireland|first=Doug|title=Moscow Pride Banned Again|publisher=UK Gay News|date=May 17, 2007|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/08/May/3107.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304181750/http://ukgaynews.org.uk/archive/08/may/3107.htm|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pride participants instead tried to peacefully assemble and deliver a petition to city hall regarding the [[right of assembly]] and [[Freedom of speech by country#Russia|freedom of expression]]. They were met by [[skinheads]] and other protesters, and police who had closed off the square and immediately arrested activists as they entered. As some were being arrested, other participants were attacked by protesters. Police did nothing. Around eleven women and two men were arrested and left in the heat, denied medical attention, and verbally abused by police officers. The officers told the women, "No one needs lesbians, no one will ever get you out of here." When participants were released from custody hours later, they were pelted by eggs and shouted at by protesters who had been waiting.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Have the Upper Hand: Freedom of assembly in Russia and the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people|date=June 2007|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[ILGA-Europe]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202073400/http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|archive-date=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT rights in Hungary|Hungary]], on the other hand, has tried to afford the best protection they can to marchers, but cannot stem the flow of violence. In 2008, hundreds of people participated in the [[Budapest Pride|Budapest Dignity March]]. Police, on alert due to attacks on two LGBT-affiliated businesses earlier in the week, erected high metal barriers on either side of the street the march was to take place on. Hundreds of angry protesters threw petrol bombs and rocks at police in retaliation. A police van was set on fire and two police officers were injured in the attacks. During the parade itself, protesters threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s, eggs and firecrackers at marchers. At least eight participants were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peto, Sandor and Krisztina Than|title=Anti-gay violence mars Hungarian parade|newspaper=The Star Online|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/6/worldupdates/2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014221138/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F7%2F6%2Fworldupdates%2F2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|archive-date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-five people were detained in connection with the attacks, and observers called the incident "the worst violence during the dozen years the Gay Pride Parade has taken place in Budapest".&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bos|first=Stefan|title=Violent Protests Disrupt Hungary's Gay Rights Parade|publisher=VOA News|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802145651/http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm|archive-date=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, three marchers in a [[Jerusalem gay pride parade|gay pride parade in Jerusalem]] on June 30, 2005, were stabbed by [[Yishai Shlisel]], a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jew]]. Shlisel claimed he had acted "in the name of God". He was charged with attempted murder. Ten years later, On July 30, 2015, [[Jerusalem gay pride parade#2015 attack|six marchers were injured]], again by Yishai Shlisel when he stabbed them. It was three weeks after he was released from jail. One of the victims, 16-year-old Shira Banki, died of her wounds at the [[Hadassah Medical Center]] three days later, on August 2, 2015. Shortly after, Prime Minister Netanyahu offered his condolences, adding "We will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law."

In 2019, the gay pride parade in Detroit was infiltrated by armed [[Neo-Nazism|neo-nazis]] who reportedly claimed they wanted to spark "Charlottesville 2.0" referring to the [[Unite the Right rally|Unite the Right]] demonstration in 2017 which resulted in the murder of [[Charlottesville car attack|Heather Heyer]], and many others injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2019/06/10/detroit-chief-nazis-wanted-charlottesville-no-2-detroit-gay-pride-event/1410945001/|title=Detroit chief: Nazis wanted 'Charlottesville 2.0' at Detroit gay pride event|last=Hunter|first=George|website=Detroit News|language=en|access-date=2019-08-14|archive-date=2019-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723183039/https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2019/06/10/detroit-chief-nazis-wanted-charlottesville-no-2-detroit-gay-pride-event/1410945001/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Christopher Street Day Berlin 2019 27.jpg|thumb|Marcher in 2019 [[Christopher Street Day]] 2019 march holding up Solidarity sign with Poland, following [[Białystok]] attack]]

===Advocacy in song lyrics===
[[File:Buju Banton (Apollo theater, 2007).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Buju Banton]], a Jamaican musician, performing in 2007]]
As a result of the strong anti-homosexual culture in [[Jamaica]], many [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] artists, such as [[Buju Banton]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Sizzla]], have published song lyrics advocating violence against homosexuals.
Similarly, [[hip-hop]] music occasionally includes aggressively homophobic lyrics,&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Homophobia and Hip-Hop|publisher=PBS|access-date=2009-03-30|archive-date=2018-10-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013025115/http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since appeared to reform.

Banton wrote a song when he was 15 years old that became a hit when he released it years later in 1992 called "Boom Bye Bye". The song is about murdering homosexuals and "advocated the shooting of gay men, pouring acid on them and burning them alive."&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; A song by Elephant Man proclaims: "When you hear a lesbian getting raped/It's not our fault ... Two women in bed/That's two sodomites who should be dead."&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;

Canadian activists have sought to deport reggae artists from the country due to homophobic content in some of their songs, which they say promote anti-gay violence. In the UK, [[Scotland Yard]] has investigated reggae [[lyrics]] and Sizzla was barred from entering the United Kingdom in 2004 over accusations his music promotes murder.&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/coalition-seeks-ejection-of-reggae-stars-over-anti-gay-lyrics-1.650484|title=Coalition seeks ejection of reggae stars over anti-gay lyrics|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=September 25, 2007|access-date=September 8, 2015|archive-date=December 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201216012931/https://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/coalition-seeks-ejection-of-reggae-stars-over-anti-gay-lyrics-1.650484|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay rights advocates have started the group [[Stop Murder Music]] to combat what they say is the promotion of hate and violence by artists. The group organized protests, causing some venues to refuse to allow the targeted artists to perform, and the loss of sponsors. In 2007, the group asked reggae artists to promise "not to produce music or make public statements inciting hatred against gay people. Neither can they authorise the re-release of previous homophobic songs." Several artists signed that agreement, including Buju Banton, Beenie Man, Sizzla and [[Capleton]],&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; but some later denied signing it.&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9251.html|title=Immigration minister criticised for letting homophobic artist into Canada|first=Tony|last=Grew|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=October 9, 2008|access-date=November 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102014318/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9251.html/|archive-date=January 2, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, skinheads in North America who promoted emerging neo-Nazi pop culture and [[Racism in North America|racist]] rock songs increasingly went to punk rock concerts with anti-gay music advocating violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/l-punks-80s-90s-kept-neo-nazis-scene/ |title=How L.A.

==Motivations==
===Macho culture and social homophobia===
{{main|Homophobia}}
{{see also|Hypermasculinity|Compulsory heterosexuality}}

The vast majority of homophobic criminal assault is perpetrated by male aggressors on male victims, and is connected to aggressive heterosexual [[machismo]] or [[male chauvinism]].
Theorists including [[Calvin Thomas (critical theorist)|Calvin Thomas]] and [[Judith Butler]] have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay.

These theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobia does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexuals in a [[heteronormative]] culture,&lt;ref name="Franklin 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franklin |first=Karen |date=April 2004 |title=Enacting Masculinity: Antigay Violence and Group Rape as Participatory Theater |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227284300 |journal=[[Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy]] |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=25–40 |doi=10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.25 |s2cid=143439942 |via=[[ResearchGate]] |access-date=July 8, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person.&lt;ref name="Franklin 2004"/&gt;

The [[Quran and violence|Quran]] cites the story of the "people of [[Lot in Islam|Lot]]" (also known as the people of [[Sodom and Gomorrah#Islamic|Sodom and Gomorrah]]), destroyed by the [[Anger#Islam|wrath]] of [[God in Islam|Allah]] because they engaged in [[Lust#Islam|lustful]] carnal acts between men.

The most followed [[Islam#Religious personages|Scholars of Islam]], such as [[Shaykh al-Islām]] [[Imam Malik]], and [[Imam Shafi]] among others, ruled that Islam disallows male homosexuality and ordained capital punishment for a person guilty of it.&lt;ref name="Fatwa IslamOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|title=Homosexuality and Lesbianism: Sexual Perversions|publisher=IslamOnline|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603002449/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|archive-date=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal punishment for male [[Islamic views on anal sex|sodomy]] has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe [[Capital and corporal punishment in Islam|capital punishment]]; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment. Homosexual activity is a [[Islamic criminal jurisprudence|crime]] and forbidden in most [[Islam by country|Muslim-majority countries]]. In some relatively [[Islam and secularism|secular]] Muslim-majority countries such as [[LGBT rights in Indonesia|Indonesia]],&lt;ref name="RoughGuideSEAsia2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rough Guide to South East Asia: Third Edition|page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetosout00vari/page/74 74]|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetosout00vari/page/74|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd|isbn=1-84353-437-1|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT rights in Jordan|Jordan]] and [[LGBT rights in Turkey|Turkey]], this is not the case, however social persecution such as [[honor killings]] are widespread of cis-gendered gay men and sometimes lesbians.

The Quran, much like the Bible and [[Torah]], has a vague condemnation of homosexuality and how it should be dealt with, leaving it ambiguous. For this reason, Islamic jurists have turned to the collections of the [[hadith]] (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) and [[Sunnah]] (accounts of his life). These, on the other hand, are perfectly clear and particularly harsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bosworth, Ed. C. and E. van Donzel|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Leiden|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi|Ibn al-Jawzi]] records Muhammad as cursing sodomites in several hadith, and recommending the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in same-sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&amp;pg=PA89|last=Wafer|first=Jim|title=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality|page=89|publisher=New York University Press|year=1997|access-date=2010-07-24|isbn=978-0-8147-7468-7|archive-date=2023-03-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230323020426/https://books.google.com/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&amp;pg=PA89|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad prescribed the death penalty for both the active and the passive male homosexual partners, which is a clear condemnation of male homosexuality within Islam, and the association with male homosexuality being associated with a cursed action has produced a long history of religiously condoned and sanctioned violence against gay men:

{{blockquote|Narrated by Abdullah ibn Abbas: "The Prophet said: 'If you find anyone doing as Lot's people did, kill the one who does it, and the one to whom it is done'."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|38|4447}}, Al-Tirmidhi, 17:1456, Ibn Maajah, 20:2561|title=|source=}}

[[Abu-al-Faraj Ibn Al-Jawzi|Ibn al-Jawzi]] (1114–1200), writing in the 12th century, claimed that Muhammad had cursed "sodomites" in several hadith, and had recommended the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="Muhammad Homosexuality"&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Wafer |author-first=Jim |year=1997 |chapter=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Zw-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 |editor1-last=Murray |editor1-first=Stephen O. |editor1-link=Stephen O.

[[Al-Nuwayri]] (1272–1332), writing in the 13th century, reported in his ''Nihaya'' that Muhammad is "alleged to have said what he feared most for his community were the practices of the people of Lot (he seems to have expressed the same idea in regard to wine and female seduction)."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1986 |title=Liwāṭ |editor1-last=Bosworth |editor1-first=C.

The overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions challenges the harmony of God's creation, and is therefore a revolt against God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dynes|first=Wayne|title=Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality|location=New York|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These views vary depending upon sect. It is noteworthy to point out that Quranists (those who do not integrate the aforementioned Hadiths into their belief system) do not advocate capital punishment, while still condemning male homosexuality as an abomination and major sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/perspectives/more/traits/homosexuality.html|title=Homosexuality prohibited in Submission (Islam)|website=www.masjidtucson.org|access-date=2017-03-05|archive-date=2016-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304141742/http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/perspectives/more/traits/homosexuality.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[imam]]s within the Sunni and Shia branches still preach views stating that homosexual males should be executed under Islamic law. These are also followed up by executions in Islamic countries, and lynchings, honor killings, and hate crimes within Muslim communities in non-Islamic countries. Abu Usamah at [[Green Lane Masjid|Green Lane Mosque]] in [[Religion in Birmingham#Islam|Birmingham]] defended his words to followers by saying "If I were to call homosexuals perverted, dirty, filthy dogs who should be executed, that's my freedom of speech, isn't it?"&lt;ref name="pinknews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8869.html|title=Violence against gays preached in British mosques claims new documentary|first=Tony|last=Grew|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=September 1, 2008|access-date=July 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122134804/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8869.html|archive-date=November 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
