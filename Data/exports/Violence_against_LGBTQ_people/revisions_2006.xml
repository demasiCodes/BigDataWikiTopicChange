The word ''puseran(t)'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''bulgarus'' from which come also the terms ''bugger'' in English and ''bougre'' in French. Though the drawing could be taken as a Northern European reaction to [[sodomy]], it is actually based on an original, now lost, by the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Andrea Mantegna]]. The depiction of the fleeing [[putto]] is an allusion to the accusation that sodomites pursue little children.]]

'''[[Violence]] against [[lesbian]]s, [[gay]]s, [[bisexuality|bisexuals]], and [[transgender]]ed''' (LGBT), sometimes called [[hate crimes]] can occur either at the hands of individuals or groups, or as part of governmental enforcement of laws targeting people who are seen to violate [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] rules. People who are merely ''perceived'' to be LGBT (but who are actually not) may also be targeted. Derrogatory words such as "Chotch," "Fag," and "Dyke" are too frequently used to victimize an LGBT.

Anti-LGBT violence can include threats, physical [[assault]], [[battery (crime)|battery]], [[sexual assault]], [[rape]], [[torture]], [[attempted murder]], or [[murder]]. These actions may be caused by cultural, [[religion and sexual orientation|religious]], or political [[mores]] and [[homophobia|biases]], though the extent to which these groups influence violence against LGBT individuals is an ongoing matter of debate.

==Statistics==
In the United States, the [[FBI]] reported that 72.6% of hate crimes reported to police in 2004 were based on perceived sexual orientation. &lt;!--"down from 16.4%." - couldn't find this in the reference cited--&gt; 61% of these attacks were against gay men, 14% against lesbians, 2% against heterosexuals and 1% against bisexuals, while attacks against GLB people at large made up 20%. [http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/hate_crime/index.html] Violence based on perceived gender identity was not recorded in the report.

==State-sponsored violence==
Sexual relations between individuals of the same sex have frequently been repressed by the state under pain of mutilation and death. Such events (represented as ''buggery'' or ''sodomy'') took place in [[Europe]] from the fifth to the twentieth centuries, and in Muslim countries from the beginning of the Muslim era up to and including the present day. Among the states that have historically punished homosexuality with death are:

== Individual violence ==
Individuals, singly or in groups, have at times taken it upon themselves (usually flouting the law) to repress those alleged to manifest variant sexual behavior. In some legal jurisdictions in the [[United States]], these acts may be legally classified as [[hate crime]]s, which increases the resulting penalty if convicted. &lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Milk, Harvey (600).jpg|thumb|250px|right|'''[[Harvey Milk]] ([[1930]]-[[1978]])'''&lt;br&gt;American politician and gay-rights activist, assassinated by a homophobic assailant.]] --&gt;

Some notable incidents of hate-related assaults include:

* [[Tennessee Williams]] was the victim of an assault in January 1979 in [[Key West]], being beaten by five teenage boys, but he was not seriously injured. The episode was part of a spate of anti-gay violence inspired by an anti-gay newspaper ad run by a local [[Baptist]] minister.
* The fatal stabbing of [[James Zappalorti]], a gay [[Vietnam]] veteran ([[1945]] &amp;ndash;  [[1990]])
* The rape and later murder of [[Brandon Teena]], a [[transsexual]] man ([[1972]] &amp;ndash;  [[1993]])
* The beating death of [[Matthew Shepard]], a gay [[student]] ([[1976]] &amp;ndash;  [[1998]])
* The murder of Pfc [[Barry Winchell]] 1999. He was engaged to [[Calpernia Addams]], a transgendered author.
* The bombing of the [[Admiral Duncan pub]] by [[David Copeland]] in [[1999]]
* The gang-rape and murder of [[Fannyann Eddy]] in 2004, shortly after giving a speech about the threats of violence faced by lesbians and gays in Sierra Leone.
* The fatal beating of gay teenager Jeff Whittington in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] on [[May 8]], [[1999]].
* One notorious incident of gay-bashing occurred on [[September 22]], [[2000]]. Ronald Gay entered a gay bar in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] and opened fire on the patrons, killing [[Danny Overstreet]] and injuring six others. Ronald said he was angry over what his name now meant, and deeply upset that three of his sons had changed their surname. He claimed that he had been told by [[God]] to find and kill lesbians and gay men, describing himself as a "Christian Soldier working for my Lord".

* The non-fatal stabbing of [[Bertrand Delanoë]], a gay [[politician]], Mayor of Paris, France, in [[2002]]
* The killing of [[Gwen Araujo]], a [[transsexual]] woman ([[1985]] &amp;ndash;  [[2002]])
* The killing of [[Paul Broussard]], a Houston-area banker (1968-1991)
* The beating death of [[Charlie Howard (murder victim)|Charlie Howard]] in [[1984]].
* [[Aaron Webster]], a gay man in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], was beaten to death in [[Stanley Park]] in [[2001]].
* On June 30, 2005, Yishai Shlisel, an [[Ultra-orthodox Judaism|ultra-orthodox Jew]] stabbed three marchers in a [[gay pride]] parade in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], claiming he acted on behalf of God.[http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Israeli_man_faces_attempted_murder_charges_for_stabbing_three_gay_pride_marchers]

* On July 30, 2006, Six men were brutally beaten after leaving the [[San Diego, California]] [[Gay Pride festival]]. One of the gay men was beaten so badly that he had to undergo extensive facial reconstructive surgery.The attackers were all adults, except for a 15-year-old and were charged with [[hate crimes]].[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20060921-1257-bn21attacks2.html&amp;cid=0&amp;sig2=5j6BFSRc0TOf8Nsuf9cy4w]



As the process of identifying non-heterosexual traits is often sloppy, violence has been committed against heterosexuals who are merely perceived to be gay. Prominent incidents include:

* {{Fact}} Actor and comedian [[Norm MacDonald]] (of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'') was attacked by two men in [[New York City]]. They thought he was a gay man because he was well-dressed, with styled hair, and lanky; he was walking through [[Greenwich Village]], a [[gay village|center of the city's gay community]]. He suffered a concussion.
