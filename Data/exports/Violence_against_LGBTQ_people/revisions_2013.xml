Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ([[LGBT]]) people frequently face violence motivated by their [[human sexuality|sexuality]] or [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|title=An Intersectional Analysis of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) People's Evaluations of Anti-Queer Violence|journal=Gender &amp; Society|year=2012|month=December|volume=26|issue=6|pages=849–873|doi=10.1177/0891243212461299|url=http://gas.sagepub.com/content/26/6/849.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence may be executed by the state, as in laws prescribing corporal punishment for homosexual acts (see [[homosexuality laws]]), or by individuals engaging in intimidation, [[mobbing]], assault, or [[lynching]] (see [[gay bashing]], [[trans bashing]]).  Violence targeted at people because of their perceived sexuality can be psychological or physical and can extend to [[murder]]. These actions may be motivated by [[homophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], [[biphobia]], [[transphobia]], and may be influenced by cultural, [[religion and sexual orientation|religious]], or political [[mores]] and biases.

In the modern [[Western world]] and much of the developed world in general, where homosexual acts have been legal in almost all countries since at least the 1940s, '''violence against LGBT people''' is often qualified as a [[hate crime]],&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;Stotzer, R.:  [https://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/Comparison%20of%20Hate%20Crime%20Formatted.pdf Comparison of love Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups], [[Williams Institute]], 2007–06. Retrieved on 2007-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt; motivated by [[homophobia]], and is often connected with either conservative-leaning religious or political ideologies which condemn homosexuality and relate it to being weak, ill, feminine, or morally wrong. Many countries outside the west, particularly where the dominant religion is [[Islam]] and in [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Russia]] are currently very dangerous for LGBT people because of [[discrimination against homosexuals]] which influences both discriminatory legislation and physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stewart | first = Chuck | title =The Greenwood Encyclopedia of LGBT Issues Worldwide | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-313-34231-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the European Union's [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]] and [[Charter of Fundamental Rights]] offer some protection against sexuality-based discrimination.

Historically, state-sanctioned persecution of homosexuals was mostly limited to [[male homosexuality]], termed "[[sodomy]]". During the medieval and early modern period, the penalty for sodomy was usually death. During the modern period (from the 19th century to the mid-20th century) in the Western world, the penalty was usually a fine or imprisonment.

As of 2009, there remain under 80 countries worldwide where homosexual acts remain illegal (notably throughout the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]] and in most of [[Africa]], but also in some of the [[Caribbean]] and [[Oceania]]) including five that carry the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7883204&amp;page=1 New Benefits for Same-Sex Couples May Be Hard to Implement Abroad]".

===Historic===
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|left|The knight von Hohenberg and his squire, being burned at the stake for sodomy, Zurich 1482 (Zurich Central Library)]]

====The Middle East====
An early law against sexual intercourse between men is recorded in [[Leviticus]] by the [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]], prescribing the [[death penalty]]. A violent law regarding homosexual rape is prescribed in the [[Assyrian Empire#Middle Assyrian period|Middle Assyrian]] Law Codes (1075 BCE), stating: "If a man lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a [[eunuch]]". This misinterpreted code doesn't condemn homosexuality;&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; it describes a situation where a man has forced sex upon another person, who then has the option of bringing a charge against him. The perpetrator is punished while the victim is not, therefore the crime is homosexual [[rape]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, 468&lt;/ref&gt;

In the account given in [[Tacitus]] ''[[Germania (Tacitus)|Germania]]'', the [[death penalty]] was reserved for two kinds of capital offenses: military treason or desertion was punished by [[hanging]], and moral infamy (cowardice and homosexuality:  ''ignavos et imbelles at corpore infames''); Gordon translates ''corpore [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'' as "unnatural prostitutes"; Tacitus refers to male homosexuality, see
David F. Greenberg, ''The construction of homosexuality'', p.&amp;nbsp;242 f. Scholarship compares the later Germanic concept of Old Norse ''[[argr]]'', Langobardic ''arga'', which combines the meanings "effeminate, cowardly, homosexual", see [[Jaan Puhvel]], 'Who were the Hittite ''hurkilas pesnes''?' in: A. Etter (eds.), ''O-o-pe-ro-si'' (FS Risch), Walter de Gruyter, 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;154.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
In [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]], the poorly attested ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' penalized an adult male for committing a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against an [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|underage male citizen]] ''([[ingenui|ingenuus]])''. It is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine. The law may also have been used to prosecute [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|adult male citizens]] who willingly took a [[Pathicus|pathic role in same-sex acts]], but prosecutions are rarely recorded and the provisions of the law are vague; as [[John Boswell]] has noted, "if there was a law against homosexual relations, no one in [[Cicero]]'s day knew anything about it."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boswell]], ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 63, 67–68, quotation on p. 69. See also Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 116; [[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992), p. 106ff.; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 140–141; Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 86, 224; Jonathan Walters, "Invading the Roman Body," in ''Roman Sexualites'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), pp. 33–35, noting particularly the overly broad definition of the ''Lex Scantinia'' by Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (American Philosophical Society, 1953, reprinted 1991), pp. 559 and 719. Freeborn Roman men could engage in sex with males of lower status, such as prostitutes and slaves, without moral censure or losing their perceived masculinity, as long as they took the active, penetrating role; see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]].&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Roman Empire]] came under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]], all male homosexual activity was increasingly repressed, often on pain of death.&lt;ref name = THEOD&gt;(Theodosian Code 9.7.6): All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people.&lt;/ref&gt; In 342 CE,  the Christian emperors [[Constantius II|Constantius]] and [[Constans]] declared same-sex marriage to be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodosian Code]] 9.8.3: ''"When a man marries and is about to offer himself to men in womanly fashion (quum vir nubit in feminam viris porrecturam), what does he wish, when sex has lost all its significance; when the crime is one which it is not profitable to know; when Venus is changed to another form; when love is sought and not found? We order the statutes to arise, the laws to be armed with an avenging sword, that those infamous persons who are now, or who hereafter may be, guilty may be subjected to exquisite punishment.''&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, in the year 390 CE,  emperors [[Valentinian II]], [[Theodosius I]] and [[Arcadius]] declared homosexual sex to be illegal and those who were guilty of it were condemned to be publicly burned alive.&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt;  Emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565 CE) made homosexuals a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] for problems such as "famines, earthquakes, and pestilences."&lt;ref&gt;Justinian ''Novels'' 77, 144; Michael Brinkschröde, "Christian Homophobia: Four Central Discourses," in '''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws and codes prohibiting homosexual practice were in force in [[Europe]] from the fourth&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt; to the twentieth centuries, and Muslim countries have had similar laws from the beginnings of [[Islam]] in the seventh century up to and including the present day. [[Abbasid]] [[Baghdad]], under the [[Caliph]] [[Al-Hadi]] (785–786 CE), punished homosexuality with death.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Florence|City of Florence]] also instated the death penalty. In Florence, a young boy named [[Giovanni di Giovanni]] (1350–1365?) was castrated and burned between the thighs with a red-hot iron by court order under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forbidden Friendships, Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=24, 227, 356, 360|last=Rocke|first=Michael|isbn=0-19-512292-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="litandhomo"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Literature and Homosexuality |first=Michael J |last=Meyer |year=2000 |publisher=Rodopi |page=206|isbn=90-420-0519-X |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; These punishments continued into the [[Renaissance]], and spread to the [[Swiss]] [[canton of Zürich]]. Knight Richard von Hohenberg (died 1482) was burned at the stake together with his lover, his young squire, during this time. In France, [[French people|French]] writer [[Jacques Chausson]] (1618–1661) was also burned alive for attempting to seduce the son of a nobleman.

In England, the [[Buggery Act 1533|Buggery Act of 1534]] made sodomy and bestiality punishable by death. This act was replaced in 1828, but sodomy remained punishable by death under the new act until 1861. The [[James Pratt and John Smith|last executions]] were in 1835. 

In [[Nazi Germany]], homosexuals were among the groups targeted by [[the Holocaust]]. See [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]] for more detailed explanations.

{{further|Homophobic violence in Brazil}}
According to the Grupo Gay da Bahia, Brazil's oldest gay rights NGO, the rate of murders of homosexuals in [[Brazil]] is particularly high, with a reported 3,196 cases over the 30-year period of 1980 to 2009 (or about 0.7 cases per 100,000 population per annum).&lt;ref name="globo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/eleicoes2010/mat/2010/10/16/numero-de-assassinatos-de-gays-no-pais-cresceu-62-desde-2007-mas-tema-fica-fora-da-campanha-922804348.asp |title=Número de assassinatos de gays no país cresceu 62% desde 2007, mas tema fica fora da campanha - Jornal O Globo |publisher=Oglobo.globo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brazilian gay group [[Grupo Gay da Bahia]] (GGB) reported 190 documented alleged homophobic murders in Brazil in 2008, accounting for about 0.5% of intentional homicides in Brazil ([[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate]] 22 per 100,000 population as of 2008). 64% of the victims were gay men, 32% were transvestites, and 4% were lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46596 Gay-Bashing Murders Up 55 Percent] (ipsnews.net, 22 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
By comparison, the FBI reported five homophobic murders in the United States during 2008, corresponding to 0.03% of intentional homicides (homicide rate 5.4 per 100,000 population as of 2008).
{{anchor|Homocaust}}Homophobic murders in Brazil are sometimes referred to as ''homocausto'' or "[[:wikt:homocaust|homocaust]]", a portmanteau of ''homosexual'' and ''holocaust''.

The numbers produced by the Grupo Gay da Bahia (GGB) have occasionally been contested on the grounds that they include all murders of LGBT people reported in the media — that is, not only those motivated by bias against homosexuals. Reinaldo de Azevedo, columnist of the [[right-wing]] [[Veja]] mazagine, Brazil's most read weekly publication, called the GGB's methodology "unscientific" based on the above objection: that they make no distinction between murders motivated by bias and those that were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = UM VERMELHO-E-AZUL PARA DISSECAR UMA NOTÍCIA.

A Brazilian gay blog has investigated a sample of 30 murders of gay people reported on the media in 2009 — including some of those used by the GGB in its national statistic report. It determined that the "large majority" of them were committed by the homosexual partners of the victims or those who were otherwise in a relationship with them (e.g., male prostitutes), with some others being killed due to unpaid debts with gangs involved in drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = "Homophobic" crimes. | publisher = [[GAYS DE DIREITA]] | year = 2010 | url = http://gaysdedireita.blogspot.com/2010/03/crimes-homofobicos.html | accessdate = 2011-06-27 | language = Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many parts of the world, including much of the [[European Union]] and United States, acts of violence are legally classified as [[hate crime]]s, which entail harsher sentences if convicted. In some countries, this form of legislation extends to [[verbal abuse]] as well as physical violence.

Violent hate crimes against LGBT people  tend to be especially brutal, even compared to other [[hate crime]]s: "an intense rage is present in nearly all homicide cases involving gay male victims".
It is rare for a victim to just be shot; he is more likely to be stabbed multiple times, mutilated, and strangled. "They frequently involved [[torture]], cutting, mutilation... showing the absolute intent to rub out the human being because of his (sexual) preference".&lt;ref name="ALTS"/&gt;
In a particularly brutal case in the United States, on March 14, 2007, in [[Wahneta, Florida]], 25-year-old [[Ryan Keith Skipper]] was found dead from 20 stab wounds and a slit throat. His body had been dumped on a dark, rural road less than 2 miles from his home. His two alleged attackers, William David Brown, Jr., 20, and Joseph Eli Bearden, 21, were indicted for robbery and first-degree murder. Highlighting their [[malice (legal term)|malice]] and contempt for the victim, the accused killers allegedly drove around in Skipper's blood-soaked car and bragged of killing him. According to a sheriff's department affidavit, one of the men stated that Skipper was targeted because "he was a faggot."&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

In [[Canada]] in 2008, police-reported data found that approximately 10% of all hate crimes in the country were motivated by sexual orientation. Of these, 56% were of a violent nature. In comparison, 38% of all racially motivated offenses were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf|title=Violence Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Bias: 2008 Hate Crime Survey|author=Stahnke, Tad, ''et al.''|publisher=[[Human Rights First]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year in the United States, according to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] data, though 4,704 crimes were committed due to racial bias and 1,617 were committed due to sexual orientation, only one murder and one [[forcible rape]] were committed due to racial bias, whereas five murders and six rapes were committed based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="FBI Table 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2008/index.html|title=Hate Crime Statistics: Offense Type by Bias Motivation|year=2008|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Northern Ireland]] in 2008, 160 [[homophobic]] incidents and 7 [[transphobic]] incidents were reported. Of those incidents, 68.4% were violent crimes; significantly higher than for any other bias category. By contrast, 37.4% of racially motivated crimes were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

===Legislation against homophobic hate crimes===
{{Update|section|inaccurate=y|date=May 2013}}
In the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], twelve have legislation specifically designed for bias based on sexual orientation (as opposed to generic [[anti-discrimination]] legislation) to be counted as aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime.{{fact|date=September 2013}}

The United States does not have federal legislation marking sexual orientation as criteria for hate crimes, but several states, including the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], enforce harsher penalties for crimes where real or perceived sexual orientation may have been a motivator. Among these 12 countries as well, only the United States has criminal law that specifically mentions gender identity, and even then only in 11 states and the District of Colombia.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; In November 2010, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted 79-70 to remove "sexual orientation" from the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, a list of unjustified reasons for executions, replacing it with "discriminatory reasons on any basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/11/18/un-deletes-gay-reference-from-anti-execution-measures/|title=UN deletes gay reference from anti-execution measures|first=Jessica|last=Geen|publisher=Pink News|date=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution specifically mentions a large number of groups, including race, religion, linguistic differences, refugees, [[street children]] and [[indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theusdaily.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=1261706&amp;type=World|title=U.N. panel cuts gay reference from violence measure|publisher=U.S. Daily|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal and police response to these types of hate crimes is hard to gauge, however. Lack of reporting by authorities on the statistics of these crimes and under-reporting by the victims themselves are factors for this difficulty.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; Often a victim will not report a crime as it will shed unwelcome light on their orientation and invite more victimization.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/02/05/bc-arron-webster-ryan-cran-released.html|title=Gay community troubled by release of killer in Stanley Park death|date=5 February 2009|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged judicative bias===
{{further|Gay Panic Defense}}
Legal defenses like the [[Gay Panic Defense]] allow for more lenient punishments for people accused of beating, torturing, or killing homosexuals because of their orientation. These arguments posit that the attacker was so enraged by their victim's advances as to cause [[temporary insanity]], leaving them unable to stop themselves or tell right from wrong. In these cases, if the loss of faculties is proven, or sympathized to the jury, an initially severe sentence may be significantly reduced. Take for example the case of Kenneth Brewer. On 30 September 1997, he met Stephen Bright at a local gay bar. He bought the younger man drinks and they later went back to Brewer's apartment. While there, Brewer made a sexual advance toward Bright, and Bright beat him to death. Bright was initially charged with [[second-degree murder]], but he was eventually convicted of third-degree [[assault]] and was sentenced to one year in prison.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reasonable"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Cynthia|title=Murder and the Reasonable Man: Passion and Fear in the Criminal Courtroom|url=http://books.google.com/?id=se0xg_yvRSMC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=Kenneth+Brewer+hawaii#v=onepage&amp;q=Kenneth%20Brewer%20hawaii&amp;f=false|publisher=[[NYU Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8147-5115-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cases like Bright's are not isolated. In 2001, [[Aaron Webster]] was beaten to death by a group of youths armed with baseball bats and a pool cue while hanging around an area of [[Stanley Park]] frequented by gay men. Ryan Cran was convicted of [[manslaughter]] in the case in 2004 and released on parole in 2009 after serving only 4 years of his six-year sentence.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; Two youths were tried under Canada's [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]] and sentenced to three years after pleading guilty. A fourth assailant was [[acquitted]].&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

Judges are not immune to letting their own prejudices affect their judgment either. In 1988, [[Texas]] Judge Jack Hampton gave a man 30 years for killing two gay men, instead of the life sentence requested by the prosecutor. After handing down his judgment, he said: "I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teenage boys ...[I] put prostitutes and gays at about the same level ... and I'd be hard put to give somebody life for killing a prostitute."&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/1998/10/23news.html|title=Asking for it|last=Stryker|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Salon Magazine]]|date=23 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, a [[Florida]] judge trying a case concerning the beating to death of a gay man asked the prosecutor, "That's a crime now, to beat up a homosexual?"  The prosecutor responded, "Yes, sir. And it's also a crime to kill them."  "Times have really changed," the judge replied. The judge, Daniel Futch, maintained that he was joking, but was removed from the case.&lt;ref name="ALTS"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hate Crimes: a reference handbook|last=Altschiller|first=Donald|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;

===Attacks on gay pride parades===
[[Gay pride parade|LGBT Pride Parades]] often attract violence because of their public nature. Though many countries where such events take place attempt to provide police protection to participants, some would prefer that the parades not happen, and police either ignore or encourage violent protesters. The country of [[Moldova]] has shown particular contempt to marchers, shutting down official requests to hold parades and allowing protesters to intimidate and harm any who try to march anyway. In 2007, after being denied a request to hold a parade, a small group of LGBT people tried to hold a small gathering. They were surrounded by a group twice their size who shouted derogatory things at them and pelted them with eggs. The gathering proceeded even so, and they tried to lay flowers at the Monument to the Victims of Repression. They were denied the opportunity, however, by a large group of police claiming they needed permission from [[city hall]].&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

The following year, a parade was again attempted. A bus carried approximately 60 participants to the capital, but before they could disembark, an angry crowd surrounded the bus. They shouted things like "let's get them out and beat them up," and "beat them to death, don't let them escape" at the frightened passengers. The mob told the activists that if they wanted to leave the bus unharmed, they would have to destroy all of their pride materials. The passengers complied and the march was called off. All the while, police stood passively about 100 meters away, taking no action even though passengers claimed at least nine emergency calls were made to police while on the bus.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Christian|title=Gay Pride Parade Trapped on Bus|publisher=SameSame|date=May 12, 2008|url=http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=67 GenderDoc-M|title=Moldovan Gay Pride Threatened, Cops Refuse Protection for Marchers|date=May 11, 2008|url=http://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/2008/05/moldovan-gay-pride-threatened-cops.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russia]]'s officials are similarly adverse to Pride Parades.

They were met by [[skinheads]] and other protesters, and police who had closed off the square and immediately arrested activists as they entered. As some were being arrested, other participants were attacked by protesters. Police did nothing. Around eleven women and two men were arrested and left in the heat, denied medical attention, and verbally abused by police officers. The officers told the women, "No one needs lesbians, no one will ever get you out of here." When participants were released from custody hours later, they were pelted by eggs and shouted at by protesters who had been waiting.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Have the Upper Hand: Freedom of assembly in Russia and the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people|date=June 2007|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[ILGA-Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hungary]], on the other hand, has tried to afford the best protection they can to marchers, but cannot stem the flow of violence. In 2008, hundreds of people participated in the [[Budapest]] Dignity March. Police, on alert due to attacks on two LGBT-affiliated businesses earlier in the week, erected high metal barriers on either side of the street the march was to take place on. Hundreds of angry protesters threw petrol bombs and rocks at police in retaliation. A police van was set on fire and two police officers were injured in the attacks. During the parade itself, protesters threw [[Molotov cocktails]], eggs and firecrackers at marchers. At least eight participants were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peto, Sandor and Krisztina Than|title=Anti-gay violence mars Hungarian parade|publisher=The Star Online|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/6/worldupdates/2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-five people were detained in connection with the attacks, and observers called the spectacle "the worst violence during the dozen years the Gay Pride Parade has taken place in Budapest."&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bos|first=Stefan|title=Violent Protests Disrupt Hungary's Gay Rights Parade|publisher=VOA News|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy in song lyrics===

During the 1980s, North America's punk rock and skinhead scenes saw the development of viciously anti-gay music and the advocacy of anti-gay violence.  This occurred with the ascendancy of neo-Nazi pop culture and racist hate-rock.

The lyrics to the song, "Tooling for Anus", by 80s Detroit hardcore band, [[The Meatmen]], explicitly states ''"I'm not a fag and I'll never be, afraid to hit the can to take a pee, afraid some sissy'll grab my ass, I'll stick his face with broken glass"'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lyricsmania.com/tooling_for_anus_lyrics_meatmen_the.html |title=The Meatmen - Tooling For Anus Lyrics |publisher=Lyricsmania.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, fans of the Meatmen try to play down their legendary anti-gay activity, saying that it was all, purportedly, meant as a "joke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackman |first=Michael |url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=12614 |title=Music: True Grit |publisher=Metro Times |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Jackman, writer for Detroit's "Metro Times," did an interview with Meatmen singer Tesco Vee, who said that the song's origins dated to the late 1970s and early 1980s in Detroit, when hardcore punk bands, unable to get booked in bars and in a city lacking all-ages clubs, would do "punk nights" at gay men's bars, creating what Vee called a "worlds collide" sort of thing.&lt;ref&gt;ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Vee's story is belied by the fact that the band not only promoted hatred against gay men, but more aggressively against lesbians.  The lyrics to the Meatmen's song "Lesbian Death Dirge" read, ''"Twisted women in a line. Emotionally traumatized, Mom and pop think you're slime, We'll steamroll you. You'll eat our poop. Look at those tracks, I'm gonna drive my motorcycle up those saggy glad bags, get your sh*t together, sucking a good stiff will do you good"'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicmademe.com/song/lyrics/26475 |title=The Music Made Me Do It : The Meatmen : Lesbian Death Dirge : Lyrics |publisher=Musicmademe.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite all this, as well as the fact that Tesco Vee had performed a song called "Morrissey Must Die" about the Smiths' self-identified asexual frontman and referred to him as a "fag," they later contributed a cover of the song "How Soon Is Now?" on a Smiths tribute album.

The closing words to the song "I'm Not a Loser", by California punk rock band the [[Descendents]] read, ''"Your pants are too tight, You fu*king homo, You suck, Mr. Buttfu*k. You don't belong here. No way you fu*king gay. I'm not a loser!"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/im-not-a-loser-lyrics-descendents.html |title=Descendents - I'M Not A Loser Lyrics |publisher=Metrolyrics.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the strong anti-homosexual culture in [[Jamaica]], many [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] artists, such as [[Buju Banton]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Sizzla]], have published song lyrics advocating violence against homosexuals.
Similarly, [[hip-hop]] music often includes aggressively homophobic lyrics.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Homophobia and Hip-Hop|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banton wrote a song when he was 15 years old that became a hit when he released it years later in 1992 called "Boom Bye Bye". The song is about violently murdering homosexuals and "advocated the shooting of gay men, pouring acid on them and burning them alive."&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; A song by Elephant Man proclaims: "When you hear a lesbian getting raped/It's not our fault ... Two women in bed/That's two sodomites who should be dead."&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;

Due to the violent, homophobic nature of some of their songs, several reggae artists have been investigated by police for promoting anti-gay violence. Some [[lyrics]] have been investigated by [[Scotland Yard]], and Sizzla was barred from entering the [[United Kingdom]] in 2004 while being investigated for promoting murder through his music.&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/09/25/concerts-reggae-antigay.html|title=Coalition seeks ejection of reggae stars over anti-gay lyrics|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay rights advocates have started the group [[Stop Murder Music]] to combat the promotion of hate and violence by artists. The group organized protests, causing some venues to refuse to allow the targeted artists to perform, and the loss of sponsors. In 2007, Stop Murder Music introduced the [[Reggae Compassionate Act]], which states that "the artists promise not to produce music or make public statements inciting hatred against gay people. Neither can they authorise the re-release of previous homophobic songs." Several artists have signed the Act, including Buju Banton, Beenie Man, Sizzla and [[Capleton]],&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; but have later denied making any commitment to stop promoting homophobia.&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9251.html|title=Immigration minister criticised for letting homophobic artist into Canada|first=Tony|last=Grew|publisher=[[Pink News]]|date=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==
{{main|Homophobia}}

===Macho culture and social homophobia===
{{Section OR|date=April 2013}}
The vast majority of homophobic criminal assault is perpetrated by male aggressors on male victims, and is connected to aggressive heterosexual [[machismo]] or [[male chauvinism]].
Theorists including [[Calvin Thomas (critical theorist)|Calvin Thomas]] and [[Judith Butler]] have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay.
Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy J. Chodorow. [http://www.cyberpsych.org/homophobia/chodorow.htm Statement in a public forum on homophobia by The American Psychoanalytic Foundation, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/health/050802_masculinity.html Masculinity Challenged, Men Prefer War and SUVs]&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, allegedly homophobia is rampant in sports, and in the [[subculture]] of its supporters, that are considered [[stereotype|stereotypically]] "male", such as [[association football|football]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/34787/fans-culture-hard-to-change "Fans' culture hard to change"]&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobia does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexual in a [[heteronormative]] culture, thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person.

Various [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual's own same-sex impulses, whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical. This threat causes repression, denial or [[reaction formation]].&lt;ref&gt;West, D.J. ''Homosexuality re-examined.'' Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1977. ISBN 0-8166-0812-1&lt;/ref&gt;

From an [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] point of view male-to-male homophobia makes little sense, as the existence of homosexual males in the population reduces for any heterosexual male the number of competitors in the heterosexual mating process. If anything, from the same point of view hetero males would be expected to encourage homosexual preferences in other males.

===Religious===

{{quote|And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]]: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.|{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}}}

The above verse, along with {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|KJV}}, is the cause of tension between the devout of the [[Abrahamic religions]] and members of the LGBT community. It is viewed by many as an outright condemnation of homosexual acts between men, and, more commonly in ancient times than today, justification for violence.

[[Pope Benedict XVI]], then the leader of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] stoked this sentiment as well, when he stated that "protecting" humanity from homosexuality was just as important as saving the world from [[climate change]] and that all relationships beyond traditional heterosexual ones are a "destruction of God's work".&lt;ref name="pope" /&gt; Further, a [[Holy See|Vatican]] official called homosexuality "a deviation, an irregularity, a wound".&lt;ref name="pope" /&gt; While the Catholic Church teaches that same-sex attraction itself is not sinful, homosexual acts are "acts of grave depravity". Homosexual congregation members are to be accepted and not discriminated against, but are asked to remain [[celibate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=14672|title=Vatican U.N. delegation calls for end to unjust discrimination against homosexuals|publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]]|date=December 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evangelicals in Africa sometimes use religion to justify violence against LGBT people and criminalizing homosexual behavior. [[Archbishop]]s [[Peter Akinola]] of [[Nigeria]] and Henry Orombi of [[Uganda]] would not condemn violence against gays and lesbians when questioned on the issue at the [[Global Anglican Future Conference]].&lt;ref name="ekklesia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/7382|title=Evangelical leader criticises failure to condemn violence against gays|publisher=Ekklesia|date=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Russell, Chief Executive of [[Church Army]], expressed outrage over their resistance, stating "Quite honestly [refusal to condemn violence against gay people in their home countries] is disgraceful, it sullies their cause, and is totally un-Christian. You cannot justify violence in God's name. Period. [...] Those who perpetrate violence against gay people in Africa now can use this silence to justify their behaviour. Christians must speak up and say this is wrong."&lt;ref name="ekklesia" /&gt;

====Islam====
{{See also|Islam and homosexuality}}
The [[Qur'an]], the holy book of Islam, cites the story of the "people of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]]" (also known as the people of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]), destroyed by the [[Anger#Religious perspectives|wrath]] of [[God in Islam|Allah]] because they engaged in lustful carnal acts between men.

Eminent scholars of Islam, such as [[Shaykh al-Islām]] [[Imam Malik]], and [[Imam Shafi]] amongst others, ruled that Islam disallowed homosexuality and ordained capital punishment for a person guilty of it.&lt;ref name="Fatwa IslamOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|title=Homosexuality and Lesbianism: Sexual Perversions|publisher=IslamOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal punishment for sodomy has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe [[capital punishment]]; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment. Homosexual activity is a crime and forbidden in most Muslim-majority countries. In some relatively secular Muslim-majority countries such as [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref name="RoughGuideSEAsia2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rough Guide to South East Asia: Third Edition|page=74|url=http://www.roughguides.com/|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd|isbn=1-84353-437-1|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jordan]] and [[Turkey]], this is not the case.

The Qur'an, much like the [[Bible]] and [[Torah]], has a vague condemnation of homosexuality and how it should be dealt with, leaving it open to interpretation. For this reason, Islamic jurists have turned to the collections of the [[hadith]] (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) and akhbar (accounts of his life). These, on the other hand, are perfectly clear and particularly harsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bosworth, Ed. C. and E. van Donzel|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Leiden|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn al-Jawzi]]{{dn|date=July 2013}} records Muhammad as cursing sodomites in several hadith, and recommending the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in same-sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&amp;pg=PA89|last=Wafer|first=Jim|title=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality|page=89 |publisher=New York University Press|year=1997|accessdate=2010-07-24|isbn=978-0-8147-7468-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]] again reports Muhammad as having prescribed the death penalty for both the active and the passive partner: "Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of Lot, kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done."&lt;ref name="Fatwa IslamOnline"/&gt; The overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions challenges the harmony of God's creation, and is therefore a revolt against God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dynes|first=Wayne|title=Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality|location=New York|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|imams]] still preach extremist views, stating that homosexuals and "women who act like men" should be killed. Abu Usamah at Green Lane Mosque in [[Birmingham]] defended his words to followers by saying "If I were to call homosexuals perverted, dirty, filthy dogs who should be murdered, that's my freedom of speech, isn't it?"&lt;ref name="pinknews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8869.html|title=Violence against gays preached in British mosques claims new documentary|first=Tony|last=Grew|publisher=[[Pink News]]|date=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less extreme leaders decry this sort of preaching, calling it a "distortion of Islam itself, the abuse and misuse of this great faith".&lt;ref name="pinknews" /&gt;

====Judaism====
{{See also|Judaism and homosexuality}}
In [[Judaism]], the death penalty has not been used in practice for more than 2000 years, though many [[Jewish religious movements|movements]] still view homosexual acts as sinful. [[Orthodox Judaism]] generally prohibits homosexual conduct. While there is disagreement about which acts come under core prohibitions, all of Orthodox Judaism puts certain core homosexual acts, including male-male [[anal sex]] in the category of ''yehareg ve'al ya'avor''&amp;mdash;"die rather than transgress"&amp;mdash;the small category of Biblically-prohibited acts (also including [[murder]], [[idolatry]], [[adultery]], and [[incest]]) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of [[Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law]] to die rather than do.
