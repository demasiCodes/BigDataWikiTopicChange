In [[LGBT rights in Europe|Europe]], the [[LGBT rights in the European Union|European Union]]'s [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]] and [[Charter of Fundamental Rights]] offer some protection against sexuality-based discrimination.

Historically, state-sanctioned persecution of homosexuals was mostly limited to [[male homosexuality]], termed "[[sodomy]]". During the medieval and early modern period, the penalty for sodomy was usually death.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} During the modern period (from the 19th century to the mid-20th century) in the Western world, the penalty was usually a fine or imprisonment.

There was a drop in locations where homosexual acts remained illegal from 2009 when there were 80 countries worldwide (notably throughout the [[LGBT in the Middle East|Middle East]], [[Central Asia]] and in most of [[Africa]], but also in some of the [[LGBT rights in the Americas#Caribbean|Caribbean]] and [[LGBT rights in Oceania|Oceania]]) with five carrying the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7883204&amp;page=1 New Benefits for Same-Sex Couples May Be Hard to Implement Abroad]"ABC News.

Brazil, a country with [[LGBT rights]] protections and legal [[same-sex marriage]], is reported to have the world's highest LGBT murder rate, with more than 380 murders in 2017 alone, an increase of 30% compared to 2016.

==State-sanctioned violence==

===Historic===
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|The knight [[Richard Puller von Hohenburg|von Hohenburg]] and his squire, being burned at the stake for sodomy, Zurich 1482 (Zurich Central Library)]]

====The Middle East====
An early law against sexual intercourse between men is recorded in [[Leviticus]] by the [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]], prescribing the [[death penalty]]. A violent law regarding homosexual intercourse is prescribed in the [[Assyrian Empire#Middle Assyrian period|Middle Assyrian]] [[Assyrian law|Law Codes]] (1075 BCE), stating: "If a man lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a [[eunuch]]".

In the account given in [[Tacitus]] ''[[Germania (Tacitus)|Germania]]'', the death penalty was reserved for two kinds of capital offenses: military treason or desertion was punished by [[hanging]], and moral infamy (cowardice and homosexuality:  ''ignavos et imbelles at corpore infames''); Gordon translates ''corpore [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'' as "unnatural prostitutes"; Tacitus refers to male homosexuality, see
David F. Greenberg, ''The construction of homosexuality'', p.&amp;nbsp;242 f. Scholarship compares the later Germanic concept of Old Norse ''[[argr]]'', Langobardic ''arga'', which combines the meanings "effeminate, cowardly, homosexual", see [[Jaan Puhvel]], 'Who were the Hittite ''hurkilas pesnes''?' in: A. Etter (eds.), ''O-o-pe-ro-si'' (FS Risch), Walter de Gruyter, 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;154.

====Europe====
[[File:Bor-Nederlantsche-Oorloghen 9161.tif|{{Largethumb}}|left|Execution by fire and torture of five homosexual Franciscan friars, Bruges, 26 July 1578]]
In [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]], the poorly attested ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' penalized an adult male for committing a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against an [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|underage male citizen]] ''([[ingenui|ingenuus]])''. It is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine. The law may also have been used to prosecute [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|adult male citizens]] who willingly took a [[Pathicus|pathic role in same-sex acts]], but prosecutions are rarely recorded and the provisions of the law are vague; as [[John Boswell]] has noted, "if there was a law against homosexual relations, no one in [[Cicero]]'s day knew anything about it."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boswell]], ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 63, 67–68, quotation on p. 69. See also Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 116; [[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992), p. 106ff.; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 140–141; Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 86, 224; Jonathan Walters, "Invading the Roman Body," in ''Roman Sexualites'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), pp. 33–35, noting particularly the overly broad definition of the ''Lex Scantinia'' by Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (American Philosophical Society, 1953, reprinted 1991), pp. 559 and 719. Freeborn Roman men could engage in sex with males of lower status, such as prostitutes and slaves, without moral censure or losing their perceived masculinity, as long as they took the active, penetrating role; see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]].&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Roman Empire]] came under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]], all male homosexual activity was increasingly repressed, often on pain of death.&lt;ref name = THEOD&gt;(Theodosian Code 9.7.6): All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people.&lt;/ref&gt; In 342 CE,  the Christian emperors [[Constantius II|Constantius]] and [[Constans]] declared same-sex marriage to be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodosian Code]] 9.8.3: ''"When a man marries and is about to offer himself to men in womanly fashion (quum vir nubit in feminam viris porrecturam), what does he wish, when sex has lost all its significance; when the crime is one which it is not profitable to know; when Venus is changed to another form; when love is sought and not found? We order the statutes to arise, the laws to be armed with an avenging sword, that those infamous persons who are now, or who hereafter may be, guilty may be subjected to exquisite punishment.''&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, in the year 390 CE,  emperors [[Valentinian II]], [[Theodosius I]] and [[Arcadius]] declared homosexual sex to be illegal and those who were guilty of it were condemned to be publicly burned alive.&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt;  Emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565 CE) made homosexuals a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] for problems such as "famines, earthquakes, and pestilences."&lt;ref&gt;Justinian ''Novels'' 77, 144; Michael Brinkschröde, "Christian Homophobia: Four Central Discourses," in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws and codes prohibiting homosexual practice were in force in [[Europe]] from the fourth&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt; to the twentieth centuries, and Muslim countries have had similar laws from the beginnings of [[Islam]] in the seventh century up to and including the present day. [[Abbasid]] [[Baghdad]], under the [[Caliph]] [[Al-Hadi]] (785–786 CE), punished homosexuality with death.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Florence|City of Florence]] also instated the death penalty. In Florence, a young boy named [[Giovanni di Giovanni]] (1350–1365?) was castrated and burned between the thighs with a red-hot iron by court order under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forbidden Friendships, Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=24, 227, 356, 360|last=Rocke|first=Michael|isbn=0-19-512292-5|url=https://archive.org/details/forbiddenfriends00rock}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="litandhomo"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Literature and Homosexuality |first=Michael J |last=Meyer |year=2000 |publisher=Rodopi |page=206|isbn=90-420-0519-X |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; These punishments continued into the [[Renaissance]], and spread to the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[canton of Zürich]]. Knight [[Richard Puller von Hohenberg|Richard von Hohenberg]] (died 1482) was burned at the stake together with his lover, his young squire, during this time. In France, [[French people|French]] writer [[Jacques Chausson]] (1618–1661) was also burned alive for attempting to seduce the son of a nobleman.

In 17th century [[Malta]], there was harsh prejudice and laws towards those who were found guilty or speak openly of being involved in same-sex activity. English voyager and author [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]], writing in March 1616, says a Spanish soldier and a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] teenage boy were publicly burnt to [[ash]]es for confessing to have practiced sodomy together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Melita Historica|last=Brincat|first=Joseph M.|title=Book reviews|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2007)4/07.pdf|date=2007|volume=14|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, and from fear of a similar fate, about a hundred males involved in same-sex prostitution sailed to [[Sicily]] the following day. This episode, published abroad by a foreign writer, is the most detailed account of LGBT life during the rule of the Order. It represents that homosexuality was still a [[taboo]], but a widespread practice, an [[open secret]], and LGBT-related information was suppressed.&lt;ref name="buttigieg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buttigieg|first=Emanuel|date=2011|title=Nobility, Faith and Masculinity: The Hospitaller Knights of Malta, c.1580-c.1700|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=DVqd_gb2tmMC&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=A &amp; C Black|isbn=9781441102430|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Timeline of LGBT history in Britain|England]], the [[Buggery Act 1533|Buggery Act of 1534]] made sodomy and bestiality punishable by death. This act was replaced in 1828, but sodomy remained punishable by death under the new act until 1861. The [[James Pratt and John Smith|last executions]] were in 1835.

In [[Nazi Germany]], homosexuals were among the groups targeted by [[the Holocaust]] (''See [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]]''). (In 1936, the homosexual [[Federico García Lorca]] was executed by right-wing rebels who became [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s dictatorship in Spain, Hitler's ally.) [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]] generally oppose homosexuality to the extent of supporting a renewed persecution the way it took place in Nazi Germany. Being homosexual is equated with being unmasculine and the German word ″Schwul″ ('gay') is used by German Neonazis as a curse word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/artikel/schwule-nazis-ein-brisantes-thema-f%C3%BCr-die-rechtsextreme-szene-8724|title=Schwule Nazis?

According to the Grupo Gay da Bahia, Brazil's oldest gay rights NGO, the rate of murders of homosexuals in [[LGBT rights in Brazil|Brazil]] is particularly high, with a reported 3,196 cases over the 30-year period of 1980 to 2009 (or about 0.7 cases per 100,000 population per annum).&lt;ref name="globo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/eleicoes2010/mat/2010/10/16/numero-de-assassinatos-de-gays-no-pais-cresceu-62-desde-2007-mas-tema-fica-fora-da-campanha-922804348.asp |title=Número de assassinatos de gays no país cresceu 62% desde 2007, mas tema fica fora da campanha - Jornal O Globo |publisher=Oglobo.globo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brazilian gay group [[Grupo Gay da Bahia]] (GGB) reported 190 documented alleged homophobic murders in Brazil in 2008, accounting for about 0.5% of intentional homicides in Brazil ([[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate]] 22 per 100,000 population as of 2008). 64% of the victims were gay men, 32% were [[trans women]] or transvestites, and 4% were lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46596 Gay-Bashing Murders Up 55 Percent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030115100/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46596 |date=2010-10-30 }} (ipsnews.net, 22 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
By comparison, the FBI reported five homophobic murders in the [[History of violence against LGBT people in the United States|United States]] during 2008, corresponding to 0.03% of intentional homicides (homicide rate 5.4 per 100,000 population as of 2008).

The numbers produced by the Grupo Gay da Bahia (GGB) have occasionally been contested on the grounds that they include all murders of LGBT people reported in the media — that is, not only those motivated by bias against homosexuals. Reinaldo de Azevedo, columnist of the [[right-wing]] [[Veja (magazine)|Veja]] magazine, Brazil's most read weekly publication, called the GGB's methodology "unscientific" based on the above objection: that they make no distinction between murders motivated by bias and those that were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = UM VERMELHO-E-AZUL PARA DISSECAR UMA NOTÍCIA.

In many parts of the world, including much of the [[European Union]] and [[LGBT rights in the United States|United States]], acts of violence are legally classified as hate crimes, which entail harsher sentences if convicted. In some countries, this form of legislation extends to [[verbal abuse]] as well as physical violence.

Violent hate crimes against LGBT people tend to be especially brutal, even compared to other hate crimes: "an intense rage is present in nearly all homicide cases involving gay male victims".
It is rare for a victim to just be shot; he is more likely to be stabbed multiple times, mutilated, and strangled. "They frequently involved [[torture]], cutting, mutilation... showing the absolute intent to rub out the human being because of his (sexual) preference".&lt;ref name="ALTS"/&gt;
In a particularly brutal case in the United States, on March 14, 2007, in [[Wahneta, Florida]], 25-year-old [[Ryan Keith Skipper]] was found dead from 20 stab wounds and a slit throat. His body had been dumped on a dark, rural road less than 2 miles from his home. His two alleged attackers, William David Brown, Jr., 20, and Joseph Eli Bearden, 21, were indicted for robbery and first-degree murder. Highlighting their [[malice (legal term)|malice]] and contempt for the victim, the accused killers allegedly drove around in Skipper's blood-soaked car and bragged of killing him. According to a sheriff's department affidavit, one of the men stated that Skipper was targeted because "he was a faggot."&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

In [[LGBT rights in Canada|Canada]] in 2008, police-reported data found that approximately 10% of all hate crimes in the country were motivated by sexual orientation. Of these, 56% were of a violent nature. In comparison, 38% of all racially motivated offenses were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf|title=Violence Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Bias: 2008 Hate Crime Survey|author=Stahnke, Tad|publisher=[[Human Rights First]]|year=2008|display-authors=etal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827144817/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org//pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf|archivedate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year in the United States, according to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] data, though 4,704 crimes were committed due to racial bias and 1,617 were committed due to sexual orientation, only one murder and one [[forcible rape]] were committed due to racial bias, whereas five murders and six rapes were committed based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="FBI Table 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2008/index.html|title=Hate Crime Statistics: Offense Type by Bias Motivation|year=2008|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Northern Ireland]] in 2008, 160 [[homophobic]] incidents and 7 [[transphobic]] incidents were reported. Of those incidents, 68.4% were violent crimes; significantly higher than for any other bias category. By contrast, 37.4% of racially motivated crimes were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

People's ignorance of and prejudice against LGBT people can contribute to the spreading of misinformation about them and subsequently to violence. In 2018, a transgender woman was killed by a mob in Hyderabad, India, following false rumors that transgender women were sex trafficking children. Three other transgender women were injured in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suri|first1=Manveena|title=Indian mob kills transgender woman over fake rumors spread on WhatsApp|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/28/asia/india-transgender-whatsapp-mob-intl/index.html|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=CNN|date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research on university-level students indicated the importance of queer visibility and its impact in creating a positive experience for LGBTIQ+ members of a campus community, this can reduce the impact and effect of incidents on youth attending university. When there is a poor climate - students are much less likely to report incidents or seek help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waling|first=Andrea|last2=Roffee|first2=James A|date=2018-03-30|title=Supporting LGBTIQ+ students in higher education in Australia: Diversity, inclusion and visibility|journal=Health Education Journal|language=en|volume=77|issue=6|pages=667–679|doi=10.1177/0017896918762233|issn=0017-8969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Violence at universities ===
In the United States, colleges and universities in the past few years have taken major steps to prevent sexual harassment from taking place on campus, but students have reported violence due to their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Pérez"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED564604|title=A Hidden Crisis: Including the LGBT Community When Addressing Sexual Violence on College Campuses|last=Pérez|first=Zenen Jaimes|last2=Hussey|first2=Hannah|date=2014-09-19|publisher=Center for American Progress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment can include "non-contact forms" such as making jokes or comments and "contact forms" like forcing students to commit sexual acts.&lt;ref name="Pérez"/&gt; Even though little information exists with LGBT violence taking place at higher learning institutions, different communities are taking a stand against the violence. Many LGBT rape survivors said they experienced their first assault before the age of 25, and that many arrive on campus with this experience. Almost half of bi-sexual women experience their first assault between the ages of 18-24, and most of these take place unreported on college campuses.&lt;ref name="Pérez"/&gt; Though the Federal Bureau of Investigation changed what the "federal" definition of what rape means (for reporting purposes) in 2012, local state governments still determine how campus violence cases are treated. Catherine Hill and Elana Silva said in ''Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus,''"Students who admit to harassing other students generally don't see themselves as rejected suitors, rather misunderstood comedians."&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED489850|title=Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus|last=Hill|first=Catherine|last2=Silva|first2=Elena|date=2005|publisher=American Association of University Women Educational Foundation, 1111 Sixteenth St|isbn=9781879922358|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most students who commit sexual violence towards other students do it to boost their own ego, believing that their actions are humorous. More than 46% of sexual harassment towards LGBT people still goes unreported.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; National resources have been created to deal with the issue of sexual violence and various organizations such as The American Association of University Women and the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence are established to provide information and resources for those who have been sexually harassed.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt;

===Legislation against homophobic hate crimes===
{{Update|section|inaccurate=y|date=May 2013}}
Members of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] began describing hate crimes based on sexual orientation (as opposed to generic [[anti-discrimination]] legislation) to be counted as aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bello|first1=Barbara Giovanna|editor1-last=Stange|editor1-first=Mary Zeiss|editor2-last=Oyster|editor2-first=Carol K.|editor3-last=Sloan|editor3-first=Jane E.|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, Volume 1|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412976855|pages=662–665|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA664|accessdate=22 February 2018|chapter=Hate Crimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[LGBT history in the United States|United States]] does not have federal legislation marking sexual orientation as criteria for hate crimes, but several states, including the District of Columbia, enforce harsher penalties for crimes where real or perceived sexual orientation may have been a motivator. Among these 12 countries as well, only the United States has criminal law that specifically mentions gender identity, and even then only in 11 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; In November 2010, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted 79-70 to remove "sexual orientation" from the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, a list of unjustified reasons for executions, replacing it with "discriminatory reasons on any basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/11/18/un-deletes-gay-reference-from-anti-execution-measures/|title=UN deletes gay reference from anti-execution measures|first=Jessica|last=Geen|newspaper=Pink News|date=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution specifically mentions a large number of groups, including race, religion, linguistic differences, refugees, [[street children]] and [[indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theusdaily.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=1261706&amp;type=World|title=U.N. panel cuts gay reference from violence measure|publisher=U.S. Daily|date=November 17, 2010|access-date=2018-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603081710/http://www.theusdaily.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=1261706&amp;type=World|archive-date=2016-06-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal and police response to these types of hate crimes is hard to gauge, however. Lack of reporting by authorities on the statistics of these crimes and under-reporting by the victims themselves are factors for this difficulty.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; Often a victim will not report a crime as it will shed unwelcome light on their orientation and invite more victimization.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/02/05/bc-arron-webster-ryan-cran-released.html|title=Gay community troubled by release of killer in Stanley Park death|date=5 February 2009|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal defenses like the [[gay panic defense]] allow for more lenient punishments for people accused of beating, torturing, or killing homosexuals because of their orientation. These arguments posit that the attacker was so enraged by their victim's advances as to cause [[temporary insanity]], leaving them unable to stop themselves or tell right from wrong. In these cases, if the loss of faculties is proven, or sympathized to the jury, an initially severe sentence may be significantly reduced. In several [[common law countries]], the mitigatory defense of [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]] has been used in violent attacks against LGBT persons, which has led several [[Australia]]n states and territories to modify their legislation, in order to prevent or reduce the using of this legal defense in cases of violent responses to non-violent homosexual advances.

There have been several highly publicized cases where people convicted of violence against LGBT people have received shorter sentences. One such case is that of Kenneth Brewer. On 30 September 1997, he met Stephen Bright at a local gay bar. He bought the younger man drinks and they later went back to Brewer's apartment. While there, Brewer made a sexual advance toward Bright, and Bright beat him to death. Bright was initially charged with [[second-degree murder]], but he was eventually convicted of third-degree [[assault]] and was sentenced to one year in prison.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reasonable"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Cynthia|title=Murder and the Reasonable Man: Passion and Fear in the Criminal Courtroom|url=https://books.google.com/?id=se0xg_yvRSMC&amp;pg=PA91 |publisher=[[NYU Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8147-5115-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cases like Bright's are not isolated. In 2001, [[Aaron Webster]] was beaten to death by a group of youths armed with baseball bats and a pool cue while hanging around an area of [[Stanley Park]] frequented by gay men. Ryan Cran was convicted of [[manslaughter]] in the case in 2004 and released on parole in 2009 after serving only 4 years of his six-year sentence.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; Two youths were tried under Canada's [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]] and sentenced to three years after pleading guilty. A fourth assailant was [[acquitted]].&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

Judges are not immune to letting their own prejudices affect their judgment either. In 1988, [[LGBT rights in Texas|Texas]] Judge Jack Hampton gave a man 30 years for killing two gay men, instead of the life sentence requested by the prosecutor. After handing down his judgment, he said: "I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teenage boys ...[I] put prostitutes and gays at about the same level ... and I'd be hard put to give somebody life for killing a prostitute."&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/1998/10/23news.html|title=Asking for it|last=Stryker|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Salon Magazine]]|date=23 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, a [[LGBT rights in Florida|Florida]] judge trying a case concerning the beating to death of a gay man asked the prosecutor, "That's a crime now, to beat up a homosexual?"  The prosecutor responded, "Yes, sir. And it's also a crime to kill them."  "Times have really changed," the judge replied. The judge, Daniel Futch, maintained that he was joking, but was removed from the case.&lt;ref name="ALTS"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hate Crimes: a reference handbook|last=Altschiller|first=Donald|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;

[[Gay pride parade|LGBT Pride Parades]] in East European, Asian and South American countries often attract violence because of their public nature. Though many countries where such events take place attempt to provide police protection to participants, some would prefer that the parades not happen, and police either ignore or encourage violent protesters. The country of [[LGBT rights in Moldova|Moldova]] has shown particular contempt to marchers, shutting down official requests to hold parades and allowing protesters to intimidate and harm any who try to march anyway. In 2007, after being denied a request to hold a parade, a small group of LGBT people tried to hold a small gathering. They were surrounded by a group twice their size who shouted derogatory things at them and pelted them with eggs. The gathering proceeded even so, and they tried to lay flowers at the Monument to the Victims of Repression. They were denied the opportunity, however, by a large group of police claiming they needed permission from [[city hall]].&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

The following year, a parade was again attempted. A bus carried approximately 60 participants to the capital, but before they could disembark, an angry crowd surrounded the bus. They shouted things like "let's get them out and beat them up", and "beat them to death, don't let them escape" at the frightened passengers. The mob told the activists that if they wanted to leave the bus unharmed, they would have to destroy all of their pride materials. The passengers complied and the march was called off. All the while, police stood passively about 100 meters away, taking no action even though passengers claimed at least nine emergency calls were made to police while on the bus.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Christian|title=Gay Pride Parade Trapped on Bus|publisher=SameSame|date=May 12, 2008|url=http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028012532/http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm|archivedate=October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=67 GenderDoc-M|title=Moldovan Gay Pride Threatened, Cops Refuse Protection for Marchers|date=May 11, 2008|url=http://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/2008/05/moldovan-gay-pride-threatened-cops.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russia]]'s officials are similarly averse to [[LGBT culture in Russia|Pride Parades]]. [[Mayor of Moscow|Mayor]] of [[Moscow]] [[Yury Luzhkov]] has repeatedly banned marches, calling them "[[satan]]ic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ireland|first=Doug|title=Moscow Pride Banned Again|publisher=UK Gay News|date=May 17, 2007|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/08/May/3107.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304181750/http://ukgaynews.org.uk/archive/08/may/3107.htm|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pride participants instead tried to peacefully assemble and deliver a petition to city hall regarding the [[right of assembly]] and [[Freedom of speech by country#Russia|freedom of expression]]. They were met by [[skinheads]] and other protesters, and police who had closed off the square and immediately arrested activists as they entered. As some were being arrested, other participants were attacked by protesters. Police did nothing. Around eleven women and two men were arrested and left in the heat, denied medical attention, and verbally abused by police officers. The officers told the women, "No one needs lesbians, no one will ever get you out of here." When participants were released from custody hours later, they were pelted by eggs and shouted at by protesters who had been waiting.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Have the Upper Hand: Freedom of assembly in Russia and the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people|date=June 2007|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[ILGA-Europe]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202073400/http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|archivedate=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT rights in Hungary|Hungary]], on the other hand, has tried to afford the best protection they can to marchers, but cannot stem the flow of violence. In 2008, hundreds of people participated in the [[Budapest Pride|Budapest Dignity March]]. Police, on alert due to attacks on two LGBT-affiliated businesses earlier in the week, erected high metal barriers on either side of the street the march was to take place on. Hundreds of angry protesters threw petrol bombs and rocks at police in retaliation. A police van was set on fire and two police officers were injured in the attacks. During the parade itself, protesters threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s, eggs and firecrackers at marchers. At least eight participants were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peto, Sandor and Krisztina Than|title=Anti-gay violence mars Hungarian parade|publisher=The Star Online|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/6/worldupdates/2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014221138/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F7%2F6%2Fworldupdates%2F2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|archivedate=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-five people were detained in connection with the attacks, and observers called the spectacle "the worst violence during the dozen years the Gay Pride Parade has taken place in Budapest".&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bos|first=Stefan|title=Violent Protests Disrupt Hungary's Gay Rights Parade|publisher=VOA News|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802145651/http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm|archivedate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Israel]], three marchers in a [[Jerusalem gay pride parade|gay pride parade in Jerusalem]] on June 30, 2005 were stabbed by [[Yishai Shlisel]], a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jew]]. Shlisel claimed he had acted "in the name of God".

It was three weeks after he was released from jail. One of the victims, 16-year-old Shira Banki, died of her wounds at the [[Hadassah Medical Center]] three days later, on 2 August 2015. Shortly after, Prime Minister Netanyahu offered his condolences, adding "We will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law."

===Advocacy in song lyrics===
[[File:Buju Banton (Apollo theater, 2007).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Buju Banton]], a Jamaican musician, performing in 2007.]]
As a result of the strong anti-homosexual culture in [[Jamaica]], many [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] artists, such as [[Buju Banton]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Sizzla]], have published song lyrics advocating violence against homosexuals.
Similarly, [[hip-hop]] music occasionally includes aggressively homophobic lyrics,&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Homophobia and Hip-Hop|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since appeared to reform.

Banton wrote a song when he was 15 years old that became a hit when he released it years later in 1992 called "Boom Bye Bye". The song is about murdering homosexuals and "advocated the shooting of gay men, pouring acid on them and burning them alive."&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; A song by Elephant Man proclaims: "When you hear a lesbian getting raped/It's not our fault ... Two women in bed/That's two sodomites who should be dead."&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;

Canadian activists have sought to deport reggae artists from the country due to homophobic content in some of their songs, which they say promote anti-gay violence. In the UK, [[Scotland Yard]] has investigated reggae [[lyrics]] and Sizzla was barred from entering the [[United Kingdom]] in 2004 over accusations his music promotes murder.&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/coalition-seeks-ejection-of-reggae-stars-over-anti-gay-lyrics-1.650484|title=Coalition seeks ejection of reggae stars over anti-gay lyrics|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay rights advocates have started the group [[Stop Murder Music]] to combat what they say is the promotion of hate and violence by artists. The group organized protests, causing some venues to refuse to allow the targeted artists to perform, and the loss of sponsors. In 2007, the group asked reggae artists to promise "not to produce music or make public statements inciting hatred against gay people. Neither can they authorise the re-release of previous homophobic songs." Several artists signed that agreement, including Buju Banton, Beenie Man, Sizzla and [[Capleton]],&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; but some later denied signing it.&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9251.html|title=Immigration minister criticised for letting homophobic artist into Canada|first=Tony|last=Grew|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=October 9, 2008|access-date=November 4, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102014318/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9251.html/|archive-date=January 2, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, skinheads in North America who promoted emerging neo-Nazi pop culture and [[Racism in North America|racist]] rock songs increasingly went to punk rock concerts with anti-gay music advocating violence.

==Motivations==
===Macho culture and social homophobia===
{{Original research section|date=April 2013}}
{{main|Homophobia}}
The vast majority of homophobic criminal assault is perpetrated by male aggressors on male victims, and is connected to aggressive heterosexual [[machismo]] or [[male chauvinism]].
Theorists including [[Calvin Thomas (critical theorist)|Calvin Thomas]] and [[Judith Butler]] have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay.
Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy J. Chodorow. [http://www.cyberpsych.org/homophobia/chodorow.htm Statement in a public forum on homophobia by The American Psychoanalytic Foundation, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/050802_masculinity.html|title=Masculinity Challenged, Men Prefer War and SUVs|work=LiveScience.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, allegedly homophobia is rampant in sports, and in the [[subculture]] of its supporters, that are considered [[stereotype|stereotypically]] "male", such as [[association football|football]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/34787/fans-culture-hard-to-change "Fans' culture hard to change"]&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobia does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexual in a [[heteronormative]] culture, thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person.

Various [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual's own same-sex impulses, whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical. This threat causes repression, denial or [[reaction formation]].&lt;ref&gt;West, D.J. ''Homosexuality re-examined.''

====Religious texts====
{{Religious text primary|section|date=May 2016}}
Some verses of the [[Bible and violence|Bible]] are often interpreted as forbidding homosexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]].|[[Leviticus 18]]:22}}

{{quote|And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.|[[Kedoshim|Leviticus 20]]:13}}

The above verses are the cause of tension between the devout of the [[Abrahamic religions]] and members of the LGBT community. It is viewed by many as an outright condemnation of homosexual acts between men, and, more commonly in ancient times than today, justification for violence.

In ''Religion Dispatches'' magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge argues that the six or so verses that are often cited to condemn LGBT people are referring instead to "abusive sex." She states that the Bible has no condemnation for "loving, committed, gay and lesbian relationships" and that [[Jesus]] was silent on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/802/the_%22gay%22_princess_di_bible/|title=The "Gay" Princess Di Bible|author=Candace Chellew-Hodge|work=Religion Dispatches|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church teaches]] that a homosexual orientation is not sinful and that LGBT people are to be treated with compassion and respect, as all others are.  It also [[theology of the body|teaches that sex]] is meant to be had between opposite sex spouses.  A 1992 letter from [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]], the future Pope Benedict XVI, condemned [[gay bashing]].&lt;ref name=reltol/&gt;  It said that LGBT people "have the same rights as all persons including the right of not being treated in a manner which offends their personal dignity."&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;  It adds that 
 	
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in word, in action and in law.&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;&lt;ref name=assumption/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in the same letter Ratzinger suggested that an increase in anti-gay violence is unsurprising if laws are introduced to protect homosexual behavior:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...when civil legislation is introduced to protect behavior to which no one has any conceivable right, neither the church nor society at large should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground and irrational and violent reactions increase.&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Theology of Pope Benedict XVI#Homosexuality and LGBT rights|Pope Benedict XVI]], then the leader of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] stated that "protecting" humanity from homosexuality was just as important as saving the world from [[climate change]] and that all relationships beyond traditional heterosexual ones are a "destruction of God's work."&lt;ref name="pope" /&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2018}} [[Pope Francis]] has been seen as [[Pastoral care for gay Catholics|more welcoming to LGBT people]], saying to a gay man that "God made you like this.

{{See also|Islam and homosexuality}}
The [[Quran and violence|Quran]], the book of Islam, cites the story of the "people of [[Lot in Islam|Lot]]" (also known as the people of [[Sodom and Gomorrah#Islamic|Sodom and Gomorrah]]), destroyed by the [[Anger#Islam|wrath]] of [[God in Islam|Allah]] because they engaged in [[Lust#Islam|lustful]] carnal acts between men.

[[Islam#Scholars|Scholars of Islam]], such as [[Shaykh al-Islām]] [[Imam Malik]], and [[Imam Shafi]] amongst others, ruled that Islam disallowed homosexuality and ordained capital punishment for a person guilty of it.&lt;ref name="Fatwa IslamOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|title=Homosexuality and Lesbianism: Sexual Perversions|publisher=IslamOnline|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603002449/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|archivedate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal punishment for [[Islamic views on anal sex|sodomy]] has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe [[Capital and corporal punishment in Islam|capital punishment]]; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment. Homosexual activity is a [[Islamic criminal jurisprudence|crime]] and forbidden in most [[Islam by country|Muslim-majority countries]]. In some relatively [[Islam and secularism|secular]] Muslim-majority countries such as [[LGBT rights in Indonesia|Indonesia]],&lt;ref name="RoughGuideSEAsia2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rough Guide to South East Asia: Third Edition|page=74|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetosout00vari|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd|isbn=1-84353-437-1|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT rights in Jordan|Jordan]] and [[LGBT rights in Turkey|Turkey]], this is not the case.

The [[Quran]], much like the [[Bible]] and [[Torah]], has a vague condemnation of homosexuality and how it should be dealt with, leaving it open to interpretation. For this reason, Islamic jurists have turned to the collections of the [[hadith]] (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) and [[Sunnah]] (accounts of his life). These, on the other hand, are perfectly clear and particularly harsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bosworth, Ed. C. and E. van Donzel|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Leiden|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi|Ibn al-Jawzi]] records Muhammad as cursing sodomites in several hadith, and recommending the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in same-sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&amp;pg=PA89|last=Wafer|first=Jim|title=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality|page=89 |publisher=New York University Press|year=1997|accessdate=2010-07-24|isbn=978-0-8147-7468-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]] again reports Muhammad as having prescribed the death penalty for both the active and the passive partner: "Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of Lot, kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done."&lt;ref name="Fatwa IslamOnline"/&gt; The overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions challenges the harmony of God's creation, and is therefore a revolt against God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dynes|first=Wayne|title=Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality|location=New York|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it must be noted that these views vary depending upon sect. It is noteworthy to point out that Quranists (those who do not integrate the aforementioned Hadiths into their belief system) do not advocate capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/perspectives/more/traits/homosexuality.html|title=Homosexuality prohibited in Submission (Islam)|website=www.masjidtucson.org|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[imam]]s still preach their views, stating that homosexuals and "women who act like men" should be executed under the Islamic law. Abu Usamah at [[Green Lane Masjid|Green Lane Mosque]] in [[Religion in Birmingham#Islam|Birmingham]] defended his words to followers by saying "If I were to call homosexuals perverted, dirty, filthy dogs who should be executed, that's my freedom of speech, isn't it?"&lt;ref name="pinknews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8869.html|title=Violence against gays preached in British mosques claims new documentary|first=Tony|last=Grew|newspaper=[[Pink News]]|date=September 1, 2008|access-date=July 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122134804/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8869.html|archive-date=November 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other contemporary Islamic views are that the ″crime of homosexuality is one of the greatest of crimes, the worst of [[Sin#Islam|sins]] and the most abhorrent of deeds″.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/38622/ The punishment for homosexuality] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921163324/http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/38622 |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;br /&gt;Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 38622&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality is considered the 11th major sin in Islam, in the days of the [[Sahabah|companions of Muhammad]], a [[Islamic views on slavery|slave]] boy was once forgiven for killing his master who sodomized him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/greater-sins-volume-1-ayatullah-sayyid-abdul-husayn-dastghaib-shirazi/eleventh-greater-sin-sodomy|title=Eleventh Greater sin: Sodomy|website=Al-Islam.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{See also|Judaism and homosexuality}}
In [[Judaism]], the [[Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism|death penalty]] against homosexuality has not been used in practice for more than 2000 years, though many [[Jewish religious movements|movements]] still view homosexual acts as sinful. [[Orthodox Judaism]] [[Homosexuality and Judaism#Orthodox Jewish views|generally prohibits homosexual conduct]]. While there is disagreement about which acts come under core prohibitions, all of Orthodox Judaism puts certain core homosexual acts, including [[Sodomy#Judaism|sodomy]] in the category of ''yehareg ve'al ya'avor''&amp;mdash;"die rather than transgress"&amp;mdash;the small category of Biblically-prohibited acts (also including [[Thou shalt not kill#Jewish doctrine|murder]], [[Idolatry in Judaism|idolatry]], [[Thou shalt not commit adultery#In Judaism|adultery]], and [[Jewish views on incest|incest]]) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of [[self-sacrifice under Jewish Law]] to die rather than do.
