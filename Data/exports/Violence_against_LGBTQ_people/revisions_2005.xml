[[Image:DurerDeathOrpheus1494.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''The Death of [[Orpheus]]'''&lt;br&gt;In [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s [[1494]] drawing, the banner hung in the tree reads: ''Orfeus der erst puseran'' ("Orpheus, the first sodomite"). The word ''puseran(t)'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''bulgarus'' from which come also the terms ''bugger'' in English and ''bougre'' in French. Though the drawing could be taken as a Northern European reaction to [[sodomy]], it is actually based on an original, now lost, by the [[Florence|Florentine]] Italian master [[Andrea Mantegna]]. The depiction of the fleeing [[putto]] is an allusion to the accusation that sodomites pursue little children.]]

'''[[Violence]] against [[lesbian]]s, [[gay]]s, [[bisexuality|bisexuals]], and [[transgender]]ed''' (LGBT), sometimes called [[hate crimes]] can occur either at the hands of individuals or groups, or as part of governmental enforcement of laws targeting people who are seen to violate [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] rules. People who are merely ''perceived'' to be LGBT (but who are actually not) may also be targeted. 

Anti-LGBT violence can include threats, physical [[assault]], [[battery (crime)|battery]], [[sexual assault]], [[rape]], [[torture]], [[attempted murder]], or [[murder]].

Many religious authorities have been accused of constantly giving spiritual support to such violence because they overtly oppose thoughts and actions associated with LGBT. However, people making this accusation often overlook the factor that these very authorities are most likely to '''oppose''' violent behaviour under this name as well because they oppose violent behaviour in general, and refuse to usurp God's role by passing these judgements. Unfortunately, religious authorities have been portrayed in the media as gay-bashing and little media attention is given to those who vocally oppose gay-bashing.

==Statistics==
In the United States, the [[FBI]] hate crime statistics for [[2004]], the most recent year available, reports that hate crimes based on perceived sexual orientation were down from 16.4 to 15.6 percent. Of Anti-LGB violence 61 percent was against gay men, anti-lesbian violence made up 14 percent, anti-bisexual violence accounted for 1 percent, attacks against heterosexuals made up 2 percent, while attacks against GLB people at large made up 20 percent. [http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2005/10/18/1] National Anti-Violence groups question the validity of this report because community statistics show the anti-queer violence has gone up for the past 2 years since the far right has been pushing "defense of marriage" constitutional amendment. The group most likely to be murdered is young, transgender females of color.

==State-sponsored violence==

Sexual relations between individuals of the same sex have frequently been repressed by the state under pain of mutilation and death. Such events (represented as ''buggery'' or ''sodomy'') took place in [[Europe]] from the fifth to the twentieth centuries, and in Muslim countries from the beginning of the Muslim era up to and including the present day. Among the states that have historically punished homosexuality with death are:
 
* The [[Roman Empire]] starting under [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] around 400 CE.
** Illustrative victim&lt;!--s--&gt;: &lt;!-- Supply examples! --&gt; [[Abbasid]] [[Baghdad]] under the Caliph [[Al-Hadi]] (785-786)
* The [[Florence|City of Florence]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]
** Illustrative victims: [[Giovanni di Giovanni]] ([[1350]] &amp;ndash; [[1365]]?), [[Florence|Florentine]] boy, castrated and "burned between the thighs with a red-hot iron" by court order;
* The [[Swiss]] canton of Zurich in the [[Renaissance]]
** Illustrative victims: [[von Hohenberg]] d. [[1482]], [[Swiss]] knight, burned at the stake together with his lover, his young squire;
* The kingdom of [[France]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]
** Illustrative victims: [[Jacques Chausson]] ([[1618]] &amp;ndash; [[1661]]), [[France|French]] minor writer, burned alive for attempting to seduce the son of a nobleman;
* [[England]] from the [[Middle Ages]] until [[1861]];
** Illustrative victims: [[William Maxwell]], [[1829]]; [[King Edward II]]
* [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]; see [[History of gays during the Holocaust]]
* [[Afghanistan]] under the rule of the [[Taliban]] (1996-2001)

Present-day countries where homosexuality is still punishable by death:
* [[Iran]]
* [[Mauritania]]
* [[Nigeria]]
* [[Pakistan]]
* [[Saudi Arabia]]
* [[Sudan]]
* [[United Arab Emirates]]
* [[Yemen]]

== Individual violence ==

[[Image:Milk, Harvey (600).jpg|thumb|250px|right|'''[[Harvey Milk]] ([[1930]]-[[1978]])'''&lt;br&gt;American politician and gay-rights activist, assassinated by a homophobic assailant.]]

Individuals, singly or in groups, have at times taken it upon themselves (usually flouting the law) to repress those alleged to manifest variant sexual behavior. In some legal jurisdictions in the [[United States]], these acts may be legally classified as [[hate crime]]s, which increases the resulting penalty if convicted.  In some situations, gay, lesbian, and bisexual people have flirted with their attackers, believing them to be interested in a homosexual encounter or relationship.

Some notable incidents of hate-related assaults include:


* [[Tennessee Williams]] was the victim of a gay-bashing in January 1979 in [[Key West]], being beaten by five teenage boys, but he was not seriously injured. The episode was part of a spate of anti-gay violence inspired by an anti-gay newspaper ad run by a local [[Baptist]] minister. Some of his literary critics spoke ill of the "excesses" present in his work, but these were, for the most part, merely attacks on Williams' sexuality.
* The fatal stabbing of [[James Zappalorti]], a gay [[Vietnam]] veteran ([[1945]] &amp;ndash;  [[1990]])
* The rape and later murder of [[Brandon Teena]], a [[transsexual]] man ([[1972]] &amp;ndash;  [[1993]])
* The beating death of [[Matthew Shepard]], a gay [[student]] ([[1976]] &amp;ndash;  [[1998]])
* The bombing of the [[Admiral Duncan pub]] by [[David Copeland]] in [[1999]]
* The fatal beating of gay teenager Jeff Whittington in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] on [[May 8]], [[1999]].
* One notorious incident of gay-bashing occurred on [[September 22]], [[2000]]. Ronald Gay entered a gay bar in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] and opened fire on the patrons, killing [[Danny Overstreet]] and injuring six others. Ronald said he was angry over what his name now meant, and deeply upset that three of his sons had changed their surname. He claimed that he had been told by [[God]] to find and kill lesbians and gay men, describing himself as a "Christian Soldier working for my Lord". [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/942255.stm]
* The non-fatal stabbing of [[Bertrand Delanoë]], a gay [[politician]], in [[2002]]
* The killing of [[Gwen Araujo]], a [[transsexual]] woman ([[1985]] &amp;ndash;  [[2002]])
* The killing of [[Paul Broussard]], a Houston-area banker (1968-1991)

As the process of identifying non-heterosexual traits is often sloppy, gay-bashing has been committed against heterosexuals who are merely perceived to be gay. Prominent incidents include:

* Actor and comedian [[Norm MacDonald]] (of [[Saturday Night Live]]) was attacked by two men in [[New York City]]. They thought he was a gay man because he was well-dressed, with styled hair, and lanky; he was walking through [[Greenwich Village]], a [[gay village|center of the city's gay community]]. He suffered a concussion.

There are also [[urban myths]] and unconfirmed stories told about gay-bashing, often devised to make a point. For instance:

: ''A man was shot to death in an [[Iowa]] bar because he was standing quietly in a corner holding a purse. He was perceived as an unwelcome gay man; in actuality, he was holding the purse for his wife, who was in the restroom.''
