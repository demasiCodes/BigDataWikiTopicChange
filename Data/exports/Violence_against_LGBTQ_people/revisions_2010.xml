'''[[Violence]] against [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], [[queer]] and [[intersex]] ([[LGBTQI]]) people''' are actions which may occur either at the hands of individuals or groups, or as part of governmental enforcement of laws targeting people who are perceived to violate [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] rules and who contravene perceived protocols of [[gender role|gender]] and sexual roles. People who are perceived to be LGBTQI may also be targeted.

A [[hate crime]] is simply defined as when individuals become victimized because of their race, ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;Stotzer, R.:  [https://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/Comparison%20of%20Hate%20Crime%20Formatted.pdf Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups], [[Williams Institute]], 2007–06. Retrieved on 2007-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Hate crimes against LGBTQI people often occur because the perpetrators are [[Homophobia|homophobic]]. The attacks can also be blamed on society itself. A variety of religious groups as well as proponents of extremist political ideologies condemn homosexuality and relate it to being weak, ill, feminine, and morally wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Sugden, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article3545414.ece Bishop accuses gays of 'conspiracy' against the Catholic Church], ''Times Online'' 13 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Violence targeted at people because of their perceived sexuality can be psychological and physical including [[murder]]. These actions may be caused by cultural, [[religion and sexual orientation|religious]], or political [[mores]] and biases.

[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|The knight von Hohenberg and his squire, being burned at the stake for sodomy, Zurich 1482 (Zurich Central Library)]]
The first recorded [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] laws  against sexual intercourse between men are dated  to circa [[550 BCE]], during the [[Babylonian captivity]] of the [[Jews|Jewish people]]; they are recorded in [[Leviticus]], and they prescribe the death penalty. Similar laws are found across [[Indo-European]] cultures in ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' in Ancient Rome and ''[[nith]]'' in protohistoric Germanic culture, or the [[Assyrian Empire#Middle Assyrian period|Middle Assyrian]] Law Codes dating 1075 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;The Middle [[Assyrian law|Assyrian Law Codes]] (1075 BCE) states: ''"If a man have intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a eunuch"'', see [[Sodomy_law#History]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Emperor Constantine]] established [[Christianity]] as the state religion of the [[Roman Empire]], male homosexual activity became repressed, specifically for the passive role, often sanctioned with [[social ostracism]], mutilation, or death.&lt;ref name = THEOD&gt;(Theodosian Code 9.7.6): All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people.&lt;/ref&gt; In 342 CE, the Christian emperors [[Constantius II|Constantius]] and [[Constans]] declared same-sex marriage to be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodosian Code]] 9.8.3: ''"When a man marries and is about to offer himself to men in womanly fashion (quum vir nubit in feminam viris porrecturam), what does he wish, when sex has lost all its significance; when the crime is one which it is not profitable to know; when Venus is changed to another form; when love is sought and not found? We order the statutes to arise, the laws to be armed with an avenging sword, that those infamous persons who are now, or who hereafter may be, guilty may be subjected to exquisite punishment.''&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, in the year 390 CE, the Christian emperors [[Valentinian II]], [[Theodosius I]] and [[Arcadius]] declared homosexual sex to be illegal and those who were guilty of it were condemned to be publicly burned alive.&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt; The Christian emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565 CE) made homosexuals a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] for problems such as "famines, earthquakes, and pestilences." &lt;ref&gt;Justinian ''Novels'' 77, 144&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=September 2010}}

Laws and codes prohibiting homosexual practice were in force in [[Europe]] from the fourth&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt; to the twentieth centuries, and Muslim countries have had similar laws from the beginnings of [[Islam]] in the seventh century up to and including the present day. [[Abbasid]] [[Baghdad]], under the [[Caliph]] [[Al-Hadi]] (785–786 CE), punished homosexuality with death.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Florence|City of Florence]] also instated the death penalty. In Florence, a young boy named [[Giovanni di Giovanni]] (1350–1365?) was castrated and burned between the thighs with a red-hot iron by court order under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forbidden Friendships, Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=24, 227, 356, 360|last=Rocke|first=Michael|isbn=0195122925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="litandhomo"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Literature and Homosexuality |first=Michael J |last=Meyer |year=2000 |publisher=Rodopi |page=206|isbn=904200519X |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; These punishments continued into the [[Renaissance]], and spread to the [[Swiss]] [[canton of Zürich]]. Knight Richard von Hohenberg (d. 1482) was burned at the stake together with his lover, his young squire, during this time. In France, [[French people|French]] writer [[Jacques Chausson]] (1618–1661) was also burned alive for attempting to seduce the son of a nobleman.

In [[England]], the [[Buggery Act 1533|Buggery Act]], which made sodomy and bestiality punishable by death, was instated in 1534 CE and remained law until 1861. In [[Nazi Germany]], homosexuals were among the groups targeted by the [[Holocaust]]. See [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]] for more detailed explanations.

[[Afghanistan]], where such acts remain punishable with fines and a prison sentence, dropped the death penalty after the fall of the [[Taliban]] in 2001, who had mandated it from 1996.

==Relationship between religious condemnation and violence==
{{See also|Religion and homosexuality}}
===Abrahamic religions===
{{quote|And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]]: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.|{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}}}

The above verse, along with {{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|KJV}}, is the cause of much tension between the devout of the [[Abrahamic religions]] and members of the LGBT community. It is viewed by many as an outright condemnation of homosexual acts between men, and, more commonly in ancient times than today, justification for violence.

Some Christian groups advocate [[conversion therapy]] and promote [[ex-gay]] groups. One such group, [[Exodus International]], argues that conversion therapy may be a useful tool for decreasing same-sex desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exodus.to/content/view/34/117/|title=Exodus International Policy Statements|publisher=[[Exodus International]]|accessdate=04-07-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical and scientific consensus in the United States is that conversion therapy is likely harmful and should be avoided because it may exploit guilt and anxiety, thereby damaging self-esteem and leading to depression and even suicide.&lt;ref name="apa"&gt;{{cite web

[[Pope Benedict XVI]], the leader of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] has stoked this sentiment as well, stating that "protecting" humanity from homosexuality was just as important as saving the world from [[climate change]] and that all relationships beyond traditional heterosexual ones are a "destruction of God's work".&lt;ref name="pope" /&gt; Further, a [[Vatican]] official called homosexuality "a deviation, an irregularity, a wound".&lt;ref name="pope" /&gt; While the Catholic Church teaches that same-sex attraction itself is not sinful, homosexual acts are "acts of grave depravity". Homosexual congregation members are to be accepted and not discriminated against, but are asked to remain [[celibate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=14672|title=Vatican U.N. delegation calls for end to unjust discrimination against homosexuals|publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]]|date=December 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evangelicals in Africa sometimes use religion to justify violence against LGBT people and criminalizing homosexual behavior. [[Archbishop]]s [[Peter Akinola]] of [[Nigeria]] and Henry Orombi of [[Uganda]] would not condemn violence against gays and lesbians when questioned on the issue at the [[Global Anglican Future Conference]].&lt;ref name="ekklesia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/7382|title=Evangelical leader criticises failure to condemn violence against gays|publisher=[[Ekklesia]]|date=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Russell, Chief Executive of [[Church Army]], expressed outrage over their resistance, stating "Quite honestly [refusal to condemn violence against gay people in their home countries] is disgraceful, it sullies their cause, and is totally un-Christian. You cannot justify violence in God's name. Period. [...] Those who perpetrate violence against gay people in Africa now can use this silence to justify their behaviour. Christians must speak up and say this is wrong."&lt;ref name="ekklesia" /&gt;

====Islam====
{{See also|Islam and homosexuality}}
The [[Qur'an]], the holy book of [[Islam]], cites the story of the "people of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]]" (also known as the people of [[Sodom]] and [[Gomorrah]]), destroyed by the [[Anger#Religious perspectives|wrath]] of [[God in Islam|Allah]] because they engaged in "lustful" carnal acts between men. 

Eminent scholars of Islam, such as [[Sheikh ul-Islam]] [[Imam Malik]], and [[Imam Shafi]] amongst others, ruled that Islam disallowed homosexuality and ordained capital punishment for a person guilty of it.&lt;ref name="Fatwa IslamOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|title=Homosexuality and Lesbianism: Sexual Perversions|publisher=IslamOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal punishment for sodomy has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe [[capital punishment]]; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment. Homosexual activity is a crime and forbidden in most Muslim-majority countries. In some relatively secular Muslim-majority countries such as [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref name="RoughGuideSEAsia2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rough Guide to South East Asia: Third Edition|page=74|url=http://www.roughguides.com/|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd|isbn=1843534371|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jordan]] and [[Turkey]], this is not the case.

The Qur'an, much like the [[Bible]] and [[Torah]], has a vague condemnation of homosexuality and how it should be dealt with, leaving it open to interpretation. For this reason, Islamic jurists have turned to the collections of the [[hadith]] (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) and akhbar (accounts of his life). These, on the other hand, are perfectly clear and particularly harsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bosworth, Ed. C. and E. van Donzel|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Leiden|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn al-Jawzi]] records Muhammad as cursing sodomites in several hadith, and recommending the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in same-sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&amp;pg=PA89|last=Wafer|first=Jim|title=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality|page=89 |publisher=New York University Press|year=1997|accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]] again reports [[Muhammad]] as having prescribed the death penalty for both the active and the passive partner: "Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of [Lot], kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done."&lt;ref name="Fatwa IslamOnline"/&gt; The overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions challenges the harmony of God's creation, and is therefore a revolt against God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dynes|first=Wayne|title=Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality|city=New York|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[imam]]s still preach extremist views, stating that homosexuals and "women who act like men" should be killed. Abu Usamah at Green Lane Mosque in [[Birmingham]] defended his words to followers by saying "If I were to call homosexuals perverted, dirty, filthy dogs who should be murdered, that's my freedom of speech, isn't it?"&lt;ref name="pinknews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8869.html|title=Violence against gays preached in British mosques claims new documentary|first=Tony|last=Grew|publisher=[[Pink News]]|date=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less extreme leaders decry this sort of preaching, calling it a "distortion of Islam itself, the abuse and misuse of this great faith".&lt;ref name="pinknews" /&gt;

====Judaism====
{{See also|Judaism and homosexuality}}
In [[Judaism]], the death penalty has not been used in practice for more than 2000 years, though many [[Jewish religious movements|movements]] still view homosexual acts as sinful. [[Orthodox Judaism]] generally prohibits homosexual conduct. While there is disagreement about which acts come under core prohibitions, all of Orthodox Judaism puts certain core homosexual acts, including male-male [[anal sex]] in the category of ''yehareg ve'al ya'avor''&amp;mdash;"die rather than transgress"&amp;mdash;the small category of Biblically-prohibited acts (also including [[murder]], [[idolatry]], [[adultery]], and [[incest]]) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of [[Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law]] to die rather than do.

The [[Reform Judaism]] movement, the largest branch of Judaism in [[North America]], has rejected the traditional view of Jewish Law on this issue. As such, they do not prohibit ordination of gays and lesbians as [[rabbi]]s and [[cantor]]s. They view Levitical laws as sometimes seen to be referring to prostitution, making it a stand against Jews adopting the idolatrous fertility cults and practices of the neighbouring [[Canaan]]ite nations rather than a blanket condemnation of same-sex intercourse or homosexuality. Reform authorities consider that, in light of what is seen as current scientific evidence about the nature of homosexuality as a biological sexual orientation, a new interpretation of the law is required.

[[Jamaica]] has some of the toughest sodomy laws in the world, with homosexual activity carrying a 10-year jail sentence.&lt;ref name="belfast"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/jamaica-homophobia-and-hate-crime-is-rife-14488995.html|title=Jamaica: Homophobia and hate crime is rife|publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tougher parts of the island nation, children are raised surrounded by strict anti-gay Christian churches and [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] preachers.&lt;ref name="freemuse"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freemuse.org/sw20860.asp|title=Dancehall star signs Reggae Compassionate Act|first=Kristina|last=Funkeson|publisher=[[Freemuse]]|date=August 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mosthomophobic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1182991,00.html|title=The Most Homophobic Place on Earth?|first=Tim|last=Padgett|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|date=April 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the case for many [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] artists, such as [[Buju Banton]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Sizzla]], and others. Banton wrote a song when he was 15 years old that became a hit when he released it years later in 1992 called "Boom Bye Bye". The song is about violently murdering homosexuals and "advocated the shooting of gay men, pouring acid on them and burning them alive."&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; A song by Elephant Man proclaims: "When you hear a lesbian getting raped/It's not our fault ... Two women in bed/That's two sodomites who should be dead."&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;

Due to the violent, homophobic nature of some of their songs, several reggae artists have been investigated by police for promoting anti-LGBT violence. Some [[lyrics]] have been investigated by [[Scotland Yard]], and Sizzla was barred from entering the [[U.K.]] in 2004 while being investigated for promoting murder through his music.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/09/25/concerts-reggae-antigay.html|title=Coalition seeks ejection of reggae stars over anti-gay lyrics|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; Gay rights advocates have started the group [[Stop Murder Music]] to combat the promotion of hate and violence by artists. The group organized protests, causing some venues to refuse to allow the targeted artists to perform, and the loss of sponsors. In 2007, Stop Murder Music introduced the [[Reggae Compassionate Act]], which states that "the artists promise not to produce music or make public statements inciting hatred against gay people. Neither can they authorise the re-release of previous homophobic songs." Several artists have signed the Act, including Buju Banton, Beenie Man, Sizzla and [[Capleton]],&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; but have later denied making any commitment to stop promoting homophobia.&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9251.html|title=Immigration minister criticised for letting homophobic artist into Canada|first=Tony|last=Grew|publisher=[[Pink News]]|date=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and police responses to criminal violence==
Otherwise law-abiding citizens have at times been prepared to break the law, either out of prejudice or in order to repress people they perceive as having LGBT identities or engaging in LGBT activity.  In many parts of the world, including much of the [[European Union]] and [[United States]], acts of violence are legally classified as [[hate crime]]s, which entail harsher sentences if convicted. In some countries, this form of legislation extends to [[verbal abuse]] as well as physical violence. Sometimes, people have been the target of anti-LGBT violence because they were perceived by their attacker to be LGBT, whether they were or not.

In the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]], though many of the 56 participating countries have hate crime legislation for [[racism]] and [[religious intolerance]], only 12 have legislation that
allows for bias based on sexual orientation to be treated as an aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; The United States does not have federal legislation marking sexual orientation as criteria for hate crimes, but several states, including the [[District of Colombia]], enforce harsher penalties for crimes where real or perceived sexual orientation may have been a motivator. Among these 12 countries as well, only the United States has criminal law that specifically mentions gender identity, and even then only in 11 states and the District of Colombia.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

Violent hate crimes against LGBT people are notable because they tend to be especially brutal, "an intense rage is present in nearly all homicide cases involving gay male victims".  It is rare for a victim to just be shot; he is more likely to be stabbed multiple times, mutilated, and strangled. "They frequently involved torture, cutting, mutilation... showing the absolute intent to rub out the human being because of his (sexual) preference".&lt;ref name="ALTS"/&gt; In a particularly brutal case, on March 14, 2007, in [[Wahneta, Florida]], 25-year-old Ryan Keith Skipper was found dead from 20 stab wounds and a slit throat. His body had been dumped on a dark, rural road less than 2 miles from his home. His two alleged attackers, William David Brown, Jr., 20, and Joseph Eli Bearden, 21, were indicted for robbery and first-degree murder. Highlighting their [[malice (legal term)|malice]] and contempt for the victim, the accused killers allegedly drove around in Skipper's blood-soaked car and bragged of killing him. According to a sheriff's department affidavit, one of the men stated that Skipper was targeted because "he was a faggot."&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

In [[Canada]] in 2008, police-reported data found that approximately 10% of all hate crimes in the country were motivated by sexual orientation. Of these, 56% were of a violent nature. In comparison, 38% of all racially motivated offenses were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"&gt;{{Cite paper|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf|title=Violence Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Bias: 2008 Hate Crime Survey|author=Stahnke, Tad, ''et. al.''|publisher=[[Human Rights First]]|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year in the United States, according to [[FBI]] data, though 4,704 crimes were committed due to racial bias and 1,617 were committed due to sexual orientation, only one murder and one [[forcible rape]] were committed due to racial bias, whereas five murders and six rapes were committed based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="FBI Table 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2008/index.html|title=Hate Crime Statistics: Offense Type by Bias Motivation|year=2008|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Northern Ireland]] in 2008, 160 [[homophobic]] incidents and 7 [[transphobic]] incidents were reported. Of those incidents, 68.4% were violent crimes; significantly higher than for any other bias category. By contrast, 37.4% of racially motivated crimes were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

Legal and police response to these types of hate crimes is hard to gauge, however. Lack of reporting by authorities on the statistics of these crimes and under-reporting by the victims themselves are factors for this difficulty.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; Oftentimes a victim will not report a crime as it will shed unwelcome light on their orientation and invite more victimization.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/02/05/bc-arron-webster-ryan-cran-released.html|title=Gay community troubled by release of killer in Stanley Park death|date=5th February 2009|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=13th September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims may also have a distrust of police to respond appropriately to the crimes, given the history of assailants getting away with light sentences, even when attacks result in death.

Legal defenses like the [[Gay Panic Defense]] allow for more lenient punishments for people accused of beating, torturing, or killing homosexuals because of their orientation. These arguments posit that the attacker was so enraged by their victim's advances as to cause [[temporary insanity]], leaving them unable to stop themselves or tell right from wrong. In these cases, if the loss of faculties is proven, or sympathized to the jury, an initially severe sentence may be significantly reduced. Take for example the case of Kenneth Brewer. On 30th September 1997, he met Stephen Bright at a local gay bar. He bought the younger man drinks and they later went back to Brewer's apartment. While there, Brewer made a sexual advance toward Bright, and Bright beat him to death. Bright was initially charged with [[second-degree murder]], but he was eventually convicted of third-degree [[assault]] and was sentenced to one year in prison.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reasonable"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Cynthia|title=Murder and the Reasonable Man: Passion and Fear in the Criminal Courtroom|url=http://books.google.com/?id=se0xg_yvRSMC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=Kenneth+Brewer+hawaii#v=onepage&amp;q=Kenneth%20Brewer%20hawaii&amp;f=false|publisher=[[NYU Press]]|year=2003|isbn=9780814751152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cases like Bright's are not isolated. In 2001, [[Aaron Webster]] was beaten to death by a group of youths armed with baseball bats and a pool cue while hanging around an area of [[Stanley Park]] frequented by gay men. Ryan Cran was convicted of [[manslaughter]] in the case in 2004 and released on parole in 2009 after serving only 4 years of his six-year sentence.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; Two youths were tried under Canada's [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]] and sentenced to three years after pleading guilty. A fourth assailant was [[acquitted]].&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

Judges are not immune to letting their own prejudices affect their judgment either. In 1988, [[Texas]] Judge Jack Hampton gave a man 30 years for killing two gay men, instead of the life sentence requested by the prosecutor. After handing down his judgment, he said: "I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teenage boys ...[I] put prostitutes and gays at about the same level ... and I'd be hard put to give somebody life for killing a prostitute."&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/1998/10/23news.html|title=Asking for it|last=Stryker|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Salon Magazine]]|date=23rd October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1987, a [[Florida]] judge trying a case concerning the beating to death of a gay man asked the prosecutor, "That's a crime now, to beat up a homosexual?"  The prosecutor responded, "Yes, sir. And it's also a crime to kill them."  "Times have really changed," the judge replied. The judge, Daniel Futch, maintained that he was joking, but was removed from the case.&lt;ref name="ALTS"&gt;{{Cite document|title=Hate Crimes: a reference handbook|last=Altschiller|first=Donald|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;

[[Gay pride parade|LGBT Pride Parades]] often attract violence because of their public nature. Though many countries where such events take place attempt to provide police protection to participants, some would prefer that the parades not happen, and police either ignore or encourage violent protesters. The country of [[Moldova]] has shown particular contempt to marchers, shutting down official requests to hold parades and allowing protesters to intimidate and harm any who try to march anyway. In 2007, after being denied a request to hold a parade, a small group of LGBT people tried to hold a small gathering. They were surrounded by a group twice their size who shouted derogatory things at them and pelted them with eggs. The gathering proceeded even so, and they tried to lay flowers at the Monument to the Victims of Repression. They were denied the opportunity, however, by a large group of police claiming they needed permission from [[city hall]].&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

The following year, a parade was again attempted. A bus carried approximately 60 participants to the capital, but before they could disembark, an angry crowd surrounded the bus. They shouted things like "let's get them out and beat them up," and "beat them to death, don't let them escape" at the frightened passengers. The mob told the activists that if they wanted to leave the bus unharmed, they would have to destroy all of their pride materials. The passengers complied and the march was called off. All the while, police stood passively about 100 meters away, taking no action even though passengers claimed at least nine emergency calls were made to police while on the bus.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Christian|title=Gay Pride Parade Trapped on Bus|publisher=SameSame|date=May 12, 2008|url=http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=67 GenderDoc-M|title=Moldovan Gay Pride Threatened, Cops Refuse Protection for Marchers|date=May 11, 2008|url=http://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/2008/05/moldovan-gay-pride-threatened-cops.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were met by [[skinheads]] and other protesters, and police who had closed off the square and immediately arrested activists as they entered. As some were being arrested, other participants were attacked by protesters. Police did nothing. Around eleven women and two men were arrested and left in the heat, denied medical attention, and verbally abused by police officers. The officers told the women, "No one needs lesbians, no one will ever get you out of here." When participants were released from custody hours later, they were pelted by eggs and shouted at by protesters who had been waiting.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Have the Upper Hand: Freedom of assembly in Russia and the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people|date=June 2007|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[ILGA-Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hungary]], on the other hand, has tried to afford the best protection they can to marchers, but cannot stem the flow of violence. In 2008, hundreds of people participated in the [[Budapest]] Dignity March. Police, on alert due to attacks on two LGBT-affiliated businesses earlier in the week, erected high metal barriers on either side of the street the march was to take place on. Hundreds of angry protesters threw petrol bombs and rocks at police in retaliation. A police van was set on fire and two police officers were injured in the attacks. During the parade itself, protesters threw [[Molotov cocktails]], eggs and firecrackers at marchers. At least eight participants were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peto, Sandor and Krisztina Than|title=Anti-gay violence mars Hungarian parade|publisher=The Star Online|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/6/worldupdates/2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-five people were detained in connection with the attacks, and observers called the spectacle "the worst violence during the dozen years the Gay Pride Parade has taken place in Budapest."&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bos|first=Stefan|title=Violent Protests Disrupt Hungary's Gay Rights Parade|publisher=VOA News|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of 1989 and the start of 1990, there were a series of unsolved murders in west London over a period of six months.
* In September 1989, Christopher Schliach, a barrister who was gay, was murdered in his home; he was stabbed more than 40 times.&lt;ref name = LONUNS2/&gt;

In July 2004 an independent inquiry into police procedures carried out by the independent Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Advisory Group for the Metropolitan Police was announced.&lt;ref name = LONUNS1/&gt;  In May 2007 the report for the independent review was released; it had examined how detectives had handled 10 murders of gay men or transsexuals.

The review recognised that Scotland Yard's work with the gay, lesbian and transsexual communities and its investigative processes had improved significantly since the 1990s, but warned that more radical steps were needed.  The cases reviewed, and the findings, included:

In 2009, the [[Scottish parliament]] unanimously passed legislation that means that crimes motivated by hatred of gay or disabled people will now be considered as 'aggravated offences'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8078988.stm MSPs approve new hate crime laws] BBC News 3 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA===
In the [[United States]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] reported that 15.6% of hate crimes reported to police in 2004 were founded on perceived [[sexual orientation]]. Sixty-one percent of those attacks were against gay men, 14% against lesbians, 2% against heterosexuals and 1% against bisexuals, while attacks against LGBT people at large made up 20%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/hate_crime/index.html Hate Crime – Crime in the United States 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Violence based on perceived gender identity was not recorded in the report.

The FBI reported that for 2006, hate crimes against gays increased to 16%, from 14% in 2005, as percentage of total documented hate crimes across the U.S.&lt;ref name=ADVOCATE1120&gt;{{cite paper |last= |first= |authorlink= |title=FBI Shows Gay-Bashing Increase in 2006 |version= |publisher=The Advocate |date=2007-11-20 |url=http://www.advocate.com/news_detail_ektid50559.asp |id= |accessdate=2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2006 annual report, released on November 19, 2007, also said that hate crimes based on sexual orientation are the third most common type, behind race and religion.&lt;ref name=ADVOCATE1120/&gt;

[[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] Deputy District Attorney (DDA) Jay Boyarsky attributed a surge in anti-gay hate crimes, from 3 in 2007 to 14 in 2008, to controversy over [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]].

====Legal responses to homophobic, biphobic, and transphobic hate crimes====
In 1988 a Florida judge, trying a case concerning the beating to death of a gay man asked the prosecutor, "That's a crime now, to beat up a homosexual?"  The prosecutor responded, "Yes, sir. And it's also a crime to kill them."  "Times have really changed," the judge replied.&lt;ref name = ALTS/&gt;
