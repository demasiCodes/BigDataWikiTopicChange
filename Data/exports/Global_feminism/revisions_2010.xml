'''Global Feminism''' is a feminist theory closely aligned with [[postcolonial]] theory and [[postcolonial feminism]]. It concerns itself primarily with the forward movement of [[women's rights]] on a global scale.  Using different historical lenses from the legacy of colonialism, Global Feminists adopt global causes and start movements which seek to dismantle what they argue are the currently predominant structures of global patriarchy. Global Feminism is also known as Transnational Feminism, World Feminism, and International Feminism.

Two historical examples Global Feminists might use to expose patriarchal structures at work in colonized groups or societies are medieval Spain (late eleventh to thirteenth centuries) and nineteenth-century Cuba. The former example concerns women of the ''Mudejar'' communities of Islamic Spain and the strict sexual codes through which their social activity was regulated. ''Mudejar'' women could be sold into slavery as a result of sexual activity with  Christian man; this was to escape the deemed punishment accorded by the Sunna, or Islamic law. Because of their simultaneous roles as upholding one’s family honor and one of “conquered status and gender,” “''Mudejar'' women suffered double jeopardy in their sexual contact with Christians [in Spain].” &lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard"&gt;Tamara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard, eds. Women and the Colonial Gaze. ISBN 0814736475.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nineteenth-century Cuba can be looked at as an example of colonialism and neocolonialism working together in a slave-based society to affect women’s lives under patriarchy, where Cuba “remained a Spanish colony while enduring a neocolonial relationship with the United States.” &lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard" /&gt; Havana, a city noted for its “absence of the female form,” had, “of all the major cities in the West…the most strict social restrictions on the female portion of its population.” &lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard" /&gt; Upper-class Cuban women were “a constant visual reminder of the separation between elite white society and the people of color they ruled." &lt;ref name="Tmara L. Hunt and Micheline R. Lessard" /&gt;
