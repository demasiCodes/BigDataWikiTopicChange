'''Global Feminism''' is a feminist theory concerned with the forward movement of [[women's rights]] on a global scale.  Global Feminists adopt global causes and start movements which seek to dismantle the currently predominant structures of global patriarchy.  

Global Feminists might argue, for example, that such structures enable the adoption of [[misogynistic]] cultural practices such as [[honor killings]], [[genital mutilation]], and [[human trafficking]].  Another concern of many Global Feminist activists is the impact of [[First World]] women's movements within the global economy as consumers upon the living and working conditions of [[Third World]] women.  For example, if an average feminist in the United States purchases a pair of athletic shoes without first researching the corporation through which they were produced, she may be buying a pair of sneakers that were sewn under [[sweatshop]] conditions and/or sewn in an offshore factory that is polluting the local land and water supply.
