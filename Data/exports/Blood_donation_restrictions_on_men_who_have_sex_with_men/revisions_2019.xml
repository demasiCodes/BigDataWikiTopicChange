{{Discrimination sidebar|expanded=Policies}}
Many countries have laws that prohibit donations of [[blood donation|blood]] or tissue for [[organ transplant]]s from [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), a classification of men who engage (or have engaged in the past) in sex with other men, regardless of whether they identify themselves as [[bisexual]], [[gay]] or otherwise. Restrictions on donors are sometimes called "deferrals", since blood donors who are found ineligible may be found eligible at a later date. However, many deferrals are indefinite meaning that donation may not be accepted at any point in the future, thus constituting a [[de facto]] ban.

Restrictions vary from country to country, and in some countries practice of protected sex or periods of abstinence are not considered. The restrictions affect these men and, in some cases, any female sex partners. They do not otherwise affect other women, including [[women who have sex with women]]. The [[United States Food &amp; Drug Administration]] (FDA) asserts that the one year deferral window is "supported by the best available scientific evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015-12-21/fda-lifts-ban-on-blood-donations-from-gay-and-bisexual-men|title=Gay and Bisexual Men Can Soon Donate Blood – but There's a Catch|website=US News &amp; World Report|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Canada, the deferral period has been decreased to 3 months, as of June, 2019&lt;ref name="CAReport"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blood.ca/sites/default/files/CBS-AR2019-en.pdf|title=Canadian Blood Services Annual Report 2018-2019|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Nov 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This change was also based on scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="CAReport" /&gt;

Many [[LGBT]] organizations view the restrictions on donation as based on [[homophobia]] and not based on valid medical concern since donations are rigorously [[HIV test|tested]] to rule out donors that are infected with known viruses such as [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]], [[Human papillomavirus|HPV]], [[Hepatitis B]], and [[Hepatitis C]]. They state the deferrals are based on stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Schoettes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Blood Donations Questions|last=Schoettes|first=Scott|date=December 2012|newspaper=Adelante Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the lifetime restriction defend it because of the asserted risk of false negative test results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-stier/blood-for-sale_b_52046.html |title=Blood for Sale |accessdate=5 April 2008 |last=Stier|first=Jeff |date=13 June 2007 |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because the MSM population in developed countries tends to have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection.&lt;ref name="unaids2006"&gt;UNAIDS 2006 report on the global AIDS epidemic, [http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2006/2006_GR_CH05_en.pdf Chapter 05], June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government advisory committee, SABTO, stated in 2013 that "the risk of transfusion of HIV infected blood would increase if MSM were allowed to donate blood".&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |title=Homosexual men allowed to give blood but sex banned for decade |publisher=Telegraph |date= 10 April 2011|last1=Bloxham |first1=Andy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 however, the UK government reduced the one year deferral window to three months, to take effect in the following months, resulting from SABTO's updated conclusions that "new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules". Furthermore, [[NHS Blood and Transplant]] are in the process of investigating how possible it is for MSM, depending on degree of risk, to donate without even the three month deferral.&lt;ref name=bbcjul17&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40669950 |title=Blood donation rules relaxed for gay men and sex workers |accessdate=28 August 2017 |date=23 July 2017 |publisher=BBC.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; NHS has said that there is currently a limited amount of data on effective ways of conducting such risk assessments, and that the initial steps of scoping, evidence gathering and testing will potentially take up to two years to complete. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/news/scientific-review-offers-chance-for-more-people-to-give-blood/|title=Scientific review offers chance for more people to give blood|website=NHS Blood and Transplant|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for change to MSM prohibitions point out that screening of donors should focus on sexual behavior as well as [[safe sex]] practices since many MSM may always have protected sex, be [[monogamy|monogamous]], or be in other low risk categories.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013" /&gt; Some groups in favor of lifting the restrictions support a waiting period after the blood is donated when the donor is considered to have had behavior considered higher risk, and before it is used, to match the blood bank's window of testing methods.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt;  While HIV is reliably detected in 10 to 14 days with RNA testing, older testing methods provide accuracy for only up to 98% of positive cases after three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sfaf.org/hiv-info/testing/hiv-test-window-periods.html|title = HIV Test Window Periods|date = 2014|accessdate = 19 February 2015|website = San Francisco AIDS Foundation|publisher = San Francisco AIDS Foundation|last = |first =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since1982, the risk for HIV infection transmitted via transfusion has been almost eliminated by the use of questionnaires to exclude donors at higher risk for HIV infection and performing screening tests with highly sensitive equipment to identify infected blood donations. According to the 2015 surveillance report by Canadian Blood Services, the risk of HIV transfusion-transmitted infection was fairly low: in 1 in 21.4million donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blood.ca/sites/default/files/External_Surveillance_Report_2015.pdf|title=Surveillance Report 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Nov 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|Contaminated blood]] put [[hemophilia|haemophiliacs]] at massive risk and severe mortality, increasing the risk of common surgical procedures. People who contracted HIV from a contaminated blood transfusion include [[Isaac Asimov]], who received a blood transfusion following a cardiac surgery.

==HIV/AIDS==
{{Main|Men who have sex with men#HIV/AIDS}}
In many developed countries HIV is more prevalent among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) than among the general population.&lt;ref name="unaids2006"/&gt;

In the United States the population most affected by HIV includes gay, bisexual, and other MSM.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/index.html|title=HIV and Gay and Bisexual Men|last=|first=|date=12 November 2019|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Nov 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 38,739 new HIV diagnoses in the US and dependent areas in 2017, 70% consisted of adult and adolescent gay and bisexual men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although approximately 492,000 sexually active gay and bisexual men are at high risk for HIV, there are more tools to prevent HIV than ever before.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Italy, Latvia, Poland, Russia and Spain are the only European countries that don't have deferral policies for men who have sex with men.

In Ireland, [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) may donate blood if they have not engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at least 12 months prior to a donation. This policy came into effect from 16 January 2017. On 27 July 2015, Tomás Heneghan, a 23-year-old University of Limerick student and journalist from Galway began a legal challenge in the High Court against the permanent deferral imposed on MSM donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/gay-blood-ban-tomas-heneghan-2240158-Jul2015/|title=This 23-year-old student is challenging Ireland's gay blood donation ban|first=Catherine|last=Healy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/gay-man-brings-legal-challenge-over-blood-donation-ban-1.2298825|title=Gay man brings legal challenge over blood donation ban|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He claims this is in breach of EU law. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a "window period" in which infections are sometimes not detected. Heneghan's previous sexual activity posed no risk of infection, according to HSE-approved advice and he said the service had no evidence upon which it could legitimately impose a life-long ban on him donating blood. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12 month ban. Later that week the Minister for Health Simon Harris agreed to the recommendations and announced the reduction would take place. However no timeline was reported for the implementation of the new policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0623/797739-blood-donation/|title=IBTS votes to end ban on gay men donating blood|journal=RTÉ News|access-date=21 August 2016|date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2016, Tomás Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/gay-man-drops-challenge-to-blood-donation-ban-after-change-in-policy-announced-by-health-minister-34913345.html|title=Gay man drops challenge to blood donation ban after change in policy announced by Health Minister – Independent.ie|access-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heneghan then wrote about his experiences of challenging the ban in a number of national media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/toms-heneghan-on-his-high-court-case-why-was-i-shaming-the-family-why-was-my-sex-life-being-opened-up-to-public-scrutiny-34917487.html|title=Tomás Heneghan on his High Court case: Why was I shaming the family?

However he also criticised the new 12 month deferral policy on MSM and called on Ireland's Health Minister to initiate a review of the IBTS and replace the 12 month deferral period for MSM with no deferral or a 3 month deferral on all donors following sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;http://theoutmost.com/news/irish-lifetime-ban-blood-donation-lifted-gay-men/?platform=hootsuite&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/blood-transfusion-service-finally-lifts-ban-on-gay-men-donating-blood-439426.html|title=Blood Transfusion Service finally lifts ban on gay men donating blood|date=17 January 2017|work=Irish Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/gay-donor-tooth-and-nail-battle-to-give-blood-at-an-end-1.2939185|title=Gay donor: 'Tooth and nail' battle to give blood at an end|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickleader.ie/news/home/231273/i-abstained-from-sex-for-23-months-gay-ul-student-wins-fight-over-blood-donations.html|title='I abstained from sex for 23 months': Gay UL student wins fight over blood donations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2019, Heneghan (27) initiated a fresh legal challenge in the High Court against the blanket deferral on men who have had oral or anal sex with another man in the previous 12-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/policy-on-gay-men-donating-blood-challenged-in-high-court-1.3898662/|title=Policy on gay men donating blood challenged in High Court|first=Aodhan|last=O'Faolain|website=Irishtimes.com|accessdate=25 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/high-court-challenge-gay-men-sex-blood-donation-4644270-May2019/|title=Man brings High Court challenge over IBTS policy on gay men donating blood|first=Aodhan|last=O'Faolain|website=TheJournal.ie|accessdate=25 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/gay-man-challenges-blood-donor-sex-policy-lq3rfpgsz|title=Gay man challenges blood donor sex policy|first=Aodhan|last=O'Faolain|newspaper=The Times|accessdate=25 May 2019|date=21 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/man-brings-court-challenge-against-blood-transfusion-service-after-they-prevented-him-from-donating-38129815.html|title=Man brings court challenge against blood transfusion service after they prevented him from donating|website=independent.ie|accessdate=25 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heneghan claims he cannot understand the reasoning behind the IBTS policy and argues that the questionnaire does not enable the IBTS to make a full evaluation of the level of risk presented by an individual donor due to their sexual behaviour. He also states that according to the IBTS’s own website, there is a window period following infection during which HIV and hepatitis may not be detected in the blood and that this window is seven days for HIV and 16 days for hepatitis. He claims that a far less onerous restriction could be imposed rather than the 12-month deferral, which would protect blood recipients. He claims the decision to place an “automatic deferral” on him is unlawful and in breach of EU law and European communities regulations on the quality and safety of human blood products and that the policy is disproportionate, discriminates against homosexual and bisexual men, and breaches his constitutional rights and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The case is due to return to the court in July 2019.

In July 2019, a gay man in Ireland filed two formal complaints with the European Commission against the Department of Health and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, and the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service (the only part of the United Kingdom to maintain a 12-month deferral policy for MSM) over the MSM one-year deferral policy. The man, who has chosen to have his complaints examined by the Commission anonymously, is alleging the ban in both jurisdictions violates a number of European Union laws, including two European Union Directives covering the standards of quality and safety for the collection of blood by EU member states, as well as provisions contained in both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Commission has informed the man his complaints will now be considered in light of EU law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gcn.ie/irish-man-files-formal-complaint-with-european-commission-over-gay-blood-ban/|title=Irish man files formal complaint with European Commission over gay blood ban|first=Peter|last=Dunne|website=GCN.ie|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar policy exists in the rest of the European Union and is the prevailing interpretation of the European Union Directive 2004/33/EC article 2.1 on donor deferrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/c1r9rx5fc499m1rm/fulltext.pdf |title=Commission Directive 2004/33/EC of 22 March 2004 |publisher=Iospress.metapress.com |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, however, is not very specific and refers to "high risk sexual contact."  The UK interprets the directive to include all forms of homosexual sex as falling within 2.2.2 of Annex III to the directive "Persons whose behaviour or activity places them at risk of acquiring  infectious diseases that may be transmitted by blood", requiring a deferral based on the window period for the diseases involved, and sets this at 12 months, despite the Annex suggesting 6 months for risk of exposure to Hepatitis B. Hélder Trindade, President of the Portuguese Institute of Blood and Transplantation (IPST), stated in 2015 that sexually abstinent homosexuals may give blood, but that MSM is definitely seen as a risk factor.&lt;ref name=tvi24-29April2015a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/doar/homossexuais-so-podem-dar-sangue-em-abstinencia-sexual |title=Homosexuals may give blood if they abstain from sex (Homossexuais só podem dar sangue em abstinência sexual)|publisher=tvi24|language=Portuguese|date=29 April 2015|accessdate=5 November 2015|quote=The President of the Institute of Blood explains that "sexual contact by men with other men is definitely (seen) as a risk factor" (Presidente do Instituto do Sangue explica que "contacto sexual de homens com outros homens é definido como fator de risco")}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, the parliamentary ombudsman launched an investigation on the possible unconstitutionality of the lifetime ban in January 2006. In June 2008, it was concluded that the ban was not unlawful in Finland as it is based on "appropriately reasoned epidemiological information" and because it is related to sexual behaviour rather than sexual orientation. The ombudsman added that people over the age of 65 and people who lived in Britain during the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease) outbreak are also screened out during blood donor interviews. In December 2013, the Finnish Red Cross blood service announced it was lifting the ban and introducing a one-year deferral instead.

Since 10 July 2016, France implemented a 1-year deferral period policy on all gay and bisexual men donating blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/europe/france-gay-blood-donation.html|title=France to Lift Ban on Gay Men Donating Blood |work=The New York Times |date=4 November 2015 |accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Since 2009, the [[New Zealand Blood Service]] (NZBS) had deferred males who have had oral or anal intercourse, with or without protection, with another male for five years. From the formation of the NZBS in 1998 to 2009, the deferral period had been ten years, but reduced to five years following an independent review of blood donation criteria in 2007-8 which found no significant difference in risk to the blood supply for deferral periods of five years compared to ten years.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/218/1386/file/NZBS%20Behavioural%20Donor%20Deferral%20Criteria%20Review%20%20Final%20Report%20April%202008.pdf |title= Behavioural Donor Deferral Criteria Review – Final Report to the New Zealand Blood Service |date= April 2008 |accessdate= 20 July 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121029210122/http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/218/1386/file/NZBS%20Behavioural%20Donor%20Deferral%20Criteria%20Review%20%20Final%20Report%20April%202008.pdf |archive-date= 29 October 2012 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the NZBS dropped the ban period from 5 years to one year following the recommendation of [[Medsafe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/2/article_16184.php |title= New one year blood ban now in place |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 1 February 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150209102337/http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/2/article_16184.php |archive-date= 9 February 2015 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their decision was mainly caused by recently gained facts about HIV transmission in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sdgln.com/health/2014/12/15/new-zealand-new-1-year-blood-ban-now-place#sthash.7HLfyPIC.dpbs |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 1 February 2015|title=New Zealand: New one-year blood ban now in place|publisher=San Diego Gay and Lesbian News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which already had a one-year deferral. The new 1 year deferral has been in effect since 15 December 2014.

The one year deferral period for MSM is on par with the one year deferral period for persons engaging in prostitution outside of New Zealand and people who have resided in a country which has a high (1% or more) HIV prevalence. Females who engage in sexual intercourse with a male who has had sex with another male are also deferred for twelve months.&lt;ref name="NZBS-safeblood"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/Give-blood/Donating/Detailed-eligibility-criteria |title= Detailed Eligibility Criteria |publisher= New Zealand Blood Service |accessdate= 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the US, the current guidance from the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is to defer any male donor who has had sex with another man (MSM) in the past year. This has been so since December 2015.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/fda-eases-restrictions-blood-donations-gay-men-35888660|title=Health Index|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female sexual partners of MSM are deferred for one year since the last exposure. This is the same policy used for any sexual partner of someone in a high risk group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html 1992 Recommendations for the prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629190236/http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html |date=29 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument used to follow these policies is that blood should be collected from a population that is at low risk for disease, since the tests are not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded, and these population groups would be considered a high risk. The policy was first put in place in 1983 by the FDA, which regulates blood donations to profit and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Blood Donations from Men Who Have Sex with Other Men Questions and Answers (published: August 19th, 2013) |publisher=FDA.gov |url=http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/bloodbloodproducts/questionsaboutblood/ucm108186.htm | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donors of what the FDA calls "HCT/P's", a category that includes transplants (other than organs) and some reproductive tissue, notably anonymous semen donations, are ineligible for five years after the most recent contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Cber/gdlns/tissdonor.htm#iv FDA/CBER – Guidance for Industry: Eligibility Determination for Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319073505/http://www.fda.gov/Cber/gdlns/tissdonor.htm#iv |date=19 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[UNOS]] policies for [[Organ donation]] require the hospital receiving the organ to be notified if the donor was an MSM within the past 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unos.org/PoliciesandBylaws2/policies/pdfs/policy_16.pdf |title=OPTN/UNOS POLICY 4 |accessdate=20 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619200410/http://unos.org/PoliciesandBylaws2/policies/pdfs/policy_16.pdf |archive-date=19 June 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organs are generally used unless there is a clear positive test for a disease.  The one year deferral was approved by the FDA on 21 December 2015, replacing a lifetime ban on donations from MSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/12/21/fda-officially-alters-decades-old-ban-on-blood-donations-from-gay-and-bisexual-men/|title=FDA: Gay men can once again donate blood in U.S., if they haven't had sex for a year}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History of calls to change the policy====

* In 2006, the [[AABB]], [[American Red Cross]], and [[America's Blood Centers]] all supported a change from the current US policy of a lifetime deferral of MSM to one year since most recent contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/transcripts/2006-4206t1.pdf |format=133MB |title=Meeting of Blood Products Advisory Committee |date=9 March 2006 |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |page=66 |accessdate=25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One model suggested that this change would result in one additional case of HIV transmitted by transfusion every 32.8 years. The AABB has suggested making this change since 1997. The FDA did not accept the proposal and had concerns about the data used to produce the model, citing that additional risk to recipients was not justified.
* On 19 August 2009, the Assembly Judiciary Committee in California passed AJR13, the U.S. Blood Donor Nondiscrimination Resolution, calling upon the FDA to end the MSM blood ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/?q=node/252 |title=Ending the Federal Ban on Gay Blood Donations |publisher=California Progress Report |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning for the restrictions==
Blood services first and foremost must ensure that all blood received for donation is safe for transfusion purposes. This is achieved by screening potential donors for high risk behaviors through questionnaires and interviews before blood is taken, and subsequent laboratory testing on samples of donated blood.

Blood services commonly justify their bans against MSM using the statistically higher prevalence of HIV and hepatitis of MSM in population studies.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Other groups with similar restrictions include commercial sex workers, injecting drug users, and people resident in countries with a high HIV prevalence (such as sub-Saharan Africa).{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In the earliest years of the AIDS epidemic, there were no reliable tests for the virus, which justified blanket bans on blood donations from groups at high risk of acquiring or having HIV, including MSM.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} For instance, by the end of 1981, there were 270 reported cases of severe immune deficiency among gay men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/history-hiv-aids/overview|title=History of HIV and AIDS overview|date=2015-07-20|website=Avert|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 270 reported cases, 121 had died.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the following year, a group of cases among gay men in Southern California emerged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The emergence of these cases led people to believe that the cause of the observed immune deficiencies were sexual in origin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This led the syndrome to initially be called [[gay-related immune deficiency]] (or GRID).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

These restrictions are similar to present-day restrictions in most countries on people residing in the United Kingdom during the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] ("mad cow disease") epidemic of the 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, due to the absence of a test for its human form, [[Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (vCJD).{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In 1985, early tests using the [[ELISA]] method looked for antibodies, which are the immune system's response to the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Bill D.|date=Spring 1994|title=HIV Antibody Testing Methods|url=https://aaimedicine.org/journal-of-insurance-medicine/jim/1994/026-01-0013.pdf|journal=Update on HIV/AIDS|volume=26|pages=13–14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a [[window period]] when using this method in which a person who has been infected with HIV is able to spread the disease but may test negative for the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwwn.cdc.gov/hivrisk/how_know/window_period.html|title=The Window Period {{!}} HIV Risk Reduction Tool {{!}} CDC|website=wwwn.cdc.gov|access-date=2019-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdnaids.ca/hiv-testing/|title=HIV testing|date=2016-11-29|website=Canadian AIDS Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This window period can be as long as three to six months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfaf.org/aids101/hiv_testing.html#window |title=San Francisco AIDS Foundation: HIV Testing |publisher=Sfaf.org |accessdate=20 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807183212/http://www.sfaf.org/aids101/hiv_testing.html#window |archive-date=7 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average of 22 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01140.html FDA Approves First Nucleic Acid Test (Nat) System To Screen Whole Blood Donors For Infections With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (Hiv) And Hepatitis C Virus (Hcv)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221174758/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01140.html |date=21 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests using the ELISA methods are often still used in developed countries because of their ease-of-use, as well as their fairly high [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]], which boasts 100% sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=kb-02-02-01#S4X|title=HIV Antibody Assays|website=hivinsite.ucsf.edu|access-date=2019-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desai|first=Darash|last2=Wu|first2=Grace|last3=Zaman|first3=Muhammad H.|date=2011-01-21|title=Tackling HIV through Robust Diagnostics in the Developing World: Current Status and Future Opportunities|journal=Lab on a Chip|volume=11|issue=2|pages=194–211|doi=10.1039/c0lc00340a|issn=1473-0197|pmc=5181793|pmid=21125097}}&lt;/ref&gt; To cover the window period resultant from the use of these tests, donors are also screened for high risk behaviors, one of which is a history of same-sex sexual activity among male potential donors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Newer tests look for the virus itself, such as the [[p24 antigen]] test, which looks for a part of the virus on the surface of infected cells, and [[Nucleic acid tests]] (NAT), which look for the genetic material of the virus in HIV-infected cells.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catie.ca/en/fact-sheets/testing/hiv-testing-technologies|title=HIV testing technologies|website=www.catie.ca|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bystryak|first=Simon|last2=Acharya|first2=Chitrangada|date=2016-05-01|title=Detection of HIV-1 p24 antigen in patients with varying degrees of viremia using an ELISA with a photochemical signal amplification system|journal=Clinica Chimica Acta; International Journal of Clinical Chemistry|volume=456|pages=128–136|doi=10.1016/j.cca.2016.02.022|issn=0009-8981|pmc=4934021|pmid=26940950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwwn.cdc.gov/hivrisk/how_know/different_tests.html|title=Types of HIV Tests {{!}} HIV Risk Reduction Tool {{!}} CDC|website=wwwn.cdc.gov|access-date=2019-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these tests, the window period is shorter, with an average duration of 12 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;  Fourth generation, or combination, HIV tests can detect HIV infection in 99% of individuals by one and a half months after infection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Risks are also associated with a non-MSM donors testing positive for HIV, which can have major implications as the donor's last donation could have been given within the window period for testing and could have entered the blood supply, potentially infecting blood product recipients. An incident in 2003 in New Zealand saw a non-MSM donor testing positive for HIV and subsequently all blood products made with the donor's last blood donation had to be recalled. This included NZ$4 million worth of [[Factor VIII]], a blood clotting factor used to treat hemophiliacs which is manufactured from large pools of donated plasma, and subsequently led to a nationwide shortage of Factor VIII and the deferral of non-emergency surgery on hemophiliac patients, costing the health sector millions of dollars more.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview" /&gt; Screening out those at high risk of bloodborne diseases, including MSM, reduces the potential frequency and impact of such incidents.

==Criticism of the restrictions==
Objections to the restrictions, including those from the American Medical Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.page|title=Policies on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender &amp; Queer (LGBTQ) Issues – AMA|website=www.ama-assn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Red Cross, are generally based on the idea that improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV to an acceptable level. Blood shortages are common, and advocates for change to the policies point out that excluding healthy donors only makes the problem worse. In 2018, approximately 10,000 donations were still urgently needed by March 10 to continue to meet patients’ needs. However, Canadian Blood Services noted that the national inventory and days on hand of several blood groups remain at critically low levels. Less than four per cent of eligible donors give blood each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blood.ca/en/media/donate-now-urgent-need-blood-across-canada-continues|title=Donate now: urgent need for blood across Canada continues {{!}} Canadian Blood Services|website=blood.ca|access-date=2019-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further advocating for change stems from the fact that the ban is a blanket ban encompassing all men who have had sex with another man, even with protection and even if the HIV status of these men's partners is shown beyond doubt to be negative. Advocates for change point out that a promiscuous straight male is a higher-risk donor than a gay or bisexual man in a monogamous relationship, but the former will usually be allowed to donate blood. Furthermore, other high-risk activities such as having sexual contact with anyone who has used needles to take drugs not prescribed by their doctor have a set deferral period before the donor is allowed to donate blood, whereas in some countries MSM donors are deferred indefinitely. If a woman has had sexual contact with a man who has had sex with a man in the last year, she must wait three months from last sexual contact before donating blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blood.ca/en/blood/am-i-eligible/men-who-have-sex-men|title=Men who have sex with men {{!}} Canadian Blood Services|website=blood.ca|access-date=2019-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
