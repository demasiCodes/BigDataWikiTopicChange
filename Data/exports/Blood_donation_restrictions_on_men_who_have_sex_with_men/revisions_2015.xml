The '''men who have sex with men blood donor controversy''' is the dispute over prohibitions on donations of [[blood donation|blood]] or tissue for [[organ transplant]]s from [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), a classification of men who engage (or have engaged in the past) in sex with other men, regardless of whether they identify themselves as [[bisexual]], [[gay]], or otherwise.  Opposition to the prohibition is frequently addressed in terms of bisexual and gay men.  Restrictions on donors are sometimes called "deferrals", since blood donors who are found ineligible may be found eligible at a later date.  Many deferrals are indefinite, however, meaning that these blood donors may or may not be accepted at any point in the future.  The restrictions vary from country to country, and in many cases, men are deferred even though they always have protected sex or have not had sex with men for many years.  The restrictions affect these men, and, in some cases, any female sex partners. They do not otherwise affect other women, including [[women who have sex with women]]. Opponents of many of the deferrals point out that these policies are not supported by medical science.&lt;ref name=Schoettes&gt;{{cite news|last=Schoettes|first=Scott|title=Blood Donations Questions|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=Adelante Magazine|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[LGBT]] organizations view the restrictions on donation as based on [[homophobia]] and not based on valid medical concern since donations are rigorously [[HIV test|tested]] to rule out donors that are infected with known viruses such as [[HIV]], [[Hepatitis B]], and [[Hepatitis C]]. They state the deferrals are based on stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt; Proponents of the lifetime restriction defend it because of the risk of false negative test results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-stier/blood-for-sale_b_52046.html |title=Blood for Sale |accessdate=5 April 2008 |last=Stier|first=Jeff |date=13 June 2007 |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because the MSM population in developed countries tends to have a relatively high prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection.&lt;ref name="unaids2006"&gt;UNAIDS 2006 report on the global AIDS epidemic, [http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2006/2006_GR_CH05_en.pdf Chapter 05], June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government advisory committee, SABTO, states that the risk of transfusion of HIV infected blood would increase if MSM were allowed to donate blood.&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |title=Homosexual men allowed to give blood but sex banned for decade |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of prohibitions against MSM point out that screening of donors should focus on sexual behavior as well as [[safe sex]] practices since many MSM may always have protected sex, be [[monogamy|monogamous]], or be in other low risk categories.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013" /&gt; Some groups in favor of lifting the restrictions support a waiting period after the blood is donated when the donor is considered to have had behavior considered higher risk, and before it is used, to match the blood bank's window of testing methods.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt;  Depending on the testing method used, the window to detect HIV can be as short as 7 to 21 days (RNA testing), or as long as three months (serology testing method). However, there is a small percentage of the population at 3% who still will not test positive after 3 months with serology testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sfaf.org/hiv-info/testing/hiv-test-window-periods.html|title = HIV Test Window Periods|date = 2014|accessdate = 19 February 2015|website = San Francisco AIDS Foundation|publisher = San Francisco AIDS Foundation|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS==
{{Main|Men who have sex with men#HIV/AIDS}}
In many developed countries HIV is more prevalent among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) than among the general population.&lt;ref name="unaids2006"/&gt;

In the United States in 2005, MSM, [[African Americans]], and persons engaging in high-risk heterosexual behavior accounted for respectively 49%, 49%, and 32% of new HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;CDC [http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/statistics_2005_hiv_surveillance_report_vol_17.pdf HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report: HIV Infection and AIDS in the United States and Dependent Areas, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 in the United States, African Americans accounted for 47.9% of new HIV diagnoses reported that year, but represented approximately only 12% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/america.htm|title=HIV and AIDS in America|publisher=avert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the US, the current guidance from the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is to indefinitely defer any male donor who has had sex with another man (MSM), in the period from 1977 to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Consumer Affairs Branch (CBER) |url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/QuestionsaboutBlood/ucm108186.htm |title=Blood Donations from Men Who Have Sex with Other Men Questions and Answers |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of July 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is proposing to change the policy by replacing the indefinite deferral with a 1-year deferral.&lt;ref name=FDAMay2015 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/health/fda-lifting-ban-on-gay-blood-donors.html?_r=0 |title=F.D.A.

Female sexual partners of MSM are deferred for one year since the last exposure. This is the same policy used for any sexual partner of someone in a high risk group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html 1992 Recommendations for the prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument used to follow these policies is that blood should be collected from a population that is at low risk for disease, since the tests are not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded, and these population groups would be considered a high risk. The policy was first put in place in 1983 by the FDA, which regulates blood donations to profit and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Blood Donations from Men Who Have Sex with Other Men Questions and Answers (published: August 19th, 2013) |publisher=FDA.gov |url=http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/bloodbloodproducts/questionsaboutblood/ucm108186.htm | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donors of what the FDA calls "HCT/P's", a category that includes transplants (other than organs) and some reproductive tissue, notably anonymous semen donations, are ineligible for five years after the most recent contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Cber/gdlns/tissdonor.htm#iv FDA/CBER - Guidance for Industry: Eligibility Determination for Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps)]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[UNOS]] policies for [[Organ donation]] require the hospital receiving the organ to be notified if the donor was an MSM within the past 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unos.org/PoliciesandBylaws2/policies/pdfs/policy_16.pdf |title=OPTN/UNOS POLICY 4 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organs are generally used unless there is a clear positive test for a disease.

====History of calls to change the policy====

* In 2006, the [[AABB]], [[American Red Cross]], and [[America's Blood Centers]] all supported a change from the current US policy of a lifetime deferral of MSM to one year since most recent contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/transcripts/2006-4206t1.pdf |format=133MB |title=Meeting of Blood Products Advisory Committee |date=9 March 2006 |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |page=66 |accessdate=25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One model suggested that this change would result in one additional case of HIV transmitted by transfusion every 32.8 years. The AABB has suggested making this change since 1997. The FDA did not accept the proposal and had concerns about the data used to produce the model, citing that additional risk to recipients was not justified.
* On 19 August 2009, the Assembly Judiciary Committee in California passed AJR13, the U.S. Blood Donor Nondiscrimination Resolution, calling upon the FDA to end the MSM blood ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/?q=node/252 |title=Ending the Federal Ban on Gay Blood Donations |publisher=California Progress Report |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2010, the New York City Council passed a resolution calling on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to eliminate the ban stating "This ban was based on prejudice, a knee-jerk reaction, and misunderstandings about the HIV/AIDS disease. Given the constant need for blood, it does not make common sense to prohibit donations from an entire population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.council.nyc.gov/d7/html/members/pdf/community_report_04.30.2010.pdf |title=Legislative and Community Report |date=30 April 2010 |publisher=[[New York City Council]] |location=[[New York]] |page=2 |format=PDF |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5y5nQs7v6 |archivedate=20 April 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 1 June 2010, the Washington, DC City Council passed a resolution calling on the FDA to "reverse the lifetime deferment of blood donations by men who have had sex with men since 1977 in favor of a policy that protects the safety and integrity of the blood supply that is based on an up-to-date scientific criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Notice/DownLoad.aspx?NoticeID=400045 |title=A Resolution 18-486 : In the Council of the District of Columbia |date=1 June 2010 |publisher=Dcregs.dc.gov |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2013, the American Medical Association issued a statement calling on the FDA to change the policy, stating that "The lifetime ban on blood donation for men who have sex with men is discriminatory and not based on sound science."&lt;ref&gt;

* In July 2013, the [[American Osteopathic Association]] approved a policy calling on the FDA to "end the indefinite deferment period for Men who have sex with Men (MSM)", and to "modify the exclusion criteria for MSM to be consistent with deferrals for those judged to be at an increased risk of infection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/news-and-publications/media-center/2013-news-releases/Pages/HOD-2013-increase-number-of-eligible-blood-donors.aspx |title=American Osteopathic Association Calls for Removing FDA's Blood Donor Ban |publisher=Osteopathic.org |date=20 July 2013 |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As of July 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is proposing to change the policy by replacing the indefinite deferral with a 1-year deferral.&lt;ref name=FDAMay2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=uippav&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/health/fda-lifting-ban-on-gay-blood-donors.html|title=F.D.A.

===European Union===
The UK (excluding Northern Ireland) lifted its lifetime ban on MSM blood donation in September 2011,&lt;ref name="SaBTO" /&gt; and changed the policy to simply restrict men who have had sex with another man within the previous 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waygood |first=James |url=http://sosogay.org/2011/government-announces-end-of-lifetime-ban-on-gay-blood-donation/ |title=UK Government lifts lifetime ban on gay blood donation |publisher=So So Gay |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended the policy change after a study concluded that a total ban may breach equality legislation and that the risk of HIV reaching the blood supply would only increase by approximately 2%.&lt;ref name = ukbanlift&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |title=Homosexual men allowed to give blood but sex banned for decade |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar policy exists in the rest of the European Union and is the prevailing interpretation of the European Union Directive 2004/33/EC article 2.1 on donor deferrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/c1r9rx5fc499m1rm/fulltext.pdf |title=Commission Directive 2004/33/EC of 22 March 2004 |publisher=Iospress.metapress.com |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, however, is not very specific and refers to "high risk sexual contact."  The UK interprets the directive to include all forms of homosexual sex as falling within 2.2.2 of Annex III to the directive "Persons whose behaviour or activity places them at risk of acquiring infectious diseases that may be transmitted by blood." requiring a deferral based on the window period for the diseases involved, and sets this at 12 months, despite the Annex suggesting 6 months for risk of exposure to Hepatitis B.  Bulgaria,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Italy,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Latvia,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Poland,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and Spain{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} all regard sex between men as not being high risk.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Hélder Trindade, President of the Portuguese Institute of Blood and Transplantation (IPST), stated in 2015 that sexually abstinent homosexuals may give blood, but that MSM is definitely seen as a risk factor.&lt;ref name=tvi24-29April2015a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/doar/homossexuais-so-podem-dar-sangue-em-abstinencia-sexual |title=Homosexuals may give blood if they abstain from sex (Homossexuais só podem dar sangue em abstinência sexual)|publisher=tvi24|language=Portuguese|date=29 April 2015|accessdate=5 November 2015|quote=The President of the Institute of Blood explains that "sexual contact by men with other men is definitely (seen) as a risk factor" (Presidente do Instituto do Sangue explica que "contacto sexual de homens com outros homens é definido como fator de risco")}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protected or unprotected oral sex is less likely to transmit HIV or Hepatitis B than unprotected penis in vagina sex.{{clarify|question=male-to-female or vice-versa, etc?|date=November 2015}}{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In Finland, the parliamentary ombudsman launched an investigation on the possible unconstitutionality of the lifetime ban in January 2006. In June 2008, it was concluded that the ban was not unlawful in Finland as it is based on "appropriately reasoned epidemiological information" and because it is related to sexual behaviour rather than sexual orientation. The ombudsman added that people over the age of 65 and people who lived in Britain during the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease) outbreak are also screened out during blood donor interviews. In December 2013, the Finnish Red Cross blood service announced it was lifting the ban and introducing a one-year deferral instead.

France announced plans in 2015 to lift ints ban on blood donation by MSM beginning in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/europe/france-gay-blood-donation.html|title=France to Lift Ban on Gay Men Donating Blood |publisher=New York Times |date=November 4, 2015 |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Australia's individual states and territories each had their own [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service|policies on blood donations by MSM]]. Most previously had some form of the indefinite deferral, and they all changed to a 12-month deferral at different times between 1996 ([[South Australia|SA]]) and 2000 ([[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], [[New South Wales|NSW]]).&lt;ref name = "Seed" /&gt;

A comparison of confirmed HIV positive blood donations before and after the change did not see a statistically significant difference, though the number of HIV positive blood donations during the period with a 12-month deferral was greater. In all of the cases of HIV positive donations associated with MSM after the 12-month deferral, the donors had lied about their medical history and would not have been eligible under either criterion.&lt;ref name = "Seed" /&gt;

===New Zealand===
Since 2009, the [[New Zealand Blood Service]] (NZBS) had deferred males who have had oral or anal intercourse, with or without protection, with another male for five years. From the formation of the NZBS in 1998 to 2009, the deferral period had been ten years, but reduced to five years following an independent review of blood donation criteria in 2007-8 which found no significant difference in risk to the blood supply for deferral periods of five years compared to ten years.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/218/1386/file/NZBS%20Behavioural%20Donor%20Deferral%20Criteria%20Review%20%20Final%20Report%20April%202008.pdf |title= Behavioural Donor Deferral Criteria Review - Final Report to the New Zealand Blood Service |date= April 2008 |accessdate= 20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the NZBS dropped the ban period from 5 years to one year following the recommendation of [[Medsafe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/2/article_16184.php |title= New one year blood ban now in place |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their decision was mainly caused by recently gained facts about HIV transmission in Australia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sdgln.com/health/2014/12/15/new-zealand-new-1-year-blood-ban-now-place#sthash.7HLfyPIC.dpbs |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 1 February 2015|title=New Zealand: New one-year blood ban now in place|publisher=San Diego Gay and Lesbian News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which already had a one-year deferral. The new 12-month deferral has been in effect since 15 December 2014.

The one year deferral period for MSM is on par with the one year deferral period for persons engaging in prostitution outside of New Zealand and people who have resided in a country which has a high (1% or more) HIV prevalence. Females who engage in sexual intercourse with a male who has had sex with another male are also deferred for twelve months.&lt;ref name="NZBS-safeblood"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/Give-blood/Donating/Detailed-eligibility-criteria |title= Detailed Eligibility Criteria |publisher= New Zealand Blood Service |accessdate= 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning for the restrictions==
Blood services first and foremost must ensure that all blood received for donation is safe for transfusion purposes. This is achieved by screening potential donors for high risk behaviors through questionnaires and interviews before blood is taken, and subsequent laboratory testing on samples of donated blood.

Blood services commonly justify their bans against MSM using the statistically higher prevalence of HIV and hepatitis of MSM in population studies.

In the earliest years of the AIDS epidemic, there were no reliable tests for the virus, which justified blanket bans on blood donations from groups at high risk of acquiring or having HIV, including MSM. These restrictions are similar to present-day restrictions in most countries on people residing in the United Kingdom during the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] ("mad cow disease") epidemic of the 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, due to the absence of a test for its human form, [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (vCJD).

In 1985, early tests using the [[ELISA]] method looked for antibodies, which are the immune system's response to the virus. However, there is a [[window period]] when using this method in which a person who has been infected with HIV is able to spread the disease but may test negative for the virus. This window period can be as long as three to six months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfaf.org/aids101/hiv_testing.html#window |title=San Francisco AIDS Foundation: HIV Testing |publisher=Sfaf.org |date= |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average of 22 days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01140.html FDA Approves First Nucleic Acid Test (Nat) System To Screen Whole Blood Donors For Infections With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (Hiv) And Hepatitis C Virus (Hcv)]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests using the ELISA methods are often still used in developed countries because they are highly [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. In developing countries, these tests are often the only method used to screen donated blood for HIV. To cover the window period resultant from the use of these tests, donors are also screened for high risk behaviors, one of which is a history of same-sex sexual activity among male potential donors. Other groups with similar restrictions include commercial sex workers, injecting drug users, and people resident in countries with a high HIV prevalence (such as sub-Saharan Africa). Newer tests look for the virus itself, such as the [[p24 antigen]] test, which looks for a part on the surface of the virus, and [[Nucleic acid tests]] (NAT), which look for the genetic material of the virus. With these tests, the window period is shorter, with an average duration of 12 days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Fourth generation combination HIV tests are conclusive at 3 months, and Hepatitis B tests are conclusive at 6 months.

Risks are also associated with a regular donor testing positive for HIV, which can have major implications as the donor's last donation could have been given within the window period for testing and could have entered the blood supply, potentially infecting blood product recipients. An incident in 2003 in New Zealand saw a regular donor testing positive for HIV and subsequently all blood products made with the donor's last blood donation had to be recalled. This included NZ$4 million worth of [[Factor VIII]], a blood clotting factor used to treat haemophiliacs which is manufactured from large pools of donated plasma, and subsequently led to a natiowide shortage of Factor VIII and the deferral of non-emergency surgery on haemophiliac patients, costing the health sector millions of dollars more.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview" /&gt; Screening out those at high risk of bloodborne diseases, including MSM, reduces the potential frequency and impact of such incidents.

==Criticism of the restrictions==
Objections to the restrictions, including those from the American Medical Association and Red Cross, are generally based on the idea that improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV to an acceptable level. Blood shortages are common, and opponents of the policies point out that excluding healthy donors only makes the problem worse. "Ideal" inventories are at least a three-day supply, but many blood centers struggle to meet this demand.

Further opposition stems from the fact that the ban is a blanket ban encompassing all men who have had sex with another man, even with protection and even if the HIV status of these men's partners is shown beyond doubt to be negative. Opponents point out that a promiscuous heterosexual male is a higher-risk donor than a gay or bisexual man in a monogamous relationship, for example a [[civil partnership in the United Kingdom]], but the former will usually be allowed to donate blood.  Additionally, in the United States, a man who has unprotected heterosexual sex with a complete stranger is allowed to donate the next day, whereas a man who has protected homosexual sex is banned from donating for life.  Furthermore, other high-risk activities such as having sexual contact with anyone who has used needles to take drugs not prescribed by their doctor have a set deferral period before the donor is allowed to donate blood, whereas in some countries MSM donors are deferred indefinitely. Female donors who have sexual contact with MSM are deferred for only twelve months.

==Protests and boycotts==

===Canada===
* The students association at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]] voted in 2012 to maintain a ban on blood clinics on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2012/07/10/ottawa-carleton-university-students-ban-blood-clinics-gay-man-policy.html |title=Blood clinic ban on campus upheld due to policy on gay men - Ottawa - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=10 July 2012 |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Throughout the 2000s, several boycotts have been held on college campuses across the United States against blood drives. For example, in 2003, a blood drive at the [[University of Vermont]] was cancelled to protest the MSM donor policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyfreepress.com/news/school-ends-blood-drives-in-protest-of-anti-gay-rules-1.582542 ]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an [[Iowa State University]] student group sparked controversy when they pulled their support for a blood drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://iowastatedaily.com/opinion/article_ea75d8f6-dc39-53fb-9c16-aadf27c5c2d9.html |title=LETTER: Political correctness may cripple blood drive turnout - Iowa State Daily: Opinion |publisher=Iowa State Daily |date=26 February 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a faculty member at [[Sonoma State University]] proposed a ban on blood drives on campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton |first=Laura |url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20080308/NEWS/803080311?p=all&amp;tc=pgall |title=Battle over blood |publisher=PressDemocrat.com |date=8 March 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[San Jose State University]] President Don Kassing suspended all blood drives on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://badgerherald.com/news/2008/02/06/college_protests_blo.php |title=News: College protests blood drives |publisher=The Badger Herald |date=6 February 2008 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, students from [[Keene State College]] protested blood drives on their campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keeneequinox.com/news/pride-protests-bad-blood-1.2187207 |title=keeneequinox.com |publisher=keeneequinox.com |date= |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2011, The Queens College Academic Senate of The City University of New York recommended that all blood drives on campus should cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.free-press-release.com/news-queens-college-city-university-of-new-york-bans-blood-drives-1302975220.html |title=Queens College Bans Blood Drives (The City University of New York) blood drive is happening in flushing queens,york college cuny blood donation |publisher=Free-press-release.com |date= |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recommendation was adopted by Queens College President James Muyskens but reversed in  June 2011 when the CUNY chancellory expressed its disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qc.cuny.edu/Academics/AcademicSenate/Documents/Minutes/110414.pdf |title=Minutes Of The Academic Senate Of Queens College |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A student organization at the University of Michigan, Blood Drives United, has been holding awareness drives in conjunction with their annual blood drive competitions as a means of productively addressing the policy while still collecting blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michigandaily.com/opinion/10daily-blood-battle-equality23|title=From the Daily: The battle for donor equality|work=The Michigan Daily|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michigandaily.com/opinion/10viewpoint-blood-battle21|title=Viewpoint: Ending a discriminatory blood policy|work=The Michigan Daily|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "sponsor" drives allow individuals ineligible to donate because of the policy to bring eligible individuals to donate on their behalf, visually demonstrating that twice as much blood could potentially be collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloodbattle.org/|title=Blood Battle at the University of Michigan|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
