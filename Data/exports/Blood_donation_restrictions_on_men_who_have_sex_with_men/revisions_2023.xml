Many countries have laws, regulations, or recommendations that effectively prohibit donations of [[blood donation|blood]] or tissue for [[organ transplant|organ]] and [[corneal transplantation|corneal transplants]] from [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), a classification irrespective of their [[Gay sexual practices|sexual activities with same-sex partners]] and of whether they [[Sexual identity|identify themselves]] as [[bisexual]] or [[gay]]. Temporary restrictions are sometimes called "deferrals", since blood donors who are found ineligible may be found eligible at a later date. However, many deferrals are indefinite meaning that donations are not accepted at any point in the future, constituting a [[de facto]] ban. Even men who have monogamous relations with their same-sex partners are found ineligible.

Since 1982, the risk for HIV infection transmitted via transfusion has been almost eliminated by the use of questionnaires to exclude donors at higher risk for HIV infection and performing screening tests with highly sensitive equipment to identify infected blood donations. According to the 2015 surveillance report by Canadian Blood Services, the risk of HIV transfusion-transmitted infection was fairly low: in 1 in 21.4 million donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blood.ca/sites/default/files/External_Surveillance_Report_2015.pdf|title=Surveillance Report 2015|access-date=18 November 2019|archive-date=8 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308135103/https://www.blood.ca/sites/default/files/External_Surveillance_Report_2015.pdf|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|Contaminated blood]] put [[hemophilia|haemophiliacs]] at massive risk and severe mortality, increasing the risk of common surgical procedures. People who contracted HIV from a contaminated [[blood transfusion]] include [[Isaac Asimov]], who received a blood transfusion following cardiac surgery.

== HIV/AIDS ==
{{Main|Men who have sex with men#HIV/AIDS}}
In many high-income countries HIV is more prevalent among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) than among the general population.&lt;ref name="unaids2006"&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |title=At Risk and Neglected: four key populations |url=http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2006/2006_GR_CH05_en.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929191022/http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2006/2006_GR_CH05_en.pdf |archive-date=29 September 2011 |access-date=12 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States the population most affected by HIV includes gay, bisexual, and other MSM.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/index.html|title=HIV and Gay and Bisexual Men|date=12 November 2019|access-date=18 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 38,739 new HIV diagnoses in the US and dependent areas in 2017, 70% consisted of adult and adolescent gay and bisexual men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although approximately 492,000 sexually active gay and bisexual men are at high risk for HIV, there are more tools to prevent HIV than ever before.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Proponents of the lifetime restriction defend it because of the asserted risk of false negative test results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stier |first=Jeff |date=13 June 2007 |title=Blood for Sale |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com, Inc |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-stier/blood-for-sale_b_52046.html |access-date=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because the MSM population in developed countries tends to have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection.&lt;ref name="unaids2006" /&gt; The UK government advisory committee, SABTO, stated in 2013 that "the risk of transfusion of HIV infected blood would increase if MSM were allowed to donate blood".&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bloxham |first1=Andy |date=10 April 2011 |title=Homosexual men allowed to give blood but sex banned for decade |work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411125844/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |archive-date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017 however, the UK government reduced the one year deferral window to three months, to take effect in the following months, resulting from SABTO's updated conclusions that "new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules". Furthermore, [[NHS Blood and Transplant]] are in the process of investigating how possible it is for MSM, depending on the degree of risk, to donate without even the three-month deferral.&lt;ref name="bbcjul17"&gt;{{cite news |date=23 July 2017 |title=Blood donation rules relaxed for gay men and sex workers |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-40669950 |access-date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; NHS has said that there is currently a limited amount of data on effective ways of conducting such risk assessments and that the initial steps of scoping, evidence gathering and testing will potentially take up to two years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Scientific review offers chance for more people to give blood |url=https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/news/scientific-review-offers-chance-for-more-people-to-give-blood/ |access-date=19 November 2019 |website=NHS Blood and Transplant |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current situation ==
Restrictions vary from country to country, and in some countries, the practice of protected sex or periods of abstinence are not considered. The restrictions affect these men and, in some cases, any female sex partners. They do not otherwise affect other women, including [[women who have sex with women]]. With regard to blood donation, the [[United States Food &amp; Drug Administration]] (FDA) enforces a three-month deferral period for MSM and women who have sex with MSM.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Commissioner |first=Office of the |date=2020-04-02 |title=Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Provides Updated Guidance to Address the Urgent Need for Blood During the Pandemic |url=https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-provides-updated-guidance-address-urgent-need-blood-during-pandemic |access-date=2020-04-03 |website=FDA |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the deferral period for MSM blood donors was decreased to 3 months in June 2019.&lt;ref name="CAReport"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Canadian Blood Services Annual Report 2018–2019 |url=https://www.blood.ca/sites/default/files/CBS-AR2019-en.pdf |access-date=18 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, for tissues such as [[cornea]]s, the MSM deferral period is five years in the United States and 12 months in Canada.&lt;ref name="Association of Federal Regulations in the United States and Canada With Potential Corneal Donation by Men Who Have Sex With Men"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Puente |first1=Michael A. |last2=Patnaik |first2=Jennifer L. |last3=Lynch |first3=Anne M. |last4=Snyder |first4=Blake M. |last5=Caplan |first5=Chad M. |last6=Pham |first6=Binhan |last7=Neves da Silva |first7=Helio V. |last8=Chen |first8=Conan |last9=Taravella |first9=Michael J. |last10=Palestine |first10=Alan G. |date=1 November 2020 |title=Association of Federal Regulations in the United States and Canada With Potential Corneal Donation by Men Who Have Sex With Men |url=https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.3630 |journal=JAMA Ophthalmology |volume=138 |issue=11 |pages=1143–1149 |doi=10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.3630 |pmc=7516798 |pmid=32970105 |via=Silverchair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
{{See also|Men who have sex with men blood donor controversy in the United Kingdom}}
Several European countries do not have deferral policies for [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM). The donation is allowed if the donor has not had a risky sexual encounter, but not depending on the sexual orientation of the donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donarsangre.org/donantes-de-sangre/|title=Donantes de sangre – Centro de Donación de Sangre de Cruz Roja|publisher=[[Cruz Roja Española]]|language=es|access-date=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Mundo 2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/salud/2015/04/29/5540e08bca47415e108b4579.html|title=España no discrimina a los donantes por su orientación sexual|date=29 April 2015|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=es|access-date=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="criteri_per_la_selezione_del_donatore" /&gt; For example, in Italy, the questionnaire item for sexual behaviour is symmetrical with respect to homosexual, heterosexual and bisexual intercourses and mentions them explicitly, as well as all points of sexual contact (oral, genital, anal), and does not mention usage of protection.&lt;ref name="criteri_per_la_selezione_del_donatore" /&gt;

The UK since November 2017 has [[Men who have sex with men blood donor controversy in the United Kingdom|implemented a 3-month deferral policy]] on all gay/bi men who want to donate their blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blood.co.uk/news-and-campaigns/news-and-statements/blood-donation-rules-have-changed/|title=Blood donation rules have changed|website=NHS Blood Donation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SaBTO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_129796 |title=Donor selection criteria review |access-date=8 September 2011 |publisher=[[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and SaBTO, Blood Donor Selection Steering Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Waygood |first=James |url=http://sosogay.org/2011/government-announces-end-of-lifetime-ban-on-gay-blood-donation/ |title=UK Government lifts lifetime ban on gay blood donation |work=So So Gay |date=8 September 2011 |access-date=20 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512193654/http://sosogay.org/2011/government-announces-end-of-lifetime-ban-on-gay-blood-donation/ |archive-date=12 May 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did not apply to Northern Ireland until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-52471308|title=Same-sex blood donation rules relaxed|date=29 April 2020|publisher=BBC News|access-date=29 April 2020|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended the policy change after a study concluded that a total ban may breach equality legislation and that the risk of HIV reaching the blood supply would only increase by approximately 2%.&lt;ref name="ukbanlift"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411125844/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 April 2011 |title=Homosexual men allowed to give blood but sex banned for decade |work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|access-date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2020, it was announced that the UK would move to a personalised sexual behaviour risk assessment and scrap the deferral period specific to MSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=14 December 2020|title=Blood donation: Rule change means more gay and bisexual men can give blood|language=en-GB|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55296525|access-date=15 December 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, MSM could historically donate blood if they had not engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at least 12 months prior to a donation. This policy had come into effect on 16 January 2017. On 27 July 2015, Tomás Heneghan, a 23-year-old University of Limerick student, and journalist from Galway began a legal challenge in the High Court against the permanent deferral imposed on MSM donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/gay-blood-ban-tomas-heneghan-2240158-Jul2015/|title=This 23-year-old student is challenging Ireland's gay blood donation ban|first=Catherine|last=Healy|date=29 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/gay-man-brings-legal-challenge-over-blood-donation-ban-1.2298825|title=Gay man brings legal challenge over blood donation ban|newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He claims this is in breach of EU law. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a "window period" in which infections are sometimes not detected. Heneghan's previous sexual activity posed no risk of infection, according to HSE-approved advice and he said the service had no evidence upon which it could legitimately impose a life-long ban on him donating blood. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12-month ban. Later that week the Minister for Health Simon Harris agreed to the recommendations and announced the reduction would take place. However, no timeline was reported for the implementation of the new policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=June 23, 2016 |title=IBTS votes to end lifetime ban on gay men donating blood |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0623/797739-blood-donation/ |url-status= |access-date=June 25, 2023 |website=RTÉ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2016, Tomás Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/gay-man-drops-challenge-to-blood-donation-ban-after-change-in-policy-announced-by-health-minister-34913345.html|title=Gay man drops challenge to blood donation ban after a change in policy announced by Health Minister – Independent.ie|access-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heneghan then wrote about his experiences of challenging the ban in a number of national media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/toms-heneghan-on-his-high-court-case-why-was-i-shaming-the-family-why-was-my-sex-life-being-opened-up-to-public-scrutiny-34917487.html|title=Tomás Heneghan on his High Court case: Why was I shaming the family?

However, he also criticized the new 12-month deferral policy on MSM and called on Ireland's Health Minister to initiate a review of the IBTS and replace the 12-month deferral period for MSM with no deferral or a 3-month deferral on all donors following sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://theoutmost.com/news/irish-lifetime-ban-blood-donation-lifted-gay-men/?platform=hootsuite |title=Irish Lifetime Ban on Blood Donation Lifted for Gay Men – theoutmost.com – Gay Ireland News &amp; Entertainmenttheoutmost.com |access-date=18 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191141/http://theoutmost.com/news/irish-lifetime-ban-blood-donation-lifted-gay-men/?platform=hootsuite |archive-date=31 January 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/blood-transfusion-service-finally-lifts-ban-on-gay-men-donating-blood-439426.html|title=Blood Transfusion Service finally lifts ban on gay men donating blood|date=17 January 2017|work=Irish Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/gay-donor-tooth-and-nail-battle-to-give-blood-at-an-end-1.2939185|title=Gay donor: 'Tooth and nail' battle to give blood at an end|newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/home/231273/i-abstained-from-sex-for-23-months-gay-ul-student-wins-fight-over-blood-donations.html|title='I abstained from sex for 23 months': Gay UL student wins fight over blood donations|website=limerickleader.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2019, Heneghan (27) initiated a fresh legal challenge in the High Court against the blanket deferral on men who had had oral or anal sex with another man in the previous 12-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/policy-on-gay-men-donating-blood-challenged-in-high-court-1.3898662/|title=Policy on gay men donating blood challenged in High Court|first=Aodhan|last=O'Faolain|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=25 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/high-court-challenge-gay-men-sex-blood-donation-4644270-May2019/|title=Man brings High Court challenge over IBTS policy on gay men donating blood|first=Aodhan|last=O'Faolain|website=TheJournal.ie|date=20 May 2019 |access-date=25 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/gay-man-challenges-blood-donor-sex-policy-lq3rfpgsz|title=Gay man challenges blood donor sex policy|first=Aodhan|last=O'Faolain|newspaper=The Times|access-date=25 May 2019|date=21 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/man-brings-court-challenge-against-blood-transfusion-service-after-they-prevented-him-from-donating-38129815.html|title=Man brings court challenge against blood transfusion service after they prevented him from donating|website=Irish Independent|access-date=25 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heneghan claims he cannot understand the reasoning behind the IBTS policy and argues that the questionnaire does not enable the IBTS to make a full evaluation of the level of risk presented by an individual donor due to their sexual behaviour. He also states that according to the IBTS's own website, there is a window period following infection during which HIV and hepatitis may not be detected in the blood and that this window is seven days for HIV and 16 days for hepatitis. He claims that a far less onerous restriction could be imposed rather than the 12-month deferral, which would protect blood recipients. He claims the decision to place an "automatic deferral" on him is unlawful and in breach of EU law and European communities regulations on the quality and safety of human blood products and that the policy is disproportionate, discriminates against homosexual and bisexual men, and breaches his constitutional rights and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The case is due to return to the court in July 2019.

In July 2019, a gay man in Ireland filed two formal complaints with the European Commission against the Department of Health and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, and the Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service (the only part of the United Kingdom to maintain a 12-month deferral policy for MSM) over the MSM one-year deferral policy. The man, who has chosen to have his complaints examined by the Commission anonymously, is alleging the ban in both jurisdictions violates a number of European Union laws, including two European Union Directives covering the standards of quality and safety for the collection of blood by EU member states, as well as provisions contained in both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. The commission has informed the man his complaints will now be considered in light of EU law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gcn.ie/irish-man-files-formal-complaint-with-european-commission-over-gay-blood-ban/|title=Irish man files formal complaint with European Commission over gay blood ban|first=Peter|last=Dunne|website=GCN.ie|access-date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar policy exists in the rest of the European Union and is the prevailing interpretation of the European Union Directive 2004–33/EC article 2.1 on donor deferrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/c1r9rx5fc499m1rm/fulltext.pdf |title=Commission Directive 2004/33/EC of 22 March 2004 |publisher=Iospress.metapress.com |access-date=28 October 2013 |archive-date=29 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029210046/http://iospress.metapress.com/content/c1r9rx5fc499m1rm/fulltext.pdf |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, however, is not very specific and refers to "high-risk sexual contact". The UK interprets the directive to include all forms of homosexual sex as falling within 2.2.2 of Annex III to the directive "Persons whose behaviour or activity places them at risk of acquiring infectious diseases that may be transmitted by blood", requiring a deferral based on the window period for the diseases involved, and sets this at 12 months, despite the Annex suggesting 6 months for risk of exposure to hepatitis B. Hélder Trindade, President of the Portuguese Institute of Blood and Transplantation (IPST), stated in 2015 that sexually abstinent homosexuals may give blood, but that MSM is definitely seen as a risk factor.&lt;ref name=tvi24-29April2015a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/doar/homossexuais-so-podem-dar-sangue-em-abstinencia-sexual |title=Homosexuals may give blood if they abstain from sex (Homossexuais só podem dar sangue em abstinência sexual)|publisher=tvi24|language=pt|date=29 April 2015|access-date=5 November 2015|quote=The President of the Institute of Blood explains that "sexual contact by men with other men is definitely (seen) as a risk factor" (Presidente do Instituto do Sangue explica que "contacto sexual de homens com outros homens é definido como fator de risco")}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 28th of November 2022, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service introduced Individual Donor Risk Assessments and removed sexuality from the eligibility criteria. All potential donors including MSM are now asked about new sexual partners, of any gender, and are eligible to donate if they have had no new partners in the previous 4 months.

In Finland, the parliamentary ombudsman launched an investigation on the possible unconstitutionality of the lifetime ban in January 2006. In June 2008, it was concluded that the ban was not unlawful in Finland as it is based on "appropriately reasoned epidemiological information" and because it is related to sexual behaviour rather than sexual orientation. The ombudsman added that people over the age of 65 and people who lived in Britain during the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease) outbreak are also screened out during blood donor interviews. In December 2013, the Finnish Red Cross blood service announced it was lifting the ban and introducing a one-year deferral instead. In 2021, the deferral period in Finland was reduced to 4 months.

In July 2016, France implemented a 1-year deferral period policy on all gay and bisexual men donating blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/europe/france-gay-blood-donation.html|title=France to Lift Ban on Gay Men Donating Blood |work=The New York Times |date=4 November 2015 |access-date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the blood MSM deferral policy implemented in France was lowered to 4 months effective on 1 February 2020.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

=== New Zealand ===
At the formation of the [[New Zealand Blood Service]] (NZBS) in 1998, the deferral period had been 10 years but was reduced to 5 years in 2009. This was following an independent review of blood donation criteria in 2007–2008 which found no significant difference in risk of the blood supply for a deferral period of 5 years compared to 10 years.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/218/1386/file/NZBS%20Behavioural%20Donor%20Deferral%20Criteria%20Review%20%20Final%20Report%20April%202008.pdf|title=Behavioural Donor Deferral Criteria Review – Final Report to the New Zealand Blood Service|date=April 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029210122/http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/218/1386/file/NZBS%20Behavioural%20Donor%20Deferral%20Criteria%20Review%20%20Final%20Report%20April%202008.pdf|archive-date=29 October 2012|access-date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the NZBS dropped the ban period from 5 years to 1 year following the recommendation of [[Medsafe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/2/article_16184.php |title= New one year blood ban now in place |date= 15 December 2014 |access-date= 1 February 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150209102337/http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/2/article_16184.php |archive-date= 9 February 2015 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their decision was mainly caused by new information about HIV transmission in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sdgln.com/health/2014/12/15/new-zealand-new-1-year-blood-ban-now-place#sthash.7HLfyPIC.dpbs |date= 15 December 2014 |access-date= 1 February 2015|title=New Zealand: New one-year blood ban now in place|publisher=San Diego Gay and Lesbian News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which already had a one-year deferral period.

The 3 month deferral period for MSM is on par with the 3-month deferral period for several other behavioural categories carrying a higher probability of unrecognized HIV infection, such as persons engaging in sex work and people who have resided in a country that has a high (1% or more) HIV prevalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzblood.co.nz/assets/Uploads/Blood-Donation-2020-Community-Summary-and-QA.pdf|title=Saxton P. 2020.

====Current recommendations====
In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issues non-binding guidance for deferral of blood donations, though they are universally followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sircar |first1=Neiloy |title=Good Public Health Policy, Better Public Health Law: Blood Donation, Individual Risk Assessments, &amp; Lifting the Deferral for Men Who Have Sex With Men |journal=Food and Drug Law Journal |year=2018 |volume=73 |issue=1 |url=https://www.fdli.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sircar_73.1.pdf |access-date=15 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2023, the restrictions were updated to focus on behavior rather than sexual orientation or gender. People are ineligible to donate blood if they have:&lt;ref name="2023_recommendations"&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/media/164829/download Recommendations for Evaluating Donor Eligibility Using Individual Risk-Based Questions to Reduce the Risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNOS]] policies for [[organ donation]] allow for solid organs from MSM donors such as hearts, lungs, and kidneys to be used in transplant surgeries, though they require the hospital receiving the organ to be notified if the donor was an MSM within the past 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unos.org/PoliciesandBylaws2/policies/pdfs/policy_16.pdf |title=OPTN/UNOS POLICY 4 |access-date=20 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619200410/http://unos.org/PoliciesandBylaws2/policies/pdfs/policy_16.pdf |archive-date=19 June 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organs are generally used unless there is a clear positive test for a disease.

Donors of human cells and tissues other than organs, such as [[corneas]] or reproductive tissue like semen, are ineligible for five years after the most recent contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/biologics-guidances/tissue-guidances|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319073505/https://www.fda.gov/Cber/gdlns/tissdonor.htm#iv |url-status=dead |title=Tissue Guidances|first=Center for Biologics Evaluation and|last=Research|date=4 December 2020|archive-date=19 March 2008|journal=FDA|via=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[Corneal transplantation|corneal donations]], the five-year deferral policy in the United States and the similar 12-month deferral policy in Canada have the effect of preventing thousands of corneal donations annually.&lt;ref name="Association of Federal Regulations in the United States and Canada With Potential Corneal Donation by Men Who Have Sex With Men" /&gt;

==== History of FDA policy ====
* In 1983, two years after the discovery of [[HIV/AIDS in the United States]], the FDA guidelines were changed to lifetime donation ban for men having had sex with a man since 1977. The argument used to follow these policies is that blood should be collected from a population that is at low risk for the disease since the tests are not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded, and these population groups would be considered high risk.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Blood Donations from Men Who Have Sex with Other Men Questions and Answers (published: August 19th, 2013) |publisher=FDA.gov |url=https://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/bloodbloodproducts/questionsaboutblood/ucm108186.htm | access-date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, the [[AABB]], American Red Cross, and [[America's Blood Centers]] all supported a change from the current US policy of a lifetime deferral of MSM to one year since most recent contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/transcripts/2006-4206t1.pdf |format=133MB |title=Meeting of Blood Products Advisory Committee |date=9 March 2006 |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |page=66 |access-date=25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One model suggested that this change would result in one additional case of HIV transmitted by transfusion every 32.8 years. The AABB has suggested making this change since 1997. The FDA did not accept the proposal and had concerns about the data used to produce the model, citing that additional risk to recipients was not justified.
* On 19 August 2009, the Assembly Judiciary Committee in California passed AJR13, the U.S. Blood Donor Nondiscrimination Resolution, calling upon the FDA to end the MSM blood ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/?q=node/252 |title=Ending the Federal Ban on Gay Blood Donations |publisher=California Progress Report |date=19 August 2009 |access-date=20 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929002048/http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/?q=node%2F252 |archive-date=29 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2010, the [[New York City Council]] passed a resolution calling on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to eliminate the ban stating "This ban was based on prejudice, a knee-jerk reaction, and misunderstandings about the HIV/AIDS disease. Given the constant need for blood, it does not make common sense to prohibit donations from an entire population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.council.nyc.gov/d7/html/members/pdf/community_report_04.30.2010.pdf |title=Legislative and Community Report |date=30 April 2010 |publisher=[[New York City Council]] |location=New York |page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917172855/http://www.council.nyc.gov/d7/html/members/pdf/community_report_04.30.2010.pdf |archive-date=17 September 2011 |url-status=live |access-date=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 1 June 2010, the [[Council of the District of Columbia]] passed a resolution calling on the FDA to "reverse the lifetime deferment of blood donations by men who have had sex with men since 1977 in favor of a policy that protects the safety and integrity of the blood supply that is based on up-to-date scientific criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Notice/DownLoad.aspx?NoticeID=400045 |title=A Resolution 18-486 : In the Council of the District of Columbia |date=1 June 2010 |publisher=Dcregs.dc.gov |access-date=28 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202852/http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Notice/DownLoad.aspx?NoticeID=400045 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2013, the American Medical Association issued a statement calling on the FDA to change the policy, stating that "The lifetime ban on blood donation for men who have sex with men is discriminatory and not based on sound science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!-- no author listed --&gt; |date=18 June 2013 |title=AMA Adopts New Policies on the Second Day of Voting at Annual Meeting |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2013/2013-06-18-new-ama-policies-annual-meeting.page |access-date=16 January 2014 |work=ama-assn.org |publisher=[[American Medical Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohney"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/american-medical-association-opposes-fda-ban-gay-men/story?id=19436366 |title=FDA Ban on Gay Men as Blood Donors Opposed by American Medical Association |publisher=ABC News |last=Mohney|first=Gillian|date=20 June 2013 |access-date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2013, the [[American Osteopathic Association]] approved a policy calling on the FDA to "end the indefinite deferment period for Men who have sex with Men (MSM)", and to "modify the exclusion criteria for MSM to be consistent with deferrals for those judged to be at an increased risk of infection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/news-and-publications/media-center/2013-news-releases/Pages/HOD-2013-increase-number-of-eligible-blood-donors.aspx |title=American Osteopathic Association Calls for Removing FDA's Blood Donor Ban |publisher=Osteopathic.org |date=20 July 2013 |access-date=1 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821193753/http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/news-and-publications/media-center/2013-news-releases/Pages/HOD-2013-increase-number-of-eligible-blood-donors.aspx |archive-date=21 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 14 December 2015, Jordan Moll-Vigrass, Congressmen [[Brian Higgins]] and the [http://www.pridecenterwny.org/ Pride Center of Western New York] held a community rally in [[Buffalo, New York]], to rally against the FDA policy that bans blood donations by gay and bisexual men. Moll-Vigrass, who is openly gay and had been in a committed relationship for four years, was refused as a blood donor after disclosing his sexual orientation during the questionnaire screening process. Outraged by the federal policy and disappointed by being refused as a blood donor, Moll-Vigrass started to advocate for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wkbw.com/news/gay-man-fighting-for-right-to-give-blood|title=Gay man fighting for the right to give blood|last=Pasceri|first=Joanna|date=December 2015|publisher=[[WKBW-TV|WKBW]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The government's unfounded policy is hurtful to the people being turned away solely based on sexual orientation and the millions of others who will be in need of a lifesaving blood donation," said Higgins. "Eligibility should be based on risk-based science rather than outdated, fear-based speculation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Rally Against FDA|url=https://higgins.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/blood-is-blood-community-rally-against-the-fda-policy-banning-gay-blood|website=Congressmen Brian Higgins|date=14 December 2015}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 21 December 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration changed the policy by replacing the indefinite deferral with a 1-year deferral for MSM and women who have sex with MSM.&lt;ref name="Mohney" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629190236/https://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html |url-status=dead |title=1992 Recommendations for the prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products|website=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |archive-date=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change was proposed the previous July.&lt;ref name=FDAMay2015&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/UCM446580.pdf |title=Revised Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products |website=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |date=May 2015 |access-date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uippav&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/health/fda-lifting-ban-on-gay-blood-donors.html|title=F.D.A.

* On 27 May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved of a new blood donor history questionnaire for general use by blood establishments, which is compatible with the deferral for 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aabb.org/news-resources/resources/donor-history-questionnaires/blood-donor-history-questionnaires|title=Blood Donor History Questionnaires|website=Default}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this update, the approved questionnaires were compatible only with an indefinite deferral of blood donations from MSM.
* As of December 2016, the [[American Red Cross]] reports that MSM may be eligible to donate blood if they did not have sex with another man in more than 12 months. The American Red Cross reports that, in January 2017, the organization began donor reinstatement of MSM who were previously deferred from donating, and who later became qualified to donate blood in accordance with the new donation deferral period of 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-alphabetical.html|title=Eligibility Criteria Alphabetical Listing|website=redcrossblood.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Red Cross website specifies that this 12-month deferral does also apply to [[transgender men]] who have sex with men, but does not apply to [[transgender women]] who have sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/lgbtq-donors|title=LGBTQ+ Donors|publisher=American Red Cross|access-date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Current guidance was issued in May 2023

=== Australia ===
Australia implemented a 12-month deferral in 1999; a comparison of confirmed HIV positive blood donations before and after the change did not see a statistically significant difference.&lt;ref name="Seed" /&gt; The [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service]] pushed to have the deferral period lowered from twelve to six months, however it was rejected by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA) in 2014. In April 2020 the TGA revised the deferral period for MSM down to three months. The revision requires approval of the federal, state and territory governments before it can go into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starobserver.com.au/news/tga-approves-lowering-of-blood-donation-deferral-period/194268|title=TGA approves lowering of blood donation deferral period|work=Star Observer|date=15 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donateblood.com.au/who-can-give/faq#faq_294|title=FAQs – Who can give|publisher=Australian Red Cross Blood Service|date=18 April 2012|access-date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifeblood's new 3-month deferral period rules went into effect on 31 January 2021.&lt;ref name=postponements&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.donateblood.com.au/postponements |website=Australian Red Cross Lifeblood |title=Postponements |access-date=6 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesperson said they empathise with those who cannot give blood.&lt;ref name=eased&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.starobserver.com.au/news/gay-blood-donation-restrictions-to-be-eased/198046 |work=Star Observer |title=Gay Blood Donation Restrictions to be Eased |first=Annie |last=Lewis |date=15 October 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasoning for the restrictions ==
Blood services first and foremost must ensure that all blood received for donation is safe for transfusion purposes. This is achieved by screening potential donors for high risk behaviours through questionnaires and interviews before blood is taken, and subsequent laboratory testing on samples of donated blood.

Blood services commonly justify their bans against MSM due to the marginal increase in the risk for transfusion-transmitted HIV.&lt;ref&gt;Davison KL, Conti S,  Brailsford SR.  The risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV from blood donations of men who have sex with men, 12 months after last sex with a man: 2005–2007 estimates from England and Wales. Vox Sang. 2013;105: 85–8&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups with similar restrictions, or complete prohibition to donate blood, due to increased or possible risk for certain infectious diseases include intravenous drug users, recipients of animal organs or tissues, and those who have traveled or lived abroad in certain countries.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Blood donations from men who have sex with other men questions and answers. Accessed at http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/bloodbloodproducts/questionsaboutblood/ucm108186.htm on 10 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, when the HIV/AIDS epidemic outbreak occurred, there was a high prevalence of the disease in MSM and no reliable tests for the virus, which justified blanket bans on blood donations from high-risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;Karamitros, G., Kitsos, N., &amp; Karamitrou, I. (2017). The ban on blood donation on men who have sex with men: time to rethink and reassess an outdated policy. ''The Pan African medical journal'', ''27'', 99. doi:10.11604/pamj.2017.27.99.12891&lt;/ref&gt;

These restrictions are similar to current restrictions on people with certain residence in the United Kingdom, France, or Saudi Arabia during the height of the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] ("mad cow disease") epidemic of 1980 through 1996, due to the absence of a test for its human form, [[variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (vCJD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1016/S1471-4914(02)02361-4|title = Blood-bank testing for infectious diseases: How safe is blood transfusion?|year = 2002|last1 = Strong|first1 = D.Michael|last2 = Katz|first2 = Louis|journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine|volume = 8|issue = 7|pages = 355–358|pmid = 12114117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, early tests using the [[ELISA]] method looked for antibodies, which are the immune system's response to the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Bill D.|date=Spring 1994|title=HIV Antibody Testing Methods|url=https://aaimedicine.org/journal-of-insurance-medicine/jim/1994/026-01-0013.pdf|journal=Update on HIV/AIDS|volume=26|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a [[window period]] when using this method in which a person who has been infected with HIV is able to spread the disease but may test negative for the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wwwn.cdc.gov/hivrisk/how_know/window_period.html|title=The Window Period {{!}} HIV Risk Reduction Tool {{!}} CDC|publisher=Centres for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=19 November 2019|archive-date=11 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111121351/https://wwwn.cdc.gov/hivrisk/how_know/window_period.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdnaids.ca/hiv-testing/|title=HIV testing|date=29 November 2016|website=Canadian AIDS Society|language=en-US|access-date=19 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This window period can be as long as three to six months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfaf.org/aids101/hiv_testing.html#window |title=San Francisco AIDS Foundation: HIV Testing |publisher=Sfaf.org |access-date=20 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807183212/http://www.sfaf.org/aids101/hiv_testing.html#window |archive-date=7 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average of 22 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01140.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221174758/https://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01140.html |url-status=dead |title=FDA Approves First Nucleic Acid Test (Nat) System To Screen Whole Blood Donors For Infections With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (Hiv) And Hepatitis C Virus (Hcv)|website=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |archive-date=21 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests using the ELISA methods are often still used in developed countries because of their ease-of-use, as well as their fairly high [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]], which boasts 100% sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=kb-02-02-01#S4X|title=HIV Antibody Assays|website=hivinsite.ucsf.edu|access-date=19 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711123739/http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=kb-02-02-01#S4X|archive-date=11 July 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Desai|first1=Darash|last2=Wu|first2=Grace|last3=Zaman|first3=Muhammad H.|date=21 January 2011|title=Tackling HIV through Robust Diagnostics in the Developing World: Current Status and Future Opportunities|journal=Lab on a Chip|volume=11|issue=2|pages=194–211|doi=10.1039/c0lc00340a|issn=1473-0197|pmc=5181793|pmid=21125097}}&lt;/ref&gt; To cover the window period resultant from the use of these tests, donors are also screened for high risk behaviours, one of which is a history of same-sex sexual activity among male potential donors.&lt;ref&gt;O’Brien SF, Ram SS, Yi QL, Goldman M.

Risks are also associated with a non-MSM donors testing positive for HIV, which can have major implications as the donor's last donation could have been given within the window period for testing and could have entered the blood supply, potentially infecting blood product recipients. An incident in 2003 in New Zealand saw a non-MSM donor testing positive for HIV and subsequently all blood products made with the donor's last blood donation had to be recalled. This included NZ$4 million worth of [[Factor VIII]], a blood clotting factor used to treat hemophiliacs which is manufactured from large pools of donated plasma, and subsequently led to a nationwide shortage of Factor VIII and the deferral of non-emergency surgery on hemophiliac patients, costing the health sector millions of dollars more.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview" /&gt; Screening out those at high risk of blood borne diseases, including MSM, reduces the potential frequency and impact of such incidents.

== Criticism of the restrictions ==
=== Need for blood ===
Objections to the restrictions, including those from the American Medical Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.page|title=Policies on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender &amp; Queer (LGBTQ) Issues – AMA|website=ama-assn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Red Cross, are generally based on the idea that improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV to an acceptable level. Blood shortages are common, and advocates for change to the policies point out that excluding healthy donors only makes the problem worse. In 2018, approximately 10,000 donations were still urgently needed by 10 March to continue to meet patients' needs. However, Canadian Blood Services noted that the national inventory and days on hand of several blood groups remain at critically low levels. Less than four per cent of eligible donors give blood each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blood.ca/en/media/donate-now-urgent-need-blood-across-canada-continues|title=Donate now: urgent need for blood across Canada continues {{!}} Canadian Blood Services|website=blood.ca|access-date=2 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Need for corneas ===
[[Corneal transplantation|Corneal transplant surgery]] can cure blindness caused by corneal disease. However, there is a global shortage of corneal donations, severely limiting the availability of corneal transplants across most of the world. A 2016 study found that 12.7 million visually impaired people were in need of a corneal transplant, with only 1 cornea available for every 70 needed.&lt;ref name="Global Survey of Corneal Transplantation and Eye Banking"&gt;Gain P, Jullienne R, He Z, et al. Global Survey of Corneal Transplantation and Eye Banking. JAMA Ophthalmol. 2016;134(2):167–173. doi:10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2015.4776&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have years-long waitlists for corneal transplant surgery due to the shortage of donated corneas.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer L. Corneal transplant wait list varies across Canada. CMAJ. 2013;185(11):E511-E512. doi:10.1503/cmaj.109-4517&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hara |last1=Hidetaka |last2=Cooper |first2=David KC |title=Xenotransplantation: the future of corneal transplantation? |journal=Cornea |year=2011 |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=371–378 |doi=10.1097/ICO.0b013e3181f237ef|pmid=21099407 |pmc=3081421 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there has never been a reported case of HIV transmission through corneal transplant surgery, and even though all donated corneas are screened for the presence of HIV through antibody or nucleic acid testing, many countries continue to ban MSM corneal donors.&lt;ref name="Association of Federal Regulations in the United States and Canada With Potential Corneal Donation by Men Who Have Sex With Men" /&gt;

=== Risk of STD transmission ===
In [[#Europe|some European countries]], high-risk sexual intercourses lead to a temporary ban, regardless of the sex of the partner. In fact, advocates for change in other countries note that the ban encompasses all same-sex sexual contact, even if the partner's HIV status is shown beyond doubt to be negative. Advocates for change point out that a promiscuous straight male is a higher-risk donor than a gay or bisexual man in a monogamous relationship, but the former will usually be allowed to donate blood. Furthermore, in some countries, other high-risk activities determine a temporary ban, such as sexual contact with anyone who has used needles to take drugs not prescribed by their doctor, whereas MSM donors are deferred indefinitely.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blood.ca/en/blood/am-i-eligible/men-who-have-sex-men|title=Men who have sex with men {{!}} Canadian Blood Services|website=blood.ca|access-date=3 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roots in discrimination ===
Many [[LGBT]] organizations view the restrictions on donation as based on [[homophobia]] and not based on valid medical concern since donations are rigorously [[HIV test|tested]] to rule out donors that are infected with known viruses such as [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]], [[hepatitis B]], and [[hepatitis C]]. They state the deferrals are based on stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Schoettes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Schoettes |first=Scott |date=December 2012 |title=Blood Donations Questions |newspaper=Adelante Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism regarding reform of MSM donor policies ==
Advocates worldwide for change to MSM prohibitions point out that screening of donors should focus on sexual behaviour as well as [[safe sex]] practices since many MSM may always have protected sex, be [[monogamy|monogamous]], or be in other low risk categories.&lt;ref name="Schoettes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013" /&gt; Some groups in favor of lifting the restrictions support a waiting period after the blood is donated when the donor is considered to have had behaviour considered higher risk, and before it is used, to match the blood bank's window of testing methods.&lt;ref name="Schoettes" /&gt; While HIV is reliably detected in 10 to 14 days with RNA testing, older testing methods provide accuracy for only up to 98% of positive cases after three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |year=2014 |title=HIV Test Window Periods |url=http://www.sfaf.org/hiv-info/testing/hiv-test-window-periods.html |access-date=19 February 2015 |website=San Francisco AIDS Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student and faculty activism on campuses ===
'''In Canada'''
* The students association at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], voted in 2012 to maintain a ban on blood clinics on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2012/07/10/ottawa-carleton-university-students-ban-blood-clinics-gay-man-policy.html |title=Blood clinic ban on campus upheld due to policy on gay men|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In the United States'''&lt;ref name="FDA" /&gt;
* In 2005, a student activist at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) filed a complaint with the university's Office of Affirmative Action, contending that American Red Cross blood drives on campus violated UVM's non-discrimination policy. The office recommended that the university no longer allow the Red Cross to conduct blood drives on campus, but the UVM administration rejected the recommendation, stating that it would not be in the interests of public health. Student and LGBT activism on the issue continued at UVM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Picard|url=http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/queer-community-seeing-red-over-blood-donation-policy/Content?oid=2128682|title=Queer Community Seeing Red Over Blood-Donation Policy|newspaper=[[Seven Days (newspaper)|Seven Days]]|date=18 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the UVM Student Government Associated voted down, by a 16–15 vote, a nonbinding resolution calling on the university to ban blood drives over the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071018/NEWS03/710180365/1004/NEWS03 |title=UVM student government rejects ban on Red Cross blood drives |date=18 October 2007 |website=Rutland Herald |access-date=12 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808203842/http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071018%2FNEWS03%2F710180365%2F1004%2FNEWS03 |archive-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2013, a group of [[University of Michigan]] students favoring a loosening of the MSM blood-donation policy started a "Bleeding for Equality" initiative in which individuals ineligible to donate because of the policy would bring eligible individuals to donate on their behalf, so as to both promote blood donation and also demonstrate that the amount of additional blood that could potentially be collected if the policy changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloodbattle.org/|title=Blood Battle|website=Blood Battle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Betsy | last1=Gast | first2=Chelsea | last2=Fournier|url=http://michigandaily.com/opinion/10viewpoint-blood-battle21|title=Viewpoint: Ending a discriminatory blood policy|work=The Michigan Daily|date=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Michigan Daily]]'', the student newspaper of the University of Michigan, editorialized in favor of a loosening of the MSM blood donation policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michigandaily.com/opinion/10daily-blood-battle-equality23|title=Editorial: The battle for donor equality|newspaper=The Michigan Daily|date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
