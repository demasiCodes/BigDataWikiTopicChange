The '''men who have sex with men blood donor controversy''' is the dispute over prohibitions on donations of [[blood donation|blood]] or tissue for [[organ transplant]]s from [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), a classification of men who engage (or have engaged in the past) in sex with other men, regardless of whether they identify themselves as [[bisexual]], [[gay]], or otherwise.  Opposition to the prohibition is frequently addressed in terms of bisexual and gay men.  Restrictions on donors are sometimes called "deferrals", since blood donors who are found ineligible may be found eligible at a later date.  Many deferrals are indefinite, however, meaning that these blood donors may or may not be accepted at any point in the future.  The restrictions vary from country to country, and in many cases, men are deferred even though they always have protected sex or have not had sex with men for many years.  The restrictions affect these men, and, in some cases, any female sex partners. They do not otherwise affect other women, including [[women who have sex with women]]. Opponents of many of the deferrals argue that these policies are not supported by medical science,&lt;ref name=Schoettes&gt;{{cite news|last=Schoettes|first=Scott|title=Blood Donations Questions|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=Adelante Magazine|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Candidate|first=Li Zhou, MPA|last2=Candidate|first2=R.T.

Many [[LGBT]] organizations view the restrictions on donation as based on [[homophobia]] and not based on valid medical concern since donations are rigorously [[HIV test|tested]] to rule out donors that are infected with known viruses such as [[HIV]], [[Hepatitis B]], and [[Hepatitis C]]. They state the deferrals are based on stereotypes.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt; Proponents of the lifetime restriction defend it because of the risk of false negative test results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-stier/blood-for-sale_b_52046.html |title=Blood for Sale |accessdate=5 April 2008 |last=Stier|first=Jeff |date=13 June 2007 |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because the MSM population in developed countries tends to have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection.&lt;ref name="unaids2006"&gt;UNAIDS 2006 report on the global AIDS epidemic, [http://data.unaids.org/pub/GlobalReport/2006/2006_GR_CH05_en.pdf Chapter 05], June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government advisory committee, SABTO, states that the risk of transfusion of HIV infected blood would increase if MSM were allowed to donate blood.&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |title=Homosexual men allowed to give blood but sex banned for decade |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of prohibitions against MSM point out that screening of donors should focus on sexual behavior as well as [[safe sex]] practices since many MSM may always have protected sex, be [[monogamy|monogamous]], or be in other low risk categories.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1aug2013" /&gt; Some groups in favor of lifting the restrictions support a waiting period after the blood is donated when the donor is considered to have had behavior considered higher risk, and before it is used, to match the blood bank's window of testing methods.&lt;ref name=Schoettes/&gt;  Depending on the testing method used, the window to detect HIV can be as short as 9 to 14 days (RNA testing), or as long as three months (serology testing method). However, there is a small percentage of the population at 3% who still will not test positive after 3 months with serology testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sfaf.org/hiv-info/testing/hiv-test-window-periods.html|title = HIV Test Window Periods|date = 2014|accessdate = 19 February 2015|website = San Francisco AIDS Foundation|publisher = San Francisco AIDS Foundation|last = |first =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS==
{{Main article|Men who have sex with men#HIV/AIDS}}
In many developed countries HIV is more prevalent among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) than among the general population.&lt;ref name="unaids2006"/&gt;

In the United States in 2005, MSM, [[African Americans]], and persons engaging in high-risk heterosexual behavior accounted for respectively 49%, 49%, and 32% of new HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;CDC [http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/statistics_2005_hiv_surveillance_report_vol_17.pdf HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report: HIV Infection and AIDS in the United States and Dependent Areas, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 in the United States, African Americans accounted for 47.9% of new HIV diagnoses reported that year, but represented approximately only 12% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/america.htm|title=HIV and AIDS in America|publisher=avert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notes====
* {{note|a|A}}In Israel, MSMs can donate blood for medical science experiments.  However, they cannot result in a standard blood transfusion unless last MSM activity was before 1977.
* {{note|b|B}} In Switzerland, a deferral period of 1 year will go into effect from January 1, 2017.&lt;ref name="thelocal.ch"/&gt;
* {{note|c|C}} In Ireland, a deferral period of 1 year will go into effect from January 16, 2017.

===United States===
In the US, the current guidance from the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) is to defer any male donor who has had sex with another man (MSM) in the past year. This has been so since December 2015.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/fda-eases-restrictions-blood-donations-gay-men-35888660|title=Health Index|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female sexual partners of MSM are deferred for one year since the last exposure. This is the same policy used for any sexual partner of someone in a high risk group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html 1992 Recommendations for the prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629190236/http://www.fda.gov/oashi/aids/1992policy.html |date=29 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument used to follow these policies is that blood should be collected from a population that is at low risk for disease, since the tests are not perfect and human error may lead to infected units not being properly discarded, and these population groups would be considered a high risk. The policy was first put in place in 1983 by the FDA, which regulates blood donations to profit and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web | title=Blood Donations from Men Who Have Sex with Other Men Questions and Answers (published: August 19th, 2013) |publisher=FDA.gov |url=http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/bloodbloodproducts/questionsaboutblood/ucm108186.htm | accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donors of what the FDA calls "HCT/P's", a category that includes transplants (other than organs) and some reproductive tissue, notably anonymous semen donations, are ineligible for five years after the most recent contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Cber/gdlns/tissdonor.htm#iv FDA/CBER - Guidance for Industry: Eligibility Determination for Donors of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319073505/http://www.fda.gov/Cber/gdlns/tissdonor.htm#iv |date=19 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[UNOS]] policies for [[Organ donation]] require the hospital receiving the organ to be notified if the donor was an MSM within the past 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unos.org/PoliciesandBylaws2/policies/pdfs/policy_16.pdf |title=OPTN/UNOS POLICY 4 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organs are generally used unless there is a clear positive test for a disease.  The one year deferral was approved by the FDA on December 21, 2015, replacing a lifetime ban on donations from MSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/12/21/fda-officially-alters-decades-old-ban-on-blood-donations-from-gay-and-bisexual-men/|title=FDA: Gay men can once again donate blood in U.S., if they haven’t had sex for a year|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History of calls to change the policy====

* In 2006, the [[AABB]], [[American Red Cross]], and [[America's Blood Centers]] all supported a change from the current US policy of a lifetime deferral of MSM to one year since most recent contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/transcripts/2006-4206t1.pdf |format=133MB |title=Meeting of Blood Products Advisory Committee |date=9 March 2006 |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |page=66 |accessdate=25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One model suggested that this change would result in one additional case of HIV transmitted by transfusion every 32.8 years. The AABB has suggested making this change since 1997. The FDA did not accept the proposal and had concerns about the data used to produce the model, citing that additional risk to recipients was not justified.
* On 19 August 2009, the Assembly Judiciary Committee in California passed AJR13, the U.S. Blood Donor Nondiscrimination Resolution, calling upon the FDA to end the MSM blood ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/?q=node/252 |title=Ending the Federal Ban on Gay Blood Donations |publisher=California Progress Report |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2010, the [[New York City Council]] passed a resolution calling on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to eliminate the ban stating "This ban was based on prejudice, a knee-jerk reaction, and misunderstandings about the HIV/AIDS disease. Given the constant need for blood, it does not make common sense to prohibit donations from an entire population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.council.nyc.gov/d7/html/members/pdf/community_report_04.30.2010.pdf |title=Legislative and Community Report |date=30 April 2010 |publisher=[[New York City Council]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |page=2 |format=PDF |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5y5nQs7v6 |archivedate=20 April 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 1 June 2010, the [[Council of the District of Columbia]] passed a resolution calling on the FDA to "reverse the lifetime deferment of blood donations by men who have had sex with men since 1977 in favor of a policy that protects the safety and integrity of the blood supply that is based on an up-to-date scientific criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Notice/DownLoad.aspx?NoticeID=400045 |title=A Resolution 18-486 : In the Council of the District of Columbia |date=1 June 2010 |publisher=Dcregs.dc.gov |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2013, the American Medical Association issued a statement calling on the FDA to change the policy, stating that "The lifetime ban on blood donation for men who have sex with men is discriminatory and not based on sound science."&lt;ref&gt;
*{{cite web |url= http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2013/2013-06-18-new-ama-policies-annual-meeting.page |title=AMA Adopts New Policies on Second Day of Voting at Annual Meeting |author=no author listed |work=ama-assn.org |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |date=18 June 2013|accessdate=16 January 2014}}

* In July 2013, the [[American Osteopathic Association]] approved a policy calling on the FDA to "end the indefinite deferment period for Men who have sex with Men (MSM)", and to "modify the exclusion criteria for MSM to be consistent with deferrals for those judged to be at an increased risk of infection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/news-and-publications/media-center/2013-news-releases/Pages/HOD-2013-increase-number-of-eligible-blood-donors.aspx |title=American Osteopathic Association Calls for Removing FDA's Blood Donor Ban |publisher=Osteopathic.org |date=20 July 2013 |accessdate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On December 21, 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration changed the policy by replacing the indefinite deferral with a 1-year deferral.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt; The change was proposed the previous July.&lt;ref name=FDAMay2015&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/UCM446580.pdf |title=Revised Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission by Blood and Blood Products |date=May 2015 |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uippav&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/health/fda-lifting-ban-on-gay-blood-donors.html|title=F.D.A. Easing Ban on Gays, to Let Some Give Blood|author=Sabrina Tavernise|publisher=New York Times|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, as of September 2016, the [[American Red Cross]] reports that the organization is not accepting blood donations from men who have had sex with men since 1977, because putting the relevant 2015 amendment to the FDA's donor acceptance guidelines into effect continues to require training and computer upgrades for which several months are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood/eligibility-requirements/eligibility-criteria-topic|title=Eligibility Criteria by Topic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On May 27, 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved of a new blood donor history questionnaire for general use by blood establishments, which is compatible with the deferral for 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aabb.org/tm/questionnaires/Pages/dhqaabb.aspx|title=Blood Donor History Questionnaires|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this update, the approved questionnaires were compatible only with an indefinite deferral of blood donations from MSM.

===European Union===
Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Russia and Spain are the only European countries that don't discriminate when it comes to blood donation. The donation is allowed if the donor hasn't had a risky sexual encounter, but not depending on the sexual orientation of the donor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.donarsangre.org/informacion-basica-para-donantes/&lt;/ref&gt;
The UK lifted its lifetime ban on MSM blood donation in September 2011 (2016 in Northern Ireland),&lt;ref name="SaBTO" /&gt; and changed the policy to simply restrict men who have had sex with another man within the previous 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waygood |first=James |url=http://sosogay.org/2011/government-announces-end-of-lifetime-ban-on-gay-blood-donation/ |title=UK Government lifts lifetime ban on gay blood donation |publisher=So So Gay |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended the policy change after a study concluded that a total ban may breach equality legislation and that the risk of HIV reaching the blood supply would only increase by approximately 2%.&lt;ref name = ukbanlift&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/8441054/Homosexual-men-allowed-to-give-blood-but-sex-banned-for-decade.html |title=Homosexual men allowed to give blood but sex banned for decade |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland, any [[Men who have sex with men|man who has ever had oral or anal sex with another man]] (MSM) is strictly banned from donating blood until 16 January 2017, when MSM donors will then have to abstain from oral or anal sex with other men for at least twelve months before donating blood. On 27 July 2015, Tomás Heneghan, a 23-year-old student and journalist from Galway began a legal challenge in the High Court against the permanent deferral imposed on MSM donors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thejournal.ie/gay-blood-ban-tomas-heneghan-2240158-Jul2015/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/gay-man-brings-legal-challenge-over-blood-donation-ban-1.2298825&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He claims this is in breach of EU law. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a “window period” in which infections are sometimes not detected. Heneghan's previous sexual activity posed no risk of infection, according to HSE-approved advice and he said the service had no evidence upon which it could legitimately impose a life-long ban on him donating blood. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12 month ban. Later that week the Minister for Health Simon Harris agreed to the recommendations and announced the reduction would take place. However no timeline was reported for the implementation of the new policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0623/797739-blood-donation/|title=IBTS votes to end ban on gay men donating blood|website=RTE.ie|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26th July 2016 Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/gay-man-drops-challenge-to-blood-donation-ban-after-change-in-policy-announced-by-health-minister-34913345.html|title=Gay man drops challenge to blood donation ban after change in policy announced by Health Minister - Independent.ie|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heneghan then wrote about his experiences of challenging the ban in a number of national media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/toms-heneghan-on-his-high-court-case-why-was-i-shaming-the-family-why-was-my-sex-life-being-opened-up-to-public-scrutiny-34917487.html|title=Tomás Heneghan on his High Court case: Why was I shaming the family?

A similar policy exists in the rest of the European Union and is the prevailing interpretation of the European Union Directive 2004/33/EC article 2.1 on donor deferrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/c1r9rx5fc499m1rm/fulltext.pdf |title=Commission Directive 2004/33/EC of 22 March 2004 |publisher=Iospress.metapress.com |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, however, is not very specific and refers to "high risk sexual contact."  The UK interprets the directive to include all forms of homosexual sex as falling within 2.2.2 of Annex III to the directive "Persons whose behaviour or activity places them at risk of acquiring  infectious diseases that may be transmitted by blood", requiring a deferral based on the window period for the diseases involved, and sets this at 12 months, despite the Annex suggesting 6 months for risk of exposure to Hepatitis B. Hélder Trindade, President of the Portuguese Institute of Blood and Transplantation (IPST), stated in 2015 that sexually abstinent homosexuals may give blood, but that MSM is definitely seen as a risk factor.&lt;ref name=tvi24-29April2015a&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/sociedade/doar/homossexuais-so-podem-dar-sangue-em-abstinencia-sexual |title=Homosexuals may give blood if they abstain from sex (Homossexuais só podem dar sangue em abstinência sexual)|publisher=tvi24|language=Portuguese|date=29 April 2015|accessdate=5 November 2015|quote=The President of the Institute of Blood explains that "sexual contact by men with other men is definitely (seen) as a risk factor" (Presidente do Instituto do Sangue explica que "contacto sexual de homens com outros homens é definido como fator de risco")}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Finland, the parliamentary ombudsman launched an investigation on the possible unconstitutionality of the lifetime ban in January 2006. In June 2008, it was concluded that the ban was not unlawful in Finland as it is based on "appropriately reasoned epidemiological information" and because it is related to sexual behaviour rather than sexual orientation. The ombudsman added that people over the age of 65 and people who lived in Britain during the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease) outbreak are also screened out during blood donor interviews. In December 2013, the Finnish Red Cross blood service announced it was lifting the ban and introducing a one-year deferral instead.

Since July 10, 2016, France implemented a 1-year deferral period policy on all gay and bisexual men donating blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/world/europe/france-gay-blood-donation.html|title=France to Lift Ban on Gay Men Donating Blood |publisher=New York Times |date=November 4, 2015 |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Australia's individual states and territories each had their own [[Australian Red Cross Blood Service|policies on blood donations by MSM]]. Most previously had some form of the indefinite deferral, and they all changed to a 12-month deferral at different times between 1996 ([[South Australia|SA]]) and 2000 ([[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], [[New South Wales|NSW]]).&lt;ref name = "Seed" /&gt;

A comparison of confirmed HIV positive blood donations before and after the change did not see a statistically significant difference. In all of the cases of HIV positive donations associated with MSM after the 12-month deferral, the donors had lied about their medical history and would not have been eligible under either criterion.&lt;ref name = "Seed" /&gt;

===New Zealand===
Since 2009, the [[New Zealand Blood Service]] (NZBS) had deferred males who have had oral or anal intercourse, with or without protection, with another male for five years. From the formation of the NZBS in 1998 to 2009, the deferral period had been ten years, but reduced to five years following an independent review of blood donation criteria in 2007-8 which found no significant difference in risk to the blood supply for deferral periods of five years compared to ten years.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/content/download/218/1386/file/NZBS%20Behavioural%20Donor%20Deferral%20Criteria%20Review%20%20Final%20Report%20April%202008.pdf |title= Behavioural Donor Deferral Criteria Review - Final Report to the New Zealand Blood Service |date= April 2008 |accessdate= 20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the NZBS dropped the ban period from 5 years to one year following the recommendation of [[Medsafe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/2/article_16184.php |title= New one year blood ban now in place |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their decision was mainly caused by recently gained facts about HIV transmission in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sdgln.com/health/2014/12/15/new-zealand-new-1-year-blood-ban-now-place#sthash.7HLfyPIC.dpbs |date= 15 December 2014 |accessdate= 1 February 2015|title=New Zealand: New one-year blood ban now in place|publisher=San Diego Gay and Lesbian News}}&lt;/ref&gt; which already had a one-year deferral. The new 1 year deferral has been in effect since 15 December 2014.

The one year deferral period for MSM is on par with the one year deferral period for persons engaging in prostitution outside of New Zealand and people who have resided in a country which has a high (1% or more) HIV prevalence. Females who engage in sexual intercourse with a male who has had sex with another male are also deferred for twelve months.&lt;ref name="NZBS-safeblood"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzblood.co.nz/Give-blood/Donating/Detailed-eligibility-criteria |title= Detailed Eligibility Criteria |publisher= New Zealand Blood Service |accessdate= 21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning for the restrictions==
Blood services first and foremost must ensure that all blood received for donation is safe for transfusion purposes. This is achieved by screening potential donors for high risk behaviors through questionnaires and interviews before blood is taken, and subsequent laboratory testing on samples of donated blood.

Blood services commonly justify their bans against MSM using the statistically higher prevalence of HIV and hepatitis of MSM in population studies.

In the earliest years of the AIDS epidemic, there were no reliable tests for the virus, which justified blanket bans on blood donations from groups at high risk of acquiring or having HIV, including MSM. These restrictions are similar to present-day restrictions in most countries on people residing in the United Kingdom during the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] ("mad cow disease") epidemic of the 1980s and early-to-mid 1990s, due to the absence of a test for its human form, [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (vCJD).

In 1985, early tests using the [[ELISA]] method looked for antibodies, which are the immune system's response to the virus. However, there is a [[window period]] when using this method in which a person who has been infected with HIV is able to spread the disease but may test negative for the virus. This window period can be as long as three to six months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfaf.org/aids101/hiv_testing.html#window |title=San Francisco AIDS Foundation: HIV Testing |publisher=Sfaf.org |date= |accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average of 22 days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01140.html FDA Approves First Nucleic Acid Test (Nat) System To Screen Whole Blood Donors For Infections With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (Hiv) And Hepatitis C Virus (Hcv)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221174758/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2002/ANS01140.html |date=21 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests using the ELISA methods are often still used in developed countries because they are highly [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. In developing countries, these tests are often the only method used to screen donated blood for HIV. To cover the window period resultant from the use of these tests, donors are also screened for high risk behaviors, one of which is a history of same-sex sexual activity among male potential donors. Other groups with similar restrictions include commercial sex workers, injecting drug users, and people resident in countries with a high HIV prevalence (such as sub-Saharan Africa). Newer tests look for the virus itself, such as the [[p24 antigen]] test, which looks for a part on the surface of the virus, and [[Nucleic acid tests]] (NAT), which look for the genetic material of the virus. With these tests, the window period is shorter, with an average duration of 12 days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Fourth generation combination HIV tests are conclusive at 3 months, and Hepatitis B tests are conclusive at 6 months.

Risks are also associated with a regular donor testing positive for HIV, which can have major implications as the donor's last donation could have been given within the window period for testing and could have entered the blood supply, potentially infecting blood product recipients. An incident in 2003 in New Zealand saw a regular donor testing positive for HIV and subsequently all blood products made with the donor's last blood donation had to be recalled. This included NZ$4 million worth of [[Factor VIII]], a blood clotting factor used to treat haemophiliacs which is manufactured from large pools of donated plasma, and subsequently led to a nationwide shortage of Factor VIII and the deferral of non-emergency surgery on haemophiliac patients, costing the health sector millions of dollars more.&lt;ref name="NZBS-criteriareview" /&gt; Screening out those at high risk of bloodborne diseases, including MSM, reduces the potential frequency and impact of such incidents.

==Criticism of the restrictions==
Objections to the restrictions, including those from the American Medical Association(indefinite deferral)&lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/about-ama/our-people/member-groups-sections/glbt-advisory-committee/ama-policy-regarding-sexual-orientation.page?&lt;/ref&gt; and Red Cross, are generally based on the idea that improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV to an acceptable level. Blood shortages are common, and opponents of the policies point out that excluding healthy donors only makes the problem worse. "Ideal" inventories are at least a three-day supply, but many blood centers struggle to meet this demand.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Further opposition stems from the fact that the ban is a blanket ban encompassing all men who have had sex with another man, even with protection and even if the HIV status of these men's partners is shown beyond doubt to be negative. Opponents point out that a promiscuous straight male is a higher-risk donor than a gay or bisexual man in a monogamous relationship, but the former will usually be allowed to donate blood. Furthermore, other high-risk activities such as having sexual contact with anyone who has used needles to take drugs not prescribed by their doctor have a set deferral period before the donor is allowed to donate blood, whereas in some countries MSM donors are deferred indefinitely. Female donors who have sexual contact with MSM are sometimes deferred temporarily.

Following [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting|a mass shooting targeting a gay nightclub]] in June 2016, there were reported expressions of frustration and disapproval by a number of gay and bisexual men who were forbidden to donate blood to victims, with LGBT activists across the country and a group of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] lawmakers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barron-Lopez |first=Laura |date=June 13, 2016 |title=Democrats Call On FDA To End Ban On Blood Donations From Gay Men |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-blood-donations-gay_us_575ed49ce4b0ced23ca8b4b3 |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging the ban to be lifted.

==Activism in favor of reform of MSM donor policies==

===Student and faculty activism on campuses===
'''In Canada'''
* The students association at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]] voted in 2012 to maintain a ban on blood clinics on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2012/07/10/ottawa-carleton-university-students-ban-blood-clinics-gay-man-policy.html |title=Blood clinic ban on campus upheld due to policy on gay men|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In the United States'''

*In 2005, a student activist at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) filed a complaint with the university's Office of Affirmative Action, contending that American Red Cross blood drives on campus violated UVM's non-discrimination policy.  The office recommended that the university no longer allow the Red Cross to conduct blood drives on campus, but the UVM administration rejected the recommendation, stating that is would not be in the interests of public health. Student and LGBT activism on the issue continued at UVM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Picard|url=http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/queer-community-seeing-red-over-blood-donation-policy/Content?oid=2128682|title=Queer Community Seeing Red Over Blood-Donation Policy|newspaper=[[Seven Days (newspaper)|Seven Days]]|date=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the UVM Student Government Associated voted down, by a 16-15 vote, a nonbinding resolution calling on the university to ban blood drives over the policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071018/NEWS03/710180365/1004/NEWS03 UVM student government rejects ban on Red Cross blood drives], Associated Press (October 18, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2013, a group of [[University of Michigan]] students favoring a loosening of the MSM blood-donation policy started a "“Bleeding for Equality" initiative in which individuals ineligible to donate because of the policy would bring eligible individuals to donate on their behalf, so as to both promote blood donation and also demonstrate that the amount of additional blood that could potentially be collected if the policy changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloodbattle.org/|title=Blood Battle at the University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Betsy Gast &amp; Chelsea Fournier|url=http://michigandaily.com/opinion/10viewpoint-blood-battle21|title=Viewpoint: Ending a discriminatory blood policy|work=The Michigan Daily|date=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Michigan Daily]]'', the student newspaper of the University of Michigan, editorialized in favor of a loosening of the MSM blood donation policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michigandaily.com/opinion/10daily-blood-battle-equality23|title=Editorial: The battle for donor equality|newspaper=The Michigan Daily|date=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
