==Terms==
There are a number of other possible terms which are also used in order to refer to negative feelings and attitudes towards Islam and Muslims, such as '''anti-Muslimism''', '''intolerance against Muslims''', '''anti-Muslim prejudice''', '''anti-Muslim bigotry''', '''hatred of Muslims''', '''anti-Islamism''', '''Muslimophobia''', '''demonisation of Islam''', or '''demonisation of Muslims'''. In German, ''Islamophobie'' (fear) and ''Islamfeindlichkeit'' (hostility) are used. The Scandinavian term ''Muslimhat'' literally means "hatred of Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaya|first1=Ayhan|editor1-last=Cesari|editor1-first=Jocelyne|title=The Oxford Handbook of European Islam|date=2014|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-960797-6|chapter=Islamophobia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and definitions ==
The word ''Islamophobia'' is a [[neologism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Roland Imhoff &amp; Julia Recker|title=Differentiating Islamophobia: Introducing a new scale to measure Islamoprejudice and Secular Islam Critique|url=https://uni-bonn.academia.edu/RolandImhoff/Papers/544018/Differentiating_Islamophobia_Introducing_a_new_scale_to_measure_Islamoprejudice_and_Secular_Islam_Critique|website=Academia |access-date=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed from ''Islam'' and ''-phobia'', a Greek [[suffix]] used in English to form "nouns with the sense 'fear {{nowrap| of – – '}}, 'aversion {{nowrap|to – – '."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/142572?rskey=Glm8gY&amp;result=2#eid |url-access=subscription|publisher=Oxford University Press|dictionary=Oxford English Dictionary |entry=-phobia, ''comb. form''|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word means "Intense dislike or fear of Islam, esp. as a political force; hostility or prejudice towards Muslims". It is [[Attested language|attested]] in English as early as 1923&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248449? |url-access=subscription |publisher=Oxford University Press|dictionary=Oxford English Dictionary |entry=Islamophobia|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt; to quote the French word ''islamophobie'', found in a thesis published by Alain Quellien in 1910 to describe "a prejudice against Islam that is widespread among the peoples of Western and [[Christian civilization]]".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Loïc Le Quellec |author-link=:fr:Jean-Loïc Le Quellec |date=2019-06-19|title=Histoire et mythe conspirationniste du mot " islamophobie "|url=https://tempspresents.com/2019/06/19/histoire-et-mythe-conspirationniste-du-mot-islamophobie/ |access-date=2019-08-31|website=Fragments sur les Temps Présents|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression did not immediately turn into the vocabulary of the English-speaking world though, which preferred the expression "feelings inimical to Islam", until its re-appearance in an article by Georges Chahati Anawati in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;"What makes the task difficult, perhaps impossible, for a non-Muslim is that he is compelled, under penalty of being accused of Islamophobia, to admire the Koran in its totality and to guard against implying the smallest criticism of the text's literary value" (Anawati 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The term did not exist in the Muslim world,{{Efn|Persian had the expression ''islām harāsī'' (اسلام هراسی), "hostility to Islam", similar to ''‛adā' al-islām'' (عَداء الإسلام) in Arabic.|name=|group=lower-alpha}} and was later translated in the 1990s as ''ruhāb al-islām'' (رُهاب الإسلام) in Arabic, literally "phobia of Islam".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[University of California at Berkeley]]'s [[Islamophobia Research &amp; Documentation Project]] suggested this working definition: "Islamophobia is a contrived fear or prejudice fomented by the existing Eurocentric and Orientalist global power structure. It is directed at a perceived or real Muslim threat through the maintenance and extension of existing disparities in economic, political, social and cultural relations, while rationalizing the necessity to deploy violence as a tool to achieve 'civilizational rehab' of the target communities (Muslim or otherwise). Islamophobia reintroduces and reaffirms a global racial structure through which resource distribution disparities are maintained and extended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Islamophobia Research &amp; Documentation Project |url=http://crg.berkeley.edu/content/islamophobia/defining-islamophobia |title=Defining "Islamophobia" |publisher=Center for Race &amp; Gender, University of California at Berkeley |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309201925/http://crg.berkeley.edu/content/islamophobia/defining-islamophobia |archive-date=9 March 2017 |access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate on the term and its limitations===
In 1996, the [[Runnymede Trust]] established the Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia (CBMI), chaired by [[Gordon Conway]], the [[vice-chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of Sussex]]. The Commission's report, ''Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All'', was published in November 1997 by the Home Secretary, [[Jack Straw]]. In the Runnymede report, Islamophobia was defined as "an outlook or world-view involving an unfounded dread and dislike of Muslims, which results in practices of exclusion and discrimination."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Runnymede Trust |title=Islamophobia A Challenge For Us All - Report of the Runnymede Trust Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia |year=1997 |url= https://mcislamofobia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Islamophobia-a-challenge-for-us-all-without-cartoons-1.pdf|publisher=[[ The Runnymede Trust]]|isbn= 0-902397-98-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoRE215"&gt;Encyclopedia of Race and Ethics, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the term was justified by the report's assessment that "anti-Muslim prejudice has grown so considerably and so rapidly in recent years that a new item in the vocabulary is needed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meer|first1=Nasar|last2=Modood|first2=Tariq|date=July 2009|title=Refutations of racism in the 'Muslim question'|journal=[[Patterns of Prejudice]]|volume=43|issue=3–4|pages=335–54|doi=10.1080/00313220903109250|s2cid=144359945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Runnymede Trust |title=Islamophobia A Challenge For Us All - Report of the Runnymede Trust Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia |year=1997 |url= https://mcislamofobia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Islamophobia-a-challenge-for-us-all-without-cartoons-1.pdf|publisher=[[ The Runnymede Trust]]|isbn= 0-902397-98-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a workshop on 'Thinking Thru Islamophobia' was held at the [[University of Leeds]], organized by the Centre for Ethnicity and Racism Studies, the participants included S. Sayyid, Abdoolkarim Vakil, [[Liz Fekete]], and Gabrielle Maranci among others. The symposium proposed a definition of Islamophobia which rejected the idea of Islamophobia as being the product of closed and open views of Islam and focused on Islamophobia as performative which problematized Muslim agency and identity. The symposium was an early attempt to bring insights from [[critical race theory]], [[postcolonial]] and [[Decoloniality|decolonial]] thought to bear on the question of Islamophobia.&lt;ref name=Sayyid&amp;Vakil/&gt;

At a 2009 symposium on "Islamophobia and Religious Discrimination", Robin Richardson, a former director of the Runnymede Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runnymedetrust.org/bgRanimed.html|title=Runnymede Trust – Ranimed, Runnymede and a Long Report|access-date=18 March 2015|archive-date=25 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225130831/http://www.runnymedetrust.org/bgRanimed.html|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2021|reason=dead link}} and the editor of ''Islamophobia: a challenge for us all'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2010|title=MCB Brings Experts and Parliamentarians Together to Discuss Islamophobia|url=http://www.mcb.org.uk/article_detail.php?article=announcement-862|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306001003/http://www.mcb.org.uk/article_detail.php?article=announcement-862|archive-date=6 March 2012|website=[[Muslim Council of Britain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that "the disadvantages of the term Islamophobia are significant" on seven different grounds, including that it implies it is merely a "severe mental illness" affecting "only a tiny minority of people"; that use of the term makes those to whom it is applied "defensive and defiant" and absolves the user of "the responsibility of trying to understand them" or trying to change their views; that it implies that hostility to Muslims is divorced from factors such as skin color, immigrant status, fear of fundamentalism, or political or economic conflicts; that it conflates prejudice against Muslims in one's own country with dislike of Muslims in countries with which the West is in conflict; that it fails to distinguish between people who are against all religion from people who dislike Islam specifically; and that the actual issue being described is hostility to Muslims, "an ethno-religious identity within European countries", rather than hostility to Islam. Nonetheless, he argued that the term is here to stay, and that it is important to define it precisely.&lt;ref name=Richardson2009&gt;Richardson, Robin (December 2009). {{cite web|url= http://www.insted.co.uk/anti-muslim-racism.pdf |title=Islamophobia or anti-muslim racism&amp;nbsp;– or what? }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(119&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, Insted website.

===Racism===
{{See also|Cultural racism}}
Several scholars consider Islamophobia to be a form of [[xenophobia]] or [[racism]]. A 2007 article in ''Journal of Sociology'' defines Islamophobia as anti-Muslim racism and a continuation of anti-[[Asian people|Asian]], [[Anti-Turkism|anti-Turkic]] and [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab]] racism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tariqmodood.com/uploads/1/2/3/9/12392325/multicultural_state_we_are_in.pdf "The Multicultural State We're In: Muslims,'Multiculture' and the 'Civic Re‐balancing' of British Multiculturalism"], ''Political Studies'': 2009 Vol 57, 473–97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.surrey.ac.uk/cronem/files/Tariq-Modood-article.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054654/https://www.surrey.ac.uk/cronem/files/Tariq-Modood-article.pdf |archive-date=2013-09-21 |title=Remaking multiculturalism after 7/7 |website=Centre for Research on the European Matrix |first=Tariq |last=Modood |date=29 September 2005 |quote=The most important such form of cultural racism today is anti-Muslim racism, sometimes called Islamophobia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Islamophobia Industry: How the Right Manufactures Fear of Muslims|author=Nathan Lean|isbn=978-0745332543|year=2012|publisher=Pluto Press |quote=Biological racist discourses have now been replaced by what is called the 'new racism' or 'cultural racist' discourses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Poynting | first1 = S. | last2 = Mason | first2 = V. | doi = 10.1177/1440783307073935 | title = The resistible rise of Islamophobia: Anti-Muslim racism in the UK and Australia before 11 September 2001 | journal = Journal of Sociology | volume = 43 | pages = 61–86 | year = 2007 | issue = 1 | s2cid = 145065236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their books, [[Deepa Kumar]] and Junaid Rana have argued that formation of Islamophobic discourses has paralleled the development of other forms of racial bigotry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: beyond "post 9/11" (''Islamophobia and the Politics of Empire'' by Deepa Kumar; ''Terrifying Muslims: Race and Labor in the South Asian Diaspora'' by Junaid Rana)|author=Erik Love|journal=Contexts| volume=12|number=1|year=2013|pages=70–72|jstor=41960426|quote=Taking these two works together, Kumar and Rana put forth a strong argument that while Islam is certainly a religion, and not a race, and Muslims (like all religious communities) are a highly diverse group in terms of ethnicity, nationality, and even racial backgrounds, Islamophobia is in fact a form of racism.

Others have questioned the relationship between Islamophobia and racism.

The [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] (ECRI) defines Islamophobia as "the fear of or prejudiced viewpoint towards Islam, Muslims and matters pertaining to them", adding that whether "it takes the shape of daily forms of racism and discrimination or more violent forms, Islamophobia is a violation of human rights and a threat to social cohesion".&lt;ref name=levandedefinitioner&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levandehistoria.se/fakta-fordjupning/islamofobi/definitioner-och-uttryck|title=Islamofobi – definitioner och uttryck|website=Forum för levande historia|access-date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and causes==

===History of the term===

One early use cited as the term's first use is by the painter [[Étienne Dinet|Alphonse Étienne Dinet]] and [[Algeria]]n intellectual Sliman ben Ibrahim in their 1918 biography of Islam's prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=La Vie de Mohammed, Prophète d'Allah |last1=Dinet |first1=Alphonse Étienne |last2=ben Ibrahim |first2=Sliman |year=1918 |location=Paris}} cited from {{Cite book|last1=Otterbeck |first1=Jonas |last2=Bevelander |first2=Pieter |year=2006 |title=Islamofobi&amp;nbsp; – en studie av begreppet, ungdomars attityder och unga muslimars utsatthet |publisher=Forum för levande historia |location=Stockholm |language=sv |isbn=978-91-976073-6-0 |url=http://www.levandehistoria.se/files/islamofobi.pdf |access-date=23 November 2011 |quote=modern orientalists [are partially] influenced by an islamofobia, which is poorly reconciled with science and hardly worthy of our time |others=Anders Lange  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119025153/http://www.levandehistoria.se/files/islamofobi.pdf |archive-date=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen2010pp5-6&gt;Allen, Christopher (2010). ''Islamophobia''. [[Ashgate Publishing]]. pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in French, they used the term ''{{Wikt-lang|fr|islamophobie}}''. Robin Richardson writes that in the English version of the book the word was not translated as "Islamophobia" but rather as "feelings inimical to Islam". Dahou Ezzerhouni has cited several other uses in French as early as 1910, and from 1912 to 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Ezzerhouni, Dahou.

"Le mot serai ainsi apparu pour la première fois dans quelques ouvrages du début du XXème siècle. On peut citer entre autre « La politique musulmane dans l'Afrique Occidentale Française » d'Alain Quellien publié en 1910, suivi de quelques citations dans la ''[[Revue du monde musulman]]'' en 1912 et 1918, la Revue du Mercure de France en 1912, « Haut-Sénégal-Niger » de Maurice Delafosse en 1912 et dans le Journal of Theological Studies en 1924. L'année suivante, Etienne Dinet et Slimane Ben Brahim, employaient ce terme qui «conduit à l'aberration » dans leur ouvrage « L'Orient vu par l'Occident »."&lt;/ref&gt; These early uses of the term did not, according to [[Chris Allen (academic)|Christopher Allen]], have the same meaning as in contemporary usage, as they described a fear of Islam by [[Liberalism and progressivism within Islam|liberal Muslims]] and [[Islamic feminism|Muslim feminists]], rather than a fear or dislike/hatred of Muslims by non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=Allen2010pp5-6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen2007&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots591=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&amp;lng=en&amp;id=45668|title=Islamophobia and its Consequences|author=Chris Allen|journal=European Islam|year=2007|pages=144–67|author-link=Chris Allen (academic)}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Fernando Bravo López argues that Dinet and ibn Sliman's use of the term was as a criticism of overly hostile attitudes to Islam by a Belgian orientalist, Henri Lammens, whose project they saw as a "'pseudo-scientific crusade in the hope of bringing Islam down once and for all.{{'"}} He also notes that an early definition of Islamophobia appears in the 1910 Ph.D. thesis of Alain Quellien, a French colonial bureaucrat:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For some, the Muslim is the natural and irreconcilable enemy of the Christian and the European; Islam is the negation of civilization, and barbarism, bad faith and cruelty are the best one can expect from the Mohammedans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, he notes that Quellien's work draws heavily on the work of the French colonial department's 1902–06 administrator, who published a work in 1906, which to a great extent mirrors [[John Esposito]]'s ''The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bravo López | first1 = F. | title = Towards a definition of Islamophobia: Approximations of the early twentieth century | doi = 10.1080/01419870.2010.528440 | journal = Ethnic and Racial Studies | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 556–73 | year = 2011 | s2cid = 217534342 | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00645104/file/PEER_stage2_10.1080%252F01419870.2010.528440.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded use of the term in English, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', was in 1923 in an article in ''[[The Journal of Theological Studies]]''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The term entered into common usage with the publication of the Runnymede Trust's report in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Otterbeck |first1=Jonas |last2=Bevelander |first2=Pieter |year=2006 |title=Islamofobi&amp;nbsp; – en studie av begreppet, ungdomars attityder och unga muslimars utsatthet |publisher=Forum för levande historia |location=Stockholm |language=sv |isbn=978-91-976073-6-0 |url=http://www.levandehistoria.se/files/islamofobi.pdf |access-date=23 November 2011 |others=Anders Lange  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119025153/http://www.levandehistoria.se/files/islamofobi.pdf |archive-date=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Kofi Annan asserted at a 2004 conference entitled "Confronting Islamophobia" that the word Islamophobia had to be coined in order to "take account of increasingly widespread bigotry".&lt;ref Name=Annan&gt;[[Kofi Annan|Annan, Kofi]].

=== Increase in Islamophobia during 1990s ===

During the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in the 1990s, far-right Serbian Orthodox Christian militants who were heavily indoctrinated with Islamophobic sentiments, perpetrated a genocide against [[Bosniaks|Bosniak Muslims]]. Since 1989, Serbian leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] publicly disseminated Islamophobic rhetoric throughout [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], inciting [[Far right in Serbia|Serbian far-right]] militants to massacre Bosniak Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Baboulias |first=Yiannis |date=1 April 2019 |title=The Balkans Are the World Capital of Islamophobia |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/01/the-balkans-are-the-world-capital-of-islamophobia/ |work=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sabic-El-Rayess |first=Amra |date=1 Oct 2020 |title= Today's America reminds me of 1990s Bosnia and Herzegovina |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/opinions/2020/10/1/from-90s-bosnia-to-mordern-dayhistory-repeats-itself |work=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Najib |first=Kawtar |title=Spatialized Islamophobia |publisher=Routledge |year=2022 |isbn=978-0-367-89478-8 |location=New York |pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stereotyping of Bosniak Muslims as a hostile force threatening Europe with "terrorism" in Serbian propaganda was closely linked to the rise of Islamophobic narratives in [[Western media]] and [[European politics|European political]] discourse.{{sfn|Miles|Brown|2003|p=164, 165}}

===Contrasting views on Islam===
The Runnymede report contrasted "open" and "closed" views of Islam, and stated that the following "closed" views are equated with Islamophobia:&lt;ref name="Runnymede1997"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/publications/pdfs/islamophobia.pdf |title= Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All |access-date= 7 May 2014 |archive-date= 26 September 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070926002939/http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/publications/pdfs/islamophobia.pdf }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(69.7&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, ''Runnymede Trust'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

:#Islam is seen as a monolithic bloc, static and unresponsive to change.
:#It is seen as separate and "other". It does not have values in common with other cultures, is not affected by them and does not influence them.
:#It is seen as inferior to the West. It is seen as barbaric, irrational, primitive, and [[sexist]].
:#It is seen as violent, aggressive, threatening, supportive of [[terrorism]], and engaged in a [[clash of civilizations]].
:#It is seen as a political [[ideology]], used for political or military advantage.
:#Criticisms made of "the West" by Muslims are rejected out of hand.

These "closed" views are contrasted, in the report, with "open" views on Islam which, while founded on respect for Islam, permit legitimate disagreement, dialogue and critique.{{sfn|Benn|Jawad|2003|p=162}} According to Benn and Jawad, The Runnymede Trust notes that anti-Muslim discourse is increasingly seen as respectable, providing examples on how hostility towards Islam and Muslims is accepted as normal, even among those who may actively challenge other prevalent forms of discrimination.{{sfn|Benn|Jawad|2003|p=165}}

===Identity politics===
It has been suggested that Islamophobia is closely related to [[identity politics]], and gives its adherents the perceived benefit of constructing their identity in opposition to a negative, essentialized image of Muslims. This occurs in the form of self-righteousness, assignment of blame and key identity markers.&lt;ref name="doving1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Døving |first1=Cora Alexa |year=2010 |title=Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia: A Comparison of Imposed Group Identities |journal=Tidsskrift for Islamforskning |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=52–76 |doi=10.7146/tifo.v4i2.24596 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davina Bhandar writes that:&lt;ref name="Bhandar"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bhandar | first1 = D. | title = Cultural politics: Disciplining citizenship | doi = 10.1080/13621021003731963 | journal = Citizenship Studies | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–43 | year = 2010 | s2cid = 146490574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Blockquote|text=[...] the term 'cultural' has become synonymous with the category of the ethnic or minority [...]. It views culture as an entity that is highly abstracted from the practices of daily life and therefore represents the illusion that there exists a spirit of the people. This formulation leads to the homogenisation of cultural identity and the ascription of particular values and proclivities onto minority cultural groups.}}

She views this as an [[ontology|ontological]] trap that hinders the perception of culture as something "materially situated in the living practices of the everyday, situated in time-space and not based in abstract projections of what constitutes either a particular tradition or culture."

In some societies, Islamophobia has materialized due to the portrayal of Islam and Muslims as the national "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]", where exclusion and discrimination occurs on the basis of their religion and civilization which differs with national tradition and identity. Examples include Pakistani and Algerian migrants in Britain and France respectively.{{sfn|Poole|2003|p=216}}{{sfn|Miles|Brown|2003|p=163}} This sentiment, according to Malcolm Brown and Robert Miles, significantly interacts with [[racism]], although Islamophobia itself is not racism.{{sfn|Miles|Brown|2003|p=163}}{{sfn|Miles|Brown|2003|p=164}} Author [[Doug Saunders]] has drawn parallels between [[Islamophobia in the United States]] and its older [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|discrimination and hate against Roman Catholics]], saying that Catholicism was seen as backwards and imperial, while Catholic immigrants had poorer education and some were responsible for crime and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Saunders|first=Doug|author-link=Doug Saunders|date=2012-09-17|title=Opinion: Catholics Then, Muslims Now|language=en-US|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/opinion/catholics-then-muslims-now.html|access-date=2014-02-18|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Haddad|2002|p=19}}&lt;ref&gt;''Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All (Summary)'', Runnymede Trust, 1997, p. 1, cited in {{cite book |last=Quraishi |first=Muzammil |title=Muslims and crime: a comparative study |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7546-4233-6 |location=Aldershot, Hants, England |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown and Miles write that another feature of Islamophobic discourse is to amalgamate nationality (e.g. Saudi), religion (Islam), and politics (terrorism, fundamentalism)&amp;nbsp;– while most other religions are not associated with terrorism, or even "ethnic or national distinctiveness".{{sfn|Miles|Brown|2003|p=163}} They feel that "many of the stereotypes and misinformation that contribute to the articulation of Islamophobia are rooted in a particular perception of Islam", such as the notion that Islam promotes terrorism&amp;nbsp;– especially prevalent after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].{{sfn|Miles|Brown|2003|p=166}}

The academics S. Sayyid and Abdoolkarim Vakil maintain that Islamophobia is a response to the emergence of a distinct Muslim public identity globally, the presence of Muslims in itself not being an indicator of the degree of Islamophobia in a society. Sayyid and Vakil maintain that there are societies where virtually no Muslims live but many institutionalized forms of Islamophobia still exist in them.&lt;ref name=Sayyid&amp;Vakil&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sayyid |first1=Salman |author-link=Salman Sayyid |last2=Vakil |first2=Abdoolkarim |year=2010 |title=Thinking Through Islamophobia: Global Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glHhHIaCm9AC |location=New York |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |page=319 |isbn=9780231702065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cora Alexa Døving, a senior scientist at the Norwegian [[Center for Studies of the Holocaust and Religious Minorities (Norway)|Center for Studies of the Holocaust and Religious Minorities]], argues that there are significant similarities between Islamophobic discourse and European pre-Nazi antisemitism.&lt;ref name="doving1"/&gt; Among the concerns are imagined threats of minority growth and domination, threats to traditional institutions and customs, skepticism of integration, threats to [[secularism]], fears of sexual crimes, fears of [[misogyny]], fears based on historical cultural inferiority, hostility to modern Western [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values, etc.

{{ill|Matti Bunzl|de}} has argued that there are important differences between Islamophobia and antisemitism. While antisemitism was a phenomenon closely connected to European [[nation-building]] processes, he sees Islamophobia as having the concern of European civilization as its focal point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-semitism and Islamophobia: hatreds old and new in Europe |last=Bunzl |first=Matti |year=2007 |publisher=Prickly Paradigm Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-9761475-8-9 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37UsAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Islamophobic+claims%22 |access-date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Døving, on the other hand, maintains that, at least in Norway, the Islamophobic discourse has a clear national element.&lt;ref name="doving1"/&gt; In a reply to Bunzl, French scholar of Jewish history, [[Esther Benbassa]], agrees with him in that he draws a clear connection between modern hostile and essentializing sentiments towards Muslims and historical antisemitism. However, she argues against the use of the term ''Islamophobia'', since, in her opinion, it attracts unwarranted attention to an underlying racist current.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia: Hatred Old and New in Europe |chapter=Xenophobia, Anti-Semitism, and Racism |last=Benbassa |first=Esther |year=2007 |publisher=Prickly Paradigm Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-9761475-8-9 |pages=86ff |chapter-url=http://www.estherbenbassa.net/SCANS/XENOPHOBIA.PDF |access-date=23 November 2011 |editor-last=Bunzl |editor-first=Matti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the Media Responsibility Institute in [[Erlangen]], Sabine Schiffer, and researcher Constantin Wagner, who also define Islamophobia as anti-Muslim racism, outline additional similarities and differences between Islamophobia and antisemitism.&lt;ref name =schiffer&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schiffer | first1 = S. | last2 = Wagner | first2 = C. | doi = 10.1177/0306396810389927 | title = Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia – new enemies, old patterns | journal = Race &amp; Class | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 77–84 | year = 2011 | s2cid = 146753309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They point out the existence of equivalent notions such as "Judaisation/Islamisation", and metaphors such as "a state within a state" are used in relation to both Jews and Muslims. In addition, both discourses make use of, among other rhetorical instruments, "religious imperatives" supposedly "proven" by religious sources, and conspiracy theories.

The differences between Islamophobia and antisemitism consist of the nature of the perceived threats to the "[[Christian West]]". Muslims are perceived as "inferior" and as a visible "external threat", while on the other hand, Jews are perceived as "omnipotent" and as an invisible "internal threat". However, Schiffer and Wagner also note that there is a growing tendency to view Muslims as a privileged group that constitute an "internal threat" and that this convergence between the two discources makes "it more and more necessary to use findings from the study of anti-Semitism to analyse Islamophobia". Schiffer and Wagner conclude,

{{Blockquote|The achievement in the study of anti-Semitism of examining Jewry and anti-Semitism separately must also be transferred to other racisms, such as Islamophobia. We do not need more information about Islam, but more information about the making of racist stereotypes in general.}}

The publication ''Social Work and Minorities: European Perspectives'' describes Islamophobia as the new form of racism in Europe,{{sfn|Williams|Soydan|Johnson|1998|p=182}} arguing that "Islamophobia is as much a form of racism as [[anti-semitism]], a term more commonly encountered in Europe as a sibling of racism, xenophobia and intolerance."{{sfn|Williams|Soydan|Johnson|1998|p=22}} [[Edward Said]] considers Islamophobia as it is evinced in [[Orientalism]] to be a trend in a more general antisemitic Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Edward W.

In their 2018 American Muslim Poll, the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding found that when it came to their Islamophobia index (see Public Opinion), they found that those who scored higher on the index, (i.e. more islamophobic) were, "associated with 1) greater acceptance of targeting civilians, whether it is a military or individual/small group that is doling out the violence, 2) greater acquiescence to limiting both press freedoms and institutional checks following a hypothetical terror attack, and 3) greater support for the so-called "Muslim ban" and the surveillance of American mosques (or their outright building prohibition)."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ispu.org/american-muslim-poll-2018-full-report/|title=American Muslim Poll 2018: Full Report {{!}} ISPU|date=2018-04-30|website=Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Islamophobia in the media}}

According to [[Elizabeth Poole]] in the ''Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic Studies'', the media have been criticized for perpetrating Islamophobia. She cites a case study examining a sample of articles in the [[British press]] from between 1994 and 2004, which concluded that Muslim viewpoints were underrepresented and that issues involving Muslims usually depicted them in a negative light. Such portrayals, according to Poole, include the depiction of Islam and Muslims as a threat to Western security and [[European values|values]].{{sfn|Poole|2003|p=217}} Benn and Jawad write that hostility towards Islam and Muslims are "closely linked to media portrayals of Islam as barbaric, irrational, primitive and sexist."{{sfn|Benn|Jawad|2003|p=165}} Egorova and Tudor cite European researchers in suggesting that expressions used in the media such as "Islamic terrorism", "Islamic bombs" and "violent Islam" have resulted in a negative perception of Islam.&lt;ref name=egorova&gt;See Egorova; Tudor (2003) pp. 2–3, which cites the conclusions of Marquina and Rebolledo in: "A.

Some media outlets are working explicitly against Islamophobia. In 2008 [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] ("FAIR") published a study "Smearcasting, How Islamophobes Spread Bigotry, Fear and Misinformation". The report cites several instances where mainstream or close to mainstream journalists, authors and academics have made analyses that essentialize negative traits as an inherent part of Muslims' moral makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Rendall |first = Steve |title = Making Islamophobia Mainstream: How Muslim-bashers broadcast their bigotry |date = 2008-11-01 |publisher = [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] |url = https://fair.org/extra/making-islamophobia-mainstream/ |access-date = 2023-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAIR also established the "[[Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism]]", designed to monitor coverage in the media and establish dialogue with media organizations. Following the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of 11 September 2001]], the [[Islamic Society of Britain]]'s "Islam Awareness Week" and the "Best of British Islam Festival" were introduced to improve community relations and raise awareness about Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic studies, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Silva and Meaux et al both theorized that one of the main causes of negative interactions, [[Stigmatization|stigma]], and [[Social exclusion|marginalization]] toward the Arabic community is due to the fact that many media framing from news outlets tend to associate [[Arab Muslims|Arab-Muslims]] with [[terrorism]] and [[Jihadism|jihadist]]-inspired motivations when it came to mass violence incidents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Silva noted in their research looking through [[The New York Times|New York Times]] articles about gun violence and noted that over the sixteen-year period of 2000 until 2016 this media framing would only increase through the time period.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Silva |first=Jason R. |date=2021-09-13 |title=The news media's framing of mass shootings: gun access, mental illness, violent entertainment, and terrorism |journal=Actual Problems of Economics and Law |volume=15 |issue=2 |doi=10.21202/1993-047x.15.2021.2.332-359 |s2cid=225520354 |issn=1993-047X|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silva compared his results to find out that Arabic [[Suspect|perpetrators]] were significantly more like to be framed as terrorists than their White counterparts.

=== Movies ===
Throughout the twentieth century, Muslim characters were portrayed in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] often negatively and with [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] stereotypes visualising them as being "uncivilised". Since the [[Post-9/11]] era, in addition to these tropes, a securitization of Muslims; portraying them as a threat to the [[Western world]], have drastically increased in movie depictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Senanayake |first=Harsha |date=2021 |title=Hollywood and Wicked Other: The Identity Formation of "Western Us" Versus "Muslim Others" |journal=Open Political Science |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=64–67 |doi=10.1515/openps-2021-0007 |s2cid=231920684 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English Defence League]] (EDL), an organization in the United Kingdom, has been described as anti-Muslim.

Furthermore, the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] and the resulting efforts of the British civil and law enforcement authorities to help seek British Muslims' help in identifying potential threats to create prevention is observed by Michael Lavalette as institutionalized Islamophobia. Lavalette alleges that there is a continuity between the former two British governments over prevention that aims to stop young Muslim people from being misled, misdirected and recruited by extremists who exploit grievances for their own "jihadist" endeavors. Asking and concentrating on Muslim communities and young Muslims to prevent future instances, by the authorities, is in itself Islamophobia as such since involvement of Muslim communities will highlight and endorse their compassion for Britain and negate the perceived threats from within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Race, Racism and Social Work: Contemporary issues and debates|last = Lavalette|first = Michael|publisher = Policy Press at the University of Bristol|year = 2014|location = England|pages = 167–90|chapter = Institutionalised Islamophobia and the 'Prevent' agenda: 'winning hearts and minds' or welfare as surveillance and control?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internalized Islamophobia ===
ISPU also highlighted a particular trend in relation to anti-Muslim sentiment in the U.S. – internalized Islamophobia among Muslim populations themselves. When asked if they felt most people want them to be ashamed of their faith identity, 30% of Muslims agreed (a higher percentage than any other faith group). When asked if they believed that their faith community was more prone to negative behavior than other faith communities, 30% of Muslims agreed, again, a higher percentage than other faith groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Excessive citations|date=September 2021|section}}
Islamophobia has become a topic of increasing sociological and political importance.{{sfn|Miles|Brown|2003|p=163}} According to Benn and Jawad, Islamophobia has increased since [[Ayatollah Khomeini]]'s [[The Satanic Verses controversy#Fatwa by Ayatollah Khomeini|1989 fatwa]] inciting Muslims to attempt to murder [[Salman Rushdie]], the author of ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', and since the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]] (in 2001).{{sfn|Benn|Jawad|2003|p=111}} [[Anthropologist]] [[Steven Vertovec]] writes that the purported growth in Islamophobia may be associated with increased Muslim presence in society and successes.&lt;ref name="Vertovec"&gt;Steven Vertovec, "Islamophobia and Muslim Recognition in Britain"&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Haddad|2002|pp=32-33}} He suggests a [[Vicious circle|circular model]], where increased hostility towards Islam and Muslims results in governmental countermeasures such as institutional guidelines and changes to legislation, which itself may fuel further Islamophobia due to increased accommodation for Muslims in public life. Vertovec concludes: "As the public sphere shifts to provide a more prominent place for Muslims, Islamophobic tendencies may amplify."&lt;ref name="Vertovec" /&gt;{{sfn|Haddad|2002|pp=32-33}}

Patel, Humphries, and Naik (1998) claim that "Islamophobia has always been present in Western countries and cultures. In the last two decades, it has become accentuated, explicit and extreme."&lt;ref&gt;Naina Patel, Beth Humphries and Don Naik, "The 3 Rs in social work; Religion,'race' and racism in Europe"&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|Soydan|Johnson|1998|pp=197-8}} However, Vertovec states that some have observed that Islamophobia has not necessarily escalated in the past decades, but that there has been increased public scrutiny of it.&lt;ref name="Vertovec" /&gt;{{sfn|Haddad|2002|pp=32-33}} According to Abduljalil Sajid, one of the members of the Runnymede Trust's Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, "Islamophobias" have existed in varying strains throughout history, with each version possessing its own distinct features as well as similarities or adaptations from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamophobia: A new word for an old fear |url=http://www.wcrp.be/articles/Sajid9-11-04.htm |author=Imam Abduljalil Sajid |access-date=17 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930121111/http://www.wcrp.be/articles/Sajid9-11-04.htm |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 [[Ziauddin Sardar]], an [[Islamic scholar]], wrote in the ''New Statesman'' that Islamophobia is a widespread European phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Sardar&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/152128 "The next holocaust"], ''New Statesman'', 5 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that each country has anti-Muslim political figures, citing [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in France; [[Pim Fortuyn]] in the Netherlands; and Philippe van der Sande of [[Vlaams Blok]], a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] nationalist party in Belgium. Sardar argued that Europe is "post-colonial, but ambivalent". Minorities are regarded as acceptable as an underclass of menial workers, but if they want to be upwardly mobile anti-Muslim prejudice rises to the surface. Wolfram Richter, professor of economics at [[Technical University of Dortmund]], told Sardar: "I am afraid we have not learned from our history. My main fear is that [[Holocaust|what we did to Jews]] we may now do to Muslims. The next holocaust would be against Muslims."&lt;ref name=Sardar/&gt; Similar fears, as noted by [[Kenan Malik]] in his book ''From Fatwa to Jihad'', had been previously expressed in the UK by Muslim philosopher [[Shabbir Akhtar]] in 1989, and Massoud Shadjareh, chair of the [[Islamic Human Rights Commission]] in 2000. In 2006 [[Salma Yaqoob]], a [[Respect Party]] Councillor, claimed that Muslims in Britain were "subject to attacks reminiscent of the gathering storm of anti-Semitism in the first decades of the last century."&lt;ref name=malik131-2&gt;Malik, Kenan. ''From Fatwa to Jihad''. Atlantic Books, London (2009): pp. 131–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Malik, a senior visiting fellow in the Department of Political, International and Policy Studies at the [[University of Surrey]], has described these claims of a brewing holocaust as "hysterical to the point of delusion"; whereas Jews in Hitler's Germany were given the official designation of ''[[Untermenschen]]'', and were subject to escalating legislation which diminished and ultimately removed their rights as citizens, Malik noted that in cases where "Muslims are singled out in Britain, it is often for privileged treatment" such as the 2005 legislation banning "incitement to religious hatred", the special funding Muslim organizations and bodies receive from local and national government, the special provisions made by workplaces, school and leisure centres for Muslims, and even suggestions by the Archbishop of Canterbury [[Rowan Williams]] and the former Lord Chief Justice, [[Nicholas Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers|Lord Phillips]], that [[sharia]] law should be introduced into Britain. The fact is, wrote Malik, that such well-respected public figures as Akhtar, Shadjareh and Yaqoob need "a history lesson about the real Holocaust reveals how warped the Muslim grievance culture has become."&lt;ref name=malik132&gt;Malik (2009): p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] reported that "public views of Islam are one casualty of the post-September 11, 2001 conflict: Nearly six in 10 Americans think the religion is prone to [[violent extremism]], nearly half regard it unfavorably, and a remarkable one in four admits to prejudicial feelings against Muslims and Arabs alike." They also report that 27 percent of Americans admit feelings of prejudice against Muslims.&lt;ref name=ABCMarch8&gt;{{Cite news |last = Cohen |first = Jon |date = 2006-03-08 |title = Poll: Americans Skeptical of Islam and Arabs |publisher = [[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] |url = https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=1700599 |access-date = 2023-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallup polls in 2006 found that 40 percent of Americans admit to prejudice against Muslims, and 39 percent believe Muslims should carry special identification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=2413473&amp;page=2 "Islamophobia Felt 5 Years after 9/11"], ''Good Morning America'', 9 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These trends have only worsened with the use of Islamophobia as a campaign tactic during the 2008 American presidential election (with several Republican politicians and pundits, including Donald Trump, asserting that Democratic candidate Barack Obama is secretly a Muslim), during the 2010 mid-term elections (during which a proposed Islamic community center was dubbed the "Ground Zero Mosque"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corbett|first=Rosemary R.|title=Making Moderate Islam: Sufism, Service, and the Ground Zero Mosque Controversy|year=2016|publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9781503600812}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the 2016 presidential election, during which Republican nominee Donald Trump proposed banning the entrance into the country of all Muslims. Associate Professor [[Deepa Kumar]] writes that "Islamophobia is about politics rather than religion per se"&lt;ref name=Kumarbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Kumar|title=Islamophobia and the Politics of Empire|year=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1608462117|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that modern-day demonization of Arabs and Muslims by US politicians and others is racist and Islamophobic, and employed in support of what she describes as an unjust war. About the public impact of this rhetoric, she says that "One of the consequences of the relentless attacks on Islam and Muslims by politicians and the media is that Islamophobic sentiment is on the rise." She also chides some "people on the left" for using the same "Islamophobic logic as the Bush regime".&lt;ref name="Fighting Islamophobia"&gt;{{Cite web |last = Kumar |first = Deepa |author-link = Deepa Kumar |date = 2006-04-03 |title=Fighting Islamophobia: A Response to Critics |url = https://mronline.org/2006/04/03/fighting-islamophobia-a-response-to-critics/ |access-date = 2023-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Kumar confirms the assertions of [[Stephen Sheehi]], who "conceptualises Islamophobia as an ideological formation within the context of the American empire. Doing so "allows us to remove it from the hands of 'culture' or from the myth of a single creator or progenitor, whether it be a person, organisation or community." An ideological formation, in this telling, is a constellation of networks that produce, proliferate, benefit from, and traffic in Islamophobic discourses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=InpaperMagazine|first=From|date=2012-07-08|title=COVER STORY: Islamophobia: an ideological formation|url=https://www.dawn.com/2012/07/08/cover-story-islamophobia-an-ideological-formation/|access-date=2023-01-02|website=DAWN.COM|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer and scholar on religion [[Reza Aslan]] has said that "Islamophobia has become so mainstream in this country that Americans have been trained to expect violence against Muslims&amp;nbsp;– not excuse it, but expect it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Freedman|first=Samuel G.|date=2012-08-10|title=If the Sikh Temple Had Been a Mosque|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/11/us/if-the-sikh-temple-had-been-a-muslim-mosque-on-religion.html|access-date=2023-01-02|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2010 [[British Social Attitudes Survey]] found that the British public "is far more likely to hold negative views of Muslims than of any other religious group," with "just one in four" feeling "positively about Islam", and a "majority of the country would be concerned if a mosque was built in their area, while only 15 per cent expressed similar qualms about the opening of a church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Britain divided by Islam, survey finds|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=11 January 2010|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6965276/Britain-divided-by-Islam-survey-finds.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114211350/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6965276/Britain-divided-by-Islam-survey-finds.html|archive-date=14 January 2010|access-date=4 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 report by [[Council on American–Islamic Relations|CAIR]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s Center for Race and Gender said that groups promoting islamophobia in the US had access to US$206 million between 2008 and 2013. The author of the report said that "The hate that these groups are funding and inciting is having real consequences like attacks on mosques all over the country and new laws discriminating against Muslims in America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/20/islamophobia-funding-cair-berkeley-report |title=The Guardian: Funding Islamophobia: $206m went to promoting 'hatred' of American Muslims |last1=Kazem |first1=Halima|date=20 June 2016 |website=The Guardian |access-date=24 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, religious discrimination against Muslims has become a significant issue of concern. In 2018, The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding found that out of the groups studied, Muslims are the most likely faith community to experience religious discrimination, the data having been that way since 2015. Despite 61% of Muslims reporting experiencing religious discrimination at some level and 62% reporting that most Americans held negative stereotypes about their community, &amp;nbsp;23% reported that their faith made them feel "out of place in the world".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are intersections with racial identity and gender identity, with 73% of Arabs surveyed being more likely to experience religious discrimination, and Muslim women (75%) and youth (75%) being the most likely to report experiencing racial discrimination. The study also found that, although, "most Muslims (86%) express pride in their faith identity, they are the most likely group studied to agree that others want them to feel shame for that identity (30% of Muslims vs. 12% of Jews, 16% of non-affiliated, and 4–6% of Christian groups)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2021 survey affiliated with [[Newcastle University]] found that 83% of Muslims in Scotland said they experienced Islamophobia such as verbal or physical attacks. 75% of them said Islamophobia is a regular or everyday issue in Scottish society and 78% believed it was getting worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas Barrie|date=June 29, 2021|title=Islamophobia in Scotland on the rise as four-fifths of Muslims report verbal and physical attacks|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/islamophobia-in-scotland-on-the-rise-as-four-fifths-of-muslims-report-verbal-and-physical-attacks/ar-AALzqfv|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210702075300/https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/islamophobia-in-scotland-on-the-rise-as-four-fifths-of-muslims-report-verbal-and-physical-attacks/ar-AALzqfv%23comments|archive-date=July 2, 2021|website=[[Microsoft News]]|publisher=[[Edinburgh Evening News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Islamic hate crimes data in the United States===

Data on types of hate crimes have been collected by the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] since 1992, to carry out the dictates of the 1990 [[Hate Crime Statistics Act]]. Hate crime offenses include crimes against persons (such as assaults) and against property (such as [[arson]]), and are classified by various race-based, religion-based, and other motivations.

The data show that recorded anti-Islamic hate crimes in the United States jumped dramatically in 2001. Anti-Islamic hate crimes then subsided, but continued at a significantly higher pace than in pre-2001 years. The step up is in contrast to decreases in total hate crimes and to the [[Crime rates in the United States|decline in overall crime in the U.S.]] since the 1990s.

Specifically, the FBI's annual hate crimes statistics reports from 1996 to 2013 document average numbers of anti-Islamic offenses at 31 per year before 2001, then a leap to 546 in 2001 (the year of [[9-11]] attacks), and averaging 159 per since. Among those offenses are anti-Islamic arson incidents which have a similar pattern: arson incidents averaged 0.4 per year pre-2001, jumped to 18 in 2001, and averaged 1.5 annually since.&lt;ref name="fbiData"&gt;The FBI reports anti-Islamic [[hate crimes]] directed against persons or property its annual reports indexed here [https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/ucr-publications#Hate].

===Anti-Islamic hate crimes in the European countries===

According to [[MDPI]]: The Islamophobia Industry in America is another related-issue; it mentions: "The industry is driven by neocon stars: Daniel Pipes, Robert Spencer, David Yerushalmi, Glenn Beck, Pamela Gellner, Paul Wolfowitz, David Horowitz, and Frank Gaffney as well as native informers Walid Shoebat, Walid Phares, Wafa Sultan, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Ibn Warraq, Brigitte Gabriel, Tawfik Hamid, and Zuhdi Jasser. They have been prolific, producing and re-circulating false or exaggerated information about Islam and Muslims in order to gain lucrative speaking engagements and increase their influence among neocons in government."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Haddad |first1 = Yvonne |author-link1 = Yvonne Haddad |last2= Harb |first2 = Nazir Nader |date=June 2014|title=Post-9/11: Making Islam an American Religion |journal = Religions |publisher = [[MDPI]] |volume = 5 |issue=2 |pages = 477–501 |doi = 10.3390/rel5020477 |issn = 2077-1444 |doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research on Islamophobia and its correlates===
[[File:Estimated Muslim population Vs Negative attitudes towards Muslims.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|According to data by the [[Pew Research Center]] elaborated by VoxEurop, in European Union countries the negative attitude towards Muslims is inversely proportional to actual presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ricci |first1=Alexander Damiano |title=Negative attitude towards Muslims inversely proportional to actual presence |url=https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Negative-attitude-towards-Muslims-inversely-proportional-to-actual-presence |access-date=4 March 2019 |work=VoxEurop/EDJNet |date=11 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Various studies have been conducted to investigate Islamophobia and its correlates among majority populations and among [[Muslim]] minorities themselves. To start with, an experimental study showed that anti-Muslim attitudes may be stronger than more general [[xenophobic]] attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spruyt | first1 = B. | last2 = Elchardus | first2 = M. | year = 2012 | title = Are anti-Muslim feelings more widespread than anti-foreigner feelings?

Studies focusing on the experience of Islamophobia among Muslims have shown that the experience of [[religious discrimination]] is associated with lower national identification and higher religious identification.&lt;ref name=kunst2012a&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kunst | first1 = J.

Some studies further indicate that societal Islamophobia negatively influences Muslim minorities' health.&lt;ref name=kunst2012b/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = D. | last2 = Lordan | first2 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Discrimination makes me sick!

As such, its adherents are entitled to freedom of religion, to decent locations and to all of our respect. On the condition, that is, that they themselves respect the rules of our republican, secular culture, and that they do not demand a status of extraterritoriality that is denied other religions, or claim special rights and prerogatives"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pascal Bruckner – A reply to Ian Buruma and Timothy Garton Ash "It's so true that many English, Dutch and German politicians, shocked by the excesses that the wearing of the Islamic veil has given way to, now envisage similar legislation curbing religious symbols in public space. The separation of the spiritual and corporeal domains must be strictly maintained, and belief must confine itself to the private realm."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mnali&gt;{{cite news | title = Extremism flourished as UK lost Christianity | author-link = Michael Nazir-Ali | first = Michael | last = Nazir-Ali | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/06/nislam206.xml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080110080819/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/06/nislam206.xml | url-status = dead | archive-date = 10 January 2008 | newspaper = [[The Sunday Telegraph]] | date = 6 January 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jocelyne Cesari, in her study of discrimination against Muslims in Europe,&lt;ref name="CesariStudy"&gt;{{cite web |last=Cesari |first=Jocelyne |date=2006-06-01 |title=Muslims In Western Europe After 9/11: Why the term Islamophobia is more a predicament than an explanation |url=http://www.euro-islam.info/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/securitization_and_religious_divides_in_europe.pdf |website=Euro-Islam Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; finds that anti-Islamic sentiment may be difficult to separate from other drivers of discrimination. Because Muslims are mainly from immigrant backgrounds and the largest group of immigrants in many Western European countries, [[xenophobia]] overlaps with Islamophobia, and a person may have one, the other, or both. So, for example, some people who have a negative perception of and attitude toward Muslims may also show this toward non-Muslim immigrants, either as a whole or certain group (such as, for example, Eastern Europeans, sub-Saharan Africans, or Roma), whereas others would not.

The largest project monitoring Islamophobia was undertaken following 9/11 by the EU watchdog, [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] (EUMC). Their May 2002 report "Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001", written by [[Chris Allen (academic)|Chris Allen]] and Jorgen S.

Despite localized differences within each member nation, the recurrence of attacks on recognizable and visible traits of Islam and Muslims was the report's most significant finding. Incidents consisted of verbal abuse, blaming all Muslims for [[List of terrorist incidents|terrorism]], forcibly removing women's [[hijab]]s, spitting on Muslims, calling children "[[Osama bin Laden|Osama]]", and random assaults. A number of Muslims were hospitalized and in one instance paralyzed.&lt;ref name=EUMC/&gt; The report also discussed the portrayal of Muslims in the media. Inherent negativity, stereotypical images, fantastical representations, and exaggerated caricatures were all identified. The report concluded that "a greater receptivity towards anti-Muslim and other xenophobic ideas and sentiments has, and may well continue, to become more tolerated."&lt;ref name=EUMC/&gt; The [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] has since released a number of publications related to Islamophobia, including ''The Fight against Antisemitism and Islamophobia: Bringing Communities together (European Round Tables Meetings)'' (2003) and ''Muslims in the European Union: Discrimination and Islamophobia'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fra.europa.eu/fra/index.php?fuseaction=content.dsp_cat_content&amp;catid=1 EUMC website&amp;nbsp;– Publications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223010504/http://fra.europa.eu/fra/index.php?fuseaction=content.dsp_cat_content&amp;catid=1 |date=23 December 2007 }}.

As Anti-Semitism Studies has shown, the etymological components of a word do not necessarily point to its complete meaning, nor how it is used. Such is also the case with Islamophobia Studies. Islamophobia has become a well known term used in academia as much as in the public sphere. Criticism of Muslims or of the Islamic religion is not necessarily Islamophobic. Islamophobia is about a dominant group of people aiming at seizing, stabilizing and widening their power by means of defining a scapegoat – real or invented – and excluding this scapegoat from the resources/rights/definition of a constructed 'we'. Islamophobia operates by constructing a static 'Muslim' identity, which is attributed in negative terms and generalized for all Muslims. At the same time, Islamophobic images are fluid and vary in different contexts, because Islamophobia tells us more about the Islamophobe than it tells us about the Muslims/Islam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September 2018, the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] launched the "Counter-Islamophobia Toolkit" (CIK), with the goal of combatting the growing Islamophobia across the [[European Union|EU]] and to be distributed to national governments and other policy makers, civil society and the media.

One of the authors of the CIK, Amina Easat-Daas, says that Muslim women are disproportionately affected by Islamophobia, based on both the "threat to the west" and "victims of...Islamic sexism" narratives. The approach taken in the CIK is a four-step one: defining the misinformed narratives based on flawed logic; documenting them; deconstructing these ideas to expose the flaws; and finally, reconstruction of mainstream ideas about Islam and Muslims, one closer to reality. The dominant ideas circulating in popular culture should reflect the diverse everyday experiences of Muslims and their faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Conversation|title=How to tackle Islamophobia – the best strategies from around Europe|url=https://theconversation.com/how-to-tackle-islamophobia-the-best-strategies-from-around-europe-106092|date=21 February 2019|access-date=1 March 2019|first=Easat-Daas |last=Amina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term "Islamophobia" is widely recognized and used,{{sfn|Poole|2003|p=218|loc=''The Runnymede Trust has been successful in that the term Islamophobia is now widely recognized and used, though many right-wing commentators reject its existence or argue that it is justified.

The term has proven problematic and is viewed by some as an obstacle to constructive [[criticism of Islam]]. Its detractors fear that it can be applied to any critique of Islamic practices and beliefs, suggesting terms such as "anti-Muslim" instead.&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of Sociology"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Sociology|edition=4th

The classification of "closed" and "open" views set out in the ''Runnymede report'' has been criticized as an oversimplification of a complex issue by scholars like [[Chris Allen (academic)|Chris Allen]], [[Fred Halliday]], and [[Kenan Malik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Chris Allen|title= Islamophobia |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L.

Tamdgidi of the University of Massachusetts, Boston, has generally endorsed the definition of Islamophobia as defined by the Runnymede Trust's ''Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All''. However, he notes that the report's list of "open" views of Islam itself presents "an inadvertent definitional framework for Islamophilia": that is, it "falls in the trap of regarding Islam monolithically, in turn as being characterized by one or another trait, and does not adequately express the complex heterogeneity of a historical phenomenon whose contradictory interpretations, traditions, and sociopolitical trends have been shaped and has in turn been shaped, as in the case of any world tradition, by other world-historical forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tamdgidi | first1 = Mohammad H. | year = 2012 | title = Beyond Islamophobia and Islamophilia as Western Epistemic Racisms: Revisiting Runnymede Trust's Definition in a World-History Context | url = http://crg.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Tamdgidi.pdf | journal = Islamophobia Studies Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | page = 76 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029212606/http://crg.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Tamdgidi.pdf | archive-date = 29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a range of Western commentators have expressed objections to the term "Islamophobia", in his paper "A Measure of Islamophobia", British academic [[Salman Sayyid]] (2014) argues that these criticisms are a form of etymological fundamentalism and echo earlier comments on racism and antisemitism. Racism and antisemitism were also accused of blocking free speech, of being conceptually weak and too nebulous for practical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sayyid (2014) 'A measure of Islamophobia' Islamophobia Studies Journal, Vol 2. No. 1, pp. 10–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French philosopher [[Pascal Bruckner]] calls the term "a clever invention because it amounts to making Islam a subject that one cannot touch without being accused of racism."&lt;ref name="Bruckner"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Michael Walzer |author1-link=Michael Walzer |date=Winter 2015 |title=Islamism and the Left |url=https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/islamism-and-the-left |access-date=2 November 2015 |magazine=[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Bruckner |first=Pascal |date=2010-11-23 |title=L'invention de l'"islamophobie" |url=https://www.liberation.fr/societe/2010/11/23/l-invention-de-l-islamophobie_695512/ |access-date= |website=Libération |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Lévy |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Mihaely |first2=Gil |date=2012-10-29 |title=Pascal Bruckner : L'islamophobie, ça n'existe pas ! |url=https://www.causeur.fr/pascal-bruckner-islamophobie-19758 |access-date= |website=Causeur |language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] is criticized for restricting [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]] by describing [[apostasy]] and [[heresy]] as Islamophobia.&lt;ref name="j971"&gt;{{cite book | last=Marshall | first=Paul | last2=Shea | first2=Nina | title=Silenced: How Apostasy and Blasphemy Codes are Choking Freedom Worldwide | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=1 December 2011 | isbn=978-0-19-981226-4 | doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199812264.001.0001 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Islamophobia as formulated by Runnymede was criticized by [[Fred Halliday]]. He writes that the target of hostility in the modern era is not Islam and its tenets as much as it is Muslims, suggesting that a more accurate term would be "Anti-Muslimism". He also states that strains and types of prejudice against Islam and Muslims vary across different nations and cultures, which is not recognized in the Runnymede analysis, as it was specifically about Muslims in Britain.&lt;ref name="Aldridge1"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Aldridge |first=Alan |title=Religion in the Contemporary World: A Sociological Introduction |date=1 February 2000 |publisher=Polity Press |isbn=978-0-7456-2083-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/religionincontem0000aldr/page/138 138] |url=https://archive.org/details/religionincontem0000aldr/page/138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poole responds that many Islamophobic discourses attack what they perceive to be Islam's tenets, while Miles and Brown write that Islamophobia is usually based upon negative stereotypes about Islam which are then translated into attacks on Muslims. They also argue that "the existence of different 'Islamophobias' does not invalidate the concept of Islamophobia any more than the existence of different racisms invalidates the concept of racism."{{sfn|Miles|Brown|2003|p=166}}{{sfn|Miles|Brown|2003|p=165}}{{sfn|Poole|2003|p=219}} In a 2011 paper in ''American Behavioral Scientist'', Erik Bleich stated "there is no widely accepted definition of Islamophobia that permits systematic comparative and causal analysis", and advances "indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims" as a possible solution to this issue.&lt;ref name="Bleich"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bleich | first1 = Erik | year = 2011 | title = What Is Islamophobia and How Much Is There? Theorizing and Measuring an Emerging Comparative Concept | journal = [[American Behavioral Scientist]] | volume = 55 | issue = 12| pages = 1581–1600 | doi=10.1177/0002764211409387| s2cid = 143679557 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to differentiate between prejudiced views of Islam and secularly motivated criticism of Islam, Roland Imhoff and Julia Recker formulated the concept "Islamoprejudice", which they subsequently operationalised in an experiment. The experiment showed that their definition provided a tool for accurate differentiation.&lt;ref name=Imhoff&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Imhoff |first1= Roland |last2 = Recker |first2 = Julia |date = 2012-08-17 |title=Differentiating Islamophobia: Introducing a new scale to measure Islamoprejudice and Secular Islam Critique |url=https://www.academia.edu/545302 |journal = [[Political Psychology]] |publisher = [[International Society of Political Psychology]] |via = [[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]] |publication-date = December 2012 |volume = 33 |issue = 6 |pages = 811–924 |doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00911.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, other researchers' experimental work indicates that, even when Westerners seem to make an effort to distinguish between criticizing (Muslim) ideas and values and respecting Muslims as persons, they still show prejudice and discrimination of Muslims—compared to non-Muslims—when these targets defend [[Illiberal democracy|illiberal]] causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/pops.12416|title = Western Anti-Muslim Prejudice: Value Conflict or Discrimination of Persons Too?| journal=Political Psychology| volume=39| issue=2| pages=281–301|year = 2018|last1 = Van Der Noll|first1 = Jolanda| last2=Saroglou| first2=Vassilis| last3=Latour| first3=David| last4=Dolezal| first4=Nathalie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
