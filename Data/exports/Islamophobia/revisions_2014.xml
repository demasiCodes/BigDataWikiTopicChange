{{Discrimination sidebar}}
'''Islamophobia''' is a term for [[prejudice]] against, hatred towards, or fear of Islamic doctrine, Muslims, or of ethnic groups perceived to be Muslim. While the term is widely recognized and used, both the term and the underlying concept have been criticized.

Some scholars have defined it as a type of [[racism]], the causes and characteristics of Islamophobia are still debated. Some commentators have posited an increase in Islamophobia resulting from the [[September 11 attacks]] while others have associated it with the increased presence of Muslims in [[Western culture|Western]] nations.

== Etymology and definitions ==
The word ''Islamophobia'' is a [[neologism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2013-09-19 |url=http://uni-bonn.academia.edu/RolandImhoff/Papers/544018/Differentiating_Islamophobia_Introducing_a_new_scale_to_measure_Islamoprejudice_and_Secular_Islam_Critique |title=Differentiating Islamophobia: Introducing a new scale to measure Islamoprejudice and Secular Islam Critique |author=Roland Imhoff &amp; Julia Recker (University of Bonn) |publisher= |year=}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed from ''Islam'' and ''-phobia'', a [[suffix]] used in English to form "nouns with the sense ‘fear of ——’, ‘aversion to ——’."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/142572?rskey=Glm8gY&amp;result=2#eid|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Oxford English Dictionary: -phobia, ''comb. form''}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound form ''Islamo-'' contains the [[thematic stem|thematic vowel]] ''[[:wikt:-o-|-o-]]'', and is found in earlier coinages such as ''Islamo-Christian'' from the 19th century.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word means "Intense dislike or fear of Islam, esp. as a political force; hostility or prejudice towards Muslims" and is [[Attested language|attested to]] in English as early as 1923.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248449?|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Oxford English Dictionary: Islamophobia}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mattias Gardell]] defines Islamophobia as "socially reproduced prejudices and aversion to Islam and Muslims, as well as actions and practices that attack, exclude or discriminate against persons on the basis that they are or perceived to be Muslim and be associated with Islam".&lt;ref name=levandedefinitioner/&gt;

===Runnymede Trust===
In 1996, the [[Runnymede Trust]] established the Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, chaired by [[Gordon Conway]], the [[vice-chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of Sussex]]. The Commission's report, ''Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All'', was published in November 1997 by the Home Secretary, [[Jack Straw]]. In the Runnymede report, Islamophobia was defined as "an outlook or world-view involving an unfounded dread and dislike of Muslims, which results in practices of exclusion and discrimination."&lt;ref name="EoRE215"&gt;Encyclopedia of Race and Ethics, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

The report went on to state that Islamophobia is the "dread or hatred of Islam and therefore, [the] fear and dislike of all Muslims," which also includes [[discrimination]] against Muslims through their exclusion from the economic, social, and public life of the nation. The opinions that Islam has no values in common with other cultures, that it is inferior to Western cultures, and is a violent [[political ideology]] rather than a [[religion]] are also, according to the report, part of the concept of Islamophobia.&lt;ref name=Runnymede5&gt;Runnymede 1997, p. 5, cited in Quraishi 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate on the term and its limitations===
At a 2009 symposium on "Islamophobia and Religious Discrimination", Robin Richardson, a former director of the Runnymede Trust&lt;ref&gt;http://www.runnymedetrust.org/bgRanimed.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the editor of ''Islamophobia: a challenge for us all'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcb.org.uk/article_detail.php?article=announcement-862&lt;/ref&gt; said that "the disadvantages of the term Islamophobia are significant" on seven different grounds, including that it implies it is merely a "severe mental illness" affecting "only a tiny minority of people"; that use of the term makes those to whom it is applied "defensive and defiant" and absolves the user of "the responsibility of trying to understand them" or trying to change their views; that it implies that hostility to Muslims is divorced from factors such as skin color, immigrant status, fear of fundamentalism, or political or economic conflicts; that it conflates prejudice against Muslims in one's own country with dislike of Muslims in countries with which the West is in conflict; that it fails to distinguish between people who are against all religion from people who dislike Islam specifically; and that the actual issue being described is hostility to Muslims, "an ethno-religious identity within European countries", rather than hostility to Islam. Nonetheless, he argued that the term is here to stay, and that it is important to define it precisely.&lt;ref name=Richardson2009&gt;Richardson, Robin (December 2009). {{PDFlink|[http://www.insted.co.uk/anti-muslim-racism.pdf "Islamophobia or anti-muslim racism&amp;nbsp;– or what?"]|119&amp;nbsp;KB}}, Insted website. Accessed December 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact definition of Islamophobia continues to be discussed with academics such as [[Chris Allen (academic)|Chris Allen]] saying it lacks a clear definition.&lt;ref name=termlimits&gt;* {{cite book|author=[[Chris Allen (academic)|Allen, Chris]]|title=Islamophobia|publisher=Ashgate|year=2010|isbn=978-0754651390|page=21}}

[[Johannes Kandel]], in a 2006 comment wrote that Islamophobia "is a vague term which encompasses every conceivable actual and imagined act of hostility against Muslims", and proceeds to argue that five of the criteria put forward by The Runnymede trust are invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Kandel, Johannes (August 2006). {{PDFlink|[http://www.fes.de/BerlinerAkademiegespraeche/publikationen/islamundpolitik/documents/Islamophobia.pdf Islamophobia&amp;nbsp;– On the Career of a Controversial Term]|118&amp;nbsp;KB}}, [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation|Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung]]&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published in the June 2013 edition of [[Standpoint (magazine)|''Standpoint'']], [[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] argued that "the term 'Islamophobia' is so inexact that - in so far as there is a definition - it includes insult of and even inquiry into any aspect of Islam, including Muslim scripture."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Murray "Forget 'Islamophobia'.

===Fear===
As opposed to being a psychological or individualistic phobia, according to professor of religion Peter Gottschalk and Gabriel Greenberg, "Islamophobia" connotes a [[social anxiety]] about Islam and Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wesleyan.edu/newsletter/campus/2007/1107islambook.html |title=Faculty, Alumnus Discuss Concept of "Islamophobia" in Co-Authored Book |accessdate=2007-12-29 |date=2007-11-20 |author=Corrina Balash Kerr |work=[[Wesleyan University]] Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/6181/1/296/ |title=Images of Muslims: Discussing Islamophobia with Peter Gottschalk |accessdate=2007-12-29 |date=2007-11-19 |work=Political Affairs. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071206034654/http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/6181/1/296/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some social scientists have adopted this definition and developed instruments to measure Islamophobia in form of fearful attitudes towards, and avoidance of, Muslims and Islam,&lt;ref&gt;Lee, S. A., Gibbons, J. A., Thompson, J. M., &amp; Timani, H. S. : "The islamophobia scale: Instrument development and initial validation.", ''International Journal for the Psychology of Religion'', Vol. 19, No. 2 (2009), pp.92-105, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10508610802711137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kunst2012b&gt;Kunst, J. R., Sam, D. L., &amp; Ulleberg, P.: "Perceived islamophobia: Scale development and validation", ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations'', Advance online publication (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.11.001&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Islamophobia should "essentially be understood as an affective part of social stigma towards Islam and Muslims, namely fear" (p.&amp;nbsp;2).&lt;ref name="kunst2012b"/&gt;

===Racism===
Several scholars consider Islamophobia as a form of racism.&lt;ref name=racismquotes/&gt; A 2007 article in ''Journal of Sociology'' defines Islamophobia as anti-Muslim racism and a continuation of anti-[[Asian people|Asian]] and [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab]] racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1177/1440783307073935|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]] has drawn parallels between modern Islamophobia and the [[antisemitism]] of the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6832035.ece The Times: Fascism fears: John Denham speaks out over clashes]&lt;/ref&gt; so have [[Maud Olofsson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_3674445.svd SvD: Reinfeldt: Kärnan i partiets idé]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jan Hjärpe]], among others.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/article/1055298--islamophobia-the-new-anti-semitism | location=Toronto | work=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/artikel_3674029.svd SvD: Sverigedemokrat till hårt angrepp mot muslimsk ideologi i tal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10089287 VG: Erna Solberg mener muslimer hetses som jødene på 30-tallet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/politics/06-Nov-2010/Islamophobia-like-1930s-antiSemitism-OIC-chief The Nation: Islamophobia like 1930s anti-Semitism: OIC chief]&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Doug Saunders]] has drawn parallels between current Islamophobia and the older [[Anti-Catholicism|discrimination and hate]] against [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Doug (18 September 2012).

Others have questioned the supposed relationship between Islamophobia and racism. Jocelyne Cesari writes that "academics are still debating the legitimacy of the term and questioning how it differs from other terms such as racism, anti-Islamism, anti-Muslimness, and anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyne Cesari [http://www.euro-islam.info/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/securitization_and_religious_divides_in_europe.pdf "Muslims In Western Europe After 9/11: Why the term Islamophobia is more a predicament than an explanation"] Submission to the Changing Landscape of Citizenship and Security: 6th PCRD of European Commission. 1 June 2006: p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cesariA&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamophobia: The Challenge of Pluralism in the 21st Century|editor=[[John L.

The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) defines Islamophobia as the fear of or prejudiced viewpoint towards Islam, Muslims and matters pertaining to them (ECRI 2006). Whether it takes the shape of daily forms of racism and discrimination or more violent forms, Islamophobia is a violation of human rights and a threat to social cohesion".&lt;ref name=levandedefinitioner&gt;[http://www.levandehistoria.se/fakta-fordjupning/islamofobi/definitioner-och-uttryck Levande Historia: Islamofobi – definitioner och uttryck]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been defined as "fear of Muslims and Islam; rejection of the Muslim religion; or a form of differentialist racism" (Helbling 2011).&lt;ref name=levandedefinitioner/&gt;

===Proposed alternatives===
The concept of Islamophobia as formulated by Runnymede was also criticized by professor [[Fred Halliday]] on several levels. He writes that the target of hostility in the modern era is not Islam and its tenets as much as it is Muslims, suggesting that a more accurate term would be "Anti-Muslimism." He also states that strains and types of prejudice against Islam and Muslims vary across different nations and cultures, which is not recognized in the Runnymede analysis, which was specifically about Muslims in Britain.&lt;ref name="Aldridge1"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Aldridge |first=Alan |title=Religion in the Contemporary World: A Sociological Introduction |date=February 1, 2000 |publisher=Polity Press |isbn=978-0-7456-2083-1 |page=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poole responds that many Islamophobic discourses attack what they perceive to be Islam's tenets, while Miles and Brown write that Islamophobia is usually based upon negative stereotypes about Islam which are then translated into attacks on Muslims. They also argue that "the existence of different ‘Islamophobias’ does not invalidate the concept of Islamophobia any more than the existence of different racisms invalidates the concept of racism."&lt;ref name="MB165"&gt;Miles; Brown (2003) pp. 165–166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Poole, E. (2003) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 paper in ''[[American Behavioral Scientist]]'', Erik Bleich stated "there is no widely accepted definition of Islamophobia that permits systematic comparative and causal analysis",&lt;ref name="Bleich"&gt;Bleich, Erik (December 2011). [http://abs.sagepub.com/content/55/12/1581.abstract "What Is Islamophobia and How Much Is There? Theorizing and Measuring an Emerging Comparative Concept"], ''[[American Behavioral Scientist]]'', vol. 55 no. 12, pp. 1581-1600.&lt;/ref&gt; and advances "indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims" as a possible solution to this issue.

In order to differentiate between prejudiced views of Islam and secularly motivated criticism of Islam, Roland Imhoff and Julia Recker formulated the concept "Islamoprejudice", which they subsequently operationalised in an experiment. The experiment showed that their definition provided a tool for accurate differentiation.&lt;ref name=Imhoff&gt;Imhoff, Roland &amp; Recker, Julia [http://uni-bonn.academia.edu/RolandImhoff/Papers/544018/Differentiating_Islamophobia_Introducing_a_new_scale_to_measure_Islamoprejudice_and_Secular_Islam_Critique “Differentiating Islamophobia: Introducing a new scale to measure Islamoprejudice and Secular Islam Critique”] Journal of Political Psychology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and causes==

===History of the term===
One early use cited as the term's first use is by the painter [[Étienne Dinet|Alphonse Étienne Dinet]] and [[Algeria]]n intellectual Sliman ben Ibrahim in their 1918 biography of Islam's prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=La Vie de Mohammed, Prophète d’Allah |last1=Dinet |first1=Alphonse Étienne |last2=ben Ibrahim |first2=Sliman |year=1918 |publisher= |location=Paris}} cited from {{Cite book|last1=Otterbeck|first1=Jonas|last2=Bevelander|first2=Pieter|year=2006|title=Islamofobi&amp;nbsp;— en studie av begreppet, ungdomars attityder och unga muslimars utsatthet|publisher=Forum för levande historia| publication-place=Stockholm |language=Swedish|isbn=91-976073-6-3|url=http://www.levandehistoria.se/files/islamofobi.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=23 November 2011|quote="modern orientalists [are partially] influenced by an islamofobia, which is poorly reconciled with science and hardly worthy of our time"|others=Anders Lange|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

''Islamophobia''. [[Ashgate Publishing]]. pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in French, they used the term ''islamophobie''. Robin Richardson writes that in the English version of the book the word was not translated as "Islamophobia" but rather as "feelings inimical to Islam". Dahou Ezzerhouni has cited several other uses in French as early as 1910, and from 1912 to 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Ezzerhouni, Dahou. [http://www.algerie-focus.com/2010/02/03/lislamophobie-un-racisme-apparu-avec-les-colonisations/ "L'islamophobie, un racisme apparu avec les colonisations"], ''Algerie-Focus'', February 3, 2010. "Le mot serai ainsi apparu pour la première fois dans quelques ouvrages du début du XXème siècle. On peut citer entre autre « La politique musulmane dans l’Afrique Occidentale Française » d’Alain Quellien publié en 1910, suivi de quelques citations dans la Revue du Monde Musulman en 1912 et 1918, la Revue du Mercure de France en 1912, « Haut-Sénégal-Niger » de Maurice Delafosse en 1912 et dans le Journal of Theological Studies en 1924. L’année suivante, Etienne Dinet et Slimane Ben Brahim, employaient ce terme qui «conduit à l’aberration » dans leur ouvrage « L’Orient vu par l’Occident »."&lt;/ref&gt; These early uses of the term did not, according to [[Chris Allen (academic)|Christopher Allen]], have the same meaning as in contemporary usage, as they described a fear of Islam by liberal Muslims and Muslim feminists, rather than a fear or dislike/hatred of Muslims by non-Muslims.&lt;ref name=Allen2010pp5-6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen2007&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?ots591=0c54e3b3-1e9c-be1e-2c24-a6a8c7060233&amp;lng=en&amp;id=45668|title=Islamophobia and its Consequences|author=[[Chris Allen (academic)|Chris Allen]]|journal=European Islam|publisher=Centre for European Policy Studies|year=2007|pages=144 to 167}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Fernando Bravo Lopez argues that Dinet and ibn Sliman's use of the term was as a criticism of overly hostile attitudes to Islam by a Belgian orientalist, Henri Lammens, whose project they saw as a "'pseudo-scientific crusade in the hope of bringing Islam down once and for all.'" He also notes that an early definition of Islamophobia appears in the Ph.D. thesis of Alain Quellien, a French colonial bureaucrat:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For some, the Muslim is the natural and irreconcilable enemy of the Christian and the European; Islam is the negation of civilization, and barbarism, bad faith and cruelty are the best one can expect from the Mohammedans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Furthermore, he notes that Quellien's work draws heavily on the work of the French colonial department's 1902-06 administrator, who published a work in 1906, which to a great extent mirrors [[John Esposito]]'s ''The Islamic Threat: Myth or Reality?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1080/01419870.2010.528440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded use of the term in English, according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], was in 1923 in an article in ''[[The Journal of Theological Studies]]''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The term entered into common usage with the publication of the Runnymede Trust's report in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Otterbeck|first1=Jonas|last2=Bevelander|first2=Pieter|year=2006|title=Islamofobi&amp;nbsp;— en studie av begreppet, ungdomars attityder och unga muslimars utsatthet|publisher=Forum för levande historia| publication-place=Stockholm |language=Swedish|isbn=91-976073-6-3|url=http://www.levandehistoria.se/files/islamofobi.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2011|others=Anders Lange|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Contrasting views on Islam===
The Runnymede report contrasted "open" and "closed" views of Islam, and stated that the following eight "closed" views are equated with Islamophobia:

:#Islam is seen as a monolithic bloc, static and unresponsive to change.
:#It is seen as separate and "other." It does not have values in common with other cultures, is not affected by them and does not influence them.
:#It is seen as inferior to the West. It is seen as barbaric, irrational, primitive, and [[sexist]].
:#It is seen as violent, aggressive, threatening, supportive of [[terrorism]], and engaged in a [[clash of civilizations]].
:#It is seen as a political [[ideology]], used for political or military advantage.
:#Criticisms made of "the West" by Muslims are rejected out of hand.
:#Hostility towards Islam is used to justify discriminatory practices towards Muslims and exclusion of Muslims from mainstream society.
:#Anti-Muslim hostility is seen as natural and normal.&lt;ref name=Runnymede1997&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/publications/pdfs/islamophobia.pdf "Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All"]|69.7&amp;nbsp;KB}}, ''Runnymede Trust'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

These "closed" views are contrasted, in the report, with "open" views on Islam which, while founded on respect for Islam, permit legitimate disagreement, dialogue and critique.&lt;ref&gt;Benn; Jawad (2004) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benn and Jawad, The Runnymede Trust notes that anti-Muslim discourse is increasingly seen as respectable, providing examples on how hostility towards Islam and Muslims is accepted as normal, even among those who may actively challenge other prevalent forms of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Brill165"&gt;Benn; Jawad (2004) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity politics===
It has been suggested that Islamophobia is closely related to [[identity politics]], and gives its adherents the perceived benefit of constructing their identity in opposition to a negative, essentialized image of Muslims. This occurs in the form of self-righteousness, assignment of blame and key identity markers.&lt;ref name="doving1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Døving |first1=Cora Alexa |year=2010 |title=Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia: A Comparison of Imposed Group Identities |journal=Tidsskrift for Islamforskning |issue=2 |pages=52–76 |publisher=Forum for Islamforskning |url=http://islamforskning.dk/files/journal/2010/FIFO-2010-2-del4.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davina Bhandar writes that:&lt;ref name="Bhandar"&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1080/13621021003731963|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=[...] the term ‘cultural’ has become synonymous with the category of the ethnic or minority (...). It views culture as an entity that is highly abstracted from the practices of daily life and therefore represents the illusion that there exists a spirit of the people. This formulation leads to the homogenisation of cultural identity and the ascription of particular values and proclivities onto minority cultural groups.}}

She views this as an [[ontology|ontological]] trap that hinders the perception of culture as something "materially situated in the living practices of the everyday, situated in time-space and not based in abstract projections of what constitutes either a particular tradition or culture."

In some societies, Islamophobia has materialized due to the portrayal of Islam and Muslims as the national "[[Other]]", where exclusion and discrimination occurs on the basis of their religion and civilization which differs with national tradition and identity. Examples include Pakistani and Algerian migrants in Britain and France respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Poole, E. (2003) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Brown-p163"/&gt; This sentiment, according to Malcolm Brown and Robert Miles, significantly interacts with [[racism]], although Islamophobia itself is not racism.&lt;ref name="Miles; Brown 2003 p. 163, 164"&gt;Miles; Brown (2003) pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown and Miles write that another feature of Islamophobic discourse is to amalgamate nationality (e.g. Arab), religion (Islam), and politics (terrorism, fundamentalism)&amp;nbsp;— while most other religions are not associated with terrorism, or even "ethnic or national distinctiveness."&lt;ref name = "Brown-p163"&gt;Miles; Brown (2003) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; They feel that "many of the stereotypes and misinformation that contribute to the articulation of Islamophobia are rooted in a particular perception of Islam", such as the notion that Islam promotes terrorism&amp;nbsp;— especially prevalent after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Miles; Brown (2003) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-way stereotyping resulting from Islamophobia has in some instances resulted in mainstreaming of earlier controversial discourses, such as liberal attitudes towards gender equality&lt;ref name="doving1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhandar"/&gt; and homosexuals.&lt;ref name=Mepschen2010&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1177/0038038510375740|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christina Ho has warned against framing of such mainstreaming of gender equality in a [[colonialism|colonial]], [[paternalism|paternal]] discourse, arguing that this may undermine minority women's ability to speak out about their concerns.&lt;ref name=Ho2007&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1016/j.wsif.2007.05.002|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Links to ideologies===
Senior scientist at [[Norwegian Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities|the Norwegian Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities]], Cora Alexa Døving, argues that there are significant similarities between Islamophobic discourse and European pre-Nazi antisemitism.&lt;ref name="doving1"/&gt; Among the concerns are imagined threats of minority growth and domination, threats to traditional institutions and customs, skepticism of integration, threats to secularism, fears of sexual crimes, fears of misogyny, fears based on historical cultural inferiority, hostility to modern Western Enlightenment values, etc.

[[Matti Bunzl]] has argued that there are important differences between Islamophobia and antisemitism. While antisemitism was a phenomenon closely connected to European [[nation-building]] processes, he sees Islamophobia as having the concern of European civilization as its focal point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-semitism and Islamophobia: hatreds old and new in Europe |last=Bunzl |first=Matti |year=2007 |publisher=Prickly Paradigm Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-9761475-8-9 |page=13 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=37UsAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Islamophobic+claims%22#search_anchor |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Døving, on the other hand, maintains that, at least in Norway, the Islamophobic discourse has a clear national element.&lt;ref name="doving1"/&gt; In a reply to Bunzl, French scholar of Jewish history, Esther Benbassa, agrees with him in that he draws a clear connection between modern hostile and essentializing sentiments towards Muslims and historical antisemitism. However, she argues against the use of the term ''Islamophobia'', since, in her opinion, it attracts unwarranted attention to an underlying racist current.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia: Hatred Old and New in Europe |chapter=Xenophobia, Anti-Semitism, and Racism |last=Benbassa |first=Esther |year=2007 |publisher=Prickly Paradigm Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-9761475-8-9 |page=86f |url=http://www.estherbenbassa.net/SCANS/XENOPHOBIA.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=23 November 2011 |editor2-last=Bunzl |editor8-first=Matti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the Media Responsibility Institute in [[Erlangen]], Sabine Schiffer, and researcher Constantin Wagner, who also define Islamophobia as anti-Muslim racism, outline additional similarities and differences between Islamophobia and antisemitism.&lt;ref name =schiffer&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1177/0306396810389927|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt; They point out the existence of equivalent notions such as "Judaisation/Islamisation", and metaphors such as "a state within a state" are used in relation to both Jews and Muslims. In addition, both discourses make use of, among other rhetorical instruments, "religious imperatives" supposedly "proven" by religious sources, and conspiracy theories.

The differences between Islamophobia and antisemitism consist of the nature of the perceived threats to the "Christian West". Muslims are perceived as "inferior" and as a visible "external threat", while on the other hand, Jews are perceived as "omnipotent" and as an invisible "internal threat". However, Schiffer and Wagner also note that there is a growing tendency to view Muslims as a privileged group that constitute an "internal threat", and that this convergence between the two discources makes "it more and more necessary to use findings from the study of anti-Semitism to analyse Islamophobia". Schiffer and Wagner conclude,

{{quote|The achievement in the study of anti-Semitism of examining Jewry and anti-Semitism separately must also be transferred to other racisms, such as Islamophobia. We do not need more information about Islam, but more information about the making of racist stereotypes in general.}}

The publication ''Social Work and Minorities: European Perspectives'' describes Islamophobia as the new form of racism in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson; Soydan; Williams (1998) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that "Islamophobia is as much a form of racism as [[anti-semitism]], a term more commonly encountered in Europe as a sibling of racism, xenophobia and Intolerance."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson; Soydan; Williams (1998) p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Said]] considers Islamophobia as it is evinced in [[Orientalism]] to be a trend in a more general antisemitic Western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Edward W. Said, ‘Orientalism Reconsidered’ in Francis Barker, Peter Hulme, Margaret Iversen, Diana Loxley (eds),'' Literature, Politics, and Theory,'' Methuen &amp; Co, London 1986 pp.210–229, pp.220f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan S. Turner (sociologist)|Bryan Stanley Turner]], introd. to Bryan S. Turner (ed.) ''Orientalism: Early Sources'', (Vol 1, Readings in Orientalism), Routledge, London (2000) reprint 2002 p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Other note that there have been a transition from anti-Asian and anti-Arab racism to anti-Muslim racism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jos.sagepub.com/content/43/1/61.abstract The resistible rise of Islamophobia - Anti-Muslim racism in the UK and Australia before 11 September 2001], [[Journal of Sociology]] March 2007 vol. 43 no. 1 61-86&lt;/ref&gt; while some note a racialization of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[Contemporary racism and Islamaphobia in Australia - Racializing religion], Ethnicities December 2007 vol. 7 no. 4 564-589&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 report by a UK anti-racism group, [[counterjihad|counter-jihadist]] outfits in Europe and North America are becoming more cohesive by forging alliances, with 190 groups now identified as promoting an Islamophobic agenda.&lt;ref name = "MaTo 14Apr2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/14/breivik-trial-norway-mass-murderer |title= Far-right anti-Muslim network on rise globally as Breivik trial opens |author= Mark Townsend |date= 14 April 2012 |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 15 April 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Islamophobia and its consequences on young people'' (p.&amp;nbsp;6) Ingrid Ramberg writes "Whether it takes the shape of daily forms of racism and discrimination or more violent forms, Islamophobia is a violation of human rights and a threat to social cohesion.". Professor [[John Esposito]] of [[Georgetown University]] calls Islamophobia "the new anti-Semitism".&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt;

[[Mohamed Nimer]] compares Islamophobia with anti-Americanism. He argues that while both Islam and America can be subject to legitimate criticisms without detesting a people as a whole, bigotry against both are on the rise.&lt;ref name=NimerA&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamophobia: The Challenge of Pluralism in the 21st Century|editor=[[John L. Esposito]]|author=Mohamed Nimer|year=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0199753642|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiculturalism===
According to Gabrielle Maranci, the increasing Islamophobia in the West is related to a rising repudiation of [[multiculturalism]]. Islam is widely regarded as the most resistant culture against Western, democratic values and its Judaeo-Christian heritage. Maranci concludes that "Islamophobia is a ‘phobia’ of multiculturalism and the transruptive effect that Islam can have in Europe and the West through transcultural processes."&lt;ref&gt;Gabriele Marranci: "Multiculturalism, Islam and the clash of civilisations theory: rethinking Islamophobia", ''Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', Vol. 5, No. 1 (2004), pp.105-117 (116f.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of Islamophobia==

===Media===
[[File:Gathering of eagles.jpg|thumb|An American protester self-identifying as Islamophobic.]]
According to Elizabeth Poole in the ''Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic Studies'', the media has been criticized for perpetrating Islamophobia. She cites a case study examining a sample of articles in the British press from between 1994 and 2004, which concluded that Muslim viewpoints were underrepresented and that issues involving Muslims usually depicted them in a negative light. Such portrayals, according to Poole, include the depiction of Islam and Muslims as a threat to Western security and values.&lt;ref&gt;Poole, E. (2003) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Benn and Jawad write that hostility towards Islam and Muslims are "closely linked to media portrayals of Islam as barbaric, irrational, primitive and sexist."&lt;ref name="Brill165"/&gt; Egorova and Tudor cite European researchers in suggesting that expressions used in the media such as "Islamic terrorism", "Islamic bombs" and "violent Islam" have resulted in a negative perception of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;See Egorova; Tudor (2003) pp. 2–3, which cites the conclusions of Marquina and Rebolledo in: "A. Marquina, V. G. Rebolledo, ‘The Dialogue between the European Union and the Islamic World’ in Interreligious Dialogues: Christians, Jews, Muslims, Annals of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts, v. 24, no. 10, Austria, 2000, pp. 166–8. "&lt;/ref&gt; John E. Richardson's 2004 book ''(Mis)representing Islam: the racism and rhetoric of British broadsheet newspapers'', criticized the [[Media of the United Kingdom|British media]] for propagating negative [[Stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims|stereotypes of Muslims]] and fueling anti-Muslim prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Richardson|first=John E.|title=(Mis)representing Islam: the racism and rhetoric of British broadsheet newspapers|publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]]|year=2004|isbn=90-272-2699-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WanqiF2XULsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study conducted by John E. Richardson, he found that 85% of mainstream newspaper articles treated Muslims as a homogeneous mass who were imagined as a threat to British society.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J. E. (2009). "‘Get Shot of the Lot of Them’: Election Reporting of Muslims in British Newspapers." Patterns of Prejudice 43(3-4): 355-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Mehdi Hasan]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' criticized Western media for over-reporting a few [[Islamist terrorist]] incidents but under-reporting the much larger number of planned non-Islamist terrorist attacks carried out by "non-Irish [[White people|white]] folks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Know your enemy|author=Mehdi Hasan|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=9 July 2009|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2009/07/mehdi-hasan-muslim-terrorism-white-british|accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 study indicates that Muslims across different European countries, such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, experience the highest degree of Islamophobia in the media.&lt;ref name=kunst2012b&gt;Kunst, Sam, &amp; Ulleberg: "Perceived islamophobia: Scale development and validation", ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations'', Advance online publication (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.11.001&lt;/ref&gt;

Media personalities have been accused of Islamophobia. The obituary in ''[[The Guardian]]'' for the Italian journalist [[Oriana Fallaci]] described her as "notorious for her Islamaphobia" [sic].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/italy/story/0,,1873911,00.html Obituary of Oriana Fallaci] – [[The Guardian]], 16 September 2006. "''Controversial Italian journalist famed for her interviews and war reports but notorious for her Islamaphobia''"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some media outlets are working explicitly against Islamophobia. In 2008 [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] ("FAIR") published a study "Smearcasting, How Islamophobes Spread Bigotry, Fear and Misinformation." The report cites several instances where mainstream or close to mainstream journalists, authors and academics have made analyses that essentialize negative traits as an inherent part of Muslims' moral makeup.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Rendall and Isabel Macdonald, [http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3648 Making Islamophobia Mainstream; How Muslim-bashers broadcast their bigotry], summary of [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] report, at its website, November/December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; FAIR also established the "[[Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism]]", designed to monitor coverage in the media and establish dialogue with media organizations. Following the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of September 11, 2001]], the [[Islamic Society of Britain]]'s "Islam Awareness Week" and the "Best of British Islam Festival" were introduced to improve community relations and raise awareness about Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic studies, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] stated that they will launch a TV channel to counter  Islamophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/411340 | title=OIC will launch channel to counter Islamophobia | date=April 19, 2012 | agency=Arab News | accessdate=January 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formed in 2009 to oppose what it considers to be a spread of Islamism, Sharia law and Islamic extremism in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academia.edu/545302/Differentiating_Islamophobia_Introducing_a_new_scale_to_measure_Islamoprejudice_and_Secular_Islam_Critique Differentiating Islamophobia: Introducing a new scale to measure Islamoprejudice and Secular Islam Critique]&lt;/ref&gt; The EDL’s former leader, [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]], left the group in 2013 after admitting that he could not control anti-Muslim extremism within its membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/08/tommy-robinson-english-defence-league|title=Tommy Robinson quits EDL saying it has become 'too extreme'|author=Haroon Siddique|date=8 Oct 2013|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
Islamophobia has become a topic of increasing sociological and political importance.&lt;ref name = "Brown-p163"/&gt; According to Benn and Jawad, Islamophobia has increased since [[Ayatollah Khomeini]]'s denouncement of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' and the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Benn; Jawad (2004) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropologist]] Steven Vertovec writes that the purported growth in Islamophobia may be associated with increased Muslim presence in society and successes.&lt;ref name="Vertovec"&gt;Steven Vertovec, "Islamophobia and Muslim Recognition in Britain"; in Haddad (2002) pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests a [[Vicious circle|circular model]], where increased hostility towards Islam and Muslims results in governmental countermeasures such as institutional guidelines and changes to legislation, which itself may fuel further Islamophobia due to increased accommodation for Muslims in public life. Vertovec concludes: "As the public sphere shifts to provide a more prominent place for Muslims, Islamophobic tendencies may amplify."&lt;ref name="Vertovec" /&gt;

Patel, Humphries, and Naik claim that "Islamophobia has always been present in Western countries and cultures. In the last two decades, it has become accentuated, explicit and extreme."&lt;ref&gt;Naina Patel, Beth Humphries and Don Naik, "The 3 Rs in social work; Religion,‘race’ and racism in Europe", in Johnson; Soydan; Williams (1998) pp. 197–198&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vertovec states that some have observed that Islamophobia has not necessarily escalated in the past decades, but that there has been increased public scrutiny of it.&lt;ref name="Vertovec" /&gt; According to Abduljalil Sajid, one of the members of the Runnymede Trust's Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, "Islamophobias" have existed in varying strains throughout history, with each version possessing its own distinct features as well as similarities or adaptations from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Islamophobia: A new word for an old fear |url=http://www.wcrp.be/articles/Sajid9-11-04.htm |author=Imam Dr Abduljalil Sajid |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005 [[Ziauddin Sardar]], an [[Islamic scholar]], wrote in the  ''New Statesman'' that Islamophobia is a widespread European phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Sardar&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/152128 "The next holocaust"], ''New Statesman'', 5 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that each country has anti-Muslim political figures, citing [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in France; [[Pim Fortuyn]] in the Netherlands; and Philippe van der Sande of [[Vlaams Blok]], a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] nationalist party in Belgium. Sardar argued that Europe is "post-colonial, but ambivalent." Minorities are regarded as acceptable as an underclass of menial workers, but if they want to be upwardly mobile anti-Muslim prejudice rises to the surface. Wolfram Richter, professor of economics at [[Dortmund University of Technology]], told Sardar: "I am afraid we have not learned from our history. My main fear is that [[Holocaust|what we did to Jews]] we may now do to Muslims. The next holocaust would be against Muslims."&lt;ref name=Sardar/&gt; Similar fears, as noted by [[Kenan Malik]] in his book ''From Fatwa to Jihad'', had been previously expressed in the UK by Muslim philosopher [[Shabbir Akhtar]] in 1989, and Massoud Shadjareh, chair of the [[Islamic Human Rights Commission]] in 2000. In 2006 [[Salma Yaqoob]], a [[Respect Party]] Councillor, claimed that Muslims in Britain were "subject to attacks reminiscent of the gathering storm of anti-Semitism in the first decades of the last century.".&lt;ref name=malik131-2&gt;Malik, Kenan. ''From Fatwa to Jihad''. Atlantic Books, London (2009): pp. 131-32.&lt;/ref&gt; Malik, a senior visiting fellow in the Department of Political, International and Policy Studies at the [[University of Surrey]], has described these claims of a brewing holocaust as "hysterical to the point of delusion"; whereas Jews in Hitler's Germany were given the official designation of ''[[Untermenschen]]'', and were subject to escalating legislation which diminished and ultimately removed their rights as citizens, Malik noted that in cases where "Muslims are singled out in Britain, it is often for privileged treatment"  such as the 2005 legislation banning "incitement to religious hatred", the special funding Muslim organizations and bodies receive from local and national government, the special provisions made by workplaces, school and leisure centres for Muslims, and even suggestions by the Archbishop of Canterbury [[Rowan Williams]] and the former Lord Chief Justice, [[Nicholas Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers|Lord Phillips]], that [[sharia]] law should be introduced into Britain.&lt;ref name=malik132&gt;Malik (2009): p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The fact is, wrote Malik, that such well-respected public figures as Akhtar, Shadjareh and Yaqoob need "a history lesson about the real Holocaust reveals how warped the Muslim grievance culture has become."&lt;ref name=malik132/&gt;

In 2006 [[ABC News]] reported that "[p]ublic views of Islam are one casualty of the post-Sept. 11, 2001 conflict: Nearly six in 10 Americans think the religion is prone to violent extremism, nearly half regard it unfavorably, and a remarkable one in four admits to prejudicial feelings against Muslims and Arabs alike." They also report that 27 percent of Americans admit feelings of prejudice against Muslims.&lt;ref name=ABCMarch8&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=1700599 "Poll: Americans Skeptical of Islam and Arabs"], ”ABC News”, March 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Gallup polls in 2006 found that 40 percent of Americans admit to prejudice against Muslims, and 39 percent believe Muslims should carry special identification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=2413473&amp;page=2 "Islamophobia Felt 5 Years after 9/11"], ''Good Morning America'', September 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Associate Professor [[Deepa Kumar]] writes that "Islamophobia is about politics rather than religion per se"&lt;ref name=Kumarbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Kumar|title=Islamophobia and the Politics of Empire|year=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1608462117|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and that modern-day demonization of Arabs and Muslims by US politicians and others is racist and Islamophobic, and employed in support of what she describes as an unjust war. About the public impact of this rhetoric, she says that "One of the consequences of the relentless attacks on Islam and Muslims by politicians and the media is that Islamophobic sentiment is on the rise." She also chides some "people on the left" for using the same "Islamophobic logic as the Bush regime".&lt;ref name="Fighting Islamophobia"&gt;[http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/kumar030406.html Fighting Islamophobia: A Response to Critics]&amp;nbsp;– Deepa Kumar, MRZine, February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In this regards, Kumar confirms the assertions of [[Stephen Sheehi]], who "conceptualises Islamophobia as an ideological formation within the context of the American empire. Doing so “allows us to remove it from the hands of ‘culture’ or from the myth of a single creator or progenitor, whether it be a person, organisation or community.” An ideological formation, in this telling, is a constellation of networks that produce, proliferate, benefit from, and traffic in Islamophobic discourses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/news/732513/cover-story-islamophobia-an-ideological-formation] "Cover Story: Islamophobia as an Ideological Formation" Dawn, August 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer and scholar on religion [[Reza Aslan]] has said that "Islamophobia has become so mainstream in this country that Americans have been trained to expect violence against Muslims&amp;nbsp;— not excuse it, but expect it"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/11/us/if-the-sikh-temple-had-been-a-muslim-mosque-on-religion.html "If the Sikh Temple Had Been a Mosque" Samuel G Freedman] ''New York Times'', August 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2010 [[British Social Attitudes Survey]] found that the British public "is far more likely to hold negative views of Muslims than of any other religious group,"&lt;ref name=Galloway&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinister parallels of hatred|date=14 March 2010|author=[[George Galloway]]|work=[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/87933|accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "just one in four" feeling "positively about Islam," and a "majority of the country would be concerned if a mosque was built in their area, while only 15 per cent expressed similar qualms about the opening of a church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Britain divided by Islam, survey finds|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=11 Jan 2010|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6965276/Britain-divided-by-Islam-survey-finds.html|accessdate=2010-04-04 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reports by governmental organizations===
The largest project monitoring Islamophobia was undertaken following 9/11 by the EU watchdog, [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] (EUMC). Their May 2002 report "Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001", written by [[Chris Allen (academic)|Chris Allen]] and Jorgen S. Nielsen of the [[University of Birmingham]], was based on 75 reports&amp;nbsp;— 15 from each EU member nation.&lt;ref name="EUMCNews"&gt;{{Cite news|title=EUMC presents reports on Discrimination and Islamophobia in the EU |publisher="European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia media release" |url=http://www.eumc.europa.eu/eumc/index.php?fuseaction=content.dsp_cat_content&amp;catid=43d8bc25bc89d&amp;contentid=4582ddc822d41 |date=2006-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EUMC&gt;Allen, Chris and Nielsen, Jorgen S. [http://www.raxen.eumc.eu.int/1/webmill.php?id=32813&amp;ditem=3101&amp;lin=detail "Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001"], EUMC, May, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The report highlighted the regularity with which ordinary Muslims became targets for abusive and sometimes violent retaliatory attacks after 9/11. Despite localized differences within each member nation, the recurrence of attacks on recognizable and visible traits of Islam and Muslims was the report's most significant finding. Incidents consisted of verbal abuse, blaming all Muslims for [[List of terrorist incidents|terrorism]], forcibly removing women's [[hijab]]s, spitting on Muslims, calling children "[[Osama bin Laden|Osama]]", and random assaults. Muslims have been hospitalized and on one occasion paralyzed.&lt;ref name=EUMC/&gt; The report also discussed the portrayal of Muslims in the media. Inherent negativity, stereotypical images, fantastical representations, and exaggerated caricatures were all identified. The report concluded that "a greater receptivity towards anti-Muslim and other xenophobic ideas and sentiments has, and may well continue, to become more tolerated."&lt;ref name=EUMC/&gt;

The EUMC has since released a number of publications related to Islamophobia, including ''The Fight against Antisemitism and Islamophobia: Bringing Communities together (European Round Tables Meetings)'' (2003) and ''Muslims in the European Union: Discrimination and Islamophobia'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://fra.europa.eu/fra/index.php?fuseaction=content.dsp_cat_content&amp;catid=1 EUMC website&amp;nbsp;– Publications] {{accessdate|2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor in History of Religion, Anne Sophie Roald, states that Islamophobia was recognized as a form of intolerance alongside [[xenophobia]] and [[antisemitism]] at the "Stockholm International Forum on Combating Intolerance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Anne Sophie |last=Roald|title=New Muslims in the European Context: The Experience of Scandinavian Converts |page=53 |publisher=Brill|year=2004|isbn=90-04-13679-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference, attended by UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]], High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Mary Robinson]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] Secretary General [[Ján Kubis]] and representatives of the [[European Union]] and [[Council of Europe]], adopted a declaration to combat "genocide, ethnic cleansing, racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia and xenophobia, and to combat all forms of racial discrimination and intolerance related to it." &lt;ref name="humanrights.gov.se"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.gov.se/stockholmforum/2001/conference_2001.html |publisher=Chancellery of the Government of Sweden |title=Conference Two: Combating Intolerance |accessdate=19 November 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], in its 5th report to Islamophobia Observatory, finds an "institutionalization and legitimization of the phenomenon of Islamophobia" in the West over the last five years.&lt;ref name=Arabnews121113&gt;{{cite news|title=OIC warns of exploiting Islamophobia phenomenon|url=http://www.arabnews.com/oic-warns-exploiting-islamophobia-phenomenon|accessdate=18 October 2013|newspaper=Arab News|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrationsverket (the Swedish National Integration Board) defined Islamophobia as "racism and discrimination expressed towards Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;[http://motargument.se/2014/02/23/terminologi-islamofobi/ Terminologi – islamofobi] ''"rasistiska och diskriminerande uttryck gentemot muslimer."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research on Islamophobia and its correlates===
Various studies have been conducted to investigate Islamophobia and its correlates among majority populations and among [[Muslim]] minorities themselves. To start with, an experimental study showed that anti-Muslim attitudes may be stronger than more general [[xenophobic]] attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Spruyt, B., &amp; Elchardus, M.: "Are anti-Muslim feelings more widespread than anti-foreigner feelings? Evidence from two split-sample experiments.", ''Ethnicities'', Advance online publication (2012), http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1468796812449707&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, studies indicate that anti-Muslim prejudice among majority populations is primarily explained by the perception of Muslims as a cultural threat, rather than as a threat towards the respective nation's economy.&lt;ref&gt;González, K. V., Verkuyten, M., Weesie, J., &amp; Poppe, E.: "Prejudice Towards Muslims in The Netherlands: Testing Integrated Threat Theory", ''The British journal of social psychology'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (2008), pp.667-685, http://dx.doi.org/10.1348/014466608X28444&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savelkoul, M., Scheepers, P., Tolsma, J., &amp; Hagendoorn, L.: "Anti-Muslim attitudes in the Netherlands: Tests of contradictory hypotheses derived from ethnic competition theory and intergroup contact theory.", ''European Sociological Review'', Vol. 27, No. 6 (2010), pp.741-758, http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcq035&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlueter, E., &amp; Scheepers, P.: "The relationship between outgroup size and anti-outgroup attitudes: A theoretical synthesis and empirical test of group threat- and intergroup contact theory", ''Social Science Research'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (2010), pp.285-295, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2009.07.006&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies focusing on the experience of Islamophobia among Muslims have shown that the experience of [[religious discrimination]] is associated with lower national identification and higher religious identification.&lt;ref name=kunst2012a&gt;Kunst, J. R., Tajamal, H., Sam, D. L., &amp; Ulleberg, P. : "Coping with Islamophobia: The effects of religious stigma on Muslim minorities' identity formation.", ''International Journal of Intercultural Relations'', Vol. 36, No. 4 (2012), pp.518-532, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijintrel.2011.12.014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verkuyten, M., &amp; Yildiz, A. A.: "National (dis)identiﬁcation and ethnic and religious identity: A study among Turkish-Dutch Muslims.", ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', Vol. 33, No. 10 (2007), pp.1448–1462, http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0146167207304276&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, religious discrimination seems to lead Muslims to increase their identification with their religion and to decrease their identification with their nation of residence. Some studies further indicate that societal Islamophobia negatively influences Muslim minorities' health.&lt;ref name="kunst2012b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, D., &amp; Lordan, G.: "Discrimination makes me sick! An examination of the discrimination–health relationship", ''Journal of Health Economics'', Vol. 31, No. 1 (2011), pp.99–111, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2011.12.002&lt;/ref&gt; One of the studies showed that the perception of an Islamophobic society is associated with more [[psychological problem]]s, such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[Neuroticism|nervousness]], regardless whether the respective individual had personally experienced religious [[discrimination]].&lt;ref name="kunst2012b"/&gt; As the authors of the study suggest, [[anti-discrimination law]]s may therefore be insufficient to fully protect Muslim minorities from an environment which is hostile towards their religious group.

Jocelyne Cesari, in her study of discrimination against Muslims in Europe,&lt;ref name=CesariStudy&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.euro-islam.info/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/securitization_and_religious_divides_in_europe.pdf Muslims In Western Europe After 9/11: Why the term Islamophobia is more a predicament than an explanation]}}&lt;/ref&gt; finds that anti-Islamic sentiment is almost impossible to separate from other drivers of discrimination. Because Muslims are mainly from immigrant backgrounds and the largest group of immigrants (in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands) [[xenophobia]] overlaps with Islamophobia. This differs from the American situation where [[Hispanic]] immigrants dominate. [[Classism]] is another overlapping factor in some nations. Muslims have lower income and poorer education in France, Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands while Muslims in the US have higher income and education than the general population. In the UK, Islam is seen as a threat to [[secularism]] in response to the calls by some Muslims for [[blasphemy laws]]. In the Netherlands, Islam is seen as a socially conservative force that threatens [[gender equality]] and the acceptance of homosexuality.

==Criticism of term and use==
[[File:Salman Rushdie 2012 Shankbone-2.jpg|thumb|165px|British novelist [[Salman Rushdie]], a former Muslim, ridiculed the term  'Islamophobia'.]]
Although the term is widely recognized and used,&lt;ref&gt;Poole, E. (2003) p. 218.  "The Runnymede Trust has been successful in that the term Islamophobia is now widely recognized and used, though many right-wing commentators reject its existence or argue that it is justified. However, now becoming a catch-all label for any harrassment involving Muslims, it should not be considered unproblematic."&lt;/ref&gt; the use of the term, its construction and the concept itself have been widely criticized. Roland Imhoff and Julia Recker, in an article that puts forward the term "Islamoprejudice" as a better alternative, write that "... few concepts have been debated as heatedly over the last ten years as the term Islamophobia."&lt;ref name=Imhoff /&gt; Jocelyne Cesari reported widespread challenges in the use and meaning of the term in 2006.&lt;ref name=Allen2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cesari2006&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro-islam.info/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/securitization_and_religious_divides_in_europe.pdf|title=Muslims in Western Europe After 9/11:Why the term Islamophobia is more a predicament than an explanation|author=Jocelyne Cesari|date=December 15–16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen, London: 2012: p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; said that under pressure from Islamist extremists, "'Islamophobia' has become accepted as a phenomenon on a par with racism", claiming that "Outside a few flashpoints where the [[British National Party|BNP]] is at work, most Muslims would be hard-pressed to identify Islamophobia in their lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.standard.co.uk/news/stop-pandering-to-the-islamist-extremists-6912982.html| title= Stop pandering to the Islamist extremists | work=London Evening Standard| date=7 July 2008| accessdate=24 October 2013 | author=Ed Husain| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salman Rushdie]] criticized the coinage of the word 'Islamophobia' saying that it "was an addition to the vocabulary of Humpty Dumpty Newspeak. It took the language of analysis, reason and dispute, and stood it on its head".&lt;ref&gt;Rushdie, Salman (2012).

Retrieved 18 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic and political debate===
Paul Jackson, in a critical study of the anti-Islamic [[English Defence League]], argues that the term Islamophobia creates a stereotype where “any criticism of Muslim societies [can be] dismissed ...” The term feeds “a language of polarised polemics ... to close down discussion on genuine areas of criticism ...” Consequently, the term is “losing much [of its] analytical value".&lt;ref name=JacksonStudy&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.radicalism-new-media.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/The_EDL_Britains_New_Far_Right_Social_Movement.pdf|title=The EDL: Britain's 'New Far Right' Social Movement|last=Jackson|first=Paul|publisher=RMN Publications, University of Northampton|pages=10–11|year=2001|accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Eli Göndör]] wrote that the term Islamophobia should be replaced with "Muslimophobia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corren.se/asikter/kolumner/eli-gondor-begreppet-islamofobi-bor-bytas-ut-6394258-artikel.aspx Corren: Eli Göndör: Begreppet islamofobi bör bytas ut]&lt;/ref&gt; As Islamophobia is "a rejection of a population on the grounds of Muslimness", other researches suggest "Muslimism".&lt;ref&gt;Bunzl 2007, Bravo Lopéz 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Mohammad H. Tamdgidi of the University of Massachusetts, Boston, has generally endorsed the definition of Islamophobia as defined by the Runnymede Trust's ''Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All''. However, he notes that the report's list of "open" views of Islam itself presents "an inadvertent definitional framework for Islamophilia": that is, it "falls in the trap of regarding Islam monolithically, in turn as being characterized by one or another trait, and does not adequately express the complex heterogeneity of a historical phenomenon whose contradictory interpretations, traditions, and sociopolitical trends have been shaped and has in turn been shaped, as in the case of any world tradition, by other world-historical forces."&lt;ref&gt;[http://crg.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Tamdgidi.pdf Mohammad H. Tamdgidi "Beyond Islamophobia and Islamophilia as Western Epistemic Racisms: Revisiting Runnymede Trust's Definition in a World-History Context" Islamophobia Studies Journal, Vol. 1 No. 1, Spring 2012:p. 76]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics argue that the term conflates criticism of "Islamic totalitarianism" with hatred of Muslims. In the wake of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]], a group of 12 writers, including novelist [[Salman Rushdie]], signed a manifesto entitled ''Together facing the new totalitarianism'' in the French weekly satirical newspaper ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'', warning against the use of the term Islamophobia to prevent criticism of "[[Islamic totalitarianism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Writers issue cartoon row warning|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4763520.stm|accessdate=19 February 2014|work=BBC News|date=1 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rushdie"&gt;[[Salman Rushdie|Rushdie, Salman]] ''et al.''

"We refuse to renounce our critical spirit out of fear of being accused of "Islamophobia", a wretched concept that confuses criticism of Islam as a religion and stigmatisation of those who believe in it."&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the ''[[New Humanist]]'', philosopher [[Piers Benn]] suggests that people who fear the rise of Islamophobia foster an environment "not intellectually or morally healthy", to the point that what he calls "Islamophobia-phobia" can undermine "critical scrutiny of Islam as somehow impolite, or ignorant of the religion's true nature."&lt;ref name="Benn"&gt;Benn, Piers (31 May 2007).

Alan Posener and Alan Johnson have written that, while the idea of Islamophobia is sometimes misused, those who claim that hatred of Muslims is justified as opposition to Islamism actually undermine the struggle against Islamism.&lt;ref name=Johnson20110306 /&gt; [[Roger Kimball]] argues that the word “Islamophobia” is inherently a prohibition or fear of criticizing of [[radical Islam]].&lt;ref name=Kimball&gt;Kimball, Roger. {{Wayback |date=20060103053941 |url=http://www.newcriterion.com/archives/24/01/after-the-suicide/ |title="After the suicide of the West"}}, January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Pascal Bruckner]], the term was invented by [[Islamic fundamentalism in Iran|Iranian fundamentalists]] in the late 1970s analogous to "[[xenophobia]]" in order to denounce as racism what he feels is legitimate criticism of Islam.&lt;ref name="The invention of Islamophobia"&gt;[[Pascal Bruckner]]: [http://www.signandsight.com/features/2123.html ''The invention of Islamophobia''], [[signandsight.com]], 3 January 2011, retrieved 29 September 2012; originally published in French in [[Libération]]: [http://www.liberation.fr/societe/01012303767-l-invention-de-l-islamophobie ''L’invention de l’«islamophobie»''], 23 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Sam Harris (author)#Islam and Muslims|Sam Harris]], while denouncing bigotry, racism, and prejudice against Muslims or Arabs, rejects the term, Islamophobia,&lt;ref&gt;Sam Harris, "[http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/lifting-the-veil-of-islamophobia#sthash.bM4Un8kE.H21DmKxR.dpuf Lifting the Veil of 'Islamophobia'] A Conversation with [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]]", May 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; as an invented psychological disorder, and states criticizing those Islamic beliefs and practices he believes pose a threat to civil society is not a form of bigotry or racism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Harris (author)|Harris, Sam]] (August 13, 2010).

''[[The Daily Beast]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Harris himself says that Islam is in urgent need of reformation by Muslims as its doctrines as they stand are antiquated and, if armed with modern technology, uniquely dangerous to civilization.&lt;ref name="ill"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/bombing-our-illusions_b_8615.html |title=Sam Harris: Bombing Our Illusions |accessdate=July 5, 2010 |work=Huffington Post |date=10 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Associated Press Stylebook''===
In December 2012, media sources reported that the terms "homophobia" and "Islamophobia" would no longer be included in the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'', and Deputy Standards Editor Dave Minthorn expressed concern about the usage of the terms, describing them as "just off the mark" and saying that they seem "inaccurate". Minthorn stated that AP decided that the terms should not be used in articles with political or social contexts because they imply an understanding of the mental state of another individual. The terms no longer appears on the online stylebook, and Minthorn believes journalists should employ more precise phrases to avoid "ascribing a mental disability to someone".&lt;ref name=huffpogay&gt;{{cite news|title= The Associated Press and Terms Like'Homophobia'|author=Warren J.
