In 1997, the British [[Runnymede Trust]] defined Islamophobia as the "dread or hatred of Islam and therefore, to the fear and dislike of all Muslims," stating that it also refers to the behavior of excluding Muslims from the "economic, social, and public life of the nation." It includes the perception that Islam has no values in common with other cultures, is inferior to the West, is a violent [[political ideology]] rather than a religion, and that discriminatory practices against Muslims are justified.&lt;ref name=Runnymede5&gt;Runnymede 1997, p. 5, cited in Quraishi 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the concept criticize the concept, allege that it is often misused to undermine legitimate [[criticism of Islam]],&lt;ref name=Malik&gt;Malik, Kenan.

==Etymology==
The term is formed of ''Islam'', the post-classical Latin ''-o-'' connecting vowel, and the post-classical Latin combining form ''-phobia'' which is used to form nouns with the sense 'irrational fear of' or 'aversion to.' &lt;ref&gt;"Islamophobia". ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford University Press. Draft Entry Sept. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[List of anti-ethnic and anti-national terms]] for other "-phobia" coinages.

==Definitions==
A number of individuals and organizations have made attempts to define the concept. [[Kofi Annan]] told a UN conference on Islamophobia in 2004: "[W]hen the world is compelled to coin a new term to take account of increasingly widespread [[bigotry]], that is a sad and troubling development. Such is the case with Islamophobia."&lt;ref name=Annan&gt;[[Kofi Annan|Annan, Kofi]]. [http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/sgsm9637.doc.htm "Secretary-General, addressing headquarters seminar on confronting Islamophobia"], [[United Nations]] press release, December 7, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Runnymede Trust]] established the Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, chaired by Professor Gordon Conway, the vice-chancellor of the [[University of Sussex]]. Their report, Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All, was launched in November 1997 by the Home Secretary, [[Jack Straw]]. In this report, Islamophobia was defined by the Trust as "an outlook or world-view involving an unfounded dread and dislike of Muslims, which results in practices of exclusion and discrimination."&lt;ref name="EoRE215"&gt;Encyclopedia of Race and Ethics, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; An early documented use of the word in the [[United States]]  was by [[Insight (magazine)|Insight magazine]] in 1991, used to describe [[Russia]]n activities in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="EoRE215"/&gt;

The American writer [[Stephen Schwartz (journalist)|Stephen Schwartz]] has defined Islamophobia as the condemnation of the entirety of [[Islam]] and its history as [[Extremism|extremist]]; "denying" the existence of a moderate Muslim majority; regarding Islam as a problem for the world; treating conflicts involving Muslims as necessarily their own fault; insisting that Muslims make changes to their religion; and inciting war against Islam as a whole.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=17874 "The 'Islamophobes' That Aren't"], ''FrontPage Magazine'', [[April 28]] [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 43, No. 1, 61-86 (2007) islamophobia is defined as anti-Muslim racism and a continuation of anti-Asian and anti-Arab racism.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 43, No. 1, 61-86 (2007)[http://jos.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/43/1/61]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptions==

The Runnymede report identified eight perceptions related to Islamophobia:

:#Islam is seen as a [[monolith]]ic bloc, static and unresponsive to change.
:#It is seen as separate and "other." It does not have values in common with other cultures, is not affected by them and does not influence them.
:#It is seen as inferior to the West. It is seen as barbaric, irrational, primitive, and [[sexist]].
:#It is seen as violent, aggressive, threatening, supportive of [[terrorism]], and engaged in a [[clash of civilizations]].
:#It is seen as a political [[ideology]], used for political or military advantage.
:#Criticisms made of "the West" by Muslims are rejected out of hand.
:#Hostility towards Islam is used to justify discriminatory practices towards Muslims and exclusion of Muslims from mainstream society.
:#Anti-Muslim hostility is seen as natural and normal.&lt;ref name=Runnymede1997&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/publications/pdfs/islamophobia.pdf "Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All"]|69.7&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]&lt;!-- application/pdf, 71377 bytes --&gt;}}, ''Runnymede Trust'', 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The above perceptions are seen as closed views on Islam. These are contrasted, in the report, with open views on Islam which, while founded on respect for Islam, permits legitimate disagreement, dialogue and critique.&lt;ref&gt;Benn; Jawad (2004) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benn and Jawad, The Runnymede Trust notes that anti-Muslim discourse is increasingly seen as respectable, providing examples on how hostility towards Islam and Muslims is accepted as normal, even among those who may actively challenge other prevelant forms of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Brill165"&gt;Benn; Jawad (2004) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

In some societies, Islamophobia has materialized due to the portrayal of Islam and Muslims as the national "[[Other]]", where exclusion and discrimination occurs on the basis of their religion and civilization which differs with national tradition and identity. Examples include Pakistani and Algerian migrants in Britain and France respectively.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic studies, p. 216
*Miles; Brown (2003) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment, according to Malcolm Brown and  Robert Miles, significantly interacts with [[racism]], although Islamophobia itself is not racism.&lt;ref&gt;Miles; Brown (2003) p. 163, 164&lt;/ref&gt; The publication "''Social Work and Minorities: European Perspectives''" describes Islamophobia as the new form of racism in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson; Soydan; Williams (1998) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that "Islamophobia is as much a form of racism as [[Anti-Semitism]], a term more commonly encountered in Europe as a sibling of Racism, Xenophobia and Intolerance."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson; Soydan; Williams (1998) p. xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of Islamophobic discourse is to amalgamate nationality (i.e. Arab), religion (Islam), and politics (terrorism, fundamentalism) â while most other religions are not associated with terrorism, or even "ethnic or national distinctiveness."&lt;ref&gt;Miles; Brown (2003) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and Miles write that "many of the stereotypes and misinformation that contribute to the articulation of Islamophobia are rooted in a particular perception of Islam", such as the notion that Islam promotes terrorism; especially prevalent after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Miles; Brown (2003) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
According to Elizabeth Poole in the  ''Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic studies'', the media has been criticized for perpetrating Islamophobia. She cites a case study examining a sample of articles in the British press from between 1994 and 2004, which concluded that Muslim viewpoints were underrepresented and that issues involving Muslims usually depicted them in a negative light. Such portrayals, according to Poole, include the depiction of Islam and Muslims as a threat to Western security and values.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic studies, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Benn and Jawad write that hostility towards Islam and Muslims are "closely linked to media portrayals of Islam as barbaric, irrational, primitive and sexist."&lt;ref name="Brill165"/&gt; Egorova and Tudor cite European researchers in suggesting that expressions used in the media such as "Islamic terrorism", "Islamic bombs" and "violent Islam" have resulted in a negative perception of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;See Egorova; Tudor (2003) pp. 2-3, which cites the conclusions of Marquina and Rebolledo in: "A. Marquina, V. G. Rebolledo, âThe Dialogue between the European Union and the Islamic Worldâ in Interreligious Dialogues: Christians, Jews, Muslims, Annals of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts, v. 24, no. 10, Austria, 2000, pp. 166-8. "&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several initiatives, based upon the sixty recommendations listed in the Runnymede Trust's report, aimed at increase Muslim participation in media and politics. Soon after the release of the Runnymede report, the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] was formed to serve as an umbrella body aiming to "represent Muslims in the public sphere, to lobby government and other institutions." The "Forum against Islamophobia and Racism" (FAIR ) was also established, designed to monitor coverage in the media and establish dialogue with media organizations. Following the attacks of September 11, the [[Islam Awareness Week]] and the "''Best of British Islam Festival''" were introduced to improve community relations and raise awareness about Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic studies, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==
Islamophobia has become a topic of increasing sociological and political importance.&lt;ref&gt;Miles; Brown (2003) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; According to Benn and Jawad, Islamophobia has increased since British Muslims' denouncement of [[Salman Rushdie]]'s "''[[The Satanic Verses]]''" and the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Benn; Jawad (2004) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthropologist]] Steven Vertovec writes that the purported growth in Islamophobia may be associated with increased Muslim presence in society and successes.&lt;ref name="Vertovec"&gt;Steven Vertovec, "Islamophobia and Muslim Recognition in Britain"; in Haddad (2002) pp. 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests a [[Vicious circle|circular model]], where increased hostility towards Islam and Muslims results in governmental countermeasures such as institutional guidelines and changes to legislation, which itself may fuel further Islamophobia due to increased accommodation for Muslims in public life. Vertovec concludes: "As the public sphere shifts to provide a more prominent place for Muslims, Islamophobic tendencies may amplify."&lt;ref name="Vertovec" /&gt;

Patel, Humphries, and Naik claim that "Islamophobia has always been present in Western countries and cultures. In the last two decades, it has become accentuated, explicit and extreme."&lt;ref&gt; Naina Patel, Beth Humphries and Don Naik, "The 3 Rs in social work; Religion,âraceâ and racism in Europe", in Johnson; Soydan; Williams (1998) pp. 197-198&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vertovec states that some have observed that Islamophobia has not necessarily escalated in the past decades, but that there has been increased public scrutiny of it.&lt;ref name="Vertovec" /&gt; According to Abduljalil Sajid, one of the members of the Runnymede Trust's Commission on British Muslims and Islamophobia, "Islamophobias" have existed in varying strains throughout history, with each version possessing its own distinct features as well as similarities or adaptations from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Islamophobia: A new word for an old fear | url =http://www.wcrp.be/articles/Sajid9-11-04.htm | author=Imam Dr Abduljalil Sajid | accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a sizeable minority, many [[Muslims in India]] tend to complain about substantial discrimination by [[Hindus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keralanext.com/news/?id=1078945 Grant Bangladeshi Hindu migrants refugee status, but deport Bangladeshi Muslims: Rajnath Singh]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a recently published report to government, called the Sachar Report, Muslims are heavily under-represented in different government and social areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milligazette.com/dailyupdate/2006/200612141_Sachar_Report_Status_Indian_Muslims.htm Summarised Sachar Report on Status of Indian Muslims]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/story/19623.html Sachar report to be implemented in full]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.indianexpress.com/sunday/fullcoverage/53.html The Missing Muslim], ''the Sunday Express. Full coverage on Sachar Report''&lt;/ref&gt; Among other facts, it found that in the province of [[West Bengal]], where Muslims make up 27% of the population, their employment in the government sector was below 3%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/246411 Fearful Muslims adopt Hindu IDs], ''The Toronto Star, August 15, 2007''&lt;/ref&gt; 

===EUMC report===
The largest project monitoring Islamophobia was undertaken following 9/11 by the EU watchdog, [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] (EUMC). Their May 2002 report "Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001", written [[Chris Allen (UK)]] and Jorgen S. Nielsen of the [[University of Birmingham]], was based on 75 reports &amp;mdash; 15 from each EU member nation.&lt;ref name="EUMCNews"&gt;{{cite news| title ="EUMC presents reports on Discrimination and Islamophobia in the EU" | publisher="European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia media release" | url=http://www.eumc.europa.eu/eumc/index.php?fuseaction=content.dsp_cat_content&amp;catid=43d8bc25bc89d&amp;contentid=4582ddc822d41 | date=2006-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EUMC&gt;Allen, Chris and Nielsen, Jorgen S. [http://www.raxen.eumc.eu.int/1/webmill.php?id=32813&amp;ditem=3101&amp;lin=detail "Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001"], EUMC, May, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The report highlighted the regularity with which ordinary Muslims became targets for abusive and sometimes violent retaliatory attacks after 9/11. Despite localized differences within each member nation, the recurrence of attacks on recognizable and visible traits of Islam and Muslims was the report's most significant finding. Incidents consisted of verbal abuse, blaming all Muslims for [[List of terrorist incidents|terrorism]], forcibly removing women's [[hijab]]s, spitting on Muslims, calling children "[[Osama bin Laden|Usama]]," and random assaults. Muslims have been hospitalized and on one occasion paralyzed.&lt;ref name=EUMC/&gt;

The report also discussed the portrayal of Muslims in the media. Inherent negativity, stereotypical images, fantastical representations, and exaggerated caricatures were all identified. The report concluded that "a greater receptivity towards anti-Muslim and other xenophobic ideas and sentiments has, and may well continue, to become more tolerated."&lt;ref name=EUMC/&gt;

==Views==
[[Image:Salman Rushdie by Kubik 01.JPG|left|thumb|170px|[[Salman Rushdie]] was one of 12 prominent writers who signed a statement condemning Islamophobia as a "wretched concept."&lt;ref name=Rushdie/&gt;]]
The concept of Islamophobia has been criticized on several grounds. Some critics argue that it is real, but is just another form of racism and does not require its own category, while others argue that, unlike racism, Islam is a religion that people can choose to adopt, to retain or to leave or [[apostatize]]. Others argue that it is used to censor criticism and that its use threatens [[free speech]].

British writer and academic [[Kenan Malik]] has called the concept a "myth," arguing that it confuses discrimination against Muslims with criticism of Islam, and that it is used to silence critics and Muslim reformers. He writes that the extent to which Muslims are more vulnerable to social exclusion and attacks than other groups is exaggerated, and that the concept allows politicians who may have supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] or the [[War on Terror]] to "reclaim the moral high ground" and "pitch for the Muslim vote." He argues that the result is the creation of a culture of victimhood, allowing individual Muslims to attribute low achievement to Islamophobia, and not to themselves. Islamophobia is not a form of racism, in his view, because Islam is a belief system. "I can be hateful about other beliefs, such as [[conservatism]] or [[communism]]. So why can't I be hateful about religion too?"&lt;ref name=Malik&gt;Malik, Kenan.[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=6679 "Islamophobia Myth"], Prospect, February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malik's analysis of Islamophobia was criticized by [[Inayat Bunglawala]] from the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] and Abdul Wahid from the [[Islamism|Islamist]] group [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]].&lt;ref name=Bunglawala&gt;Bunglawala, Inayat &amp; Wahid, Abdul. [http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/pdfarticle.php?id=6764 "Is Islamophobia a Myth?"], ''Prospect Magazine'', March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Bunglawala writes that Malik's argument is limited to overt acts of violence against Muslims. As an example of less overt prejudice, Bunglawala cites a BBC study that found applicants for jobs who had English-sounding names were more likely to secure an interview than those with Muslim names. By ignoring non-violent examples of alleged Islamophobia, Malik's commentary "makes a mockery of victims of prejudice by pretending they have not been discriminated against," according to Bunglawala. In addition, he argues that Malik did not adequately study the proposed law against the incitement of religious hatred, and that he failed to appreciate the definitions of the term "Islamophobia" according to the very sources he uses in his article.&lt;ref name=Bunglawala/&gt;

In the wake of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]], a group of 12 prominent writers signed a statement in the French weekly satirical newspaper ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' in March 2006, warning against the use of the term Islamophobia to prevent criticism of "[[Islamic totalitarianism]]." The novelist [[Salman Rushdie]] was among these signatories. The statement alleged that "Islamism is a reactionary ideology that kills equality, freedom and [[secularism]] wherever it is present. We refuse to renounce our critical spirit out of fear of being accused of "Islamophobia", a wretched concept that confuses criticism of Islam as a religion and stigmatization of those who believe in it."&lt;ref name=Rushdie&gt;[[Salman Rushdie|Rushdie, Salman]] ''et al''. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4764730.stm "Writers' statement on cartoons"], BBC News, March 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

British columnist Josie Appleton argues Runnymede Trust uses the term Islamophobia to prevent [[criticism of Islam]]. "Rather than engage Muslims in debate, non-Muslims are supposed to tiptoe around them, for fear of causing offense."&lt;ref name=Appleton&gt;Appleton, Josie. [http://www.spiked-online.co.uk/Articles/00000006D95B.htm "Who's afraid of Islamophobia"], ''Spiked Online'', [[July 2]] [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afshin Ellian]], a Dutch [[law professor]], writes that the concept is used to delegitimize criticism by characterizing it as [[Psychopathology|pathological]]&lt;ref name="Ellian"&gt;[[Afshin Ellian|Ellian, Afshin]]. [http://kvc.minbuza.nl/uk/current/2006/february/ellian.html "Stop Capitulating to Threats"], [[February 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Civil rights|civil-rights]] activist [[Bahram Soroush]] has called it "intellectual blackmail".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryamnamazie.com/tv/islamophobia_term_scaremongering.html "The term Islamophobia is being used for scaremongering"] - International TV interview with Bahram Soroush, [[June 7]] [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; French writer [[Robert Redeker]] argues that the history of the term demonstrates that the term Islamophobia was created by "radical islamists" to "tackle feminists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertredeker.net/mondecontemporain_lalaicite,l_islamophobie.htm]" L'islamophobie, l'arme des islamistes contre la laÃ¯citÃ©."&lt;/ref&gt;

"Whoever coined the term 'Islamophobia' was quite shrewd," chimes in [[Dennis Prager]]. "Notice the intellectual sleight of hand here. â¦ One can rightly or wrongly fear Islam, or more usually, aspects of Islam, and have absolutely no bias against all Muslims, let alone be a racist. The equation of Islamophobia with racism is particularly dishonest. Muslims come in every racial group, and Islam has nothing to do with race. â¦ Even granting that there are people who fear Islam, how does that in any way correlate with racism? If fear of an ideology rendered one racist, all those who fear [[conservatism]] or [[liberalism]] should be considered racist. â¦ However, the only religion the West permits criticism of is [[Christianity]]. People write books, give lectures and conduct seminars on the falsity of Christian claims, or on the immoral record of Christianity, and no one attacks them for racism or bigotry, let alone attacks them physically. â¦ The fact remains that the term 'Islamophobia' has one purpose â to suppress any criticism, legitimate or not, of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.townhall.com/columnists/DennisPrager/2007/07/31/why_islamophobia_is_a_brilliant_term Why "Islamophobia" Is a Brilliant Term] by [[Dennis Prager]], [[July 31]], [[2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; Prager had himself been accused of Islamophobia after he compared the Muslim sacred text, the [[Qur'an]], with Adolf [[Hitler]]s [[Mein Kampf]] and when he suggested that [[US Congress]]man [[Keith Ellison (politician)|Keith Ellison]]'s decision to take his oath of office on [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s Qur'an "undermines American civilization".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=53235 A response to my critics â and a solution] - Dennis Prager - [[December 5]], [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2006/12/quran_controver_1.html Quran controversy continues: Prager catching flak] - [[USA Today]] Blog - [[December 04]], [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Hari]] of ''[[The Independent]]'' has criticized the use of the term by organizations like [[Islamophobia Watch]], arguing that [[Liberal movements within Islam|liberal Muslims]] interested in reform are left unsupported because people fear being accused of Islamophobia. He writes: "If Muslim women and Muslim [[gay]]s are going to have any kind of decent life, the [Muslim] liberals need to receive solidarity and support â but slap-dash charges of Islamophobia intimidate people who could offer it ... While Islamophobia Watch talk about defending Muslims, they end up defending the nastiest and most right-wing part of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]] â the ones who are oppressing and killing the rest."&lt;ref name=Hari&gt;Hari, Johann.

Critics have cited the case of British journalist [[Polly Toynbee]], who was nominated in May 2003 for the title of "Most Islamophobic Media Personality of the Year" at the [[Annual Islamophobia Awards]] overseen by the [[Islamic Human Rights Commission]], who has argued that there is no such thing as Islamophobia.&lt;ref name=Toynbee&gt;[[Polly Toynbee|Toynbee, Polly]].

Writing in the [[New Humanist]], philosopher [[Piers Benn]] suggests that people who fear the rise of Islamophobia foster an environment "not intellectually or morally healthy", to the point that what he calls "Islamophobia-phobia" can undermine "critical scrutiny of Islam as somehow impolite, or ignorant of the religion's true nature", encouraging "sentimental pretence that all claims to religious truth are somehow 'equal', or that critical scrutiny of Islam (or any belief system) is ignorant, prejudiced, or 'phobic'".&lt;ref name=Benn&gt;[http://newhumanist.org.uk/524 "On Islamophobia-phobia"].&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New Criterion]]'' editor [[Roger Kimball]] argues that the word "Islamophobia" is a misnomer. "A phobia describes an [[Phobia|irrational fear]], and it is axiomatic that fearing the effects of radical Islam is not irrational, but on the contrary very well-founded indeed, so that if you want to speak of a legitimate phobia â itâs a phobia I experience frequently â we should speak instead of Islamophobia-phobia, the fear of and revulsion towards Islamophobia."&lt;ref name=Kimball&gt;Kimball, Roger.

American writer [[Stephen Schwartz (journalist)|Stephen Schwartz]], director of the Center for Islamic Pluralism, has cautioned against what he sees as a tendency to accuse all opponents of Islamic radicalism of Islamophobia, but writes that it is nevertheless a real phenomenon. He defines it as the condemnation of the entirety of [[Islam]] and its history as [[Extremism|extremist]]; denying the existence of a moderate Muslim majority; regarding Islam as a problem for the world; treating conflicts involving Muslims as necessarily their own fault; insisting that Muslims make changes to their religion; and inciting war against Islam as a whole.&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;[[Stephen Schwartz (journalist)|Schwartz, Stephen]].

Turkish writer Ali BulaÃ§ says, We should draw a line between the concept of âIslamophobiaâ as reflected in Europe and in the United States. (...) The difference of views and perceptions between Europe and the United States regarding the Muslim world and the Islamophobia that breaks out in Western countries is an issue for which Muslims and their opinions should be taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=Bulac&gt;Bulac, Ali [http://www.maviye.com/comments.asp?id=94 Two versions of phobia], ''Zaman (newspaper)'', September 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A passenger traveling to the [[British Virgin Islands]] on a plane bound for the United States from Manchester in the UK was forced off the plane prior to [[takeoff]]. The man, a British-born Muslim residing in the United States, said he was singled out because he was a Muslim pilot and was left feeling "demoralized and humiliated. I must have met the profile on the day. I have an Arabic name, I am a Muslim, I'm from Britain and I know how to fly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/220/220381_muslim_pilot_kicked_off_jet_in_terror_alert.html Muslim pilot kicked off jet in terror alert] - [[Manchester Evening News]].

[[22 August]], [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* On [[21 November]] [[2006]], six [[imams]] were forcefully removed from a [[US Airways]] flight at [[Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport]] on suspicions of terrorism. The event led to an outcry from Muslim organizations in America saying that what happened showed the growing prejudice against Muslims in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100687.html "U.S. Muslims outraged after imams kicked off plane"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[22 November]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the accusations made against the imams can be found in the official police report on the incident (currently exclusively hosted [http://pajamasmedia.com/2006/12/the_faking_imams_pajamas_media.php here]), which includes written witness testimony of the imams' extremely suspicious activity, such as praising terrorism, praying unnecessarily loudly, asking for [[Seat belt|seat-belt]] extensions that were obviously not needed (then putting said extensions under their seats), not sitting in their assigned seats (having someone near each exit in a pattern shared by hijackers of the past), and getting up to move around and confer with each other repeatedly. See [[Flying Imams controversy]] for more details regarding this incident.
