The legal status of [[transgender]] people varies greatly around the world. Some countries have enacted laws protecting the rights of transgender individuals, but others have criminalized their [[gender identity]] or [[gender expression|expression]]. In many cases, transgender individuals face [[discrimination]] in employment, housing, healthcare, and other areas of life.

A [[transgender]] person is someone whose [[gender identity]] is inconsistent or not culturally associated with the sex they were [[Sex assignment|assigned at birth]] and also with the [[gender role]] that is associated with that sex. They may have, or may intend to establish, a new gender status that accords with their gender identity. ''[[Transsexual]]'' is generally considered a subset of ''transgender'',&lt;ref name="TR2006"&gt;''[[iarchive:transgenderright0000unse|Transgender Rights]]'' (2006, {{ISBN|0816643121}}), edited by Paisley Currah, Richard M. Juang, Shannon Minter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bevan"&gt;Thomas E. Bevan, ''The Psychobiology of Transsexualism and Transgenderism'' (2014, {{ISBN|1440831270}}), page 42: "The term transsexual was introduced by Cauldwell (1949) and popularized by Harry Benjamin (1966) [...]. The term transgender was coined by John Oliven (1965) and popularized by various transgender people who pioneered the concept and practice of transgenderism. It is sometimes said that Virginia Prince (1976) popularized the term, but history shows that many transgender people adovcated the use of this term much more than Prince. The adjective ''transgendered'' should not be used [...]. Transsexuals constitute a subset of transgender people."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alegria"&gt;A. C.

"Some Transsexual individuals also identify with the broader transgender community; others do not."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=retrieved 20 August 2015: " Transsexualism is often included within the broader term 'transgender', which is generally considered an umbrella term for people who do not conform to typically accepted gender roles for the sex they were assigned at birth. The term 'transgender' is a word employed by activists to encompass as many groups of gender diverse people as possible. However, many of these groups individually don't identify with the term. Many health clinics and services set up to serve gender variant communities employ the term, however most of the people using these services again don't identify with this term. The rejection of this political category by those that it is designed to cover clearly illustrates the difference between self-identification and categories that are imposed by observers to understand other people." |url=http://www.gendercentre.org.au/resources/fact-sheets/transsexualism.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128074648/http://www.gendercentre.org.au/resources/fact-sheets/transsexualism.htm |archive-date=28 November 2014 |access-date=1 August 2017 |website=Gendercentre.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, most legal jurisdictions recognize the two traditional gender identities and social roles, [[man]] and [[woman]], but tend to exclude any other gender identities and expressions. People assigned male at birth are usually legally recognized as men, and people assigned female at birth are usually legally recognized as women, in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. However, there are some countries which recognize, by law, a [[third gender]]. That third gender is often associated with being [[nonbinary]]. There is now a greater understanding of the breadth of variation outside the typical categories of "man" and "woman", and many self-descriptions are now entering the literature, including ''[[pangender]]'', ''[[genderqueer]]'', ''polygender'', and ''agender''. Medically and socially, the term "transsexualism" is being replaced with ''[[gender incongruence]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Gender incongruence.

Many of the issues regarding transgender rights are generally considered a part of [[family law]], especially the issues of [[marriage]] and the question of a transgender person benefiting from a partner's [[insurance]] or [[social security]].

The degree of [[legal recognition]] provided to transgender people varies widely throughout the world. Many countries now legally recognize sex reassignments by permitting a change of legal gender on an individual's [[birth certificate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=J.K. |title=Transgender Rights and Politics : Groups, Issue Framing, and Policy Adoption |last2=Haider-Markel |first2=D.P. |date=2014 |publisher=University of Michigan Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many transsexual people have permanent surgery to change their body, [[gender-affirming surgery]] or semi-permanently change their body by hormonal means, [[transgender hormone therapy]]. [[Legal status of gender-affirming healthcare|The legal status of such healthcare]] varies. In many countries, some of these modifications are required for legal recognition. In a few, the legal aspects are directly tied to health care; i.e. the same bodies or doctors decide whether a person can move forward in their treatment and the subsequent processes automatically incorporate both matters. In others, these medical procedures are illegal.

In some jurisdictions, transgender people (who are considered non-transsexual) can benefit from the legal recognition given to [[transsexual]] people. In some countries, an explicit medical diagnosis of "transsexualism" is (at least formally) necessary. In others, a diagnosis of "gender dysphoria", or simply the fact that one has established a non-conforming gender role, can be sufficient for some or all of the legal recognition available. The [[DSM-5]] recognizes gender dysphoria as an official diagnosis. Not all transgender or transsexual people feel gender dysphoria or gender incongruence, but in many countries a diagnosis is required for legal recognition, if transgender people are legally recognized at all.

===South Africa===
{{Main|Transgender rights in South Africa}}
The [[Constitution of South Africa]] forbids discrimination on the basis of sex, gender and sexual orientation (amongst other grounds). The [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] has indicated that "sexual orientation" includes transsexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=De Vos |first=Pierre |date=14 July 2010 |title=Christine, give them hell! |url=http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/christine-give-them-hell/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717195016/http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/christine-give-them-hell/ |archive-date=17 July 2011 |access-date=12 July 2011 |website=Constitutionally Speaking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] enacted the [[Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status Act]], which allows a transgender person who has undergone medical or surgical gender reassignment to apply to the [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]] to have the sex description altered on their birth record. Once the birth record is altered they can be issued with a new [[birth certificate]] and [[identity document]], and are considered "for all purposes" to be of the new sex.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=68026 Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status Act, 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629111742/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=68026 |date=29 June 2011 }}''. Parliament of South Africa, 15 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Egypt}}
Transgender people face significant existing societal stigma against the LGBT+ community in [[Egypt]], a conservative [[Muslim]] nation. The procedure for gender reassignment is not illegal in Egypt, however, the complication and stigmatisation has put transgender people through mental and physical assault along with torture, as per [[Human Rights Watch]]. Reportedly, the statistics of criminal acts committed against the transgender community have not been available because they have had a history of going unreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Transgender Egyptians face abuse, discrimination for asserting their identity |url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/12/egypt-transgender-challenges-religion-society.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201224153819/https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/12/egypt-transgender-challenges-religion-society.html |archive-date=24 December 2020 |access-date=24 December 2020 |website=Al Monitor|date=9 December 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=12 November 2020 |title=Egyptian transgender woman faces uphill battle against stigma |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/egypt-trans-int-idUSKBN27S1OD |url-status=live |access-date=12 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112202435/https://www.reuters.com/article/egypt-trans-int-idUSKBN27S1OD |archive-date=12 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Botswana===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Botswana}}
In September 2017, the Botswana High Court ruled that the refusal of the Registrar of National Registration to change a transgender man's gender marker was "unreasonable and violated his constitutional rights to dignity, privacy, freedom of expression, equal protection of the law, freedom from discrimination and freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment". LGBT activists celebrated the ruling, describing it as a great victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Botswana: Activists Celebrate Botswana's Transgender Court Victory |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201710090073.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621164818/https://allafrica.com/stories/201710090073.html |archive-date=21 June 2019 |access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=29 September 2017 |title=Press Release: Botswana High Court Rules in Landmark Gender Identity Case |url=https://southernafricalitigationcentre.org/2017/09/29/press-release-botswana-high-court-rules-in-landmark-gender-identity-case/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428140544/https://www.southernafricalitigationcentre.org/2017/09/29/press-release-botswana-high-court-rules-in-landmark-gender-identity-case/ |archive-date=28 April 2019 |access-date=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the Botswana Government announced it would appeal the ruling, but decided against it in December, supplying the trans man in question with a new identity document that reflects his gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mambaonline.com/2017/12/06/sweet-closure-botswana-agrees-recognise-trans-man/ "Sweet closure" as Botswana finally agrees to recognise trans man] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180630052752/http://www.mambaonline.com/2017/12/06/sweet-closure-botswana-agrees-recognise-trans-man/ |date=30 June 2018 }}, ''Mambaonline''&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar case, where a transgender woman sought to change her gender marker to female, was heard in December 2017. The High Court ruled that the Government must recognise her gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=18 December 2017 |title=Botswana to recognise a transgender woman's identity for first time after historic High Court ruling |work=independent.co.uk |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/botswana-gaborone-transgender-identity-lgbt-rights-legabibo-court-law-a8114991.html |url-status=live |access-date=14 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503034726/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/botswana-gaborone-transgender-identity-lgbt-rights-legabibo-court-law-a8114991.html |archive-date=3 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; She dedicated her victory to "every single trans diverse person in Botswana".

==Asia==
===China===
{{Main|Transgender people in China}}

In 2009 the Chinese government made it illegal for minors to change their officially listed gender, stating that sexual reassignment surgery, available to only those over the age of twenty, was required in order to apply for a revision of their identification card and residence registration.&lt;ref name="jun"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jun |first=Pi |date=9 October 2010 |title=Transgender in China |journal=Journal of LGBT Youth |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=346–351 |doi=10.1080/19361653.2010.512518 |s2cid=143885704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014 the [[Shanxi|Shanxi province]] started allowing minors to apply for the change with the additional information of their guardian's identification card. This shift in policy allows post-surgery marriages to be recognized as heterosexual and therefore legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sun |first=Nancy |date=9 January 2014 |title=Shanxi Permits Persons to Change Gender Information |publisher=All-China Women's Federation |url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/report/168827-1.htm |url-status=dead |access-date=17 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129030210/http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/report/168827-1.htm |archive-date=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender youth in China face many challenges. One study found that Chinese parents report 0.5%  (1:200) of their 6 to 12-year boys and 0.6%  (1:167) of girls often or always 'state the wish to be the other gender'. 0.8% (1:125) of 18- to 24-year-old university students who are birth-assigned males (whose sex/gender as indicated on their ID card is male) report that the 'sex/gender I feel in my heart'  is female, while another 0.4% indicating that their perceived gender was 'other'. Among birth-assigned females, 2.9% (1:34) indicated they perceived their gender as male, while another 1.3% indicating 'other'.&lt;ref name="winter"&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Winter |first1=Sam |last2=Conway |first2=Lynn |title=How many trans* people are there?

According to a survey conducted by Peking University, Chinese [[trans female]] students face strong discrimination in many areas of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=2017中国跨性别群体生存现状调查报告 |url=https://doc.mbalib.com/view/23d82eecfd6765a009adcfd32e455028.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220401115908/https://doc.mbalib.com/view/23d82eecfd6765a009adcfd32e455028.html |archive-date=1 April 2022 |access-date=2022-02-08 |website=MBA智库}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sex segregation]] is found everywhere in Chinese schools and universities: student enrollment (for some special schools, universities and majors), appearance standards ([[hairstyles]] and [[School uniform#Social implications of school uniforms on gender|uniforms]] included), private spaces (bathrooms, toilets and dormitories included), physical examinations, [[Military education and training in China|military trainings]], [[Conscription in China|conscription]], [[Physical education|PE]] classes, [[Physical education|PE]] exams and physical health tests. Chinese students are required to attend all the activities according to their legal gender marker, otherwise they will be punished. It is also difficult to change the gender information of educational attainments and academic degrees in China, even after [[sex reassignment surgery]], which results in discrimination against well-educated trans women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2019-12-23 |title=跨性别者手术后：历时半年终于修改学历 就业遭歧视 |url=https://www.sohu.com/a/362100660_120146415 |access-date=2022-02-08 |website=搜狐}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=变性人群体真实生态：唯学历证明无法修改性别 |date=2012-06-20 |publisher=搜狐 |url=http://news.sohu.com/20120620/n346142516.shtml |language=zh-cn |access-date=2022-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812205346/http://news.sohu.com/20120620/n346142516.shtml |archive-date=2014-08-12 |author=王若翰}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019]], was passed by Parliament in November 2019, and came into effect on 11 January 2020. It protects transgender individuals against discrimination in education, employment and healthcare. It recognizes the gender identity of the individual, and there are provisions in the law for a certificate to be issued with their new gender identity.  There have been reservations among some in the transgender community, both regarding the difficulty of obtaining a certificate, and because of lack of awareness and lack of sensitivity to the issue among local public officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Nath |first=Damini |date=January 11, 2020 |title=Transgender Persons Act comes into effect |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/transgender-persons-act-comes-into-effect/article30545336.ece |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229091631/https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/transgender-persons-act-comes-into-effect/article30545336.ece |archive-date=29 February 2020 |access-date=1 October 2020 |website=The Hindu |publisher=N.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, transgender individuals were officially recognized by the government and allowed to undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]]. 
Officially the leader of Iran's [[Islamic Revolution]], [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]], issued a [[fatwa]] declaring sex reassignment surgery permissible for "diagnosed transsexuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Fathi |first=Nazila |date=2 August 2004 |title=As Repression Lifts, More Iranians Change Their Sex |work=The New York Times |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE0D91F3DF931A3575BC0A9629C8B63 |url-status=live |access-date=12 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200108050104/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/02/world/as-repression-eases-more-iranians-change-their-sex.html |archive-date=8 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Tait |first=Robert |date=27 July 2005 |title=A Fatwa for Freedom |work=The Guardian |location=London |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jul/27/gayrights.iran |url-status=live |access-date=2010-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124232234/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jul/27/gayrights.iran |archive-date=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Human Rights Report: Being Transgender in Iran |url=https://www.outrightinternational.org/sites/default/files/OutRightTransReport.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135144/https://www.outrightinternational.org/sites/default/files/OutRightTransReport.pdf |archive-date=16 January 2018 |access-date=2018-08-06 |website=Outright.

{{Main|Transgender rights in Malaysia}}
There is no legislation expressly allowing transsexuals to legally change their gender in [[Malaysia]]. The relevant legislations are the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1957 and National Registration Act 1959. Therefore, judges currently exercise their discretion in interpreting the law and defining the gender. There are conflicting decisions on this matter. There is a case in 2003 where the court allowed a transsexual to change her gender indicated in the [[Identity document|identity card]], and granted a declaration that she is a female.&lt;ref name="bar"&gt;[http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/content/view/2063/27/#_ftn4 "JeffreyJessie: Recognising Transsexuals"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175216/http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/content/view/2063/27/#_ftn4 |date=27 September 2007 }}, ''The Malaysian Bar''.

In 2018, the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government]] passed the '''Transgender Person (Protection of Rights) Act''' which officially established the legal right of transgender people in Pakistan to identify themselves as such and instituted anti-discrimination laws. These include recognition of transgender identity in legal documents such as [[Pakistani passport|passports]], identity card, and drivers licences, along with prohibiting discrimination in employment, schools, workplaces, public transit, healthcare, etc. The bill also included the right for inheritance in accordance to their chosen gender. Furthermore, the bill obligates the Pakistani government to build protection centers and safe houses for the specific purpose of being used by the transgender community in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Ingber |first=Sasha |date=May 9, 2018 |title=Pakistan Passes Historic Transgender Rights Bill |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/09/609700652/pakistan-passes-historic-transgender-rights-bill |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918174933/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/09/609700652/pakistan-passes-historic-transgender-rights-bill |archive-date=18 September 2020 |access-date=October 1, 2020 |website=npr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
{{Main|Transgender rights in the Philippines}}
The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on 12 September 2008, allowed Jeff Cagandahan, 27, to change his [[birth certificate]], gender and name:&lt;blockquote&gt;We respect respondent's congenital condition and his mature decision to be a male. Life is already difficult for the ordinary person. We cannot but respect how respondent deals with his unordinary state and thus help make his life easier, considering the unique circumstances in this case. In the absence of a law on the matter, the court will not dictate on respondent concerning a matter so innately private as one's sexuality and lifestyle preferences, much less on whether or not to undergo medical treatment to reverse the male tendency due to rare medical condition, [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]. In the absence of evidence that respondent is an 'incompetent,' and in the absence of evidence to show that classifying respondent as a male will harm other members of society ... the court affirms as valid and justified the respondent's position and his personal judgment of being a male.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Court records showed that at age six, he had small [[ovaries]]; at 13, his ovarian structure was minimized, he had no breasts and did not menstruate. The [[psychiatrist]] testified that "he has both male and female sex organs, but was genetically female, and that since his body secreted male hormones, his female organs did not develop normally." The [[Philippines]] National Institutes of Health said "people with congenital adrenal hyperplasia lack an [[enzyme]] needed by the [[adrenal gland]] to make the [[hormones]] [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=newsinfo.inquirer.net, Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer |archive-date=8 August 2014 |access-date=1 August 2017 |website=Newsinfo.inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Rare Condition Turns Woman into Man |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610145052/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html |archive-date=10 June 2013 |access-date=26 July 2015 |website=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ruling, however, only applied to cases involving congenital adrenal hyperplasia and other intersex situations.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The Philippine Supreme Court has also ruled that Filipino citizens do not have the right to legally change their sex on official documents (driver's license, passport, birth certificate, Social Security records, etc.) if they are transsexual and have undergone sexual reassignment surgery. In 2007, the Court overruled a lower court decision and found that another individual could not legally change name and sex from male to female, as it would have "serious and wide-ranging legal and public policy consequences," citing the institution of marriage in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=26 September 2013 |title=Sex change and sex reassignment – Katrina Legarda – ABS-CBN News |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/views-and-analysis/06/02/09/sex-change-and-sex-reassignment-katrina-legarda |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926051337/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/views-and-analysis/06/02/09/sex-change-and-sex-reassignment-katrina-legarda |archive-date=26 September 2013 |access-date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=OutrageMag com |title=Living History: On changing one's sex by petitioning the Phl courts |date=6 September 2018 |url=https://outragemag.com/living-history-on-changing-ones-sex-by-petitioning-the-phl-courts/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
{{Main|Transgender rights in South Korea}}
In South Korea, it is possible for transgender individuals to change their legal gender, although it depends on the decision of the judge for each case. Since the 1990s, however, it has been approved in most of the cases. The legal system in Korea does not prevent marriage once a person has changed their legal gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yi, Luhur Taylor, Brown |first=Horim, Winston, N.T. |date=December 2019 |title=PUBLIC OPINION OF TRANSGENDER RIGHTS in South Korea |url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Public-Opinion-Trans-South-Korea-English-Dec-2019.pdf |journal=Williams Institute of Law at UCLA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Supreme Court of Korea ruled that transsexuals have the right to alter their legal papers to reflect their reassigned sex. A trans woman can be registered, not only as female, but also as being "born as a woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=In re Change of Name and Correction of Family Register, Supreme Court of South Korea (22 June 2006) |url=https://www.icj.org/sogicasebook/in-re-change-of-name-and-correction-of-family-register-supreme-court-of-south-korea-22-june-2006/ |access-date=2021-04-12 |website=International Commission of Jurists |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the government unveiled the new chip-embedded identity card, scheduled to be issued in late 2020. Gender will not be explicitly displayed on the physical card, although the second digit of national identification number reveals gender information anyway ("1" for male; "2" for female). With the inception of new identity card, a third gender option (using digit "7" as the second digit of national identification number) will be available to transgender persons alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=潘 |first=姿羽 |date=2018-11-21 |title=2020年啟用晶片身分證 保留數字7給跨性別人士 |trans-title=Chip-embedded ID to release in 2020, digit 7 reserved for transgender persons |url=https://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/201811210342.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621095749/https://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/201811210342.aspx |archive-date=21 June 2019 |access-date=2019-06-12 |publisher=Central News Agency, Taiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it raises concerns that the practice could stigmatize transgender persons, instead of respecting their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-11-23 |title=聯名新聞稿/性別團體回應國發會新制身分證意見 |trans-title=Joint press release/ gender groups' response to the National Development Council on the new identity card |url=https://www.istscare.org/2018/11/23/1144/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122004339/http://www.istscare.org/2018/11/23/1144/ |archive-date=22 January 2019 |access-date=2019-06-12 |website=Beyond Gender (Intersex, Transgender and Transsexual People Care Association)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the third-gender option policy are yet to be released.

==Europe==
{{See also|LGBT rights in the European Union}}
A majority of countries in Europe give transgender people the right to at least change their first name, most of which also provide a way of changing birth certificates. Several European countries recognize the right of transgender people to marry in accordance with their post-operative sex. [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Spain, and the United Kingdom all recognize this right. The [[Convention on the recognition of decisions regarding a sex change]] provides regulations for mutual recognition of sex change decisions and has been signed by five European countries and ratified by Spain and the Netherlands.

In 1908, [[Imperial Germany]] (with the help of sexologist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee|WhK]]) issued a very limited number of [[Transvestite certificate|'transvestite passes']] – ''[[transvestite]]'' at this time referring to crossdressers as well as transgender and [[gender non-conforming]] people – which enabled individuals to dress in clothes which were seen as discordant with their [[biological sex|sex]].

Since 1980, Germany has a law that regulates the change of first names and legal gender. It is called {{lang|de|Gesetz über die Änderung der Vornamen und die Feststellung der Geschlechtszugehörigkeit in besonderen Fällen ([[:de:Transsexuellengesetz]] – TSG)}} (Law about the change of first name and determination of gender identity in special cases (Transsexual law – TSG)).

=== Malta ===
Malta passed the 'Gender Identity, Gender Expression, and Sex Characteristics Act in 2015. This bill states that all citizens of Malta have the right to

# The recognition of their gender identity;
# The free development of their person according to their gender identity;
# Be treated according to their gender identity and, particularly, to be identified in that way in the documents providing their identity therein; and
# Bodily integrity and physical autonomy.&lt;ref name="Malta Transgender Bill"&gt;{{cite web |date=26 March 2015 |title=Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act (Malta, 2015) |url=http://tgeu.org/gender-identity-gender-expression-sex-characteristics-act-malta-2015/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407011037/http://tgeu.org/gender-identity-gender-expression-sex-characteristics-act-malta-2015/ |archive-date=7 April 2015 |access-date=6 April 2015 |website=Transgender Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act protects the gender identity of a person at all times. It also states that "person shall not be required to provide proof of a surgical procedure for total or partial genital reassignment, hormonal therapies or any other psychiatric, psychological or medical treatment to make use of the right to gender identity." The act allows parents to postpone listing gender on a child's birth certificate and prohibits "non-medically necessary treatments on the sex characteristics of a person."&lt;ref name="Malta Transgender Bill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Explanation of Malta Gender Identity Law"&gt;{{cite web |title=Gender Identity, Gender Expression And Sex Characteristics Act |url=http://socialdialogue.gov.mt/en/Public_Consultations/MSDC/Pages/Consultations/GIGESC.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408011911/http://socialdialogue.gov.mt/en/Public_Consultations/MSDC/Pages/Consultations/GIGESC.aspx |archive-date=8 April 2015 |access-date=6 April 2015 |publisher=Social Dialogue Malta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic countries===
The [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] model approach to transgender rights emphasizes the human rights of transgender people and is based on legal equality and self-identification, which has been adopted in countries such as [[Denmark]], [[Greenland]], [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]].

The first milestone sentence in the case of gender shifting was given by Warsaw's Voivode Court in 1964. The court reasoned that it be possible, in face of civil procedure and acting on civil registry records, to change one's legal gender after their genital reassignment surgery had been conducted. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled that in some cases, when the attributes of the individual's preferred gender were predominant, it is possible to change one's legal gender even before genital reassignment surgery.&lt;ref&gt;see for example: T. Smyczynski, Prawo rodzinne i opiekuńcze, C.H. Beck 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Anna Grodzka, the first transgender MP in the history of Europe who underwent a genital reassignment operation was appointed.

The law allows an adult person to change their legal gender without any requirements. Minors aged 16 and 17 are able to do so with parental consent and a psychological opinion, confirming that their decision has been taken freely and without any outside pressure. The law also prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics, and bans non-consensual sex assignment treatment and/or surgical intervention on intersex children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Lei n.º 38/2018 |url=https://dre.pt/web/guest/home/-/dre/115933863/details/maximized?serie=I&amp;day=2018-08-07&amp;date=2018-08-01 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808171917/https://dre.pt/web/guest/home/-/dre/115933863/details/maximized?serie=I&amp;day=2018-08-07&amp;date=2018-08-01 |archive-date=8 August 2018 |access-date=27 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Romania]] it is legal for transgender people to change their first name to reflect their gender identity based on personal choice. Since 1996, it has been possible for someone who has gone through genital reassignment surgery to change their legal gender in order to reflect their post-operative sex. Transgender people then have the right to marry in accordance with their post-operative sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Transsexualismul in Romania |url=http://accept-romania.ro/lgbt-issues/trans/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109032154/http://accept-romania.ro/lgbt-issues/trans/ |archive-date=9 November 2012 |access-date=2 December 2012 |publisher=Accept Romania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] effectively granted full legal recognition for binary transgender people.&lt;ref name=equalityhumanrights.com1/&gt; In contrast to some systems elsewhere in the world, the gender recognition process under the Act does not require applicants to be post-operative.

On 15 June 2020, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] (SCOTUS) ruled in [[Bostock v. Clayton County]] that for the purposes of Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], discrimination on the basis of transgender status is also discrimination because of sex.

Regardless of the legal sex classification determined by a state or territory, the federal government may make its own determination of sex classification for federally issued documents. For instance, the U.S. Department of State requires a medical certification of "appropriate clinical treatment for transition to the updated gender (male or female)" to amend the gender designation on a U.S. passport, but sex reassignment surgery is not a requirement to obtain a U.S. passport in the updated gender.&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/gender.html "Gender Designation Change", ''Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102171335/https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/gender.html |date=2 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves transgender Americans subject to inconsistent and often discriminatory regulations when seeking healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Funk, Jaydi |last2=Funk, Steven |last3=Whelan, Sylvia Blaise |date=2019 |title=Trans*+ and Intersex Representation and Pathologization: An Interdisciplinary Argument for Increased Medical Privacy |url=https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128893 |url-status=live |journal=Berkeley Journal of Gender, Law &amp; Justice |language=en |volume=34 |issue=1 |doi=10.15779/z380c4sk4f |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200126233452/https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128893 |archive-date=26 January 2020 |access-date=26 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South America==
South America has some of the most progressive legislation in the world regarding transgender rights. Bolivia and Ecuador are among the few countries worldwide that offer constitutional protection against discrimination based on gender identity. Transgender persons are allowed to change their name and gender on legal documents in a majority of countries. Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Uruguay allow individuals to change their name and gender without undergoing medical treatment, sterilization or judicial permission. In [[Peru]] a judicial order is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=10 August 2015 |title=Latin America's Transgender-Rights Leaders |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/latin-americas-transgender-rights-leadership |url-status=live |magazine=The New Yorker |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022165642/http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/latin-americas-transgender-rights-leadership |archive-date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=7 September 2016 |title=Bolivia's transgender citizens celebrate new documents |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-37295906 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022162212/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-37295906 |archive-date=22 October 2016 |website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
{{main|Transgender rights in Argentina}}
In 2012 the Argentine Congress passed the [[Gender Identity Law (Argentina)|Ley de Género (Gender Law)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=16 July 2014 |title=Argentina Gender Identity Law – TGEU – transgender europe |url=http://www.tgeu.org/Argentina_Gender_Identity_Law |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716162710/http://www.tgeu.org/Argentina_Gender_Identity_Law |archive-date=16 July 2014 |access-date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows individuals over 18 to change the gender marker in their DNI (national ID) on the basis of a written declaration only. Argentina thus became the first country to adopt a gender recognition policy based entirely on individual autonomy, without any requirement for third party diagnosis, surgeries or obstacles of any type.

===Bolivia===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Bolivia}}
The Gender Identity law allows individuals over 18 to legally change their name, gender and photography on legal documents.  No surgeries or judicial order are required. The law took effect on 1 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=En un mes 50 transgénero y transexuales cambiaron su identidad en Bolivia |date=30 August 2016 |url=http://eju.tv/2016/08/en-un-mes-50-transgenero-y-transexuales-cambiaron-su-identidad-en-bolivia/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831150552/http://eju.tv/2016/08/en-un-mes-50-transgenero-y-transexuales-cambiaron-su-identidad-en-bolivia/ |archive-date=31 August 2016 |access-date=5 September 2016 |language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Brazil}}
Changing legal gender assignment in Brazil is legal according to the [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice of Brazil]], as stated in a decision rendered on 17 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL1342579-5598,00.html Transgenders can change their name, as decided by the Supreme Court of Justice {{in lang|pt}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810204602/http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL1342579-5598,00.html |date=10 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And in 2008, Brazil's public health system started providing free sexual reassignment operations in compliance with a court order. Federal prosecutors had argued that sexual reassignment surgery was covered under a [[Constitution of Brazil|constitutional]] clause guaranteeing [[medical care]] as a [[Fundamental rights|basic right]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0,,OI2892454-EI715,00-Mudanca+de+sexo+pelo+SUS+comeca+no+fim+do+ano.html Sex-change in Brazil {{in lang|pt}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220651/http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0,,OI2892454-EI715,00-Mudanca+de+sexo+pelo+SUS+comeca+no+fim+do+ano.html |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients must be at least 18 years old and diagnosed as transsexuals with no other [[personality disorder]]s, and must undergo [[psychological evaluation]] with a multidisciplinary team for at least two years, begins with 16 years old. 
The national average is of 100 surgeries per year, according to the Ministry of Health of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athosgls.com.br/noticias_visualiza.php?contcod=34625 Brazil to provide free sex-change operations {{in lang|en}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424101013/http://athosgls.com.br/noticias_visualiza.php?contcod=34625 |date=24 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2020, a bill was introduced that defines biological sex as the only factor in determining gender.

===Chile===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Chile}}
Chile bans all discrimination and hate crimes based on gender identity and gender expression. The Gender Identity Law, in effect since 2019, recognizes the right to self-perceived gender identity, allowing people over 14 years to change their name and gender on all official documents without prohibitive requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=30 December 2019 |title=Chile transgender rights law takes effect |url=https://www.washingtonblade.com/2019/12/30/chile-transgender-rights-law-takes-effect/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101132700/https://www.washingtonblade.com/2019/12/30/chile-transgender-rights-law-takes-effect/ |archive-date=1 January 2020 |access-date=2 January 2020 |website=Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1974, the change of gender had been possible in the country through a judicial process.

===Colombia===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Colombia}}
Since 2015, a Colombian person may change their legal gender and name manifesting their solemn will before a notar, no surgeries or judicial order required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=DECRETO 1227 DE 2015 |url=https://www.suin-juriscol.gov.co/viewDocument.asp?ruta=Decretos/30019850#:~:text=DECRETO%201227%20DE%202015&amp;text=por%20el%20cual%20se%20adiciona,el%20Registro%20del%20Estado%20Civil. |access-date=16 November 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecuador===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Ecuador}}
Since 2016, Ecuadorians are allowed to change their birth name and gender identity (instead of the sex assigned at birth) on legal documents and national ID cards. The person who wants to change the word "sex" for "gender" in the identity card shall present two witnesses to accredit the self-determination of the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=LEY ORGÁNICA DE GESTIÓN DE LA IDENTIDAD Y DATOS CIVILES |url=http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ec/es/system/files/ro_ley_organica_de_gestion_de_la_identidad_y_datos_civiles_ro_684_2do_supl_04-02-2015.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806145113/http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ec/es/system/files/ro_ley_organica_de_gestion_de_la_identidad_y_datos_civiles_ro_684_2do_supl_04-02-2015.pdf |archive-date=6 August 2016 |access-date=5 September 2016 |website=Asambleanacional.gob.ec |language=es-LA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peru===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Peru}}
In Peru transgender persons can change their legal gender and name after complying with certain requirements that may become psychological and psychiatric evaluations, a medical intervention or sex reassignment surgery. A judicial permission is required.
In November 2016, the Constitutional Court of Peru determined that transsexuality is not a pathology and recognized the right to gender identity. However, favorable judicial decisions on gender change have been appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=31 January 2018 |title=Reniec en desacuerdo con cambio de sexo en DNI, pese a orden de Juzgado en Arequipa |url=https://peru21.pe/peru/arequipa-reniec-desacuerdo-cambio-sexo-dni-393934-noticia/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102045401/https://peru21.pe/peru/arequipa-reniec-desacuerdo-cambio-sexo-dni-393934-noticia/ |archive-date=2 January 2020 |access-date=2 January 2020 |website=Peru21 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uruguay===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Uruguay}}
Since 2019, transgender people can self-identify their gender and update their legal name, without approval from a judge after the approval of the Comprehensive Law for Trans Persons. The new law creates scholarships for trans people to access education, a monthly pension for transgender people born before 1975 and also requires government services to employ a minimum of 1% of the transgender population. It also now acknowledges the self-identification of non-binary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=19 October 2018 |title=Trans people in Uruguay can now self-identify their gender, without surgery |url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/uruguay-transgender-rights/#gs.3e8cX3A0 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190809033252/https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/uruguay-transgender-rights/#gs.3e8cX3A0 |archive-date=9 August 2019 |access-date=2 January 2020 |website=Gay Star News |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, lawmakers passed the Gender identity law allowing transgender people over the age of 18 to change their name and legal gender on all official documents. Surgery, diagnosis or hormone therapy were not a requirement but a judicial permission was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ley 18.620 DERECHO A LA IDENTIDAD DE GÉNERO Y AL CAMBIO DE NOMBRE Y SEXO EN DOCUMENTOS IDENTIFICATORIOS |url=https://legislativo.parlamento.gub.uy/temporales/leytemp6280254.htm |access-date=5 September 2016 |website=legislativo.parlamento.gub.uy |language=es-LA}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{main|Transgender rights in Australia}}
Birth certificates are regulated by the [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]], whereas marriage and passports are matters for federal law. All Australian jurisdictions now recognise the affirmed sex of an individual, with varying requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=BIRTHS, DEATHS AND MARRIAGES REGISTRATION ACT 1995 – SECT 32B Application to alter register to record change of sex |url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/bdamra1995383/s32b.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402141253/http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/bdamra1995383/s32b.html |archive-date=2 April 2015 |access-date=26 July 2015 |website=5.austlii.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the landmark case ''New South Wales Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages v Norrie'' [2014] the High Court of Australia held that the ''Births Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1995'' (NSW) did not require a person having undergone genital reassignment surgery to identify as either a man or a woman.

Passports are issued in the preferred gender, without requiring a change to birth certificates or citizenship certificates.  A letter is needed from a medical practitioner which certifies that the person has had or is receiving appropriate treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Sex and Gender Diverse Passport Applicants |url=https://www.passports.gov.au/web/sexgenderapplicants.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019035814/https://www.passports.gov.au/web/sexgenderapplicants.aspx |archive-date=19 October 2011 |access-date=26 July 2015 |website=Passports.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
