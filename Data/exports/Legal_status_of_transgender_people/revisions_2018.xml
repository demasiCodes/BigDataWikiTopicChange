{{LGBT rights}}
A person may be considered to be a [[transgender]] person if their [[gender identity]] is inconsistent or not culturally associated with the sex they were [[Sex assignment|assigned at birth]], and consequently also with the [[gender role]] and social status that is typically associated with that sex. They may have, or may intend to establish, a new gender status that accords with their gender identity. ''Transsexual'' is generally considered a subset of ''transgender'',&lt;ref name="TR2006"&gt;''Transgender Rights'' (2006, {{ISBN|0816643121}}), edited by Paisley Currah, Richard M. Juang, Shannon Minter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bevan"&gt;Thomas E. Bevan, ''The Psychobiology of Transsexualism and Transgenderism'' (2014, {{ISBN|1440831270}}), page 42: "The term transsexual was introduced by Cauldwell (1949) and popularized by Harry Benjamin (1966) [...]. The term transgender was coined by John Oliven (1965) and popularized by various transgender people  who pioneered the concept and practice of transgenderism. It is sometimes said that Virginia Prince (1976) popularized the term, but history shows that many transgender people adovcated the use of this term much more than Prince. The adjective ''transgendered'' should not be used [...]. Transsexuals constitute a subset of transgender people."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alegria"&gt;A. C. Alegria, ''Transgender identity and health care: Implications for psychosocial and physical evaluation'', in the ''Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners'', volume 23, issue 4 (2011), pages 175–182: "Transgender, Umbrella term for persons who do not conform to gender norms in their identity and/or behavior (Meyerowitz, 2002). Transsexual, Subset of transgenderism; persons who feel discordance between natal sex and identity (Meyerowitz, 2002)."&lt;/ref&gt; but some transsexual people reject being labelled ''transgender''.&lt;ref name="Valentine"&gt;Valentine, David. ''Imagining Transgender: An Ethnography of a Category'', Duke University, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stryker"&gt;[[Susan Stryker|Stryker, Susan]]. Introduction. In Stryker and S.

"Some Transsexual individuals also identify with the broader transgender community; others do not."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gendercentre.org.au/resources/fact-sheets/transsexualism.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128074648/http://www.gendercentre.org.au/resources/fact-sheets/transsexualism.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 November 2014|title=retrieved 20 August 2015: " Transsexualism is often included within the broader term 'transgender', which is generally considered an umbrella term for people who do not conform to typically accepted gender roles for the sex they were assigned at birth. The term 'transgender' is a word employed by activists to encompass as many groups of gender diverse people as possible. However, many of these groups individually don't identify with the term. Many health clinics and services set up to serve gender variant communities employ the term, however most of the people using these services again don't identify with this term. The rejection of this political category by those that it is designed to cover clearly illustrates the difference between self-identification and categories that are imposed by observers to understand other people."|website=Gendercentre.org.au|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, most legal jurisdictions recognize the two traditional gender identities and social roles, [[man]] and [[woman]], but tend to exclude any other gender identities, and expressions. However, there are some countries which recognize, by law, a [[third gender]].  There is now a greater understanding of the breadth of variation outside the typical categories of "man" and "woman", and many self-descriptions are now entering the literature, including ''[[pangender]]'', ''[[genderqueer]]'', ''polygender'' and ''agender''. Medically and socially, the term "transsexualism" is being replaced with ''[[gender identity]]'' or ''[[gender dysphoria]]'', and terms such as ''transgender people'', ''trans men'' and ''trans women'' are replacing the category of transsexual people.

This raises many legal issues and aspects of transgenderism.  Most of these issues are generally considered a part of [[family law]], especially the issues of [[marriage]] and the question of a transsexual person benefiting from a partner's [[insurance]] or [[social security]].

The degree of [[legal recognition]] provided to transgenderism varies widely throughout the world.  Many countries now legally recognise sex reassignments by permitting a change of legal gender on an individual's [[birth certificate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kathoey Ladyboy: Thailand's Got Talent|last=Duthel|first=Heinz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many transsexual people have permanent surgery to change their body, [[sexual reassignment surgery]] (SRS) or semi-permanently change their body by hormonal means, [[hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT). In many countries, some of these modifications are required for legal recognition. In a few, the legal aspects are directly tied to health care; i.e. the same bodies or doctors decide whether a person can move forward in their treatment, and the subsequent processes automatically incorporate both matters.

In some jurisdictions, transgender people (who are considered non-transsexual) can benefit from the legal recognition given to [[transsexual]] people. In some countries, an explicit medical diagnosis of "transsexualism" is (at least formally) necessary. In others, a diagnosis of "gender dysphoria", or simply the fact that one has established a non-conforming gender role, can be sufficient for some or all of the legal recognition available. The [[DSM-V]] recognizes gender dysphoria as an official diagnosis.

{{Main|LGBT rights in South Africa#Gender transition laws}}
The [[Constitution of South Africa]] forbids discrimination on the basis of sex, gender and sexual orientation (amongst other grounds). The [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] has indicated that "sexual orientation" includes transsexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/christine-give-them-hell/ |first=Pierre |last=De Vos |title=Christine, give them hell! |work=Constitutionally Speaking |date=14 July 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717195016/http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/christine-give-them-hell/ |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] enacted the [[Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status Act]], which allows a transgender person who has undergone medical or surgical gender reassignment to apply to the [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]] to have the sex description altered on their birth record. Once the birth record is altered they can be issued with a new [[birth certificate]] and [[identity document]], and are considered "for all purposes" to be of the new sex.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=68026 Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status Act, 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629111742/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=68026 |date=29 June 2011 }}''. Parliament of South Africa, 15 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Botswana===

In September 2017, the Botswana High Court ruled that the refusal of the Registrar of National Registration to change a transgender man's gender marker was "unreasonable and violated his constitutional rights to dignity, privacy, freedom of expression, equal protection of the law, freedom from discrimination and freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment".

In 2009 the Chinese government made it illegal for minors to change their officially listed gender, stating that sexual reassignment surgery, available to only those over the age of twenty, was required in order to apply for a revision of their identification card and residence registration.&lt;ref name="jun"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jun|first1=Pi|title=Transgender in China|journal=Journal of LGBT Youth|date=9 October 2010|volume=7|issue=4|pages=346–351|doi=10.1080/19361653.2010.512518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014 the [[Shanxi|Shanxi province]] started allowing minors to apply for the change with the additional information of their guardian’s identification card. This shift in policy allows post-surgery marriages to be recognized as heterosexual and therefore legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sun|first1=Nancy|title=Shanxi Permits Persons to Change Gender Information|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/report/168827-1.htm|accessdate=17 October 2014|publisher=All-China Women's Federation|date=9 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129030210/http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/report/168827-1.htm|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender youth in China face many challenges. One study found that Chinese parents report 0.5%  (1:200) of their 6 to 12-year boys and 0.6%  (1:167) of girls often or always ‘state the wish to be the other gender’. 0.8% (1.125) of 18- to 24-year-old university students who are birth-assigned males (whose sex/gender as indicated on their ID card is male) report that the ‘sex/gender I feel in my heart’  is female, while another 0.4% indicating that their perceived gender was ‘other’. Among birth-assigned females, 2.9% (1:34) indicated they perceived their gender as male, while another 1.3% indicating ‘other’.&lt;ref name="winter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winter|first1=Sam|last2=Conway|first2=Lynn|title=How many trans* people are there?

{{quote|Non-recognition of the identity of Hijras/transgender persons denies them equal protection of law, thereby leaving them extremely vulnerable to harassment, violence and sexual assault in public spaces, at home and in jail, also by the police. Sexual assault, including molestation, rape, forced anal and oral sex, gang rape and stripping is being committed with impunity and there are reliable statistics and materials to support such activities. Further, non-recognition of identity of Hijras /transgender persons results in them facing extreme discrimination in all spheres of society, especially in the field of employment, education, healthcare etc.

Hijras/transgender persons face huge discrimination in access to public spaces like restaurants, cinemas, shops, malls etc. Further, access to public toilets is also a serious problem they face quite often. Since, there are no separate toilet facilities for Hijras/transgender persons, they have to use male toilets where they are prone to sexual assault and harassment. Discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation or gender identity, therefore, impairs equality before law and equal protection of law and violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India.&lt;ref name="TGruling"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=National Legal Services Authority ...

There is no legislation expressly allowing transsexuals to legally change their gender in [[Malaysia]].

Therefore, judges currently exercise their discretion in interpreting the law and defining the gender. There are conflicting decisions on this matter. There is a case in 2003 where the court allowed a transsexual to change her gender indicated in the [[Identity document|identity card]], and granted a declaration that she is a female.&lt;ref name=bar&gt;[http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/content/view/2063/27/#_ftn4 "JeffreyJessie: Recognising Transsexuals"], ''The Malaysian Bar''.

The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on 12 September 2008, allowed Jeff Cagandahan, 27, to change both his [[birth certificate]], gender and name from Jennifer to Jeff, to male: "We respect respondent’s congenital condition and his mature decision to be a male. Life is already difficult for the ordinary person. We cannot but respect how respondent deals with his unordinary state and thus help make his life easier, considering the unique circumstances in this case. In the absence of a law on the matter, the court will not dictate on respondent concerning a matter so innately private as one's sexuality and lifestyle preferences, much less on whether or not to undergo medical treatment to reverse the male tendency due to rare medical condition, [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]. In the absence of evidence that respondent is an 'incompetent,' and in the absence of evidence to show that classifying respondent as a male will harm other members of society [...] the court affirms as valid and justified the respondent's position and his personal judgment of being a male." Court records showed that – at 6, he had small [[ovaries]]; at 13, his ovarian structure was minimized and he had no breasts and did not menstruate. The [[psychiatrist]] testified that "he has both male and female sex organs, but was genetically female, and that since his body secreted male hormones, his female organs did not develop normally." The [[Philippines]] National Institutes of Health said "people with congenital adrenal hyperplasia lack an [[enzyme]] needed by the [[adrenal gland]] to make the [[hormones]] [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|title=newsinfo.inquirer.net, Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|website=Newsinfo.inquirer.net|accessdate=1 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman Into Man|work=Fox News|accessdate=26 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610145052/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|archivedate=10 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, however, it has been approved in most of the cases. The legal system in Korea does not prevent marriage once a person has changed their legal gender.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2006, the Supreme Court of Korea ruled that transsexuals have the right to alter their legal papers to reflect their reassigned sex. A trans woman can be registered, not only as female, but also as being "born as a woman."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

While same-sex marriage is not approved by South Korean law, a transsexual woman obtains the marital status of 'female' automatically when she marries to a man, even if she has previously been designated as "male."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2013 a court ruled that transsexuals can change their legal sex without undergoing genital surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Un|first1=Ji-Won|last2=Park|first2=Hyun-Jung|title=Landmark legal ruling for South Korean transgenders|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/578323.html|accessdate=16 May 2015|publisher=''The Hankyoreh''|date=16 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101236/http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/578323.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
A majority of countries in [[Europe]] give transgender people the right to at least change their first name, most of which also provide a way of changing birth certificates. Several European countries recognize the right of transsexuals to marry in accordance with their post-operative sex. [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Sweden]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]] all recognize this right. The [[Convention on the recognition of decisions regarding a sex change]] provides regulations for mutual recognition of sex change decisions and has been signed by five European countries and ratified by Spain and the Netherlands.

===Finland===
{{Main|LGBT rights in Finland#Gender identity and expression}}
In Finland, people wishing to change their legal gender must be sterilized or "for some other reason infertile". A recommendation from the [[UN Human Rights Council]] to eliminate the sterilization requirement was rejected by the Finnish government in 2017.&lt;ref name="gsn-29aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wareham|first1=Jamie|title=Finland will keep sterilizing trans people after it rejects law reform|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/finnish-government-continue-sterilization-trans-people/|accessdate=September 1, 2017|newspaper=[[Gay Star News]]|date=August 29, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902003512/https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/finnish-government-continue-sterilization-trans-people/|archivedate=2 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in France#Gender identity and expression}}
In France, there is currently no law that defines sex-change procedures. However, it is possible to ask for a sex- or a name change before the Court. The judge decides to grant or refuse the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/transgender-people-victory-france/#gs.vzYBN0g|title=Transgender people win major victory in France|date=13 July 2016|website=Gaystarnews.com|accessdate=1 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802003117/https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/transgender-people-victory-france/#gs.vzYBN0g|archivedate=2 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{main|Transgender rights in Germany}}
Since 1980, [[Germany]] has a law that regulates the change of first names and legal gender. It is called {{lang|de|Gesetz über die Änderung der Vornamen und die Feststellung der Geschlechtszugehörigkeit in besonderen Fällen ([[:de:Transsexuellengesetz]] – TSG)}} (Law about the change of first name and determination of gender identity in special cases (Transsexual law – TSG)). Requirements that applicants for a change in gender were infertile post-surgery declared unconstitutional by supreme court ruling in a 2011.

The bill grants this right to anyone aged 17 and older. However, even underaged children between the age of 15 and 17 will have access to the legal gender recognition process, but under certain conditions, such as obtaining a certificate from a medical council.&lt;ref name="2017GenderChangeBill"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/news/latest-news/greece-gender-recognition-law-oct2017|title=Greece improves gender recognition law but misses chance to introduce self-determination|publisher=ILGA EUROPE|accessdate=10 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104130104/https://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/news/latest-news/greece-gender-recognition-law-oct2017|archivedate=4 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/greece-passes-gender-change-law|title=Greece passes gender-change law opposed by Orthodox church|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=10 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010200400/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/greece-passes-gender-change-law|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was opposed by the [[Holy Synod]] of the [[Church of Greece|Orthodox Church]], the [[Communist Party of Greece]], [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] and [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]].&lt;ref name=“veconomist” /&gt;

{{main|Transgender rights in Ireland}}
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], it was not possible for a transsexual person to alter their birth certificate until 2015. The High Court took a case by [[Lydia Foy]] in 2002 that was turned down, as a birth certificate was deemed to be a historical document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Lydia Foy's Case|url=http://www.teni.ie/page.aspx?contentid=588|publisher=Transgender Equality Network Ireland|accessdate=16 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427160724/http://teni.ie/page.aspx?contentid=588|archivedate=27 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first milestone sentence in the case of gender shifting was given by Warsaw's Voivode Court in 1964. The court reasoned that it be possible, in face of civil procedure and acting on civil registry records, to change one's legal gender after their genital reassignment surgery had been conducted. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled that in some cases, when the attributes of the individual's preferred gender were predominant, it is possible to change one's legal gender even before genital reassignment surgery.&lt;ref&gt;see for example: T. Smyczynski, Prawo rodzinne i opiekuńcze,  C.H. Beck 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Anna Grodzka, the first transgender MP in the history of Europe who underwent a genital reassignment operation was appointed. In the Polish Parliamentary Election 2011 she gained 19 337 votes (45 079 voted for her party in the constituency) in the City of [[Cracow]] and came sixth in her electoral district (928 914 people, voter turnout 55,75%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wybory 2011: Andrzej Duda (PIS) zdeklasował konkurentów w Krakowie|url=http://www.infokrakow24.pl/18374/wybory-2011-andrzej-duda-pis-zdeklasowal-konkurentow-w-krakowie/|accessdate=17 May 2015|language=Polish|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904000523/http://www.infokrakow24.pl/18374/wybory-2011-andrzej-duda-pis-zdeklasowal-konkurentow-w-krakowie/|archivedate=4 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grodzka is reportedly the only transsexual person with ministerial responsibilities in the world since 10 November 2011 (as of 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/careers/anna-grodzka-worlds-only-transsexual-mp|title=Anna Grodzka: what's it like being the world's only transsexual MP?|last=Hudson|first=David|date=2013-05-30|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-11|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012045157/https://www.theguardian.com/careers/anna-grodzka-worlds-only-transsexual-mp|archivedate=12 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2015/09/i-m-not-giving-polands-first-transgender-mp-anna-grodzka-her-activism|title=“I’m not giving up”: Poland's first transgender MP Anna Grodzka on her activism|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615030500/http://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2015/09/i-m-not-giving-polands-first-transgender-mp-anna-grodzka-her-activism|archivedate=15 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Romania]] it is legal for transgender people to change their first name to reflect their gender identity based on personal choice.

{{Main article|Transgender rights in the United States|History of transgender people in the United States|Transgender disenfranchisement in the United States}}
Pursuant to the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. Const., Amend. 10]], which reserves to the states (or to the people) all powers not assigned to the federal government, the legal classification of sex is a matter of state jurisdiction in the United States.  The principle is generally extended to the [[District of Columbia]] and U.S. territories, though the federal government has power to overrule any decision those non-state entities might make.  

Regardless of the legal sex classification determined by a state or territory, the federal government may make its own determination of sex classification for federally issued documents. For instance, the U.S. Department of State requires a medical certification of "appropriate clinical treatment for transition to the updated gender (male or female)" to amend the gender designation on a U.S. passport, but sex reassignment surgery is not a requirement to obtain a U.S. passport in the updated gender&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/gender.html "Gender Designation Change", ''Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102171335/https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/gender.html |date=2 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]] allow individuals to change their name and gender without undergoing medical treatment, sterilization or judicial permission. In [[Uruguay]] a judicial order is required. In [[Chile]] transgender persons can change their legal gender and name after completion of medical intervention. Judicial permissions are required. [[Peru]] allows legal name change after surgery, however gender change is not allowed by courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin America’s Transgender-Rights Leaders|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/latin-americas-transgender-rights-leadership|website=The New Yorker|date=10 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022165642/http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/latin-americas-transgender-rights-leadership|archivedate=22 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia's transgender citizens celebrate new documents|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-37295906|website=BBC News|date=7 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022162212/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-37295906|archivedate=22 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
{{main|Transgender rights in Argentina}}
In 2012 the Argentine Congress passed the Ley de Género (Gender Law),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tgeu.org/Argentina_Gender_Identity_Law|title=Argentina Gender Identity Law - TGEU - transgender europe|date=16 July 2014|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=1 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716162710/http://www.tgeu.org/Argentina_Gender_Identity_Law|archivedate=16 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows individuals over 18 to change the gender marker in their DNI (national ID) on the basis of a written declaration only. Argentina thus became the first country to adopt a gender recognition policy based entirely on individual autonomy, without any requirement for third party diagnosis, surgeries or obstacles of any type.

===Bolivia===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Bolivia#Gender identity and expression}}
The Gender Identity law allows individuals over 18 to legally change their name, gender and photography on legal documents.  No surgeries or judicial order are required. The law took effect on August 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia Approves Progressive Law Recognizing Transgender Rights|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Bolivia-Approves-Progressive-Law-Recognizing-Transgender-Rights-20160521-0018.html|accessdate=5 September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008065131/http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Bolivia-Approves-Progressive-Law-Recognizing-Transgender-Rights-20160521-0018.html|archivedate=8 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=En un mes 50 transgénero y transexuales cambiaron su identidad en Bolivia|url=http://eju.tv/2016/08/en-un-mes-50-transgenero-y-transexuales-cambiaron-su-identidad-en-bolivia/|accessdate=5 September 2016|language=es-LA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831150552/http://eju.tv/2016/08/en-un-mes-50-transgenero-y-transexuales-cambiaron-su-identidad-en-bolivia/|archivedate=31 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{Main article|Transgender rights in Brazil}}
Changing legal gender assignment in Brazil is legal according to the [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice of Brazil]], as stated in a decision rendered on October 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL1342579-5598,00.html Transgenders can change their name, as decided by the Supreme Court of Justice {{pt icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810204602/http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL1342579-5598,00.html |date=10 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And in 2008, Brazil's public health system started providing free sexual reassignment operations in compliance with a court order. Federal prosecutors had argued that sexual reassignment surgery was covered under a [[Constitution of Brazil|constitutional]] clause guaranteeing [[medical care]] as a [[Fundamental rights|basic right]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0,,OI2892454-EI715,00-Mudanca+de+sexo+pelo+SUS+comeca+no+fim+do+ano.html Sex-change in Brazil {{pt icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220651/http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0,,OI2892454-EI715,00-Mudanca+de+sexo+pelo+SUS+comeca+no+fim+do+ano.html |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients must be at least 18 years old and diagnosed as transsexuals with no other [[personality disorder]]s, and must undergo [[psychological evaluation]] with a multidisciplinary team for at least two years, begins with 16 years old.

===Australia===
{{main|Transgender rights in Australia}}
Birth certificates are within the jurisdiction of the states, whereas marriage and passports are matters for the Commonwealth. All Australian jurisdictions now recognise the affirmed sex of an individual after surgery unless the person is married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/bdamra1995383/s32b.html|title=BIRTHS, DEATHS AND MARRIAGES REGISTRATION ACT 1995 - SECT 32B Application to alter register to record change of sex|website=5.austlii.edu.au|accessdate=26 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402141253/http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/bdamra1995383/s32b.html|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the landmark case ''New South Wales Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages v Norrie'' [2014] the High Court of Australia held that the ''Births Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1995'' (NSW) did not require a person having undergone genital reassignment surgery to identify as either a man or a woman. The ruling permits a gender registration of "non-specific".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages v Norrie [2014] HCA 11 (2 April 2014)|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2014/11.html|publisher=High Court of Australia|accessdate=16 May 2015|date=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passports are issued in the preferred gender, without requiring a change to birth certificates or citizenship certificates.  A letter is needed from a medical practitioner which certifies that the person has had or is receiving appropriate treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/web/sexgenderapplicants.aspx|title=Sex and Gender Diverse Passport Applicants|website=Passports.gov.au|accessdate=26 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019035814/https://www.passports.gov.au/web/sexgenderapplicants.aspx|archivedate=19 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia was the only country in the world to require the involvement and approval of the judiciary ([[Family Court of Australia]]) with respect to allowing transgender children access to [[Hormone replacement therapy (transgender)|hormone replacement therapy]].&lt;ref name="abc-riskinglives"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Janine|title=Transgender teenagers 'risking lives' buying hormones on black market|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-15/transgender-teens-buying-black-market-hormones/7722084|accessdate=7 September 2016|agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=15 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908071445/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-15/transgender-teens-buying-black-market-hormones/7722084|archivedate=8 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended in late 2017, when the Family Court issued a landmark ruling establishing that, in cases where there is no dispute between a child, their parents, and their treating doctors, hormone treatment can be prescribed without court permission.&lt;ref name="30NovFamilyCourtRuling"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/transgender-teens-can-now-access-treatment-without-going-to|title=Transgender Teens Can Now Access Treatment Without Going To Court, Following Landmark Decision|work=BuzzFeed|date=30 November 2017|author=Lane Sainty|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211052448/https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/transgender-teens-can-now-access-treatment-without-going-to|archivedate=11 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the [[Human Rights Act 1993]] does not explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender. Whilst it is believed that gender identity is protected under the laws preventing discrimination on the basis of either sex or sexual orientation,&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Act 1993 s21(1)(m)&lt;/ref&gt; it is not known how this applies to those who have not had, or will not have, gender reassignment surgery.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Commission 2004.

Transgender persons in the Northern Mariana Islands may change their legal gender following [[sex reassignment surgery]] and a name change. The ''Vital Statistics Act of 2006'', which took effect in March 2007, states that: "Upon receipt of a certified copy of an order of the CNMI Superior Court indicating the sex of an individual born in the CNMI has been changed by surgical procedure and whether such individual’s name has been changed, the certificate of birth of such individual shall be amended as prescribed by regulation." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Vital Statistics Act of 2006 |type= Public Law |number= 15-50 |language= English |date= 2006 |url= http://www.cnmilaw.org/pdf/public_laws/15/pl15-50.pdf |accessdate= 12 August 2015 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150923205038/http://www.cnmilaw.org/pdf/public_laws/15/pl15-50.pdf |archivedate= 23 September 2015 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
