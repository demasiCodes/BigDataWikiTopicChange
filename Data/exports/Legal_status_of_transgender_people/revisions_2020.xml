A person may be considered to be a [[transgender]] person if their [[gender identity]] is inconsistent or not culturally associated with the sex they were [[Sex assignment|assigned at birth]] and consequently also with the [[gender role]] and social status that is typically associated with that sex. They may have, or may intend to establish, a new gender status that accords with their gender identity. ''Transsexual'' is generally considered a subset of ''transgender'',&lt;ref name="TR2006"&gt;''Transgender Rights'' (2006, {{ISBN|0816643121}}), edited by Paisley Currah, Richard M. Juang, Shannon Minter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bevan"&gt;Thomas E. Bevan, ''The Psychobiology of Transsexualism and Transgenderism'' (2014, {{ISBN|1440831270}}), page 42: "The term transsexual was introduced by Cauldwell (1949) and popularized by Harry Benjamin (1966) [...]. The term transgender was coined by John Oliven (1965) and popularized by various transgender people who pioneered the concept and practice of transgenderism. It is sometimes said that Virginia Prince (1976) popularized the term, but history shows that many transgender people adovcated the use of this term much more than Prince. The adjective ''transgendered'' should not be used [...]. Transsexuals constitute a subset of transgender people."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alegria"&gt;A. C. Alegria, ''Transgender identity and health care: Implications for psychosocial and physical evaluation'', in the ''Journal of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners'', volume 23, issue 4 (2011), pages 175–182: "Transgender, Umbrella term for persons who do not conform to gender norms in their identity and/or behavior (Meyerowitz, 2002). Transsexual, Subset of transgenderism; persons who feel discordance between natal sex and identity (Meyerowitz, 2002)."&lt;/ref&gt; but some transsexual people reject being labelled ''transgender''.&lt;ref name="Valentine"&gt;Valentine, David.

"Some Transsexual individuals also identify with the broader transgender community; others do not."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gendercentre.org.au/resources/fact-sheets/transsexualism.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128074648/http://www.gendercentre.org.au/resources/fact-sheets/transsexualism.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 November 2014|title=retrieved 20 August 2015: " Transsexualism is often included within the broader term 'transgender', which is generally considered an umbrella term for people who do not conform to typically accepted gender roles for the sex they were assigned at birth. The term 'transgender' is a word employed by activists to encompass as many groups of gender diverse people as possible. However, many of these groups individually don't identify with the term. Many health clinics and services set up to serve gender variant communities employ the term, however most of the people using these services again don't identify with this term. The rejection of this political category by those that it is designed to cover clearly illustrates the difference between self-identification and categories that are imposed by observers to understand other people."|website=Gendercentre.org.au|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, most legal jurisdictions recognize the two traditional gender identities and social roles, [[man]] and [[woman]], but tend to exclude any other gender identities and expressions. However, there are some countries which recognize, by law, a [[third gender]].  There is now a greater understanding of the breadth of variation outside the typical categories of "man" and "woman", and many self-descriptions are now entering the literature, including ''[[pangender]]'', ''[[genderqueer]]'', ''polygender'', and ''agender''. Medically and socially, the term "transsexualism" is being replaced with ''[[gender incongruence]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/411470068 |title=Gender incongruence. ICD-11 – Mortality and Morbidity Statistics |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=7 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[gender dysphoria]]'',&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |author-link1=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) |year=2013 |pages=451–459 |location=Arlington, VA |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |isbn=978-0-89042-554-1 |doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596}}&lt;/ref&gt; and terms such as ''transgender people'', ''trans men'', and ''trans women'' are replacing the category of transsexual people.

This raises many legal issues and aspects of being transgender.{{clarify|date=December 2019}}  Most of these issues are generally considered a part of [[family law]], especially the issues of [[marriage]] and the question of a transgender person benefiting from a partner's [[insurance]] or [[social security]].

The degree of [[legal recognition]] provided to transgender people varies widely throughout the world.  Many countries now legally recognise sex reassignments by permitting a change of legal gender on an individual's [[birth certificate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kathoey Ladyboy: Thailand's Got Talent|last=Duthel|first=Heinz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many transsexual people have permanent surgery to change their body, [[sexual reassignment surgery]] (SRS) or semi-permanently change their body by hormonal means, [[hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT). In many countries, some of these modifications are required for legal recognition. In a few, the legal aspects are directly tied to health care; i.e. the same bodies or doctors decide whether a person can move forward in their treatment and the subsequent processes automatically incorporate both matters.

In some jurisdictions, transgender people (who are considered non-transsexual) can benefit from the legal recognition given to [[transsexual]] people. In some countries, an explicit medical diagnosis of "transsexualism" is (at least formally) necessary. In others, a diagnosis of "gender dysphoria", or simply the fact that one has established a non-conforming gender role, can be sufficient for some or all of the legal recognition available. The [[DSM-5]] recognizes gender dysphoria as an official diagnosis.

The [[Constitution of South Africa]] forbids discrimination on the basis of sex, gender and sexual orientation (amongst other grounds). The [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] has indicated that "sexual orientation" includes transsexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/christine-give-them-hell/ |first=Pierre |last=De Vos |title=Christine, give them hell! |work=Constitutionally Speaking |date=14 July 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717195016/http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/christine-give-them-hell/ |archivedate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] enacted the [[Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status Act]], which allows a transgender person who has undergone medical or surgical gender reassignment to apply to the [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]] to have the sex description altered on their birth record. Once the birth record is altered they can be issued with a new [[birth certificate]] and [[identity document]], and are considered "for all purposes" to be of the new sex.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=68026 Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status Act, 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629111742/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=68026 |date=29 June 2011 }}''.

===Botswana===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Botswana}}
In September 2017, the Botswana High Court ruled that the refusal of the Registrar of National Registration to change a transgender man's gender marker was "unreasonable and violated his constitutional rights to dignity, privacy, freedom of expression, equal protection of the law, freedom from discrimination and freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment". LGBT activists celebrated the ruling, describing it as a great victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201710090073.html |title=Botswana: Activists Celebrate Botswana's Transgender Court Victory |access-date=14 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621164818/https://allafrica.com/stories/201710090073.html |archive-date=21 June 2019 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://southernafricalitigationcentre.org/2017/09/29/press-release-botswana-high-court-rules-in-landmark-gender-identity-case/ Press Release: Botswana High Court Rules in Landmark Gender Identity Case]&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the Botswana Government announced it would appeal the ruling, but decided against it in December, supplying the trans man in question with a new identity document that reflects his gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mambaonline.com/2017/12/06/sweet-closure-botswana-agrees-recognise-trans-man/ “Sweet closure” as Botswana finally agrees to recognise trans man], ''Mambaonline''&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar case, where a transgender woman sought to change her gender marker to female, was heard in December 2017. The High Court ruled that the Government must recognise her gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/botswana-gaborone-transgender-identity-lgbt-rights-legabibo-court-law-a8114991.html |title=Botswana to recognise a transgender woman’s identity for first time after historic High Court ruling |newspaper=independent.co.uk |date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She dedicated her victory to "every single trans diverse person in Botswana".

===China===
{{Main|Transgender in China}}

In 2009 the Chinese government made it illegal for minors to change their officially listed gender, stating that sexual reassignment surgery, available to only those over the age of twenty, was required in order to apply for a revision of their identification card and residence registration.&lt;ref name="jun"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jun|first1=Pi|title=Transgender in China|journal=Journal of LGBT Youth|date=9 October 2010|volume=7|issue=4|pages=346–351|doi=10.1080/19361653.2010.512518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014 the [[Shanxi|Shanxi province]] started allowing minors to apply for the change with the additional information of their guardian's identification card. This shift in policy allows post-surgery marriages to be recognized as heterosexual and therefore legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sun|first1=Nancy|title=Shanxi Permits Persons to Change Gender Information|url=http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/report/168827-1.htm|accessdate=17 October 2014|publisher=All-China Women's Federation|date=9 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129030210/http://www.womenofchina.cn/html/womenofchina/report/168827-1.htm|archivedate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender youth in China face many challenges. One study found that Chinese parents report 0.5%  (1:200) of their 6 to 12-year boys and 0.6%  (1:167) of girls often or always 'state the wish to be the other gender'. 0.8% (1:125) of 18- to 24-year-old university students who are birth-assigned males (whose sex/gender as indicated on their ID card is male) report that the 'sex/gender I feel in my heart'  is female, while another 0.4% indicating that their perceived gender was 'other'. Among birth-assigned females, 2.9% (1:34) indicated they perceived their gender as male, while another 1.3% indicating 'other'.&lt;ref name="winter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winter|first1=Sam|last2=Conway|first2=Lynn|title=How many trans* people are there?

The [[Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019]], was passed by Parliament in November 2019, and came into effect on 11 January 2020. It  protects transgender individuals against discrimination in education, employment and healthcare. It recognizes the gender identity of the individual, and there are provisions in the law for a certificate to be issued with their new gender identity.  There have been reservations among some in the transgender community, both regarding the difficulty of obtaining a certificate, and because of lack of awareness and lack of sensitivity to the issue among local public officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nath |first1=Damini |title=Transgender Persons Act comes into effect |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/transgender-persons-act-comes-into-effect/article30545336.ece |date=January 11, 2020 |website=The Hindu |publisher=N.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, transgender individuals were officially recognized by the government and allowed to undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]].

===Malaysia===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Malaysia}}
There is no legislation expressly allowing transsexuals to legally change their gender in [[Malaysia]]. The relevant legislations are the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1957 and National Registration Act 1959. Therefore, judges currently exercise their discretion in interpreting the law and defining the gender. There are conflicting decisions on this matter.

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Pakistan}}
'''In 2018''', Islamabad, Pakistan passed a Transgender protection bill, ('''Transgender Person (Protection of Rights) Act''') which implements transgender people's right in identity, and anti-discrimination laws. Laws include recognition of trans identity in legal documents such as passports, ID cards, and driver licenses, and prohibiting discrimination in employment, schools, work-place, public transit, healthcare, etc., as well as the right for inheritance in accordance to their chosen gender. Furthermore, the bill obligates the government to build protection centers and safe houses be built for the transgender community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ingber |first=Sasha |title=Pakistan Passes Historic Transgender Rights Bill |website=npr |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/09/609700652/pakistan-passes-historic-transgender-rights-bill |date=May 9, 2018 |accessdate=October 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the British invasion, [[Hindustan]]is considered gender ambiguity and transgender identity a norm, anti LGBT+ laws were implemented by the British to co-ordinate with theirs in England. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and other religious minorities did not feel passionate hatred towards people with LGBT identity according to historical records. In many ways, the creation of laws which support the LGBT community can be regarded as an act of [[Decolonization]]

In 2009, the Pakistan Supreme Court ruled in favor of the transgender community. The landmark ruling stated that as citizens they were entitled to the equal benefit and protection of the law and called upon the government to take steps to protect transgender people from discrimination and harassment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/14-sc-orders-equal-benefits-for-transvestites-zj-02] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718093830/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/metropolitan/14-sc-orders-equal-benefits-for-transvestites-zj-02|date=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry was the architect of major extension of rights to Pakistan's transgender community during his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jon Boone in Islamabad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/28/pakistan-judges-backlash-ftikhar-haudhry |title=Pakistan's chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry suffers public backlash |work=theguardian.com |accessdate=2014-02-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223012528/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/28/pakistan-judges-backlash-ftikhar-haudhry |archivedate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court of cassation, the highest court in [[Jordan]] allowed a [[Transsexual]] Woman to change her legal Name and Sex to Female in 2014 after she brought forth Medical Reports from Australia.

===Philippines===
{{Main|Transgender rights in the Philippines}}
The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on 12 September 2008, allowed Jeff Cagandahan, 27, to change both his [[birth certificate]], gender and name from Jennifer to Jeff, to male: "We respect respondent’s congenital condition and his mature decision to be a male. Life is already difficult for the ordinary person. We cannot but respect how respondent deals with his unordinary state and thus help make his life easier, considering the unique circumstances in this case. In the absence of a law on the matter, the court will not dictate on respondent concerning a matter so innately private as one's sexuality and lifestyle preferences, much less on whether or not to undergo medical treatment to reverse the male tendency due to rare medical condition, [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]. In the absence of evidence that respondent is an 'incompetent,' and in the absence of evidence to show that classifying respondent as a male will harm other members of society [...] the court affirms as valid and justified the respondent's position and his personal judgment of being a male." Court records showed that – at 6, he had small [[ovaries]]; at 13, his ovarian structure was minimized and he had no breasts and did not menstruate. The [[psychiatrist]] testified that "he has both male and female sex organs, but was genetically female, and that since his body secreted male hormones, his female organs did not develop normally." The [[Philippines]] National Institutes of Health said "people with congenital adrenal hyperplasia lack an [[enzyme]] needed by the [[adrenal gland]] to make the [[hormones]] [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|title=newsinfo.inquirer.net, Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|website=Newsinfo.inquirer.net|accessdate=1 August 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman into Man|work=Fox News|accessdate=26 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610145052/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|archivedate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This, however, only applies to cases involving congenital adrenal hyperplasia and other intersex situations.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The Philippine Supreme Court has also ruled that Filipino citizens do not have the right to legally change their sex on official documents (driver's license, passport, birth certificate, Social Security records, etc.) if they are transsexual and have undergone sexual reassignment surgery.  The Court said that if the man, now anatomically a female, were to be allowed to legally change his sex it would have "serious and wide-ranging legal and public policy consequences," citing the institution of marriage in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/views-and-analysis/06/02/09/sex-change-and-sex-reassignment-katrina-legarda|title=Sex change and sex reassignment - Katrina Legarda - ABS-CBN News|date=26 September 2013|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=1 August 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926051337/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/views-and-analysis/06/02/09/sex-change-and-sex-reassignment-katrina-legarda|archivedate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
{{Main|Transgender rights in South Korea}}
In South Korea, it is possible for transgender individuals to change their legal gender, although it depends on the decision of the judge for each case. Since the 1990s, however, it has been approved in most of the cases. The legal system in Korea does not prevent marriage once a person has changed their legal gender.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2006, the Supreme Court of Korea ruled that transsexuals have the right to alter their legal papers to reflect their reassigned sex. A trans woman can be registered, not only as female, but also as being "born as a woman."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

While same-sex marriage is not approved by South Korean law, a transsexual woman obtains the marital status of 'female' automatically when she marries to a man, even if she has previously been designated as "male."{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 2013 a court ruled that transsexuals can change their legal sex without undergoing genital surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Un|first1=Ji-Won|last2=Park|first2=Hyun-Jung|title=Landmark legal ruling for South Korean transgenders|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/578323.html|accessdate=16 May 2015|newspaper=The Hankyoreh|date=16 May 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101236/http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/578323.html|archivedate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the government unveiled the new chip-embedded identity card, scheduled to be issued in late 2020. Gender will not be explicitly displayed on the physical card, although the second digit of national identification number reveals gender information anyway ("1" for male; "2" for female). With the inception of new identity card, a third gender option (using digit "7" as the second digit of national identification number) will be available to transgender persons alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = 潘| first = 姿羽| title = 2020年啟用晶片身分證 保留數字7給跨性別人士| trans-title= Chip-embedded ID to release in 2020, digit 7 reserved for transgender persons| publisher = Central News Agency, Taiwan|accessdate = 2019-06-12| date = 2018-11-21| url = https://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/201811210342.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it raises concerns that the practice could stigmatize transgender persons, instead of respecting their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; | title = 聯名新聞稿/性別團體回應國發會新制身分證意見| trans-title= Joint press release/ gender groups' response to the National Development Council on the new identity card| website = Beyond Gender (Intersex, Transgender and Transsexual People Care Association)|accessdate = 2019-06-12| date = 2018-11-23| url = https://www.istscare.org/2018/11/23/1144/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details of the third-gender option policy are yet to be released.

After [[same-sex marriage in Taiwan|same-sex marriage law]] became effective on 24 May 2019, transgender persons could marry a person of the same registered gender.

==Europe==
A majority of countries in [[Europe]] give transgender people the right to at least change their first name, most of which also provide a way of changing birth certificates. Several European countries recognize the right of transgender people to marry in accordance with their post-operative sex. [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Sweden]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]] all recognize this right. The [[Convention on the recognition of decisions regarding a sex change]] provides regulations for mutual recognition of sex change decisions and has been signed by five European countries and ratified by Spain and the Netherlands.

===Finland===
{{Main|Transgender rights in Finland}}
In Finland, people wishing to change their legal gender must be sterilized or "for some other reason infertile". A recommendation from the [[UN Human Rights Council]] to eliminate the sterilization requirement was rejected by the Finnish government in 2017.&lt;ref name="gsn-29aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wareham|first1=Jamie|title=Finland will keep sterilizing trans people after it rejects law reform|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/finnish-government-continue-sterilization-trans-people/|accessdate=1 September 2017|newspaper=[[Gay Star News]]|date=29 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902003512/https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/finnish-government-continue-sterilization-trans-people/|archivedate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{main|Transgender rights in Germany}}
In 1908, [[Imperial Germany]] (with the help of sexologist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee|WhK]]) issued a very limited number of [[Transvestite certificate|'transvestite passes']] – ''[[transvestite]]'' at this time referring to crossdressers as well as transgender and [[gender non-conforming]] people – which enabled individuals to dress in clothes which were seen as discordant with their [[biological sex|sex]]. This ended in 1933.&lt;ref name="Gershon"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gershon |first1=Livia |title=Gender Identity in Weimar Germany |url=https://daily.jstor.org/gender-identity-in-weimar-germany/ |website=JSTOR Daily |accessdate=19 July 2019 |date=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Frost |first1=Natasha |title=The Early 20th-Century ID Cards That Kept Trans People Safe From Harassment |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/trans-id-passes-weimar-germany-marcus-hirschfeld |website=Atlas Obscura |accessdate=19 July 2019 |date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1980, [[Germany]] has a law that regulates the change of first names and legal gender. It is called {{lang|de|Gesetz über die Änderung der Vornamen und die Feststellung der Geschlechtszugehörigkeit in besonderen Fällen ([[:de:Transsexuellengesetz]] – TSG)}} (Law about the change of first name and determination of gender identity in special cases (Transsexual law – TSG)).

The bill grants this right to anyone aged 17 and older. However, even underaged children between the age of 15 and 17 will have access to the legal gender recognition process, but under certain conditions, such as obtaining a certificate from a medical council.&lt;ref name="2017GenderChangeBill"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/news/latest-news/greece-gender-recognition-law-oct2017|title=Greece improves gender recognition law but misses chance to introduce self-determination|publisher=ILGA EUROPE|accessdate=10 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104130104/https://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/news/latest-news/greece-gender-recognition-law-oct2017|archivedate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/greece-passes-gender-change-law|title=Greece passes gender-change law opposed by Orthodox church|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=10 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010200400/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/greece-passes-gender-change-law|archivedate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was opposed by the [[Holy Synod]] of the [[Church of Greece|Orthodox Church]], the [[Communist Party of Greece]], [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] and [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]].&lt;ref name="veconomist" /&gt;

The first milestone sentence in the case of gender shifting was given by Warsaw's Voivode Court in 1964. The court reasoned that it be possible, in face of civil procedure and acting on civil registry records, to change one's legal gender after their genital reassignment surgery had been conducted. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled that in some cases, when the attributes of the individual's preferred gender were predominant, it is possible to change one's legal gender even before genital reassignment surgery.&lt;ref&gt;see for example: T.

In 2011, Anna Grodzka, the first transgender MP in the history of Europe who underwent a genital reassignment operation was appointed.

The law allows an adult person to change their legal gender without any requirements. Minors aged 16 and 17 are able to do so with parental consent and a psychological opinion, confirming that their decision has been taken freely and without any outside pressure. The law also prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics, and bans non-consensual sex assignment treatment and/or surgical intervention on intersex children&lt;ref&gt;[https://dre.pt/web/guest/home/-/dre/115933863/details/maximized?serie=I&amp;day=2018-08-07&amp;date=2018-08-01 Lei n.º 38/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Romania]] it is legal for transgender people to change their first name to reflect their gender identity based on personal choice.

On 15 June 2020, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] (SCOTUS) ruled in [[Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia|''Bostock v. Clayton County'']] that for the purposes of Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], discrimination on the basis of transgender status is also discrimination because of sex.

Regardless of the legal sex classification determined by a state or territory, the federal government may make its own determination of sex classification for federally issued documents. For instance, the U.S. Department of State requires a medical certification of "appropriate clinical treatment for transition to the updated gender (male or female)" to amend the gender designation on a U.S. passport, but sex reassignment surgery is not a requirement to obtain a U.S. passport in the updated gender.&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/gender.html "Gender Designation Change", ''Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102171335/https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports/information/gender.html |date=2 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leaves transgender Americans subject to inconsistent and often discriminatory regulations when seeking healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Funk, Jaydi|last2=Funk, Steven|last3=Whelan, Sylvia Blaise|date=2019|title=Trans*+ and Intersex Representation and Pathologization: An Interdisciplinary Argument for Increased Medical Privacy|url=https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128893|journal=Berkeley Journal of Gender, Law &amp;amp; Justice|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|doi=10.15779/z380c4sk4f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooklyn Liberation March, the largest transgender-rights demonstration in LGBTQ history, took place on 14 June 2020 stretching from [[Grand Army Plaza]] to [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn]], focused on supporting black transgender lives, drawing an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/nyregion/brooklyn-black-trans-parade.html|title=How a March for Black Trans Lives Became a Huge Event|author=Anushka Patil|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 June 2020|accessdate=28 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/shannonkeating/pride-protest-black-trans-rally-brooklyn-liberation-lgbtq|title=Corporate Pride Events Can't Happen This Year.

Argentina thus became the first country to adopt a gender recognition policy based entirely on individual autonomy, without any requirement for third party diagnosis, surgeries or obstacles of any type.

===Bolivia===

And in 2008, Brazil's public health system started providing free sexual reassignment operations in compliance with a court order. Federal prosecutors had argued that sexual reassignment surgery was covered under a [[Constitution of Brazil|constitutional]] clause guaranteeing [[medical care]] as a [[Fundamental rights|basic right]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0,,OI2892454-EI715,00-Mudanca+de+sexo+pelo+SUS+comeca+no+fim+do+ano.html Sex-change in Brazil {{in lang|pt}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220651/http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0,,OI2892454-EI715,00-Mudanca+de+sexo+pelo+SUS+comeca+no+fim+do+ano.html |date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Peru transgender persons can change their legal gender and name after complying with certain requirements that may become psychological and psychiatric evaluations, a medical intervention or sex reassignment surgery. A judicial permission is required.
In November 2016, the Constitutional Court of Peru determined that transsexuality is not a pathology and recognized the right to gender identity. However, favorable judicial decisions on gender change have been appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reniec en desacuerdo con cambio de sexo en DNI, pese a orden de Juzgado en Arequipa |url=https://peru21.pe/peru/arequipa-reniec-desacuerdo-cambio-sexo-dni-393934-noticia/ |website=Peru21 |accessdate=2 January 2020 |language=es |date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2019, transgender people can self-identify their gender and update their legal name, without approval from a judge after the approval of the Comprehensive Law for Trans Persons. The new law creates scholarships for trans people to access education, a monthly pension for transgender people born before 1975 and also requires government services to employ a minimum of 1% of the transgender population. It also now acknowledges the self-identification of non-binary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trans people in Uruguay can now self-identify their gender, without surgery |url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/uruguay-transgender-rights/#gs.3e8cX3A0 |website=Gay Star News |accessdate=2 January 2020 |language=en-gb |date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, lawmakers passed the Gender identity law allowing transgender people over the age of 18 to change their name and legal gender on all official documents. Surgery, diagnosis or hormone therapy were not a requirement but a judicial permission was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ley 18.620 DERECHO A LA IDENTIDAD DE GÉNERO Y AL CAMBIO DE NOMBRE Y SEXO EN DOCUMENTOS IDENTIFICATORIOS|url=https://legislativo.parlamento.gub.uy/temporales/leytemp6280254.htm|website=legislativo.parlamento.gub.uy|accessdate=5 September 2016|language=es-LA}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
