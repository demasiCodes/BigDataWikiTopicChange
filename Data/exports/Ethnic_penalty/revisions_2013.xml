The '''ethnic penalty''' is defined as the economic and non-economic disadvantages [[Minority group|ethnic minorities]] experience in the [[Labour economics|labour market]] compared to non-ethnic minority groups of the same human and social capital. Heath and Ridge originally look at the ethnic penalty by making comparisons between two groups in Britain, [[White British|whites]] and [[Black British|blacks]]. They note that unemployment of black African men is twice as high as unemployment of white men.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, A.F. and J. Ridge (1983) “Social Mobility of Ethnic Minorities”, ''Journal of Biosocial Science'', Supplement No. 8: 169-184.&lt;/ref&gt; Using 2001 UK census data, Johnston et al. suggests that all ethno-religious groups experienced ethnic penalties in the labour market, with the exception of White British ethno-religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, R. et al. (2010) "Ethno-Religious Categories and Measuring Occupational Attainment in Relation to Education in England and Wales: A Multilevel Analysis’, Environment and Planning A 42(3): 578-591.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hasmath, examining the Canadian case, concludes that exclusionary [[discrimination]] is not the only potential explanation for ethnic penalties. Conditions such an individual's social network, a firm's working culture, and a community's social trust should be strongly factored.&lt;ref&gt;Hasmath, R. (2012). ''The Ethnic Penalty: Immigration, Education and the Labour'' Market. Aldershot: Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging work by [[Behavioral economics|behavioral economists]], psychologists, and sociologists reinforce the premise that the ethnic penalty is not simply discrimination.  They suggest that non-cognitive factors must be taken into consideration for explaining the ethnic penalty.
