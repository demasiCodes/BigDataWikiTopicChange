J. Rummel]] to describe "the murder of any person or people by a government, including [[genocide]], politicide, and [[mass murder]]".  For example, government-sponsored killings for political reasons would be considered democide. Democide can include deaths arising from "reckless and depraved disregard for life"; this brings into account many deaths arising through mass starvation. However, he himself uses the wider sense of "killed by", including all kinds "reason-result" relationship between act of government and actual death of person. Moreover, calculating the number of victims, he doesn't need evidence of somebodies' death; the result of statistical calculation is, for Rummel, effective proof.

While of relatively recent origin, the word has gained in use, particularly by legal and social activists for [[human rights]]. It should, however, be noted that the term ''democide'' is not yet widely accepted.  Although it is clearly Rummel's intent that the term democide should include war deaths, many have objected to the characterization of such deaths as murder./* Accusations of Democide */ It is not Rummel's intent to include war deaths. He explicitly excludes them in his definition, except for the purposive killing of noncombatants.

=== Accusations of Democide ===

For books, articles, data, and analyses regarding democide, see Rummel's website at www.hawaii.edu/powerkills.

Accusations of mass killings by a government are relatively common. Less common are well-documented cases with enough evidence to support the accusation.  Almost all accusations are disputed to some degree, although the evidence in some cases is stronger than in others.  For instance, many of the figures cited in ''Death by Government'', in which R.J. Rummel first coined the term,  have been criticized for not taking into account numbers of deaths caused by the absence of government by means such as [[anarchy]], civil disorder, or foreign invasion. 

Some frequently used examples of democide include [[The Great Purges]] carried out by [[Joseph Stalin]] in the [[Soviet Union]] between [[1934]] and [[1939]], which led to an estimated 20 million deaths (this figure is disputed), and the actions of [[Mao Zedong]] in launching the [[Great Leap Forward]] in [[1958]], resulting in a famine which killed many million of people. These were not cases of genocide, because those who were killed were not selected on the basis of their race, but were killed in large numbers as a result of government policies.

===Significant 20th century democides===
The following based on Matthew White's web site [http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstats.htm] lists the significant democides where the death rate can be estimated to exceed 1,000,000. Accurate figures are difficult to establish and many estimates tend to reflect particular biases.  In speaking of the [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] democides White concludes that the toll was "700,000 to 1,600,000 more or less".  Several of these amounts include a significant portion of famine deaths.

The listing of the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II]] has been hotly disputed, particularly by people acting in defense of those countries that appear responsible. They especially dispute the high numbers that have been reported as killed. They suggest that these killings should be included as victims of World War II, despite the fact that these activities continued well after the war.

The total of these is 196,500,000

== Critics of Rummel calculations ==   

Professional historians point out that Rummel's methods of calculating death tolls are highly controversial. He compares the statistical data before and after a crucial date and derives conclusions about the number of killings that had occurred in between. However, he fails to establish evidence of the actual killing. His results are essentially based on statistical data which are highly prone to errors.
