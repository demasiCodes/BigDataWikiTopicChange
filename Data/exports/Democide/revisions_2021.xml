'''Democide''' is a concept proposed by American political scientist [[Rudolph Rummel]] to describe "the intentional killing of an unarmed or disarmed person by government agents acting in their [[authoritative]] capacity and pursuant to government policy or high command."&lt;ref name="Harff 1996"&gt;Harff, Barbara (1996).

Rummel created ''democide'' as an extended term to include forms of government murder not covered by ''[[genocide]]''. According to Rummel, democide surpassed war as the leading cause of non-natural death in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democraticpeace.wordpress.com/2009/07/01/democide-vs-other-causes-of-death/|title=Democide Vs.

== Definition ==
Democide is the murder of any person or people by their government, including genocide, politicide and mass murder. Democide is not necessarily the elimination of entire cultural groups but rather groups within the country that the government feels need to be eradicated for political reasons and due to claimed future threats.&lt;ref name="Harff 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harff 2017"/&gt;

According to Rummel, genocide has three different meanings. The ordinary meaning is murder by government of people due to their national, ethnic, racial or religious group membership. The legal meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty on genocide, the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]. This also includes nonlethal acts that in the end eliminate or greatly hinder the group. Looking back on history, one can see the different variations of democides that have occurred, but it still consists of acts of killing or mass murder. The generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. In order to avoid confusion over which meaning is intended, Rummel created the term ''democide'' for this third meaning.&lt;ref name="Genocide"&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/GENOCIDE.HTM Genocide].&lt;/ref&gt;

In "How Many Did Communist Regimes Murder?", Rummel wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;First, however, I should clarify the term democide. It means for governments what murder means for an individual under municipal law. It is the premeditated killing of a person in cold blood, or causing the death of a person through reckless and wanton disregard for their life. Thus, a government incarcerating people in a prison under such deadly conditions that they die in a few years is murder by the state—democide—as would parents letting a child die from malnutrition and exposure be murder. So would government forced labor that kills a person within months or a couple of years be murder. So would government created famines that then are ignored or knowingly aggravated by government action be murder of those who starve to death. And obviously, extrajudicial executions, death by torture, government massacres, and all genocidal killing be murder. However, judicial executions for crimes that internationally would be considered capital offenses, such as for murder or treason (as long as it is clear that these are not fabricated for the purpose of executing the accused, as in communist show trials), are not democide. Nor is democide the killing of enemy soldiers in combat or of armed rebels, nor of noncombatants as a result of military action against military targets.&lt;ref name="Rummel 1993"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his work and research, Rummel distinguished between colonial, democratic, and authoritarian and totalitarian regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tago|first1=Atsushi|last2=Wayman|first2=Frank|date=January 2010|title=Explaining the Onset of Mass Killing, 1949–87|journal=Journal of Peace Research|location=Thousand Oaks, California|publisher=SAGE  Publications|volume=47|issue=1|pages=3–13|doi=10.1177/0022343309342944|issn=0022-3433|jstor=25654524|s2cid=145155872}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defined [[totalitarianism]] thusly:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is much confusion about what is meant by totalitarian in the literature, including the denial that such systems even exist. I define a totalitarian state as one with a system of government that is unlimited constitutionally or by countervailing powers in society (such as by a church, rural gentry, labor unions, or regional powers); is not held responsible to the public by periodic secret and competitive elections; and employs its unlimited power to control all aspects of society, including the family, religion, education, business, private property, and social relationships. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union was thus totalitarian, as was Mao's China, Pol Pot's Cambodia, Hitler's Germany, and U Ne Win's Burma. Totalitarianism is then a political ideology for which a totalitarian government is the agency for realizing its ends. Thus, totalitarianism characterizes such ideologies as state socialism (as in Burma), Marxism-Leninism as in former East Germany, and Nazism. Even revolutionary Moslem Iran since the overthrow of the Shaw in 1978–79 has been totalitarian—here totalitarianism was married to Moslem fundamentalism. In short, totalitarianism is the ideology of absolute power. State socialism, communism, Nazism, fascism, and Moslem fundamentalism have been some of its recent raiments. Totalitarian governments have been its agency. The state, with its international legal sovereignty and independence, has been its base. As will be pointed out, mortacracy is the result.&lt;ref name="Rummel 1994b"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rummel|first=Rudolph|year=1994|chapter-url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781351294089-2/democide-totalitarian-states-mortacracies-megamurderers-rummel|chapter=Democide in Totalitarian States: Mortacracies and Megamurderers|editor-last1=Charny|editor-first1=Israel W.|editor-last2=Horowitz|editor-first2=Irving Louis|title=The Widening Circle of Genocide|edition=1st|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781351294089-2/democide-totalitarian-states-mortacracies-megamurderers-rummel|isbn=9781351294089|accessdate=25 November 2021|via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Estimates ==
In his estimates, [[Rudolph Rummel]] relied mostly on historical accounts, an approach that rarely provides accuracy compared with contemporary academic opinion. In the case of Mexican democide, Rummel wrote that while "these figures amount to little more than informed guesses", he thought "there is enough evidence to at least indict these authoritarian regimes for megamurder."&lt;ref name="Mexican Democide"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rummel|first=Rudolph|year=2003|orig-year=1997|chapter-url=https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP11.HTM|chapter=Statistics of Mexican Democide: Estimates, Calculations, and Sources|title=Statistic of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900|edition=hardback|location=Charlottesville, Virginia|publisher=Center for National Security Law, School of Law, University of Virginia; Transaction Publishers, Rutgers University|isbn=9783825840105|accessdate=August 31, 2021|via=POwer Kills}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rummel, his research showed that the death toll from democide is far greater than the death toll from war. After studying over 8,000 reports of government-caused deaths, Rummel estimated that there have been 262 million victims of democide in the last century. According to his figures, six times as many people have died from the actions of people working for governments than have died in battle. One of his main findings was that democracies have much less democide than authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Harff 2017"/&gt; Rummel argued that there is a relation between political power and democide. Political mass murder grows increasingly common as political power becomes unconstrained. At the other end of the scale, where power is diffuse, checked, and balanced, political violence is a rarity. According to Rummel, "[t]he more power a regime has, the more likely people will be killed. This is a  major reason for promoting freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/FREEMAN.INTERVIEW.HTM|title=An Exclusive Freeman Interview: Rudolph Rummel Talks About the Miracle of Liberty and Peace|magazine=The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty|issue=47|date=July 1997|accessdate=2 November 2021|via=Power Kills}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rummel argued that "concentrated political power is the most dangerous thing on earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Jacobs|editor-first1=Steven|editor-last2=Totten|editor-first2=Samuel|year=2013|orig-year=2002|title=Pioneers of Genocide Studies|edition=1st|location=London, England|publisher=Routledge|page=170|isbn=9781412849746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rummel's estimates, especially about Communist democide, typically included a wide range and cannot be considered determinative.&lt;ref name="Harff 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harff 2017"/&gt; Rummel calculated nearly 43 million deaths due to democide inside and outside the Soviet Union during Stalin's regime.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/DBG.TAB1.4.GIF&lt;/ref&gt; This is much higher than an often quoted figure of 20 million, or a 2010s figure of 9 million.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Tymothy D. (27 January 2011). [http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2011/01/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/ "Hitler vs. Stalin: Who was worse?"]. ''The New York Review of Books''. Retrieved 25 November 2021.&lt;/ref&gt; Rummel responded that the 20 million estimate is based on a figure from  [[Robert Conquest]]'s ''[[The Great Terror (book)|The Great Terror]]'' and that Conquest's qualifier "almost certainly too low" is usually forgotten. For Rummell, Conquest's calculations excluded camp deaths before 1936 and after 1950, executions (1939–1953), the forced [[population transfer in the Soviet Union]] (1939–1953), the deportation within the Soviet Union of minorities (1941–1944), and those the Soviet [[Red Army]] and [[Cheka]] (the [[secret police]]) executed throughout Eastern Europe after their conquest during the 1944–1945 period. Moreover, the [[Holodomor]] that killed 5 million in 1932–1934 (according to Rummel) is also not included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/04/how-many-did-stalin-really-murder.html "How Many Did Stalin Really Murder?"]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rummel, forced labor, executions and concentration camps were responsible for over one million deaths in the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] from 1948 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Rummel, Rudolph (1997).

Retrieved 14 November 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other researchers have found similar results to Rummel's. One commented that "[n]umerous researchers point out that democratic norms and political structures constrain elite decisions about the use of repression against their citizens whereas autocratic elites are not so constrained. Once in place, democratic institutions—even partial ones—reduce the likelihood of armed conflict and all but eliminate the risk that it will lead to geno/politicide."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/genocide/ "Genocide"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030201259/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/genocide/|date=30 October 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers often give widely different estimates of [[mass killing]]s or [[mass murder]]s. They use different definitions, methodology and sources, with some including battle deaths in their calculations. [[Klas-Göran Karlsson]] prefers using the term ''[[crimes against humanity]]'' to include "the direct mass killings of politically undesirable elements, as well as forced deportations and forced labour." Karlsson acknowledges that the term may be misleading in the sense that the Communist regimes targeted groups of their own citizens, but he considers it useful as a broad legal term which emphasizes attacks on civilian populations and because the offenses demean humanity as a whole.&lt;ref name="Karlsson &amp; Schoenhals 2008"&gt;Karlsson, Klas-Göran; Schoenhals, Michael (2008).

In 1994, [[Rudolph Rummel]]'s book ''Death by Government'' included about 110 million people, foreign and domestic, killed by Communist democide from 1900 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Rummel, Rudolph (1994). ''Death by Government''. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers. p. 15, table 1.6. {{ISBN|978-1-56000-927-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Rummel wrote: "Even were we to have total access to all communist archives we still would not be able to calculate precisely how many the communists murdered. Consider that even in spite of the archival statistics and detailed reports of survivors, the best experts still disagree by over 40 percent on the total [[The Holocaust#Victims and death toll|number of Jews killed by the Nazis]]. We cannot expect near this accuracy for the victims of communism. We can, however, get a probable [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)|order of magnitude]] and a relative approximation of these deaths within a most likely range."&lt;ref name="Rummel 1993"/&gt; Due to additional information about [[Mao Zedong]]'s culpability in the [[Great Chinese Famine]] according to ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'', a 2005 book authored by [[Jon Halliday]] and [[Jung Chang]], Rummel revised upward his total for Communist democide to about 148 million,&lt;ref&gt;Rummel, Rudolph (10 October 2005).

The criticism of some of the estimates, especially those of Rummel and ''The Black Book of Communism'' which made use of Rummel's estimates and analysis, are mostly focused on three aspects, namely that the estimates were based on sparse and incomplete data when significant errors are inevitable; that the figures were skewed to higher possible values; and that those dying at war and victims of civil wars, Holodomor and other famines under Communist governments should not be counted.&lt;ref name="Harff 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuromiya, Hiroaki (2001).

"There is barely any other field of study that enjoys so little consensus on defining principles such as definition of genocide, typology, application of a comparative method, and timeframe. Considering that scholars have always put stress on prevention of genocide, comparative genocide studies have been a failure. Paradoxically, nobody has attempted so far to assess the field of comparative genocide studies as a whole. This is one of the reasons why those who define themselves as genocide scholars have not been able to detect the situation of crisis."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Far-right, fascist, and feudal regimes ====
Estimates by Rummel for [[fascist]] or [[far-right]] regimes include [[Nazi Germany]] at 20,946,000 (1933–1945), [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Nationalist China]] (1925–1949) and later [[Martial law in Taiwan|Taiwan]] at 10,214,000 (1949–1987), and [[Empire of Japan]] at 5,964,000 (1900–1945). Estimates for other regime-types include the [[Ottoman Empire]] at 1,883,000 ([[Greek genocide]]), [[Pakistan]] at 1,503,000 ([[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]), [[Porfiriato]] at somewhere between 600,000–3,000,000 and closer to 1,417,000 (1900–1920),&lt;ref name="Mexican Democide"/&gt; and the [[Russian Empire]] at 1,066,000 (1900–1917).&lt;ref name="Rummel 1994a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rummel|first=Rudolph|year=1994|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE1.HTM|title=Death by Government: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900|edition=1st|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781560009276|accessdate=25 November 2021|via=Power Kills}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democide in Communist and Nationalist China, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union are characterized by Rummel as deka-megamurderers (128,168,000), while those in Cambodia, Japan, Pakistan, Poland, Turkey, Vietnam, and Yugoslavia are characterized as the lesser megamurderers (19,178,000), and cases in Mexico, North Korea, and feudal Russia are characterized as suspected megamurderers (4,145,000).&lt;ref name="Rummel 1994a"/&gt; Rummel wrote that "even though the Nazis hardly matched the democide of the Soviets and Communist Chinese as shown in table 1.3, they proportionally killed more. Figure 1.2 illustrates this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rummel|first=Rudolph|year=1992|url=https://hawaii.edu/powerkills/NAZIS.CHAP1.HTM|title=Democide: Nazi Genocide and Mass Murder|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412821476|accessdate=28 November 2021|via=Power Kills}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial regimes ===
In response to [[David Stannard]]'s figures about what he terms "the [[American Holocaust]]", Rummel estimated that over the centuries of [[European colonization]] about 2 million to 15 million [[American indigenous people]] were victims of democide, excluding military battles and unintentional deaths in Rummel's definition. Rummel wrote that "[e]ven if these figures are remotely true, then this still make this subjugation of the Americas one of the bloodier, centuries long, democides in world history."&lt;ref&gt;''Cook on Stannard'', p. 12. Rummel's quote and estimate from [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/DBG.CHAP3.HTM his website], about midway down the page, after footnote 82. Rummel's estimate is presumably not a single democide, but is a total of multiple democides, since there were many different governments involved.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democratic regimes ===
While democratic regimes are considered by Rummel to be the least likely to commit democide and engage in wars per the [[democratic peace theory]],&lt;ref name="Harff 2017"/&gt; Rummel wrote that "democracies themselves are responsible for some of this democide. Detailed estimates have yet to be made, but preliminarily work suggests that some 2,000,000 foreigners have been killed in cold blood by democracies."&lt;ref name="Rummel 1994b"/&gt; [[Foreign policy]] and [[secret service]]s of democratic regimes "may also carry on subversive activities in other states, support deadly coups, and actually encourage or support rebel or military forces that are involved in democidal activities. Such was done, for example, by the American CIA in the 1952 coup against Iran Prime Minister Mossadeq and the 1973 coup against Chile's democratically elected President Allende by General Pinochet. Then there was the secret support given the military in El Salvador and Guatemala although they were slaughtering thousands of presumed communist supporters, and that of the Contras in their war against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua in spite of their atrocities. Particularly reprehensible was the covert support given to the Generals in Indonesia as they murdered hundreds of thousands of communists and others after the alleged attempted communist coup in 1965, and the continued secret support given to General Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan of Pakistan even as he was involved in murdering over a million Bengalis in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)."&lt;ref name="Rummel 1994b"/&gt;

According to Rummel, examples of democratic democide would include "those killed in indiscriminate or civilian targeted city bombing, as of Germany and Japan in World War II. It would include the large scale massacres of Filipinos during the bloody American colonization of the Philippines at the beginning of this century, deaths in British concentration camps in South Africa during the Boar War, civilian deaths due to starvation during the British blockade of Germany in and after World War I, the rape and murder of helpless Chinese in and around Peking in 1900, the atrocities committed by Americans in Vietnam, the murder of helpless Algerians during the Algerian War by the French, and the unnatural deaths of German prisoners of war in French and American POW camps after World War II."&lt;ref name="Rummel 1994b"/&gt;
