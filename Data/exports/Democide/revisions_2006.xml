'''Democide''' is a term created by [[political scientist]] [[R. J. Rummel]] in order to create a broader concept than the legal definition of genocide. Democide is defined as "The murder of any person or people by a [[government]], including [[genocide]], [[politicide]], and [[mass murder]]"

==Definition==
According to Rummel, [[genocide]] has 3 different meanings. The ordinary meaning is murder by government of people due to their national, ethnic, racial, or religious group membership. The legal meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty, the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]. This also includes nonlethal acts that in the end eliminate the group, such as preventing births or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group. A generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. It is to avoid confusion regarding what meaning is intended that Rummel created the term democide for the third meaning.[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/GENOCIDE.HTM]

Rummel defines democide as "The murder of any person or people by a [[government]], including [[genocide]], [[politicide]], and [[mass murder]]". For example, government-sponsored killings for political reasons would be considered democide. Democide can also include deaths arising from "intentionally or knowingly reckless and depraved disregard for life"; this brings into account many deaths arising through various neglects and abuses, such as forced [[mass starvation]]. Rummel explicitly excludes battle deaths in his definition. Capital punishment, actions taken against armed civilians during mob action or riot, and the deaths of noncombatants killed during attacks on military targets so long as the primary target is military, are not considered democide. More exact details can be found here: [http://www.freedomsnest.com/rummel_definition.html]

He has further stated: "I use the civil definition of murder, where someone can be guilty of murder if they are responsible in a reckless and wanton way for the loss of life, as in incarcerating people in camps where they may soon die of malnutrition, unattended disease, and forced labor, or deporting them into wastelands where they may die rapidly from exposure and disease."

Some examples of democide include [[the Great Purges]] carried out by [[Joseph Stalin]] in the [[Soviet Union]], the deaths from the [[colonial]] policy in the [[Congo Free State]], and [[Mao]]'s [[Great Leap Forward]] resulting in a famine which killed millions of people. These were not cases of genocide, because those who were killed were not selected on the basis of their race, but were killed in large numbers as a result of government policies. Famine is classified as democide if it fits the definition above.

As an example, Rummel until recently did not classify the Great Leap Forward as  democide. He believed that Mao's policies were largely responsible for the  famine, but he was misled about it, and finally when he found out, he stopped  it and changed his policies. Thus not an intentional famine and thus not a  democide. New information from ''[[Mao: the Unknown Story]]'' states that Mao  knew about the famine from the beginning and didn't care. Eventually he had to  be stopped by a meeting of 7,000 top Communist Party members. Thus the famine  was intentional and a  democide.[http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/11/getting-my-reestimate-of-maos-democide.html]

== Research on democide ==
Accusations of mass killings by a government are relatively common. Less common are well-documented cases with enough evidence to support the accusation.  Almost all accusations are disputed to some degree, although the evidence in some cases is stronger than in others.

Rummel's sources  include scholarly works, refugee reports, memoirs, biographies, historical  analyses, actual exhumed body counts, records kept by the murderers themselves,  and so on. In short his data are all estimates available in English for  all nations over a period of a century, and available in the libraries he  worked in, including the [[Library of Congress]]. 

He provides the most probable death toll along a low and a high count that are meant to be the most unlikely low and high number of deaths, and thus to bracket the probable true count. It is to determine these lows and highs that he includes what some others might consider absurd estimates. His published books do not include new research and new sources available after the publication date.

Rummel's counts 43 million deaths due to democide during Stalin's regime inside  and outside the Soviet Union. This is much higher than an often quoted figure  of 20 million. Rummel has responded that this is based on a figure from  [[Robert Conquest]]'s book ''[[The Great Terror]]'' from [[1968]] and that  Conquest's qualifier "almost certainly too low" is usually forgotten.  Conquest's calculations excluded camp deaths after 1950, and before 1936;  executions 1939-53; the vast deportation of the people of captive nations into  the camps, and their deaths 1939-1953; the massive deportation within the  Soviet Union of minorities 1941-1944; and their deaths; and those the Soviet  Red Army and secret police executed throughout Eastern Europe after their  conquest during 1944-1945. Moreover, the [[Holodomor]] that killed 5 million in  1932-1934 is not  included.[http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/04/how-many-did-stalin-really-murder.html]

His research shows that the death toll from democide is far greater than the death toll from war. After studying over 8,000 reports of government caused deaths, Rummel estimates that there have been 262 million victims of democide in the last century. According to his figures, six times as many people have died from the inflictions of people working for governments than have died in battle.

One of his main findings is that liberal democracies have much less democide than authoritarian regimes.[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/MIRACLE.HTM] He argues that there is a relation between political power and  democide. Political mass murder grows increasingly common as political power  becomes unconstrained. At the other end of the scale, where power is diffuse,  checked, and balanced, political violence is a rarity. According to Rummel,  "The more power a regime has, the more likely people will be killed. This is a  major reason for promoting freedom." Rummel concludes: "Concentrated political  power is the most dangerous thing on earth."

Several other researchers have found similar results. "Numerous researchers point out that democratic norms and political structures constrain elite decisions about the use of repression against their citizens whereas autocratic elites are not so constrained." "Once in place, democratic institutions-even partial ones-reduce the likelihood of armed conflict and all but eliminate therisk that it will lead to geno/politicide."[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/inscr/genocide/]

For books, articles, data, and analyses regarding democide, see Rummel's website.[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/] In particular, he has an extensive [[FAQ]].[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/QA.V2.HTML] He has also made his many sources and the calculations used, from a pre-publisher manuscript of his book ''Statistics of Democide'', available online.[http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP1.HTM] Researchers often give widely different estimates of mass murder. They use different definitions, methodology, and sources. For example, some include battle deaths in their calculations. Matthew White's website has compiled some of these different estimates.[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstats.htm]

== Update on democides ==

In May 2005, Rummel guessed the number for [[Darfur Conflict]] to be [http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/05/democide-galore_08.html &gt;400,000.]

In November 2005, he estimated the democide in [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]'s [[People's Republic of China|China]] (1949-1975) to 73,000,000. 
[http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/11/reevaluating-chinas-democide-to-be.html Reevaluating China's Democide to be 73,000,000 ]

In December 2005, he raised his estimate for colonial democide to 50,000,000 and estimated the democide in the [[Congo Free State]] to 10,000,000.[http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/12/reevaluating-colonial-democide.html][http://freedomspeace.blogspot.com/2005/12/new-estimate-of-20th-century-democide.html]
