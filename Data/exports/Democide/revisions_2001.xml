J. Rummel]] in his book "Death by Government". He defines democide as "the murder of any person or people by a government, including [[genocide]], [[politicide]], and [[mass murder]]". (Source: [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/DBG.CHAP2.HTM]).



Democide includes killings for political purposes (politicide), and large scale indiscriminate murder (e.g. the quota system that operated under Stalinism).



Democide is both a broader and a more restricted term than [[genocide]]. On the one hand, it includes killings on political or other grounds, which genocide (at least according to the original meaning of the term) does not. On the other hand, it excludes acts other than killing intended to destroy a ethnic or racial group, such as forced sterilization or the removal of children. Such acts count as genocide, but not democide.



According to research done by [[R.J. Rummel]], the likelihood of a government committing what he calls [[democide]], the mass killing by a government of its own population, correlates with the extent of governmental power. The more power a government has, the more likely it is to kill people, with wholesale killings being possible only in totalitarian regimes. Rummel also estimates that in the 20th century, 169 million people were killed in democide.



Governments are not the only organizations that kill people. See [[homicidal organization]].
