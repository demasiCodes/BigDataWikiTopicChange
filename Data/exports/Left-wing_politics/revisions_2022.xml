Within the [[left–right political spectrum]], ''Left'' and ''[[right-wing politics|Right]]'' were coined during the [[French Revolution]], referring to the seating arrangement in the French [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]]. Those who sat on the left generally opposed the [[Ancien Régime]] and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[monarchy]] and supported the French Revolution, the creation of a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[republic]] and the [[secularisation]] of society&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author-last1=Knapp |author-first1=Andrew |url=https://archive.org/details/governmentpoliti0000knap |title=The government and politics of France |author-last2=Wright |author-first2=Vincent |date=2006 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-35732-6 |edition=5th |location=London [u.a.] |quote=the government and politics of france.|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those on the right were supportive of the traditional institutions of the Ancien Régime. Usage of the term ''Left'' became more prominent after the restoration of the French monarchy in 1815, when it was applied to the ''Independents''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Realms of memory: conflicts and divisions |date=1996 |editor-first=Pierre |editor-last=Nora |chapter=Right and Left |author-first=Marcel |author-last=Gauchet |pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''wing'' was first appended to Left and Right in the late 19th century, usually with disparaging intent, and ''left-wing'' was applied to those who were unorthodox in their religious or political views.

Ideologies considered to be ''left-wing'' vary greatly depending on the placement of the [[Overton window]] along the [[left–right political spectrum|political spectrum]] in a given time and place. At the end of the 18th century, upon the founding of the first [[Liberal democracy#Origins|liberal democracies]], the term ''Left'' was used to describe [[liberalism]] in the United States and [[republicanism]] in France, supporting a lesser degree of [[Social stratification|hierarchical decision-making]] than the ''right-wing politics'' of the [[Traditional conservatism|traditional conservatives]] and [[Monarchism|Monarchists]]. In [[Modernism|modern]] politics, the term ''Left'' typically applies to ideologies and movements to the left of [[classical liberalism]], supporting some degree of [[Economic democracy|democracy in the economic sphere]]. Today, ideologies such as [[social liberalism]] and [[social democracy]] are considered to be [[centre-left]], while ''the Left'' is typically reserved for movements more [[Criticism of capitalism|critical of capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-first1=Alan |author-last1=Maass |author-first2=Howard |author-last2=Zinn |author-link2=Howard Zinn |title=The Case for Socialism |quote=The ''International Socialist Review'' is one of the best left-wing journals around... |page=164 |publisher=[[Haymarket Books]] |edition=Revised |year=2010 |isbn=978-1608460731}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[anarchism]], [[communism]], [[Marxism]] and [[syndicalism]], each of which rose to prominence in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-first1=Michael |author-last1=Schmidt |author-first2=Lucien |author-last2=Van der Walt |author-link2=Lucien van der Walt |title=Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism |series=Counter-Power |volume=1 |publisher=[[AK Press]] |year=2009 |page=128 |quote=[...] anarchism is a coherent intellectual and political current dating back to the 1860s and the First International, and part of the labour and left tradition. |isbn=978-1-904859-16-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==
{{See also|Right-wing politics}}
The following positions are typically associated with left-wing politics.

=== Economics ===
{{see also|Anarchist economics|Marxism and Keynesianism|Socialist economics}}
Left-leaning economic beliefs range from [[Keynesian]] economics and the [[welfare state]] through [[industrial democracy]] and the [[social market]] to the [[nationalization]] of the economy and [[Planned economy|central planning]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-first=Andrew |author-last=Glyn |title=Social Democracy in Neoliberal Times: The Left and Economic Policy since 1980 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=2001 |isbn=978-0-19-924138-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] advocacy of a council-based and self-managed [[anarchist communism]]. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], leftists supported [[trade union]]s. At the beginning of the 20th century, many leftists advocated strong government intervention in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last1=Beinhocker |author-first1=Eric D. |title=The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics |date=2006 |publisher=[[Harvard Business Press|Harvard Business School Press]] |location=Boston, Mass. |isbn=978-1-57851-777-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/originofwealthev00bein/page/316 316] |url=https://archive.org/details/originofwealthev00bein/page/316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leftists continue to criticize the perceived exploitative nature of [[globalization]], the "[[race to the bottom]]" and unjust lay-offs and exploitation of workers. In the last quarter of the 20th century, the belief that the government (ruling in accordance with the interests of the people) ought to be directly involved in the day-to-day workings of an economy declined in popularity amongst the [[centre-left]], especially [[social democrats]] who adopted the [[Third Way]].

Other leftists believe in [[Marxian economics]], named after the economic theories of [[Karl Marx]]. Some distinguish Marx's economic theories from his political philosophy, arguing that Marx's approach to understanding the economy is independent of his advocacy of [[revolutionary socialism]] or his belief in the inevitability of a [[proletarian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Neo-Marxian Schools |publisher=[[The New School]] |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/neomarx.htm |access-date=23 August 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416234151/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/neomarx.htm |archive-date=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author-last=Munro |author-first=John |title=Some Basic Principles of Marxian Economics |publisher=[[University of Toronto]] |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~munro5/MARXECON.htm |access-date=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxian economics do not exclusively rely on Marx and draw from a range of Marxist and non-Marxist sources. The ''[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]'' and ''[[workers' state]]'' are terms used by some Marxists, particularly [[Leninists]] and [[Marxist–Leninists]], to describe what they see as a temporary state between the [[capitalist]] [[State of affairs (sociology)|state of affairs]] and a [[communist society]]. Marx defined the proletariat as salaried workers, in contrast to the [[lumpenproletariat]], who he defined as the outcasts of society such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049344/Lumpenproletariat |title=Lumpenproletariat |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political relevance of farmers has divided the left.

[[Left-libertarians]], [[anarchists]] and [[libertarian socialists]] believe in a [[decentralized]] economy run by [[trade unions]], [[workers' councils]], [[cooperatives]], [[municipalities]] and communes, opposing both [[State ownership|state]] and [[Private property|private]] control of the economy, preferring [[social ownership]] and local control in which a nation of decentralized regions is united in a [[confederation]]. The [[global justice movement]], also known as the [[anti-globalisation movement]] and the [[alter-globalisation]] movement, protests against [[corporate]] [[economic globalisation]] due to its negative consequences for the poor, workers, the environment, and small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-first=Tom |author-last=Mertes |title=A Movement of Movements |location=New York |publisher=[[Verso Books]] |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Krishna-Hensel |author-first=Sai |year=2006 |title=Global Cooperation: Challenges and Opportunities in the Twenty-first Century |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Juris"&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Juris |author-first=Jeffrey S. |year=2008 |title=Networking Futures: The Movements against Corporate Globalization |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |location=Durham |isbn=978-0-8223-4269-4 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the foremost left-wing advocates was Thomas Paine, one of the first individuals since ''left'' and ''right'' became political terms to describe the collective human ownership of the world which he speaks of in Agrarian Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-last1=Paine |author-first1=Thomas |title=Agrarian Justice |url=http://thomaspaine.org/major-works/agrarian-justice.html |publisher=Thomas Paine National Historical Association |access-date=13 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, most of left-wing thought and literature regarding environmentalism stems from this duty of ownership and the aforementioned form of cooperative ownership means that humanity must take care of the Earth. This principle is reflected in much of the historical left-wing thought and literature that came afterwards, although there were disagreements about what this entailed. Both Karl Marx and the early socialist philosopher and scholar [[William Morris]] arguably had a concern for environmental matters.&lt;ref name="Foster2000"&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Foster |author-first=J.

From the 1970s onwards, environmentalism became an increasing concern of the left, with social movements and several unions campaigning on environmental issues and causes. In Australia, the left-wing [[Builders Labourers Federation]], led by the communist Jack Mundy, united with environmentalists to place [[green ban]]s on environmentally destructive development projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Burgman |author-first=Meredith |title=Green Bans, Red Union: Environmental Activism and the New South Wales Builders Labourers' Federation |publisher=[[UNSW Press]] |location=Sydney |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several segments of the socialist and Marxist left consciously merged environmentalism and anti-capitalism into an [[eco-socialist]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Wall |author-first=D. |title=Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Commoner]] articulated a left-wing response to ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' model that predicted catastrophic [[resource depletion]] and spurred environmentalism, postulating that capitalist technologies were the key cause responsible for environmental degradation, as opposed to human population pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Commoner |author-first=B. |title=[[The Closing Circle]] |date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental degradation can be seen as a class or equity issue, as environmental destruction disproportionately affects poorer communities and countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/articles/file/The+Argentimes.pdf |title=Poor Bear Burden of Industrialisation |work=[[Blacksmith Institute]] |date=19 October 2007 |access-date=16 April 2016 |author-first=Sanra |author-last=Ritten |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184856/http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/articles/file/The+Argentimes.pdf |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several left-wing or socialist groupings have an overt environmental concern and several green parties contain a strong socialist presence. The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] features an eco-socialist group, the [[Green Left (UK)|Green Left]], which was founded in June 2005.

=== Nationalism, anti-imperialism and anti-nationalism ===
{{see also|Anarchism and nationalism|Anti-imperialism|Internationalism (politics)|Left-wing nationalism|Proletarian internationalism|}}
The question of [[nationality]], [[imperialism]] and [[nationalism]] has been a central feature of political debates on the Left. During the French Revolution, nationalism was a key policy of the Republican Left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last1=Doyle |author-first1=William |title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution |date=2002 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-925298-5 |edition=2nd |quote="An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...", "The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed, it has conquered the world." |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoff00doyl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican Left advocated for [[civic nationalism]]&lt;ref name="Knapp" /&gt; and argued that the nation is a "daily plebiscite" formed by the subjective "will to live together". Related to [[revanchism]], the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism was sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, there was a debate between leftists such as the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical]] [[Georges Clemenceau]], the [[French Section of the Workers' International|Socialist]] [[Jean Jaurès]] and the nationalist [[Maurice Barrès]], who argued that colonialism diverted France from liberating the "blue line of the [[Vosges]]", in reference to Alsace-Lorraine; and the "[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]" such as [[Jules Ferry]] of the [[Moderate Republicans (France)|Moderate Republicans]], [[Léon Gambetta]] of the [[Republican Union (France)|Republicans]] and [[Eugène Etienne]], the president of the Parliamentary Colonial Group. After the [[antisemitic]] [[Dreyfus Affair]] in which officer [[Alfred Dreyfus]] was falsely convicted of sedition and exiled to a penal colony in 1894 before being exonerated in 1906, nationalism in the form of [[Boulangism]] increasingly became associated with the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Winock |author-first=Michel |author-link=Michel Winock |title=Histoire de l'extrême droite en France |language=fr |trans-title=History of the extreme right in France |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marxist]] [[social class]] theory of [[proletarian internationalism]] asserts that members of the [[working class]] should act in solidarity with working people in other countries in pursuit of a common [[class interest]], rather than only focusing on their own countries. Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan: "[[Workers of the world, unite!]]", the last line of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers should act in solidarity with the international proletariat in order to further increase the power of the working class. Proletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war and international conflicts, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the [[bourgeoisie]] as the [[ruling class]]. According to Marxist theory, the [[antonym]] of proletarian internationalism is [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view [[nationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Szporluk |author-first=Roman |title=Communism and Nationalism |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[racism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-first1=John |author-last1=Solomos |author-first2=Les |author-last2=Back |title=Marxism, Racism, and Ethnicity |journal=American Behavioral Scientist |year=1995 |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=407–420 |doi=10.1177/0002764295038003004 |url=http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/pub/eres/SOC217_PIMENTEL/solomos.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.602.5843 |s2cid=39984567}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including antisemitism)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author-last=Lenin |author-first=Vladimir |author-link=Vladimir Lenin |title=Anti-Jewish Pogroms |work=Speeches On Gramophone Records |year=1919 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/mar/x10.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[religion]] as [[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]] tactics used by the ruling classes to prevent the [[working class]] from uniting against them in solidarity with one another. Left-wing movements have often taken up anti-imperialist positions. Anarchism has developed a critique of nationalism that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for [[centralisation]] (both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals) while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been extensively discussed by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in his book titled ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]] such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and ''The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism|first=Fredy|last=Perlman|location=Detroit|publisher=Black &amp; Red|year=1985|isbn=978-0317295580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of revolutions in [[German Revolution|Germany]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]] in the 1918–1920 years ended [[Bolshevik]] hopes for an imminent [[world revolution]] and led to the promotion of the doctrine of [[socialism in one country]] by [[Joseph Stalin]]. In the first edition of his book titled ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient. By the end of that year in the second edition of the book, he argued that the "[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country". In April 1925, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] elaborated on the issue in his brochure titled ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'', whose position was adopted as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article titled ''On the Issues of Leninism'' (К вопросам ленинизма) was published. This idea was opposed by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his supporters, who declared the need for an international "[[permanent revolution]]" and condemned Stalin for betraying the goals and ideals of the socialist revolution. Various [[Fourth International]]ist groups around the world who describe themselves as [[Trotskyist]] see themselves as standing in this tradition while [[Maoist China]] formally supported the theory of socialism in one country.

European social democrats strongly support [[Europeanism]] and [[Supranational union|supranational]] integration within the [[European Union]], although there is a minority of nationalists and [[Eurosceptics]] on the left. Several scholars have linked this form of left-wing nationalism to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries, often encouraged by [[neoliberal]] [[free trade]] agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any form of nationalism which emphasizes a leftist working-class populist agenda that seeks to overcome exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World [[Decolonization|anti-colonialist movements]] have adopted leftist and socialist ideas. [[Third-Worldism]] is a tendency within leftist thought that regards the division between [[First World]] and [[Second World]] [[developed country|developed countries]] and [[Third World]] [[developing countries]] as being of high political importance. This tendency supports [[decolonization]] and [[national liberation movements]] against imperialism by capitalists. Third-Worldism is closely connected with [[African socialism]], [[Latin American socialism]], [[Maoism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anti-imperialism.org/2012/11/02/what-is-maoism-third-worldism/ |title=What is Maioism-Third Worldism? |publisher=Anti-Imperialism.org |date=2 November 2011 |access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=November 2012}} [[pan-Africanism]] and [[pan-Arabism]]. Several left-wing groups in the developing world such as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in Mexico, the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Naxalites]] in India have argued that the First World and the Second World Left takes a racist and paternalistic attitude towards liberation movements in the Third World.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Religion ===
{{see also|Anarchism and religion|Buddhist socialism|Christian anarchism|Christian communism|Christian left|Christian socialism|Jewish left|Islamic socialism}}
The original [[French Left]] was firmly [[anti-clerical]], strongly opposing the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and supporting [[atheism]] and the [[separation of church and state]], ushering in a policy known as ''[[laïcité]]''.&lt;ref name="Knapp" /&gt; [[Karl Marx]] asserted that "[r]eligion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. 1976. ''Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right''. Collected Works, vol. 3. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In Soviet Russia, the [[Bolsheviks]] under [[Vladimir Lenin]] originally embraced an ideological principle which professed that all religion would eventually atrophy and resolved to eradicate organized [[Christianity]] and other religious institutions. In 1918, 10 [[Russian Orthodox]] hierarchs were summarily executed by a firing squad, and children were deprived of any religious education outside of the home.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh]], ''Sacred Causes'' HarperCollins (2006), p. 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today in the [[Western world]], those on the Left generally support [[secularization]] and the separation of church and state. However, religious beliefs have also been associated with many left-wing movements such as the [[progressive movement]], the [[Social Gospel]] movement, the [[civil rights movement]], the [[anti-war movement]], the anti-[[capital punishment]] movement and [[Liberation Theology]]. Early [[utopian socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and the [[Comte de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', major Christian writers defended ideas that socialists found agreeable and advocated for. Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]] and the rejection of capitalism and excessive [[wealth]] can be found in the [[Holy Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1533448,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112223942/http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1533448,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 January 2007 |title=Does God Want You To Be Rich? |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |author-first1=David van |author-last1=Biema |author-first2=Jeff |author-last2=Chu |date=10 September 2006 |access-date=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 19th century, the Social Gospel movement arose, particularly among [[Anglicans]], [[Lutherans]], [[Methodists]] and [[Baptists]] in North America and Britain which integrated [[Progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] through faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as Christian anarchism, Christian socialism and Christian communism. In the 20th century, the theology of liberation and [[Creation Spirituality]] was championed by several scholars and priests, such as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]]. Other left-wing religious movements include Buddhist socialism, Jewish socialism and Islamic socialism. There have been alliances between the left and anti-war [[Muslims]], such as the [[Respect Party]] and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] in Britain. In France, the left has been divided over moves to ban the [[hijab]] from schools, with some leftists supporting a ban based on the separation of church and state in accordance with the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'' and other leftists opposing the prohibition based on personal and religious freedom.

=== Social progressivism and counterculture ===
{{Globalize|section|United States|date=August 2021}}
{{see also|Counterculture|New Left|Socialism and LGBT rights|Socialist feminism}}
[[Social progress]]ivism is another common feature of modern leftism, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;James Brewer Stewrt, ''Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-55849-635-4}}. "[...] the progressive assumptions of 'uplift'." (page 40).&lt;/ref&gt; the enshrinement of [[women's suffrage]] in the [[United States Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/progress/suffrage/suffrage.html |title=For Teachers (Library of Congress) |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |access-date=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the protection of [[civil rights]], [[LGBTQ rights]], [[women's rights]] and [[multiculturalism]]. Progressives have both advocated for [[alcohol prohibition]] legislation and worked towards its repeal in the mid to late 1920s and early 1930s. Current positions associated with social progressivism in the [[Western world]] include strong opposition to the [[death penalty]], [[torture]], [[mass surveillance]], and the [[war on drugs]], and support for [[abortion]] rights, [[cognitive liberty]], LGBTQ rights including legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]], [[same-sex adoption]] of children, the [[Gender reassignment|right to change one's legal gender]], distribution of [[contraceptives]], and public funding of embryonic [[stem-cell research]]. The desire for an expansion of social and civil liberties often overlaps that of the [[libertarian]] movement. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives such as [[Lester Frank Ward]] and [[John Dewey]], who believed that a democratic society and system of government was practically impossible without a universal and comprehensive nationwide system of education.

Various counterculture and anti-war movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the New Left. Unlike the earlier leftist focus on [[labour union]] activism and a proletarian revolution, the New Left instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. The New Left in the United States is associated with the [[hippie movement]], mass protest movements on school campuses and a broadening of focus from protesting [[Social class|class]]-based oppression to include issues such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[sexual orientation]]. The British New Left was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of the [[Old Left]]. The New Left opposed prevailing authoritarian structures in society which it designated as "[[The Establishment]]" and became known as the "Anti-Establishment". The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers en masse, but instead concentrated on a social activist approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. This view has been criticized by several [[Marxists]], especially [[Trotskyists]], who characterized this approach as "substitutionism" which they described as a misguided and non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could "substitute" for and "replace" the revolutionary agency of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm |title=Tony Cliff: Trotsky on substitutionism (Autumn 1960) |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4662049/Against-Substitutionism |title=Against Substitutionism |publisher=Scribd.com |date=6 November 2006 |access-date=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early [[feminists]] and advocates of women's rights were considered a part of the Left by their contemporaries. Feminist pioneer [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was influenced by [[Thomas Paine]]. Many notable leftists have been strong supporters of gender equality such as [[Marxist]] philosophers and activists [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Clara Zetkin]] and [[Alexandra Kollontai]], [[anarchist]] philosophers and activists such as [[Virginia Bolten]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]] and [[democratic socialist]] philosophers and activists such as [[Helen Keller]] and [[Annie Besant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last1=Campling |author-first1=Jo |editor-last1=Bryson |editor-first1=Valerie |title=Feminist Political Theory: An Introduction |date=2003 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire [u.a.] |isbn=978-0-333-94568-1 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marxists such as Rosa Luxemburg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1912/05/12.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg: Women's Suffrage and Class Struggle (1912) |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clara Zetkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/1976/women/3-zetkin.html |title=Clara Zetkin: On a Bourgeois Feminist Petition |publisher=Marxists.org |date=28 December 2008 |access-date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/zetkin/1920/lenin/zetkin1.htm |title=Clara Zetkin: Lenin on the Women's Question – 1 |publisher=Marxists.org |date=29 February 2004 |access-date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alexandra Kollontai,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author-first=Alexandra |author-last=Kollontai |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1909/social-basis.htm |title=The Social Basis of the Woman Question by Alexandra Kollontai 1909 |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author-first=Alexandra |author-last=Kollontai |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1919/women-workers/ch01.htm |title=Women Workers Struggle For Their Rights by Alexandra Kollontai 1919 |publisher=Marxists.org |access-date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are supporters of radical social equality for women and have rejected and opposed [[liberal feminism]] because they considered it to be a capitalist [[bourgeois]] ideology. Marxists were responsible for organizing the first [[International Working Women's Day]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author-first=Alexandra |author-last=Kollontai |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1920/womens-day.htm |title=1920-Inter Women's Day |publisher=Marxists.org |date=26 August 1920 |access-date=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[women's liberation movement]] is closely connected to the New Left and other [[new social movements]] which openly challenged the orthodoxies of the Old Left. Socialist feminism as exemplified by the [[Freedom Socialist Party]] and [[Radical Women]] and [[Marxist feminism]], spearheaded by [[Selma James]], saw themselves as a part of the Left that challenges male-dominated and [[sexist]] structures within the Left. The connection between left-wing ideologies and the struggle for LGBTQ rights also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBTQ rights include [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Harry Hay]], [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Daniel Guérin]], among others. The New Left is also strongly supportive of LGBTQ rights and liberation, having been instrumental in the founding of the [[LGBTQ rights movement]] in the aftermath of the [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall Riots]] of 1969. Contemporary leftist activists and socialist countries such as Cuba are actively supportive of LGBTQ+ people and are involved in the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights and equality.

== History ==
{{see also|American Left|French Left|Left–right political spectrum|History of political thought}}

In politics, the term ''Left'' derives from the [[French Revolution]] as the political groups opposed to the royal veto privilege ([[The Mountain|Montagnard]] and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] deputies from the [[Estates-General of 1789|Third Estate]]) generally sat to the left of the presiding member's chair in parliament while the ones in favour of the royal veto privilege sat on its right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Winock]], La Droite, hier et aujourd’hui, tempus, 2012, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; That habit began in the French [[Estates General of 1789]]. Throughout the 19th century, the main line dividing [[Politics of France|Left and Right]] was between supporters of the French [[republic]] and those of the [[monarchy]]'s privileges.&lt;ref name="Knapp" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2016}} The [[June Days uprising]] during the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] was an attempt by the Left to re-assert itself after the [[1848 Revolution (France)|1848 Revolution]], but only a small portion of the population supported this.

In the mid-19th century, [[nationalism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]] and [[anti-clericalism]] became key features of the French Left. After [[Napoleon III]]'s [[French coup of 1851|1851 coup]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], [[Marxism]] began to rival radical republicanism and [[utopian socialism]] as a force within left-wing politics. The influential ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], published amidst the wave of [[revolutions of 1848]] across Europe, asserted that all of human history is defined by [[class struggle]]. They predicted that a [[proletarian]] revolution would eventually overthrow [[bourgeois]] [[capitalism]] and create a [[Stateless society|stateless]], [[Post-capitalism|moneyless]] and [[classless]] [[communist society]]. It was in this period that the word ''wing'' was appended to both Left and Right.&lt;ref name="oed.com"&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Home: Oxford English Dictionary |dictionary=Oxford English Dictionary |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107000?redirectedFrom=left-wing#eid |access-date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Workingmen's Association]] (1864–1876), sometimes called the First International, brought together delegates from many different countries, with many different views about how to reach a classless and stateless society. Following a split between supporters of Marx and [[Mikhail Bakunin]], anarchists formed the [[International Workers' Association – Asociación Internacional de los Trabajadores|International Workers' Association (IWA–AIT)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Marshall |author-first=Peter |title=Demanding the Impossible — A History of Anarchism |title-link=Demanding the Impossible |publisher=[[Fontana Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-00-686245-1 |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/demandingimpossi00mars_782/page/n545 9]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second International]] (1888–1916) became divided over the issue of [[World War I]]. Those who opposed the war, among them [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], saw themselves as further to the left.

In the United States, leftists such as [[social liberals]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]] and [[trade unionists]] were influenced by the works of [[Thomas Paine]], who introduced the concept of [[asset-based egalitarianism]] which theorises that [[social equality]] is possible by a redistribution of resources. After the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]], the phrase "the Left" was used to describe those who supported trade unions, the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[anti-war movement]].&lt;ref name="Van Gosse 2005"&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Van Gosse |title=The Movements of the New Left, 1950–1975: A Brief History with Documents |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4039-6804-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Reuss |author-first=JoAnne C. |title=American Folk Music and Left-Wing Politics |publisher=[[The Scarecrow Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8108-3684-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, ''left-wing'' and ''right-wing'' have often been used as synonyms for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties, or as synonyms for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=3 March 2009 |title=Steel to gop fight for Coleman |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://thepage.time.com/2009/03/03/steele-to-gop-fight-for-coleman/?xid=rss-page |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722030847/http://thepage.time.com/2009/03/03/steele-to-gop-fight-for-coleman/?xid=rss-page |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 July 2011 |access-date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=7 May 2009 |title=Is it Spain's place to investigate Gitmo?|url=http://www.theweek.com/article/index/96256/Is_it_Spains_place_to_investigate_Gitmo |magazine=The Week |access-date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reported in ''Mother Jones'', 29 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author-last=Gellene |author-first=Denise |date=10 September 2007 |title=Study finds left-wing brain, right-wing brain |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-politics10sep10,0,5982337.story |access-date=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from [[centre-left]] to [[far-left]] or [[ultra-left]]. The term ''centre-left'' describes a position within the political mainstream that accepts capitalism and a market economy. The terms ''far-left'' and ''ultra-left'' are used for positions that are more [[Radical politics|radical]], more strongly rejecting [[capitalism]] and mainstream [[representative democracy]], instead advocating for a socialist society based on [[economic democracy]] and [[direct democracy]], representing economic, political and social democracy. The centre-left includes [[social democrats]], [[social liberals]], [[Progressivism|progressives]] and [[Green politics|greens]]. Centre-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a [[mixed economy]] with an empowered [[public sector]] and a thriving [[private sector]]. Centre-left policies tend to favour limited [[state intervention]] in matters pertaining to the [[public interest]].

In several countries, the terms ''far-left'' and ''radical left'' have been associated with many varieties of [[anarchism]], [[autonomism]] and [[communism]]. They have been used to describe groups that advocate [[anti-capitalism]] and [[eco-terrorism]]. In France, a distinction is made between the centre-left and the left represented by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and the [[French Communist Party]] and the far-left as represented by [[anarcho-communists]], [[Maoists]] and [[Trotskyists]].&lt;ref&gt;Cosseron, Serge (ed.). ''Le dictionnaire de l'extrême gauche''. Paris: [[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]], 2007. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] defines "left-wing extremism" as groups that "seek to bring about change through violent revolution, rather than through established political processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hsa-leftwing-extremists-increase-in-cyber-attacks-dated-26-january-2009.pdf |title=Leftwing Extremists Increase in Cyber Attacks |access-date=3 June 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419052505/http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hsa-leftwing-extremists-increase-in-cyber-attacks-dated-26-january-2009.pdf |archive-date=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to [[far-right politics]], [[Extremism|extremist]] far-left politics have motivated [[political violence]], [[radicalization]], [[genocide]], [[terrorism]], sabotage and damage to property, the formation of [[militant]] organizations, [[political repression]], [[conspiracism]], [[xenophobia]], and [[nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Rossi 2021"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rossi |first=Federica |date=April 2021 |editor-last=Treiber |editor-first=Kyle |title=The failed amnesty of the 'years of lead' in Italy: Continuity and transformations between (de)politicization and punitiveness |journal=[[European Journal of Criminology]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] and [[London]] |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] on behalf of the [[European Society of Criminology]] |doi=10.1177/14773708211008441 |issn=1741-2609 |quote=The [[Years of Lead (Italy)|1970s in Italy]] were characterized by the persistence and prolongation of political and social unrest that many Western countries experienced during the late 1960s.

The increasing militarization and the use of political violence, from [[sabotage]] and damage to property, to [[kidnapping]]s and [[Targeted killing|targeted assassinations]], were justified by left-wing groups both as necessary means to achieve a revolutionary project and as defences against the threat of a neo-fascist coup. |doi-access=free |s2cid=234835036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ojeili-Taylor 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=el-Ojeili |first1=Chamsy |last2=Taylor |first2=Dylan |date=September 2018 |editor1-last=Cheng |editor1-first=Enfu |editor2-last=Schweickart |editor2-first=David |editor3-last=Andreani |editor3-first=Tony |title=The Revaluation of All Values: Extremism, The Ultra-Left, and Revolutionary Anthropology |journal=International Critical Thought |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] on behalf of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=410–425 |doi=10.1080/21598282.2018.1506262 |issn=2159-8282 |eissn=2159-8312 |s2cid=158719628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McClosky |first1=Herbert |last2=Chong |first2=Dennis |date=July 1985 |title=Similarities and Differences Between Left-Wing and Right-Wing Radicals |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0007123400004221/type/journal_article |journal=British Journal of Political Science |language=en |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=329–363 |doi=10.1017/S0007123400004221 |issn=0007-1234 |quote=Once one adjusts for superficial differences, Shils contended, communists and other radicals of the far left resemble right-wing radicals in zealotry, susceptibility to Manichean interpretations of human events, implacable hatred of opponents, intolerance toward dissenters and deviants, and an inclination to view public affairs as the outcome of conspiracies and secret plots. |s2cid=154330828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kopyciok |first1=Svenja |last2=Silver |first2=Hilary |date=2021-06-10 |title=Left-Wing Xenophobia in Europe |journal=Frontiers in Sociology |volume=6 |pages=666717 |doi=10.3389/fsoc.2021.666717 |issn=2297-7775 |pmc=8222516 |pmid=34179182 |quote=We find that a surprisingly large share of those who identify as far left do express extremely xenophobic attitudes, and we profile them in contrast to far right xenophobes. |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Cheng |last2=Lee |first2=Ji-Yong |date=2007-12-01 |title=Making sense of North Korea: "National Stalinism" in comparative-historical perspective |url=https://online.ucpress.edu/cpcs/article/40/4/459/77/Making-sense-of-North-Korea-National-Stalinism-in |journal=Communist and Post-Communist Studies |language=en |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=459–475 |doi=10.1016/j.postcomstud.2007.10.003 |issn=0967-067X |quote=the role of strong anti-liberal ideology that combined both far left and far right nationalist elements was highly significant in sustaining the regime and therefore should not be underestimated...the DPRK regime was able to hold on to power by using imagined and real external threats, such as the nuclear and missile crises, to justify continuing domestic repression and reinforce its nationalist claims}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Pruitt |first=Sarah |title=How Are Socialism and Communism Different? |url=https://www.history.com/news/socialism-communism-differences |access-date=2022-10-06 |website=HISTORY |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, the term ''[[Chinese New Left]]'' denotes those who oppose the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] enacted by [[Deng Xiaoping]] in the 1980s and 1990s, favour instead the restoration of Maoist policies and the immediate transition to a socialist economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/74029202-a389-11da-83cc-0000779e2340,s01=1.html |title=China launches 'New Deal' for farmers |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western world]], the term ''New Left'' is used for social and cultural politics.

In the United Kingdom during the 1980s, the term ''[[hard left]]'' was applied to supporters of [[Tony Benn]] such as the [[Campaign Group]] and those involved in the ''[[Labour Briefing|London Labour Briefing]]'' newspaper as well as Trotskyist groups such as [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] and the [[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1054337.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Benn's golden anniversary |date=4 December 2000 |access-date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, the term ''[[soft left]]'' was applied to supporters of the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] who were perceived to be more moderate and closer to the centre, accepting [[Keynesianism]]. Under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]], the Labour Party adopted the [[Third Way]] and rebranded itself as [[New Labour]] in order to promote the notion that it was less left-wing than it had been in the past to accommodate the [[neoliberal]] trend arising since the 1970s with the [[displacement of Keynesianism]] and [[post-war social democracy]]. One of the first actions of [[Ed Miliband]], the Labour Party leader who succeeded Blair and Brown, was the rejection of the New Labour label and a promise to abandon the Third Way and turn back to the left. However, Labour's voting record in the [[House of Commons]] from 2010 to 2015 indicated that the Labour Party under Miliband had maintained the same distance from the left as it did under Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26743802 |work=[[BBC News]] |title=MPs approve annual welfare cap in Commons vote |date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author-first=John |author-last=Kampfner |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/05/labour-back-on-the-right |title=Labour's return to the right |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=5 November 2012 |access-date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the election of [[Jeremy Corbyn]] as the Labour Party leader was viewed by scholars and political commentators as Labour turning back toward its more classical socialist roots, rejecting neoliberalism and the Third Way whilst supporting a [[democratic socialist]] society and an end to [[austerity]] measures.
