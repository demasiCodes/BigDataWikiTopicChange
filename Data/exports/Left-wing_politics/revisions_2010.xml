{{Party politics}}
In [[politics]], '''''Left''''', '''''left-wing''''' and '''''leftist''''' are generally used to describe support for [[social change]] to create a more [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society.&lt;ref&gt;T. Alexander Smith, Raymond Tatalovich. Cultures at war: moral conflicts in western democracies. Toronto, Canada: Broadview Press, Ltd, 2003. Pp 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Left and right: the significance of a political distinction, Norberto Bobbio and Allan Cameron, pg. 37, University of Chicago Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''Left'' and [[Right-wing politics|''Right'']] were coined during the [[French Revolution]], referring to the seating arrangement in parliament; those who sat on the left generally supported the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical changes]] of the revolution, including the creation of a [[republic]] and [[secularization]].&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt;

Use of the term Left became more prominent after the restoration of the French monarchy in [[1815]] when it was applied to the "Independents".&lt;ref&gt;''Realms of memory: conflicts and divisions'' (1996), ed. Pierre Nora, "Right and Left" by Marcel Gauchet, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The term was then applied to a number of revolutionary movements in Europe, especially [[socialism]], [[anarchism]]&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Frank H. (1994). The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881–1908). Transaction Publishers. p. xi. "Usually considered to be an extreme left-wing ideology, anarchism has always included a significant strain of radical individualism...&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[communism]]. The term is also used to describe [[social democracy]] and [[social liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Van Gosse 2005"&gt;Van Gosse, ''The Movements of the New Left, 1950 - 1975: A Brief History with Documents'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2005, ISBN 9781403968043&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sarnold"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=N.

According to Barry Clark,&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political economy: A comparative approach''. Westport, CT: Praeger Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Leftists... claim that human development flourishes when individuals engage in cooperative, mutually respectful relations that can thrive only when excessive differences in status, power, and wealth are eliminated. According to leftists, a society without substantial equality will distort the development of not only deprived persons, but also those whose privileges undermine their motivation and sense of social responsibility. This suppression of human development, together with the resentment and conflict engendered by sharp class distinctions, will ultimately reduce the efficiency of the economy.}}

==History of the term==
{{See also|Left–right politics|History of the Left in France}}
In politics the term ''left wing'' derives from the [[French Revolution]], as radical [[The Mountain|Montagnard]] and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] deputies from the [[Third Estate]] generally sat to the left of the president's chair, a habit which began in the [[French States-General|Estates General]] of 1789. Throughout the [[France in the 19th century|19th century]], the main line dividing [[Politics of France|Left and Right in France]] was between supporters of the [[Republic]] and those of the [[Monarchy]].&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=67ttjXHhT3wC&amp;dq=the+government+and+politics+of+france&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tUFySqX7CYWIMqOg3LEM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge | isbn=9780415357326}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[June Days Uprising]] during the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] was an attempt by the left to assert itself after the [[1848 Revolution (France)|1848 Revolution]], but few of the (still predominantly rural) population supported them.

After [[Napoleon III]]'s [[French coup of 1851|1851 coup]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], [[Marxism]] began to rival Radical Republicanism and the "[[Utopian socialism]]" of [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Charles Fourier]]. Particularly influential in this regard was the publication of the [[Communist Manifesto]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1848, which asserted that the history of all hitherto existing human society is the history of class struggle. They predicted that a [[proletarian]] revolution would eventually overthrow [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society, and by abolishing private property create a [[classless]], [[Stateless communism|stateless]], and post-monetary society.

In the mid 19th century, nationalism, socialism, agitation in favour of greater democracy, and [[anti-clericalism]] (opposition to the role of the church in controlling French social and cultural life) all became features of the French Left. In the United States many leftists, [[social liberal]]s, [[progressivism|progressive]]s and trade unionists were influenced by the works of [[Thomas Paine]], who introduced the concept of [[asset-based egalitarianism]], which theorises that [[social equality]] is possible by a redistribution of resources, usually in the form of a [[Financial capital|capital]] grant provided at the [[age of majority]].

The [[International Workingmen's Association]] (1864–76), sometimes called the First International, brought together delegates, from many different countries, with many different views about how to reach a classless and stateless society. Following a split with supporters of Marx and [[Mikhail Bakunin]] at the First International, the anarchists formed the [[International Workers' Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Peter. "Demanding the Impossible&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;— A History of Anarchism" p. 9. Fontana Press, London, 1993 ISBN 978-0-00-686245-1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second International]] (1888–1916) divided over the issue of the [[First World War]]. Those who opposed the war, such as [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], saw themselves as further to the left (see [[Zimmerwald Left]]).

In the United States after [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the phrase "the Left" was used to describe those who supported [[labor unions]], the [[civil rights movement]]s, and [[anti-war]] demonstrations.&lt;ref name="Van Gosse 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JoAnne C. Reuss, ''American Folk Music and Left-Wing Politics'', The Scarecrow Press, 2000, ISBN 9780810836846&lt;/ref&gt;  In more recent times, in the United States, ''left-wing'' and ''right-wing'' have often been used as synonyms for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], or as synonyms for ''[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]'' and ''[[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]]'' in the specific meaning of those terms in American English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thepage.time.com/2009/03/03/steele-to-gop-fight-for-coleman/?xid=rss-page|title=Steel to gop fight for Coleman | work=Time | date=2009-03-03 | accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theweek.com/article/index/96256/Is_it_Spains_place_to_investigate_Gitmo ABC news, reported in The Week, May 15, 2009, page 13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;reported in Mother Jones, April 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-politics10sep10,0,5982337.story | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Study finds left-wing brain, right-wing brain | date=2007-09-10 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the Democratic Party is generally perceived to be a center-left coalition.

Karl Marx described the working class as the revolutionary class. What became known as the [[New Left]] however sought to de-emphasize the economic determinism which Marx advocated in ''[[Das Kapital]]'', and focus instead upon what they perceived to be the more [[humanism|humanist]] Marx of the [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]. The New Left came to prominence in the West after the student-and-worker revolts of 1968.

==Varieties==
The spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from [[centre-left]] to [[far left]] (or [[Ultra leftism|ultra-left]]). The term ''centre left'' describes a position close to the political mainstream. The terms ''far left'' and ''ultra-left'' refer to positions that are more [[Political radicalism|radical]]. The centre-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrat]]s, [[Progressivism|progressive]]s and also some [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]]s and [[Green politics|greens]] (in particular the [[Eco-socialism|eco-socialist]]s). Centre-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a [[mixed economy]] with a significant [[public sector]] and a thriving [[private sector]]. Centre-left policies tend to favour limited [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]] in the [[Economics|economy]] in matters pertaining to the [[public interest]]. The centre-left also often favours moderate [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] policies and generally, though not universally, supports individual freedom on moral issues.

In several countries, the terms ''far left'' and ''radical left'' have been associated with [[communism]], [[Maoism]], [[Autonomism]] and many forms of [[anarchism]].  They have been used to describe groups that advocate [[anti-capitalist]], [[identity politics]] or [[eco-terrorism]]. In France, a distinction is made between the ''left'' ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]) and the ''far left'' ([[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], [[Maoism|Maoists]] and [[Anarchism|Anarchists]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cosseron, Serge (ed.). ''Le dictionnaire de l'extrême gauche''. Paris: [[Larousse]], 2007. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Department of Homeland Security]] defines left-wing extremism as groups who want "to bring about change through violent revolution rather than through established political processes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hsa-leftwing-extremists-increase-in-cyber-attacks-dated-26-january-2009.pdf Left-wing extremists likely to increase use of cyber attacks over the next coming decade]&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, the term ''[[Chinese New Left]]'' denotes those who oppose the current [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] and favour the restoration of more socialist policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/74029202-a389-11da-83cc-0000779e2340,s01=1.html|title=China launches ‘New Deal’ for farmers|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=2006-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western world]], the term ''[[New Left]]'' refers to [[Culture|cultural]] politics. In the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1980s, the term ''[[hard left]]'' was applied to supporters of [[Tony Benn]], such as the [[Campaign Group]] and [[Labour Briefing]], as well as Trotskyist groups such as the [[Militant Tendency]] and [[Socialist Organiser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1054337.stm | work=BBC News | title=Benn's golden anniversary | date=2000-12-04 | accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, the term ''[[soft left]]'' was applied to supporters of the [[British Labour Party]] who were perceived to be more moderate. Under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] the British Labour Party re-branded itself as [[New Labour]] in order to promote the notion that it was less left-wing than it had been in the past. One of the first actions however of the Labour Party leader who succeeded them, [[Ed Miliband]], was the rejection of the "New Labour" label.

==Positions==
===Economics===
Leftist economic beliefs range from [[Keynesian]] economics and the [[welfare state]] through [[industrial democracy]] and the [[social market]] to [[nationalization]] of the economy and [[Planned economy|central planning]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Glyn, ''Social Democracy in Neoliberal Times: The Left and Economic Policy since 1980'', Oxford University Press, 2001, ISBN 978-0199241385.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[industrial revolution]], left-wingers supported [[trade union]]s. In the early twentieth century, the Left were associated with policies advocating extensive government intervention in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Eric D. Beinhocker. ''The origin of wealth''. [[Harvard Business Press]]. 2006. ISBN 9781578517770 p. 416 [http://www.google.com/books?id=eUoolrxSFy0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Beinhocker#PPA416,M1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Leftists continue to criticize what they perceive as the exploitative nature of [[globalization]], such as [[sweatshops]], the ''[[race to the bottom]]'' and unjust lay-offs. In the last quarter of the Twentieth Century the belief that government (ruling in accordance with the interests of the people) ought to directly involve itself in the day to day workings of an economy declined in popularity amongst the [[center left]], especially [[social-democrats]] who became influenced by [[Third Way (centrism)|'third way']] ideology. 

Other leftists believe in [[Marxian economics]], which are based on the economic theories of [[Karl Marx]]. Some distinguish Marx's economic theories from his political philosophy, arguing that Marx's approach to understanding the economy is independent of his advocacy of revolutionary [[socialism]] or his belief in the inevitability of [[proletariat|proletarian]] revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxian economics does not exclusively rely upon Marx, it draws from a range of Marxist and non-Marxist sources. The [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] or [[workers' state]] are terms used by Marxists to describe what they see as a temporary state between the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Communism|communist]] society. Marx defined the proletariat as salaried workers, in contrast to the [[lumpen proletariat]], who he defined as outcasts of society, such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049344/Lumpenproletariat Lumpen proletariat -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The political relevance of farmers has divided the left. In ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx scarcely mentioned the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939251-2,00.html Marxism Fails on the Farm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mao Zedong]] believed that it would be rural peasants not urban workers who would bring about proletariat revolution.

[[Left-libertarian]]s, [[Libertarian socialist]]s and left-wing anarchists believe in a decentralized economy run by [[trade union]]s, [[workers' council]]s, [[cooperative]]s, [[Municipality|municipalities]] and [[Commune (socialism)|communes]], and oppose both government and [[Private property|private]] control of the economy, preferring ''local control'', in which a nation of decentralized regions are united in a confederation.

===Nationalism===
{{See also|Left-wing nationalism}}
The question of [[nationality]] and [[nationalism]] has been a central feature of political debates on the Left.  During the French Revolution, nationalism was a policy of the Republican Left.&lt;ref&gt;William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'', Oxford University Press, 2003, ISBN 9780199252985, "An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...", "The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world."&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican Left advocated [[civic nationalism]],&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; and argued that the nation is a "daily plebiscite" formed by the subjective "will to live together."  Related to "revanchism", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism was sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]].  In the 1880s, there was a debate between those, such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] (Radical), [[Jean Jaurès]] (Socialist) and [[Maurice Barrès]] (nationalist), who argued that colonialism diverted France from the "blue line of the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine), and the "[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]", such as Jules Ferry (moderate republican), Léon Gambetta (republican) and [[Eugène Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group.  After the [[Dreyfus Affair]] however nationalism became increasingly associated with the far right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extrême droite en France'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[social class]] theory of [[proletarian internationalism]] asserts that members of the [[working class]] should act in solidarity with working people in other countries in pursuit of a common [[class interest]], rather than focusing on their own countries. Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan, "[[Workers of all countries, unite!]]", the last line of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers ought to act in solidarity to further increase the power of the working class.

Proletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the [[ruling class]]. According to Marxist theory, the [[antonym]] of proletarian internationalism is [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view [[nationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Szporluk, Roman. Communism and Nationalism. 2nd. Oxford University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; [[racism]]&lt;ref&gt;Marxism, Racism, and Ethnicity SOLOMOS and BACK American Behavioral Scientist.1995; 38: 407-420&lt;/ref&gt; (including [[anti-Semitism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir |title=Anti-Jewish Pogroms |work=Speeches On Gramophone Records |publisher= |year=1919 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/mar/x10.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[religion]], as [[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]] strategies used by the ruling classes to prevent the [[working class]] from uniting against them.  Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] positions. Anarchism has developed a [[Anarchism and nationalism|critique of nationalism]] that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]], such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and "The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;''The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism'' by Fredy Perlman.Detroit, Black &amp; Red Publishers, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of revolutions in [[German Revolution|Germany]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]] ended [[Bolshevik]] hopes for an imminent [[world revolution]] and led to promotion of "[[Socialism in One Country]]" by [[Joseph Stalin]]. In the first edition of the book ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient. But by the end of that year, in the second edition of the book, he argued that the "[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country". In April 1925 [[Nikolai Bukharin]] elaborated the issue in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'' The position was adopted as State policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism'' (К вопросам ленинизма). This idea was opposed by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers who declared the need for an international "[[permanent revolution]]". Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition, while [[Maoist China]] supported Socialism in One Country.

Some link [[left-wing nationalism]] to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by [[free-trade]] agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards [[Supranational union|supranational organizations]] such as the [[European Union]]. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many [[Third World]] anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.

===Social progressivism and counterculture===
[[Social progressivism]] is another common feature of the modern Left, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the [[abolition of slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;James Brewer Stewrt, ''Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War'', University of Massachusetts Press, 2008, ISBN 9781558496354.  "...the progressive assumptions of 'uplift'." (page 40)&lt;/ref&gt; [[women's suffrage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/progress/suffrage/suffrage.html |title=For Teachers (Library of Congress) |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[civil rights]], and [[multiculturalism]]. Progressives have both advocated [[prohibition]] legislation and worked towards its repeal.  Current positions associated with social progressivism in [[Western world|the West]] include opposition to the death penalty, and support for legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]], distribution of [[contraceptives]], public funding of embryonic [[stem-cell research]], and the right of women to choose [[abortion]].  Public education is a subject of great interest to social progressives, who support comprehensive [[sex education]], and making condoms available to high school students.

Various [[counterculture]] movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the "[[New Left]]". Unlike the earlier leftist focus on [[labour movement|union]] activism, the "New Left" instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. U.S. "New Left" is associated with the [[Hippie|Hippie movement]], college campus mass protest movements and a broadening of focus from protesting [[social class|class]]-based oppression to include issues such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and [[sexual orientation]]. The British "New Left" was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of "[[Old Left]]".

The New Left opposed prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed "The Establishment", and became known as "anti-Establishment."  The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers, but rather concentrated on a [[social activist]] approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. This view has been criticised by some [[Marxists]] (especially [[Trotskyists]]) who characterized this approach as 'substitutionism'- or what they saw as the misguided and apparently non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could 'substitute' for the revolutionary agency of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm |title=Tony Cliff: Trotsky on substitutionism (Autumn 1960) |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/4662049/Against-Substitutionism |title=Against Substitutionism |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2006-11-06 |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early [[Feminism|feminists]] and advocates of [[women's rights]] were considered left-wing by their contemporaries.  Feminist pioneer [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was influenced by the radical thinker [[Thomas Paine]]. Many notable leftists have been strong supporters of sexual equality, such as: the Marxists [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Clara Zetkin]] and [[Alexandra Kollontai]], the anarchist [[Emma Goldman]], and the socialists [[Helen Keller]] and [[Annie Besant]]&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Bryson, ''Feminist Political Theory, An Introduction'',  Palgrave Macmillan, 2003, ISBN: 978-0333945681.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Marxists such as Clara Zetkin&lt;ref&gt;Zetkin, Clara [http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/1976/women/3-zetkin.html On a Bourgeois Feminist Petition] 1895&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zetkin, Clara [http://www.marxists.org/archive/zetkin/1920/lenin/zetkin1.htm Lenin on the Women’s Question]&lt;/ref&gt; and Alexandra Kollontai &lt;ref&gt;Kollontai, Alexandra [http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1909/social-basis.htm The Social Basis of the Woman Question] 1909&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kollontai, Alexandra [http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1919/women-workers/ch01.htm Women Workers Struggle For Their Rights] 1919&lt;/ref&gt; however, though supporters of radical social equality for women, opposed feminism on the grounds that it was a bourgeois ideology. Marxists were responsible for organizing the first [[International Women's Day]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexandra Kollontai |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1920/womens-day.htm |title=1920-Inter Women's Day |publisher=Marxists.org |date=1920-08-26 |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times the [[women's liberation movement]] is closely connected to the New Left and other [[new social movements]] that challenged the orthodoxies of the Old Left. [[Socialist feminism]] (e.g.[[Freedom Socialist Party]], [[Radical Women]]) and [[Marxist feminism]] (e.g. [[Selma James]]) saw themselves as a part of the left that challenged what they perceive to be male-dominated and [[sexist]] structures within the left. [[Liberal feminism]] is closely connected with [[Social liberalism|left-liberalism]], and the left-wing of mainstream American politics. (e.g. the [[National Organization for Women]]).

===Religion===
The original French left-wing was [[anti-clerical]], opposing the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and supporting the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; [[Karl Marx]] asserted that "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. 1976. ''Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right''. Collected Works, v. 3. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In Soviet Russia the [[Bolshevik]]s originally embraced "an ideological creed which professed that all religion would atrophy" and "resolved to eradicate [[Christianity]] as such." In 1918 "ten [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] hierarchs were summarily shot" and "children were deprived of any religious education outside the home."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh]] ''Sacred Causes'' HarperCollins (2006) p41-43&lt;/ref&gt; Later communist governments, such as the [[People's Republic of China]], have also been hostile to religion.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Religious beliefs however have also been associated with some left-wing movements, such as the American [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement and the anti-[[capital punishment]] movement. Early [[socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]], and the [[Duc de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia]]'' major Christian writers defended ideas that socialists found agreeable.  There is a strong thread of [[egalitarianism]] in the [[New Testament]]. Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]], and the rejection of excessive [[wealth]] can be found in the [[Bible]]. In the late 19th century, the [[Social Gospel]] movement arose (particularly among some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptists]] in [[North America]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]],) which attempted to integrate [[progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] in faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as [[Christian Socialism]]. In the 20th century, [[liberation theology|the theology of liberation]] and [[Creation Spirituality]] was championed by such writers as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].

There are also left-wing Islamic movements such as [[Islamic socialism]]. There have been alliances between the Left and anti-war [[Muslim]]s, such as the [[Respect Party]] and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] in Britain. In France, the Left has been divided over moves to ban the [[hijab]] from schools, with some supporting a ban based on separation of church and state, and others opposing the ban based on personal freedom.

===The environment===
{{Main|Green politics}}

Both Karl Marx and the early socialist [[William Morris]] arguably had a deep concern for environmental matters.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, J. B., Marx's Ecology, 2000 (New York: Monthly Review Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burkett, P., Marx and Nature, 1999 (New York: St. Martin's Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leonora.fortunecity.co.uk/WilliamMorris.html |title=William Morris: The First Green Socialist" |publisher=Leonora.fortunecity.co.uk |date=2007-12-14 |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, J.W. (2003) ‘Capitalism as World-ecology: Braudel and Marx on Environmental History’, Organization &amp; Environment 16(4): 431–58.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marx, “Even an entire society, a nation, or all simultaneously existing societies taken together . . . are not owners of the earth. They are simply its possessors, its beneficiaries, and have to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding generations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=13676 |title=Marx and ecology&amp;#124; |publisher=Socialist Worker |date=2007-12-08 |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx's Ecology, 2000 (New York: Monthly Review Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Russian Revolution, environmental scientists such as revolutionary [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]] and the Proletkul't  organisation made efforts to incorporate environmentalism into Bolshevism, and "integrate production with natural laws and limits" in the first decade of [[Soviet]] rule, before [[Joseph Stalin]] attacked ecologists and the science of ecology, purged environmentalists and promoted the pseudo-science of [[Trofim Lysenko]].&lt;ref&gt;Gare, A., Soviet Environmentalism: The Path Not Taken, in Benton, E. (ed.) The Greening of Marxism, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovel, J., The Enemy of Nature, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arran Gare, ‘The Environmental Record of the Soviet Union’, Capitalism Nature Socialism, 13 (2002), 52 - 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, environmentalism became an increasing concern of the left, with social movements and some unions campaigning over environmental issues. For example, the left-wing [[Builders Labourers Federation]] in [[Australia]], led by the communist Jack Mundy, united with environmentalists to place [[Green Bans]] on environmentally destructive development projects.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Burgman, Green Bans, Red Union: Environmental Activism and the New South Wales Builders Labourers' Federation (UNSW Press, Sydney,1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Some segments of the socialist and Marxist left consciously merged environmentalism and anti-capitalism into an [[eco-socialist]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Wall, D., Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Commoner articulated a left-wing response to [[The Limits to Growth]] model that predicted catastrophic resource depletion and spurred environmentalism, postulating that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for environmental degradation, as opposed to population pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Commoner, B., The Closing Circle, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental degradation can be seen as a class or equity issue, as environmental destruction disproportionately affects poorer communities and countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/articles/file/The+Argentimes.pdf Blacksmithinstitute.org]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several left wing or socialist groupings have an overt environmental concern, whereas several green parties contain a strong socialist presence. For example, The Green Party of England and Wales features an eco-socialist group, Green Left, that was founded in June 2005 and whose members hold a number of influential positions within the party, including both the former Principal Speakers Siân Berry and Dr. Derek Wall, himself an eco-socialist and marxist academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gptu.net/gleft/greenleft.shtml |title=Green Left homepage |publisher=Gptu.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, some 'Green-Left' political parties combine traditional social-democratic values such as a desire for greater economic equality and workers rights with demands for environmental protection, such as the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left|Nordic Green Left]].

Well-known socialist [[Bolivian President]] [[Evo Morales]] has traced [[environmental degradation]] to [[consumerism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-september-25-2007/president-evo-morales&lt;/ref&gt;  He has said "The Earth does not have enough for the North to live better and better, but it does have enough for all of us to live well."  [[James Hansen]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Raj Patel]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[The Yes Men]], and [[Dennis Kucinich]] have had similar views.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenation.com/article/how-solve-climate-problem&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=NrLv4surz7UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=profit+over+people&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Jt-EIM9KkL&amp;sig=SJyrY9YdYjOPM_ssb7Iat4B3hTc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a_esTPOIDMifOoyO5PUG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://rajpatel.org/2010/08/06/we-have-yet-to-see-the-biggest-costs-of-the-bp-spill/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FtrSql3vss&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://scrutinyhooligans.us/2010/07/26/the-yes-men-fix-the-world/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4ph9rSRY3Q&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st Century, questions about the environment have become increasingly politicized, with the Left generally accepting the findings of environmental scientists about [[global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/blogs/barone/2009/03/16/the-left-pushes-secular-religions-global-warming-embryonic-stem-cell-research.html |title=The Left Pushes Secular Religions: Global Warming, Embryonic Stem Cell Research - Michael Barone |publisher=usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page8.htm |title=World Scientists' Warning To Humanity |publisher=Dieoff.org |date=1992-11-18 |accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many on the Right disputing or rejecting those findings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/13/science/earth/13book.html, "Challenges to both Left and Right on Global Warming", by Andrew C. Revkin, Nov. 13, 2007, "The right says global warming is somewhere between a hoax and a minor irritant, and argues that liberals’ thirst for top-down regulations will drive American wealth to developing countries and turn off the fossil-fuelled engine powering the economy."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/29/weather-channel-founder-blasts-gore-global-warming-campaign/ |title=Weather Channel Founder Blasts Gore Over Global Warming Campaign |publisher=FOXNews.com |date= 2009-01-29|accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Mooney, ''The Republican War on Science'', "the modern Right has adopted a style of politics that puts its adherents in increasingly stark conflict with both scientific information and dispassionate, expert analysis in general.", p. 4-5, "...the Right's selective attack on Mann's work ultimately presents a huge diversion for policymakers trying to decide what to do about global warming." p. 89, Basic Books, 2006, ISBN 9780465046768&lt;/ref&gt; The left is however divided over how to effectively and equitably reduce [[carbon emissions]]- the center-left often advocates a reliance on market measures such as [[emissions trading]] or a [[carbon tax]], whilst those further to the left tend to support direct government regulation and intervention either alongside or instead of market mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/41735&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solidarity.net.au/22/carbon-tax-not-the-solution-we-need-on-climate/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/43410&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-globalization and Third-worldism===
The [[Global Justice Movement]], also known as the [[anti-globalisation]] or [[alter-globalization]] movement, protests against global trade agreements and the negative consequences they perceive them to have for the poor and the environment. This movement is generally characterised as left-wing, although some on the right, [[Pat Buchanan]] for example, oppose globalization on nationalistic grounds.  The Global Justice Movement does not oppose globalisation per se, on the contrary, it supports some forms of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]. Its main themes are the reforms (or abolition) of international institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the creation of an international social and environmental justice movement. It rejects the leadership of any [[political party]], defining itself as a "movement of movements."

[[Third-worldism]] regards the inequality between developed, or [[First World]] countries, and the developing, or [[Third World]] countries as of key political importance.  It supports [[national liberation movements]] against what it takes to be [[imperialism]] by capitalist nations. Key figures associated with Third-worldism include [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], [[Andre Gunder Frank]], [[Samir Amin]] and [[Simon Malley]]. Among the [[New Left]] groups associated with Third Worldism were [[Monthly Review]] and the [[New Communist Movement]].

Third worldism is closely connected with [[Pan-Africanism]], [[Pan-Arabism]], [[Maoism]], [[African socialism]] and [[Socialism|Latin American socialist trends]]. The [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and the [[Sandinistas]] are or have been particular ''causes célèbres''. Some left-wing groups in the developing world, such as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in Mexico, the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]], and the [[Naxalites]] in India, argue that the First-World left takes a racist and paternalistic attitude towards liberation movements in the Third-World. There is particular criticism of the role played by [[NGOs]] and the assumption by the Western [[Anti-globalization movement]] that they should seek to influence the politics of the Third World.

===Post-modernism===
Left-wing [[post-modernism]] opposes attempts to supply universal explanatory theories, including Marxism, deriding them as [[Meta-narrative|grand narratives]]. It views culture as a battleground, and via [[deconstruction]] seeks to undermine all pretensions to knowledge. Left-wing critics of post-modernism assert that [[cultural studies]] inflates the importance of culture by denying the existence of an independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=59issue=105 Post-modernism, commodity fetishism and hegemony], Néstor Kohan, [[International Socialism (journal)|International Socialism]], Issue 105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/chomsky-on-postmodernism.html Chomsky on Postmodernism], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Z Communications|Z-Magazine's]] Left On-Line Bulletin Board.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[physicist]] [[Alan Sokal]] wrote [[Sokal Affair|a nonsensical article]] entitled "Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/~as2/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity], [[Alan Sokal]], first published in; [[Social Text]], issue 46/47, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The journal ''Social Text'' published the paper in its Spring/Summer 1996 issue, whereupon Sokal publicly revealed his hoax. While this action was interpreted as an attack upon leftism, however Sokal, who was a committed supporter of the [[Sandinista]] movement in [[Nicaragua]] during the 1980s, intended it as a critique from within the left.&lt;ref name="physics.nyu.edu"&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies], [[Alan Sokal]]&lt;/ref&gt; He said he was concerned about what he saw as the increasing prevalence on the left of "a particular kind of nonsense and sloppy thinking... that denies the existence of objective realities". He called into question the usefulness of such theories to the wider left movement saying he "never understood how [[deconstruction]] was meant to help the working class."&lt;ref name="physics.nyu.edu"/&gt;
