The political terms "Left" and "[[Right-wing politics|Right]]" were coined during the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799), referring to the seating arrangement in the French [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]]: those who sat on the left generally opposed the [[monarchy]] and supported the revolution, including the creation of a [[republic]] and [[secularization]],&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; while those on the right were supportive of the traditional institutions of the [[Ancien Régime|Old Regime]]. Use of the term "Left" became more prominent after the restoration of the French monarchy in 1815 when it was applied to the "Independents".&lt;ref&gt;''Realms of memory: conflicts and divisions'' (1996), ed. Pierre Nora, "Right and Left" by Marcel Gauchet, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "wing" was appended to Left and Right in the late 19th century, usually with disparaging intent and "left-wing" was applied to those who were unorthodox in their religious or political views.

The term was later applied to a number of movements, especially [[republicanism]] during the French Revolution in the 18th century, followed by [[socialism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Maass|first2=Howard|last2=Zinn|title=The Case for Socialism|quote=The ''International Socialist Review'' is one of the best left-wing journals around...|page=164|publisher=Haymarket Books|edition=Revised|year=2010|isbn=978-1608460731}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[communism]], [[anarchism]] and [[social democracy]] in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Schmidt|first2=Lucien|last2=Van der Walt|title=Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism|series=Counter-Power|volume=1|publisher=AK Press|year=2009|page=128|quote=[...] anarchism is a coherent intellectual and political current dating back to the 1860s and the First International, and part of the labour and left tradition|isbn=978-1-904859-16-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term left-wing has been applied to a broad range of movements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jean Francois|last=Revel|title=Last Exit to Utopia|quote=In the United States, the word liberal is often used to describe the left wing of the Democratic party.|page=24|publisher=Encounter Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1594032646}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[civil rights movements]], [[feminist movement]]s, [[anti-war movement]]s and [[environmental movement]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Eric|last=Neumayer|title=The environment, left-wing political orientation, and ecological economics|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=51|year=2004|issue=3–4|pages=167–175|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.06.006|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/714/1/EE_51%283-4%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Barry|title=International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics|quote=All surveys confirm that environmental concern is associated with green voting...[I]n subsequent European elections, green voters have tended to be more left-leaning...the party is capable of motivating its core supporters as well as other environmentally minded voters of predominantly left-wing persuasion...|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2002|isbn=978-0415202855|url=https://archive.org/details/internationalenc0000unse_a2h7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a wide range of parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.ohio-state.edu/Fleisher/courses/econ508winter06/docs/Democratic_socialism.pdf|title=Democratic socialism|accessdate=3 June 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902085146/http://www.econ.ohio-state.edu/Fleisher/courses/econ508winter06/docs/Democratic_socialism.pdf|archivedate=2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/05/green-party-left-uk-politics-caroline-lucas|title=Green party to position itself as the real left of UK politics|author=Fiona Harvey|journal=The Guardian|date=2014-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sarnold"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=N.

== History ==
{{see also|History of political thought|Left–right political spectrum|French Left}}
[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|5 May 1789, opening of the [[Estates General of 1789]] in Versailles]]

In politics, the term "Left" derives from the [[French Revolution]], as the anti-monarchist [[The Mountain|Montagnard]] and [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] deputies from the [[Estates-General of 1789|Third Estate]] generally sat to the left of the presiding member's chair in parliament, a habit which began in the French [[Estates General of 1789]]. Throughout the [[France in the 19th century|19th century in France]], the main line dividing [[Politics of France|Left and Right]] was between supporters of the French [[Republic]] and those of the [[monarchy]].&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knapp|first1=Andrew|last2=Wright|first2=Vincent|title=The government and politics of France|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-415-35732-6|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67ttjXHhT3wC&amp;dq=the+government+and+politics+of+france&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2016}} The [[June Days uprising]] during the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] was an attempt by the Left to assert itself after the [[1848 Revolution (France)|1848 Revolution]], but only a small portion of the population supported this.

In the mid-19th century, [[nationalism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]] and [[anti-clericalism]] became features of the French Left. After [[Napoleon III]]'s [[French coup of 1851|1851 coup]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], [[Marxism]] began to rival radical republicanism and [[utopian socialism]] as a force within left-wing politics. The influential ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'' by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], published in 1848, asserted that all human history is the history of [[class struggle]]. They predicted that a [[proletarian]] revolution would eventually overthrow [[bourgeois]] [[capitalism]] and create a [[classless]], [[Stateless society|stateless]], post-monetary [[communist society]]. It was in this period that the word "wing" was appended to both Left and Right.&lt;ref name="oed.com"&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/107000?redirectedFrom=left-wing#eid|title=Home: Oxford English Dictionary|dictionary=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, many leftists, [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]] and [[trade unionist]]s were influenced by the works of [[Thomas Paine]], who introduced the concept of [[asset-based egalitarianism]], which theorises that [[social equality]] is possible by a redistribution of resources.

The [[International Workingmen's Association]] (1864–1876), sometimes called the First International, brought together delegates from many different countries, with many different views about how to reach a classless and stateless society. Following a split between supporters of Marx and [[Mikhail Bakunin]], anarchists formed the [[International Workers' Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=Demanding the Impossible — A History of Anarchism|page=9|publisher=Fontana Press|location=London|year=1993|isbn=978-0-00-686245-1|title-link=Demanding the Impossible}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second International]] (1888–1916) became divided over the issue of [[World War I]]. Those who opposed the war, such as [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], saw themselves as further to the left.

In the United States after [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the phrase "the Left" was used to describe those who supported trade unions, the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[anti-war movement]].&lt;ref name="Van Gosse 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Gosse|title=The Movements of the New Left, 1950–1975: A Brief History with Documents|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn=978-1-4039-6804-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=JoAnne C.|last=Reuss|title=American Folk Music and Left-Wing Politics|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8108-3684-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently in the United States, left-wing and right-wing have often been used as synonyms for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], or as synonyms for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thepage.time.com/2009/03/03/steele-to-gop-fight-for-coleman/?xid=rss-page|title=Steel to gop fight for Coleman|work=Time|date=3 March 2009|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.theweek.com/article/index/96256/Is_it_Spains_place_to_investigate_Gitmo|title=Is it Spain's place to investigate Gitmo?|magazine=The Week|date=7 May 2009|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reported in ''Mother Jones'', 29 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-politics10sep10,0,5982337.story|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Study finds left-wing brain, right-wing brain|date=10 September 2007|accessdate=2 May 2010|first=Denise|last=Gellene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==
The following positions are typically associated with left-wing politics.

=== Economics ===
Leftist economic beliefs range from [[Keynesian]] economics and the [[welfare state]] through [[industrial democracy]] and the [[social market]] to [[nationalization]] of the economy and [[Planned economy|central planning]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Glyn, ''Social Democracy in Neoliberal Times: The Left and Economic Policy since 1980'', Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-19-924138-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] advocacy of a council- and assembly-based self-managed [[anarchist communism]]. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], leftists supported [[trade union]]s. At the beginning of the 20th century, many leftists advocated strong government intervention in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beinhocker|first1=Eric D.|title=The Origin of Wealth: Evolution, Complexity, and the Radical Remaking of Economics|date=2006|publisher=[[Harvard Business Press|Harvard Business School Press]]|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=978-1-57851-777-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/originofwealthev00bein/page/316 316]|url=https://archive.org/details/originofwealthev00bein/page/316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leftists continue to criticize what they perceive as the exploitative nature of [[globalization]], the "[[race to the bottom]]" and unjust lay-offs. In the last quarter of the 20th century, the belief that government (ruling in accordance with the interests of the people) ought to be directly involved in the day-to-day workings of an economy declined in popularity amongst the [[center-left]], especially [[social democrat]]s who became influenced by "[[Third Way]]" ideology.

Other leftists believe in [[Marxian economics]], which are based on the economic theories of [[Karl Marx]]. Some distinguish Marx's economic theories from his political philosophy, arguing that Marx's approach to understanding the economy is independent of his advocacy of revolutionary [[socialism]] or his belief in the inevitability of [[proletarian]] revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Neo-Marxian Schools|publisher=The New School|url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/neomarx.htm|accessdate=23 August 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416234151/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/neomarx.htm|archivedate=16 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munro|first=John|title=Some Basic Principles of Marxian Economics|publisher=University of Toronto|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~munro5/MARXECON.htm|accessdate=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxian economics does not exclusively rely upon Marx, but it draws from a range of Marxist and non-Marxist sources. The "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]" or "[[workers' state]]" are terms used by some Marxists, particularly [[Leninist]]s and [[Marxist–Leninist]]s, to describe what they see as a temporary state between the [[capitalist]] state of affairs and a [[communist society]]. Marx defined the proletariat as salaried workers, in contrast to the "[[Lumpenproletariat]]", who he defined as outcasts of society, such as beggars, tricksters, entertainers, buskers, criminals and prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9049344/Lumpenproletariat|title=Lumpenproletariat|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political relevance of farmers has divided the left. In ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx scarcely mentioned the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939251-2,00.html|title=Communists: Marxism Fails on the Farm|journal=Time|date=13 October 1961|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mao Zedong]] believed that it would be rural peasants, not urban workers, who would bring about the proletarian revolution.

[[Left-libertarian]]s, [[libertarian socialist]]s and [[anarchist]]s believe in a [[decentralized]] economy run by [[trade union]]s, [[workers' council]]s, [[cooperative]]s, [[Municipality|municipalities]] and [[Commune (socialism)|communes]] and oppose both [[State ownership|state]] and [[Private property|private]] control of the economy, preferring [[social ownership]] and local control, in which a nation of decentralized regions is united in a [[confederation]].

The [[global justice movement]], also known as the [[anti-globalization movement]] or [[alter-globalization]] movement, protests against [[Corporation|corporate]] [[economic globalization]] due to its negative consequences for the poor, workers, the environment and small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, ''A Movement of Movements'', New York: Verso, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krishna-Hensel|first=Sai|year=2006|title=Global Cooperation: Challenges and Opportunities in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Juris&gt;{{cite book|last=Juris|first=Jeffrey S.|year=2008|title=Networking Futures: The Movements against Corporate Globalization|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0-8223-4269-4|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment ===
{{main article|Green politics|Eco-socialism|Green anarchism}}
One of the foremost left-wing advocates was Thomas Paine, one of the first individuals since left and right became political terms to describe the collective human ownership of the world which he speaks of in Agrarian Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Paine |first1=Thomas |title=Agrarian Justice |url=http://thomaspaine.org/major-works/agrarian-justice.html |publisher=Thomas Paine National Historical Association |accessdate=13 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, most of left-wing thought concerning environmentalism stems from this duty of ownership, and this cooperative ownership means that we need to take care of it. This is reflected in much of the historical left-wing thought that came after, although there were disagreements about what this entailed.

Both Karl Marx and the early socialist [[William Morris]] arguably had a concern for environmental matters.&lt;ref name="Foster2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=J.

From the 1970s onwards, environmentalism became an increasing concern of the left, with social movements and some unions campaigning over environmental issues. For example, the left-wing [[Builders Labourers Federation]] in [[Australia]], led by the communist Jack Mundy, united with environmentalists to place [[green ban]]s on environmentally destructive development projects.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith Burgman, ''Green Bans, Red Union: Environmental Activism and the New South Wales Builders Labourers' Federation'', UNSW Press, Sydney, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Some segments of the socialist and Marxist left consciously merged environmentalism and anti-capitalism into an [[eco-socialist]] ideology.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Wall, D., ''Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Commoner]] articulated a left-wing response to ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' model that predicted catastrophic resource depletion and spurred environmentalism, postulating that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for environmental degradation, as opposed to population pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Commoner, B., ''[[The Closing Circle]]'', 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental degradation can be seen as a class or equity issue, as environmental destruction disproportionately affects poorer communities and countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/articles/file/The+Argentimes.pdf|title=Poor Bear Burden of Industrialisation|work=[[Blacksmith Institute]]|date=19 October 2007|accessdate=16 April 2016|author=Sanra Ritten|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184856/http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/articles/file/The+Argentimes.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several left-wing or socialist groupings have an overt environmental concern and several green parties contain a strong socialist presence. For example, the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] features an eco-socialist group, [[Green Left (UK)|Green Left]], that was founded in June 2005.

=== Nationalism and anti-nationalism ===
{{see also|Internationalism (politics)|Left-wing nationalism|Proletarian internationalism}}
The question of [[nationality]] and [[nationalism]] has been a central feature of political debates on the Left. During the French Revolution, nationalism was a policy of the Republican Left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=William|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-925298-5|edition=2nd|quote="An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...", "The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world."|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordhistoryoff00doyl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican Left advocated [[civic nationalism]]&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; and argued that the nation is a "daily plebiscite" formed by the subjective "will to live together". Related to "revanchism", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], nationalism was sometimes opposed to [[imperialism]]. In the 1880s, there was a debate between those, such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] (Radical), [[Jean Jaurès]] (Socialist) and [[Maurice Barrès]] (nationalist), who argued that colonialism diverted France from the "blue line of the [[Vosges]]" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine); and the "[[French colonial empire|colonial lobby]]", such as Jules Ferry (moderate republican), Léon Gambetta (republican) and [[Eugène Etienne]], the president of the parliamentary colonial group. After the [[Dreyfus Affair]], nationalism instead became increasingly associated with the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extrême droite en France'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marxist]] [[social class]] theory of [[proletarian internationalism]] asserts that members of the [[working class]] should act in solidarity with working people in other countries in pursuit of a common [[class interest]], rather than focusing on their own countries. Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan: "[[Workers of the world, unite!]]", the last line of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. Union members had learned that more members meant more bargaining power. Taken to an international level, leftists argued that workers ought to act in solidarity to further increase the power of the working class.

Proletarian internationalism saw itself as a deterrent against war, because people with a common interest are less likely to take up arms against one another, instead focusing on fighting the [[ruling class]]. According to Marxist theory, the [[antonym]] of proletarian internationalism is [[bourgeois nationalism]]. Some Marxists, together with others on the left, view [[nationalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Szporluk, Roman. ''Communism and Nationalism''. 2nd. Oxford University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; [[racism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John|last=Solomos|first2=Les|last2=Back|title=Marxism, Racism, and Ethnicity|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=1995|volume=38|issue=3|pages=407–420|doi=10.1177/0002764295038003004|url=http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/pub/eres/SOC217_PIMENTEL/solomos.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.602.5843}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including [[anti-Semitism]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lenin|first=Vladimir|title=Anti-Jewish Pogroms|work=Speeches On Gramophone Records|year=1919|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1919/mar/x10.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[religion]] as [[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]] tactics used by the ruling classes to prevent the [[working class]] from uniting against them. Left-wing movements therefore have often taken up [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] positions. Anarchism has developed a [[Anarchism and nationalism|critique of nationalism]] that focuses on nationalism's role in justifying and consolidating state power and domination. Through its unifying goal, nationalism strives for centralization, both in specific territories and in a ruling elite of individuals, while it prepares a population for capitalist exploitation. Within anarchism, this subject has been treated extensively by [[Rudolf Rocker]] in ''[[Nationalism and Culture]]'' and by the works of [[Fredy Perlman]], such as ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]'' and ''The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism|first=Fredy|last=Perlman|location=Detroit|publisher=Black &amp; Red|year=1985|isbn=978-0317295580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of revolutions in [[German Revolution|Germany]] and [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Hungary]] ended [[Bolshevik]] hopes for an imminent [[world revolution]] and led to promotion of "[[Socialism in One Country]]" by [[Joseph Stalin]]. In the first edition of the book ''Osnovy Leninizma'' (''Foundations of Leninism'', 1924), Stalin argued that revolution in one country is insufficient, but by the end of that year in the second edition of the book he argued that the "[[proletariat]] can and must build the socialist society in one country". In April 1925, [[Nikolai Bukharin]] elaborated the issue in his brochure ''Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat?'', whose position was adopted as state policy after Stalin's January 1926 article ''On the Issues of Leninism'' (К вопросам ленинизма). This idea was opposed by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers who declared the need for an international "[[permanent revolution]]". Various Fourth Internationalist groups around the world who describe themselves as Trotskyist see themselves as standing in this tradition, while [[Maoist China]] supported Socialism in One Country.

European social democrats strongly support [[Europeanism]] and [[Supranational union|supranational]] integration, although there is a minority of nationalists and eurosceptics also in the left. Some link this [[left-wing nationalism]] to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by [[free trade]] agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.

[[Third-Worldism]] is a tendency within leftist thought that regards the division between [[First World]] [[developed country|developed countries]] and [[Third World]] [[developing countries]] as being of high political importance. This tendency supports [[decolonization|national liberation movements]] against what it considers [[imperialism]] by capitalists. Third-Worldism is closely connected with [[African socialism]], [[Socialism#Latin America|Latin American socialism]], [[Maoism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anti-imperialism.org/2012/11/02/what-is-maoism-third-worldism/|title=What is Maioism-Third Wolrdism?|publisher=Anti-Imperialism.org|date=2 November 2011|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=November 2012}} [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Pan-Arabism]]. Some left-wing groups in the developing world – such as the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] in Mexico, the [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] in [[South Africa]] and the [[Naxalites]] in India – argue that the First World Left takes a racist and paternalistic attitude towards liberation movements in the Third World.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Religion ===
{{see also|Political science of religion|Anarchism and religion|Buddhist socialism|Christian left|Jewish left|Islamic socialism}}
The original French left-wing was [[anti-clerical]], opposing the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and supporting the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; [[Karl Marx]] asserted that "[r]eligion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. 1976. ''Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right''. Collected Works, vol. 3. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In Soviet Russia, the [[Bolshevik]]s originally embraced "an ideological creed which professed that all religion would atrophy" and "resolved to eradicate [[Christianity]] as such". In 1918, "ten [[Russian Orthodox|Orthodox]] hierarchs were summarily shot" and "children were deprived of any religious education outside the home".&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh]], ''Sacred Causes'' HarperCollins (2006), p. 41–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Today in the [[Western world]] those on the Left usually support [[secularization]] and the [[separation of church and state]].

However, religious beliefs have also been associated with some left-wing movements, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the anti-[[capital punishment]] movement. Early [[socialist]] thinkers such as [[Robert Owen]], [[Charles Fourier]] and the [[Comte de Saint-Simon]] based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. From [[St. Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' through [[St. Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia]]'', major Christian writers defended ideas that socialists found agreeable.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other common leftist concerns such as [[pacifism]], [[social justice]], [[racial equality]], [[human rights]] and the rejection of excessive [[wealth]] can be found in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1533448,00.html|title=Does God Want You To Be Rich?|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=David van Biema, Jeff Chu|date=10 September 2006|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, the [[Social Gospel]] movement arose (particularly among some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglicans]], [[Lutheran]]s, [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptist]]s in [[North America]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]) which attempted to integrate [[Progressivism|progressive]] and [[socialist]] thought with [[Christianity]] in faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as [[Christian socialism]]. In the 20th century, the [[Liberation theology|theology of liberation]] and [[Creation Spirituality]] was championed by such writers as [[Gustavo Gutierrez]] and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]].

Other left-wing religious movements include [[Islamic socialism]] and [[Buddhist socialism]]. There have been alliances between the left and anti-war [[Muslim]]s, such as the [[Respect Party]] and the [[Stop the War Coalition]] in Britain. In France, the left has been divided over moves to ban the [[hijab]] from schools, with some supporting a ban based on separation of church and state and others opposing the prohibition based on personal freedom.

=== Social progressivism and counterculture ===
{{see also|Socialist feminism|Socialism and LGBT rights}}
[[Social progressivism]] is another common feature of modern leftism, particularly in the United States, where social progressives played an important role in the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]],&lt;ref&gt;James Brewer Stewrt, ''Abolitionist Politics and the Coming of the Civil War'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-55849-635-4}}. "[...] the progressive assumptions of 'uplift'." (page 40).&lt;/ref&gt; [[women's suffrage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/progress/suffrage/suffrage.html|title=For Teachers (Library of Congress)|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[civil rights]] and [[multiculturalism]]. Progressives have both advocated [[prohibition]] legislation and worked towards its repeal. Current positions associated with social progressivism in [[Western world|the West]] include opposition to the [[death penalty]] and the [[War on Drugs]], support for [[abortion]] rights, [[cognitive liberty]], [[LGBT rights]] including legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]], distribution of [[contraceptive]]s, and public funding of embryonic [[stem-cell research]]. Public education was a subject of great interest to groundbreaking social progressives such as [[Lester Frank Ward]] and [[John Dewey]], who believed that a democratic system of government was impossible without a universal and comprehensive system of education.

Various [[counterculture]] movements in the 1960s and 1970s were associated with the "[[New Left]]". Unlike the earlier leftist focus on [[Labour movement|union]] activism, the New Left instead adopted a broader definition of political activism commonly called [[social activism]]. The New Left in the United States is associated with the [[Hippie|hippie movement]], college campus mass protest movements, and a broadening of focus from protesting [[Social class|class]]-based oppression to include issues such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[sexual orientation]]. The British New Left was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of "Old Left".

The New Left opposed prevailing authority structures in society, which it termed "The Establishment" and became known as "anti-Establishment". The New Left did not seek to recruit industrial workers but rather concentrated on a social activist approach to organization, convinced that they could be the source for a better kind of [[social revolution]]. This view has been criticised by some [[Marxist]]s (especially [[Trotskyist]]s) who characterized this approach as "substitutionism", which they described as a misguided and non-Marxist belief that other groups in society could "substitute" for the revolutionary agency of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1960/xx/trotsub.htm|title=Tony Cliff: Trotsky on substitutionism (Autumn 1960)|publisher=Marxists.org|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4662049/Against-Substitutionism|title=Against Substitutionism|publisher=Scribd.com|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early [[feminist]]s and advocates of [[women's rights]] were considered left-wing by contemporaries. Feminist pioneer [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] was influenced by the radical thinker [[Thomas Paine]]. Many notable leftists have been strong supporters of gender equality, such as the Marxists [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Clara Zetkin]], and [[Alexandra Kollontai]]; anarchists such as [[Virginia Bolten]], [[Emma Goldman]], and [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]]; and socialists [[Helen Keller]] and [[Annie Besant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campling|first1=Valerie Bryson.

Marxists were responsible for organizing the first [[International Working Women's Day]] events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexandra Kollontai|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1920/womens-day.htm|title=1920-Inter Women's Day|publisher=Marxists.org|date=26 August 1920|accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[women's liberation movement]] is closely connected to the New Left and other [[new social movements]] that challenged the orthodoxies of the Old Left. [[Socialist feminism]], as exemplified by the [[Freedom Socialist Party]] and [[Radical Women]]; and [[Marxist feminism]], as with [[Selma James]], saw themselves as a part of the left that challenged what they perceive to be male-dominated and [[sexist]] structures within the Left. [[Liberal feminism]] is closely connected with [[social liberalism]], and in America, with the left wing of mainstream politics (e.g., [[National Organization for Women]]).

The connection between left-leaning ideologies and [[LGBT rights]] struggles also has an important history. Prominent socialists who were involved in early struggles for LGBT rights include [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Harry Hay]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and [[Daniel Guérin]], among others.

== Varieties ==
The spectrum of left-wing politics ranges from [[center-left]] to [[far-left]] (or [[ultra-left]]). The term center-left describes a position within the political mainstream. The terms far-left and ultra-left refer to positions that are more [[Political radicalism|radical]]. The center-left includes [[Social democracy|social democrats]], [[social liberal]]s, [[Progressivism|progressives]] and also some [[democratic socialist]]s and [[Green politics|greens]] (including some [[eco-socialist]]s). Center-left supporters accept market allocation of resources in a [[mixed economy]] with a significant [[public sector]] and a thriving [[private sector]]. Center-left policies tend to favour limited state intervention in matters pertaining to the [[public interest]].

In several countries, the terms far-left and radical left have been associated with varieties of [[communism]], [[autonomism]] and [[anarchism]]. They have been used to describe groups that advocate [[anti-capitalism]] or [[eco-terrorism]]. In France, a distinction is made between the left ([[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]) and the far-left ([[Trotskyist]]s, [[Maoist]]s and [[anarchist]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Cosseron, Serge (ed.). ''Le dictionnaire de l'extrême gauche''. Paris: [[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]], 2007. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] defines left-wing extremism as groups that want "to bring about change through violent revolution rather than through established political processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hsa-leftwing-extremists-increase-in-cyber-attacks-dated-26-january-2009.pdf|title=Leftwing Extremists Increase in Cyber Attacks|accessdate=3 June 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419052505/http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/hsa-leftwing-extremists-increase-in-cyber-attacks-dated-26-january-2009.pdf|archivedate=19 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, the term "[[Chinese New Left]]" denotes those who oppose the current [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reforms]] and favour the restoration of more socialist policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/74029202-a389-11da-83cc-0000779e2340,s01=1.html|title=China launches 'New Deal' for farmers|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western world]], the term New Left refers to cultural politics. In the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1980s, the term "[[hard left]]" was applied to supporters of [[Tony Benn]], such as the [[Campaign Group]] and those involved in the ''[[Labour Briefing|London Labour Briefing]]'' newspaper, as well as Trotskyist groups such as [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] and the [[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/1054337.stm|work=BBC News|title=Benn's golden anniversary|date=4 December 2000|accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, the term "[[soft left]]" was applied to supporters of the [[British Labour Party]] who were perceived to be more moderate. Under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]], the British Labour Party rebranded itself as [[New Labour]] in order to promote the notion that it was less left-wing than it had been in the past. One of the first actions of the Labour Party leader who succeeded them, [[Ed Miliband]], was the rejection of the "New Labour" label. However, Labour's voting record in parliament would indicate that under Miliband it had maintained the same distance from the left as it had with Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26743802|work=BBC News|title=MPs approve annual welfare cap in Commons vote|date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|author=John Kampfner|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/05/labour-back-on-the-right|title=Labour's return to the right|journal=The Guardian|date=2012-11-05|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the election of [[Jeremy Corbyn]] as Labour Party leader was viewed by some as Labour turning back toward its socialist roots.

Leftist [[postmodernism]] opposes attempts to supply universal explanatory theories, including Marxism, deriding them as [[Meta-narrative|grand narratives]]. It views culture as a contested space and via [[deconstruction]] seeks to undermine all pretensions to absolute truth. Left-wing critics of post-modernism assert that [[cultural studies]] inflates the importance of culture by denying the existence of an independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=59issue%3D105|title=International Socialism: Postmodernism, commodity fetishism and hegemony|publisher=Interet Archive|accessdate=3 June 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125104930/http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=59issue%3D105|archivedate=25 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/chomsky-on-postmodernism.html|title=Noam Chomsky on Post-Modernism|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=3 June 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030421013324/http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/chomsky-on-postmodernism.html|archivedate=21 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
