{{NPOV|date=November 2017}}

'''Bias''' is prejudice in favour of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair.

Biases can be learned implicitly within [[Culture|cultural]] contexts. People may develop biases toward or against an individual, an [[ethnic group]], a nation, a religion, a [[social class]], a political party, theoretical paradigms and ideologies within academic domains, or a species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steinbock|first1=Bonnie|title=Speciesism and the Idea of Equality|journal=Philosophy|date=1978|issue=204|pages=247–256|doi=10.1017/S0031819100016582|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3475308&amp;fileId=S0031819100016582|volume=53|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205205839/http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=3475308&amp;fileId=S0031819100016582|archivedate=2014-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biased means one-sided, lacking a neutral viewpoint, or not having an [[Open-mindedness|open mind]]. Bias can come in many forms and is related to [[prejudice]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;"bias ...; prejudice", The New Merriam–Webster Dictionary, {{ISBN|0877799008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In science and engineering, a bias is a [[systematic error]]. [[Statistical bias]] results from an unfair [[Sample (statistics)|sampling]] of a population, or from an [[estimation]] process that does not give accurate results on average.

==Cognitive biases==
{{Main article|Cognitive bias|List of cognitive biases}}
A cognitive bias is a repeating or basic misstep in thinking, assessing, recollecting, or other cognitive processes.&lt;ref name=Chegg&gt;{{cite journal | title =Definition of Cognitive Bias | publisher =Chegg | url =http://www.chegg.com/homework-help/definitions/cognitive-bias-13 | accessdate =1 September 2015 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://archive.is/20160509015823/http://www.chegg.com/homework-help/definitions/cognitive-bias-13 | archivedate =9 May 2016 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a pattern of deviation from standards in judgment, whereby inferences may be created unreasonably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haselton, M.

===Anchoring===
{{Main article|Anchoring}}
Anchoring is a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|psychological heuristic]] that describes the propensity to rely on the first piece of [[information]] encountered when [[decision making|making decisions]].&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Anchoring bias in decision-making | publisher = Science Daily | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/anchoring.htm | accessdate = September 29, 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150929180102/http://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/anchoring.htm | archivedate = September 29, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Anchoring Definition | publisher = Investopedia | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp | accessdate = September 29, 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20132020365600/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp | archivedate = November 7, 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this [[heuristic]], individuals begin with an implicitly suggested reference point (the "anchor") and make adjustments to it to reach their estimate. For example, the initial price offered for a [[used car]] sets the standard for the rest of the [[negotiation]]s, so that [[price]]s lower than the initial price seem more reasonable even if they are still higher than what the car is worth.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|year=1974|pages=1124–1131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~camerer/Ec101/JudgementUncertainty.pdf|pmid=17835457|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817144047/http://www.hss.caltech.edu/%7Ecamerer/Ec101/JudgementUncertainty.pdf|archivedate=2014-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Teach, "[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014027 Avoiding Decision Traps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614061542/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014027 |date=2013-06-14 }}", [[CFO (magazine)|''CFO'']] (1 June 2004).

Apophenia is well documented as a [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]] for gambling. Gamblers may imagine that they see patterns in the numbers which appear in [[Lottery|lotteries]], [[card game]]s, or [[roulette wheel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://waterstone.wordpress.com/2007/05/24/apophenia-illusory-correlation/ |title=Apophenia &amp; Illusory Correlation « Paul Xavier Waterstone |publisher=Waterstone.wordpress.com |date=2007-05-24 |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One manifestation of this is known as the "[[gambler's fallacy]]".

Pareidolia is the visual or auditory form of apophenia. It has been suggested that pareidolia combined with [[hierophany]] may have helped ancient societies organize chaos and make the world intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rupestreweb.info/china.html |last1=Bustamante |first1=Patricio |last2=Yao |first2=Fay |last3=Bustamante |first3=Daniela |year=2010 |title=The worship to the mountains: a study of the creation myths of the chinese culture |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092744/http://www.rupestreweb.info/china.html |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bustamante |first1=Patricio |last2=Yao |first2=Fay |last3=Bustamante |first3=Daniela |year=2010 |title=Search for meanings: from pleistocene art to the worship of the mountains in early China.

===Attribution bias===
{{Main article|Attribution bias}}
An attribution bias can happen when individuals assess or attempt to discover explanations behind their own and others' behaviors.&lt;ref name="Heider"&gt;Heider, F. (1958).

Rather than operating as objective perceivers, individuals are inclined to perceptual slips that prompt biased understandings of their social world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funder | first1 = D.C. | year = 1987 | title = Errors and mistakes: Evaluating the accuracy of social judgment | url = http://psy.ucsd.edu/%7Emckenzie/FunderPsychBull1987.pdf | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 101 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–90 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.101.1.75 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516210858/http://psy.ucsd.edu/~mckenzie/FunderPsychBull1987.pdf | archivedate = 2008-05-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nisbett and Ross 1980"&gt;Nisbett, R.E. &amp; Ross, L. (1980). ''Human inference: Strategies and shortcomings of social judgment'', Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; When judging others we tend to assume their actions are the result of internal factors such as [[personality]], whereas we tend to assume our own actions arise because of the necessity of external circumstances. There are a wide range of [[Attribution bias#List of attributional biases|sorts]] of attribution biases, such as the [[ultimate attribution error]], [[fundamental attribution error]], [[actor-observer bias]], and [[self-serving bias]].

===Confirmation bias===
[[File:Fred Barnard07.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A drawing of a man sitting on a stool at a writing desk|Confirmation bias has been described as an internal "[[Wikt:yes man|yes man]]", echoing back a person's beliefs like [[Charles Dickens]]' character [[Uriah Heep]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite journal |title=How to Ignore the Yes-Man in Your Head |first=Jason |last=Zweig |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company |date=November 19, 2009 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703811604574533680037778184 |accessdate=2010-06-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214052645/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703811604574533680037778184 |archivedate=February 14, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main article|Confirmation bias}}

Confirmation bias is the tendency to [[Research|search for]], [[Evaluation|interpret]], favor, and [[recall (memory)|recall]] information in a way that confirms one's [[belief]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] while giving disproportionately less attention to information that contradicts it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Plous | first=Scott | title=The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making | pages=233 | date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is stronger for [[emotion]]ally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain [[attitude polarization]] (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), [[Confirmation bias#Persistence of discredited beliefs|belief perseverance]] (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and [[illusory correlation]] (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations). Confirmation biases contribute to [[overconfidence effect|overconfidence]] in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. Poor [[decision making|decisions]] due to these biases have been found in political and organizational contexts.&lt;ref name=cbiaspolitics&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickerson|first=Raymond S.|title=Confirmation Bias: A Ubiquitous Phenomenon in Many Guises|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=June 1998|volume=2|issue=2|pages=175–220|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara W. Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara]] (1984). ''The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam''. New York: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Framing===
{{anchor|Cultural bias}} {{Main article|Cultural bias|Framing (social sciences)}}
Framing involves the [[social construction]] of [[social phenomenon|social phenomena]] by [[mass media]] sources, [[Ideology|political or social movements]], [[Politician|political leaders]], and so on. It is an influence over how people organize, perceive, and communicate about [[reality]].&lt;ref name="Druckman2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Druckman | first1 = J.N. | year = 2001 | title = The Implications of Framing Effects for Citizen Competence | url = | journal = Political Behavior | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 225–256 | doi=10.1023/A:1015006907312}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be positive or negative - depending on the audience and what kind of information is being presented. For political purposes, framing often presents facts in such a way that implicates a problem that is in need of a solution. Members of political parties attempt to frame issues in a way that makes a solution favoring their own political leaning appear as the most appropriate course of action for the situation at hand.&lt;ref name="van der Pas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Pas|first=D.|title=Making Hay While the Sun Shines: Do Parties Only Respond to Media Attention When The Framing is Right?|journal=Journal of Press/Politics|year=2014|volume=19|issue=1|pages=42–65|doi=10.1177/1940161213508207}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As understood in [[social theory]], framing is a [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] of [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], a collection of [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotes]] and [[stereotype]]s, that individuals rely on to understand and respond to events.&lt;ref name="Goffman1974"&gt;Goffman, E. (1974). Frame analysis: An easy on the organization of experience. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; People use filters to make sense of the world, the choices they then make are influenced by their creation of a frame.

Cultural bias is the related phenomenon of interpreting and judging phenomena by standards inherent to one's own culture. Numerous such biases exist, concerning cultural norms for color, location of body parts, [[mate selection]], concepts of [[justice]], [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[logic]]al validity, acceptability of [[evidence]], and [[taboo]]s. Ordinary people may tend to imagine other people as basically the same, not significantly more or less valuable, probably attached emotionally to different groups and different land.

===Halo effect===
{{Main article|Halo effect}}

===Horn effect===
{{main article|Horn effect}}
Sometimes called horn&lt;u&gt;'''s'''&lt;/u&gt; effect (as in [[Sign of the horns|Devil's horns]]), the horn effect is one of a number of effects that psychologists call “[[Bias blind spot]]s.”&lt;ref name="Attitudes"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rightattitudes.com/2010/04/30/rating-errors-halo-effect-horns-effect/|title=The Halo and Horns Effects [Rating Errors]|date=2010-05-01|website=Right Attitudes|access-date=2017-09-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823114921/http://www.rightattitudes.com/2010/04/30/rating-errors-halo-effect-horns-effect/|archivedate=2017-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horn effect occurs when "individuals believe (that negative) traits are inter-connected."&lt;ref name="JoshKennon"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.joshuakennon.com/mental-model-horns-effect-and-halo-effect|title=Mental Model: Horns Effect and Halo Effect|website=www.joshuakennon.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias involves a halo effect working in a negative direction: if the observer dislikes one aspect of something, they will have a negative predisposition toward everything about it. It is a phenomenon in which an observer's judgment of a person is adversely affected by the presence of (for the observer) an unfavorable aspect of this person.

The term is derived from the English&lt;ref&gt;some of this information originated in a Dutch Wiki article, translated to English, then supplemented by other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; word "horn" and refers to devil's horn(s).

===Status quo bias===
{{Main article|Status quo bias}}
Status quo bias is an [[emotional bias]]; a preference for the current state of affairs. The current baseline (or status quo) is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss.
Status quo bias should be distinguished from a rational preference for the [[status quo]] ante, as when the current state of affairs is objectively superior to the available alternatives, or when imperfect information is a significant problem. A large body of evidence, however, shows that status quo bias frequently affects human decision-making.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Lobbying is often spoken of with [[contempt]], the implication is that people with inordinate [[Power (social and political)|socioeconomic power]] are [[corruption|corrupting]] the [[law]] in order to serve their own interests.  When people who have a [[duty]] to act on behalf of others, such as elected officials with a duty to serve their constituents' interests or more broadly the [[common good]], stand to benefit by shaping the law to serve the interests of some private parties, there is a conflict of interest. This can lead to all sides in a debate looking to sway the issue by means of lobbyists.

Self-regulation is the process whereby an organization monitors its own adherence to legal, ethical, or safety standards, rather than have an outside, independent agency such as a third party entity monitor and enforce those standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Self-regulation dictionary definition | url = http://www.yourdictionary.com/self-regulation | publisher = yourdictionary.com | accessdate = October 2, 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151005144250/http://www.yourdictionary.com/self-regulation | archivedate = October 5, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-regulation of any group can create a conflict of interest. If any organization, such as a corporation or government bureaucracy, is asked to eliminate unethical behavior within their own group, it may be in their interest in the short run to eliminate the appearance of unethical behavior, rather than the behavior itself.

Regulatory capture is a form of [[political corruption]] that can occur when a [[regulatory agency]], created to act in the [[public interest]], instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special [[interest group]]s that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Regulatory Capture Definition | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp | publisher = Investopedia | accessdate = October 2, 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151003140220/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp | archivedate = October 3, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/regulatory-capture-101-1412544509|title=Regulatory Capture 101|date=2014-10-06|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903202258/https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulatory-capture-101-1412544509|archivedate=2017-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory capture occurs because groups or individuals with a high-stakes interest in the outcome of policy or regulatory decisions can be expected to focus their resources and energies in attempting to gain the policy outcomes they prefer, while members of the public, each with only a tiny individual stake in the outcome, will ignore it altogether.&lt;ref name="nyt-tbl"&gt;Timothy B.

===Shilling===
{{Main article|Shill}}
Shilling is deliberately giving spectators the feeling that one is an energetic autonomous [[customer|client]] of a [[seller|vendor]] for whom one is working. The effectiveness of shilling relies on [[crowd psychology]] to encourage other onlookers or audience members to purchase the goods or services (or accept the ideas being marketed). Shilling is illegal in some places, but legal in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |url=http://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/x030044/greeting-cards-america-inc-et-al |litigants=FTC v.

Statistical bias is a property of a [[statistics|statistical]] technique or of its results whereby the [[expected value]] of the results differs from the true underlying quantitative [[parameter#Statistics and econometrics|parameter]] being [[estimation theory|estimated]].

==Contextual biases==
===Academic bias===
{{Main article|Academic bias}}
Academic bias is the bias or perceived bias of [[academia|scholars]] allowing their [[belief]]s to shape their [[research]] and the [[scientific community]].

===Educational bias===
{{main article|Bias in education}}
Bias in education refers to real or perceived bias in the educational system. The content of school textbooks is often the issue of debate, as their target audience is young people, and the term "whitewashing" is used to refer to selective removal of critical or damaging evidence or comment.&lt;ref name="7forms"&gt;{{cite web | last = Sadker | first = David | title = Seven Forms of Bias in Instructional Materials | website = sadker.org | url = http://www.sadker.org/curricularbias.html | accessdate = 3 September 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151021055904/http://www.sadker.org/curricularbias.html | archivedate = 21 October 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washpost"&gt;{{cite web | last = Strauss | first = Valerie | title = Proposed Texas textbooks are inaccurate, biased and politicized, new report finds | website = washingtonpost.com | publisher = Washington Post | date = 12 September 2014 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/09/12/proposed-texas-textbooks-are-inaccurate-biased-and-politicized-new-report-finds/ | accessdate = 3 September 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150908172705/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/09/12/proposed-texas-textbooks-are-inaccurate-biased-and-politicized-new-report-finds/ | archivedate = 8 September 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitewashhist"&gt;{{cite web | last = Czitrom | first = Daniel | title = Texas school board whitewashes history | website = cnn.com | publisher = CNN | date = 22 March 2010 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/03/18/czitrom.texas.textbooks/ | accessdate = 3 September 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150328170047/http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/03/18/czitrom.texas.textbooks/ | archivedate = 28 March 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious bias in textbooks is observed in countries where religion plays a dominant role. There can be many forms of educational bias. Some overlooked aspects, occurring especially with the pedagogical circles of public and private schools—sources that are unrelated to fiduciary or mercantile impoverishment which may be unduly magnified—include teacher bias as well as a general bias against women who are going into STEM research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanmentalhealthfundation.org|title=How to Get Your Ex Boyfriend Back - Tips to Win Back His Love and Get Him Back|website=www.americanmentalhealthfundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Crisis Counseling with Children," Van Ornum and Murdock, 1990, NY: Crossroad/Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimenter bias===
{{main article|Experimenter's bias}}
In [[Experimental science|science research]], experimenter bias occurs when experimenter expectancies regarding [[Experiment|study]] results bias the [[Scientific method|research]] outcome.&lt;ref name= Sackett&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sackett |first=D.

===Full text on net bias===
{{Main article|FUTON bias|No abstract available bias}}
Full text on net (or FUTON) bias  is a tendency of [[scholar]]s to cite [[academic journal]]s with [[open access]]—that is, journals that make their full text available on the [[internet]] without charge—in their own writing as compared with [[Closed-access|toll access publications]]. Scholars can more easily discover and access articles that have  their full text on the internet, which increases authors' likelihood of reading, quoting, and citing these articles, this may increase the [[impact factor]] of open access journals relative to journals without open access.&lt;ref name="pmid 15301326"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murali |first1=N.

===Inductive bias===
{{main article|Inductive bias}}
Inductive bias occurs within the field of [[machine learning]]. In machine learning one seeks to develop [[algorithm]]s that are able to ''learn'' to anticipate a particular output. To accomplish this, the learning algorithm is given training cases that show the expected connection. Then the learner is tested with new examples.  Without further assumptions, this problem cannot be solved exactly as unknown situations may not be predictable.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1980 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DesJardinsandGordon1995&gt;{{cite journal | last = DesJardins | first = M. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = D.

A classical example of an inductive bias is [[Occam's Razor]], which assumes that the simplest consistent hypothesis is the best.

===Media bias===
{{main article|Media bias}}
Media bias is the bias or perceived bias of [[journalist]]s and [[news producer]]s within the [[mass media]] in the selection of events, the stories that are reported, and how they are covered.  The term generally implies a pervasive or widespread bias violating [[Journalism ethics and standards|the standards of journalism]], rather than the perspective of an individual journalist or article. There are varied forms of media bias, including [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda-setting]], [[gatekeeping (communication)|gatekeeping]], [[sensationalism]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://umd.academia.edu/StefanoRivolta/Papers/1052068/Strategic_Maneuvering_and_Media_Bias_in_Political_News_Magazine_Opinion_Articles ''Strategic Maneuvering and Media Bias in Political News Magazine Opinion Articles''], Stefano Mario Rivolta, 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The level of media bias in different nations is debated. There are also [[watchdog journalism|watchdog]] groups that report on media bias.

Practical limitations to media neutrality include the inability of journalists to report all available stories and facts, the requirement that selected facts be linked into a coherent narrative, [[government]] influence including overt and covert [[censorship]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpj.org/reports/2006/05/10-most-censored-countries.php "10 Most Censored Countries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016063824/https://cpj.org/reports/2006/05/10-most-censored-countries.php |date=2015-10-16 }}, Committee to Protect Journalists, 2 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the influence of the [[ownership|owners]] of the news source, [[concentration of media ownership]], the selection of [[Employment|staff]], the [[preference]]s of an intended [[audience]], and pressure from [[advertiser]]s.

Bias has been a feature of the mass media since its birth with the invention of the [[printing press]]. The expense of early printing equipment restricted media production to a limited number of people. Historians have found that publishers often served the interests of powerful social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Heinrichs, ''The Printing Press (Inventions That Shaped the World)'', p. 53, Franklin Watts, 2005, {{ISBN|0-531-16722-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-531-16722-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication bias===
{{main article|Publication bias}}
Publication bias is a type of bias with regard to what academic [[research]] is likely to be published because of a tendency of [[research]]ers, and journal editors, to prefer some outcomes rather than others e.g. results showing a [[Statistical significance|significant]] finding, leads to a problematic bias in the published literature.&lt;ref name="Song2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Song | first1 = F. | last2 = Parekh | first2 = S. | last3 = Hooper | first3 = L. | last4 = Loke | first4 = Y.

It refers to a tendency to under-report unexpected or undesirable experimental results, while being more trusting of expected or desirable results. This can propagate, as each instance reinforces the status quo, and later experimenters justify their own reporting bias by observing that previous experimenters reported different results.

Social desirability bias is a bias within [[Social research|social science research]] where [[survey methodology|survey]] respondents can tend to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed positively by others.&lt;ref name="SDRdef"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Social Desirability Bias | publisher = psychologyconcepts.com | url = http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/social-desirability-bias/ | accessdate = September 1, 2015 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150831110944/http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/social-desirability-bias/ | archivedate = August 31, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can take the form of over-reporting laudable behavior, or under-reporting undesirable behavior. This bias interferes with the interpretation of average tendencies as well as individual differences. The inclination represents a major issue with [[Self-report study|self-report]] questionnaires; of special concern are self-reports of abilities, [[Personality|personalities]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]], and [[Recreational drug use|drug use]].&lt;ref name="SDRdef" /&gt;

===Sexism===
{{Main article|Sexism}}
Sexism is [[discrimination]] based on a person's [[Sex and gender|sex or gender]]. Sexism can affect any gender, but it is particularly documented as affecting women and girls.&lt;!--NOTE: Consensus among WP:Reliable sources, assessed via WP:Due weight, is that sexism is typically against women. Before removing this text, raise the issue on the talk page first.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;There is a clear and broad consensus among academic scholars in multiple fields that sexism refers primarily to discrimination against women, and primarily affects women. See, for example:
* {{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=New Oxford American Dictionary |title=Sexism |access-date= |edition=3 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199891535}} Defines sexism as "prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex."
* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Academic Edition |year=2015}} Defines sexism as "prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Notes that "sexism in a society is most commonly applied against women and girls.  It functions to maintain patriarchy, or male domination, through ideological and material practices of individuals, collectives, and institutions that oppress women and girls on the basis of sex or gender."
* {{cite encyclopedia |last1=Cudd|first1=Ann E.|last2=Jones|first2=Leslie E.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=A Companion to Applied Ethics |year=2005 |publisher=Blackwell |location=London}} Notes that "'Sexism' refers to a historically and globally pervasive form of oppression against women."
* {{cite encyclopedia |last=Masequesmay|first=Gina|editor-last=O'Brien|editor-first=Jodi|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society |year=2008 |publisher=SAGE}} Notes that "sexism usually refers to prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Also states that "sexism is an ideology or practices that maintain patriarchy or male domination."
* {{cite encyclopedia |last=Hornsby |first=Jennifer|editor-last=Honderich|editor-first=Ted|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |edition=2 |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford}} Defines sexism as "thought or practice which may permeate language and which assume's women's inferiority to men."
* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Collins Dictionary of Sociology  |year=2006 |publisher=Harper Collins}} Defines sexism as "any devaluation or denigration of women or men, but particularly women, which is embodied in institutions and social relationships."
* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Palgrave MacMillan Dictionary of Political Thought |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan}} Notes that "either sex may be the object of sexist attitudes... however, it is commonly held that, in developed societies, women have been the usual victims."
* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Love, Courtship, and Sexuality through History, Volume 6: The Modern World |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood}} "Sexism is any act, attitude, or institutional configuration that systematically subordinates or devalues women.  Built upon the belief that men and women are constitutionally different, sexism takes these differences as indications that men are inherently superior to women, which then is used to justify the nearly universal dominance of men in social and familial relationships, as well as politics, religion, language, law, and economics."
* {{cite encyclopedia |last=Foster |first=Carly Hayden |editor-last=Kurlan|editor-first=George Thomas|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Political Science |title=Sexism |year=2011 |publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781608712434}} Notes that "both men and women can experience sexism, but sexism against women is more pervasive."
* {{cite encyclopedia |last=Johnson|first=Allan G.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell |location= |id= }} Suggests that "the key test of whether something is sexist... lies in its consequences: if it supports male privilege, then it is by definition sexist. I specify 'male privilege' because in every known society where gender inequality exists, males are privileged over females."
* {{cite book |last=Lorber |first=Judith |year=2011 |title=Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=5}} Notes that "although we speak of gender inequality, it is usually women who are disadvantaged relative to similarly situated men."
* {{cite book |last1=Wortman |first1=Camille B. |last2=Loftus |first2=Elizabeth S. |last3=Weaver |first3=Charles A |title=Psychology |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1999}} "As throughout history, today women are the primary victims of sexism, prejudice directed at one sex, even in the United States."
&lt;/ref&gt; It has been linked to [[stereotype]]s and [[gender role]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Matsumoto | first = David | title = The Handbook of Culture and Psychology | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2001 | page = 197 | isbn = 0-19-513181-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nakdimen KA The American Journal of Psychiatry [1984, 141(4):499-503]&lt;/ref&gt; and may include the belief that one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another.&lt;ref&gt;Doob, Christopher B. 2013.
