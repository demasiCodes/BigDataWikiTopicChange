'''Bias''' is an inclination of temperament or outlook to present or hold a partial perspective and a refusal to even consider the possible merits of alternative points of view.  People may be biased toward or against an individual, a race, a religion, a social class, or a political party.  Biased means one-sided, lacking a neutral viewpoint, not having an open mind.  Bias can come in many forms and is often considered to be synonymous with [[prejudice]] or [[bigotry]]. 

==In statistics==
{{Main|Bias (statistics)}}
In statistics, there are several types of bias:
*[[Selection bias]], were there is an error in choosing the individuals or groups to take part in a [[Scientific method|scientific study]].
*[[Spectrum bias]] consists of evaluating the ability of a diagnostic test in a biased group of patients, which leads to an overestimate of the sensitivity and specificity of the test.
*The [[bias of an estimator]] is the difference between an estimator's expectation and the true value of the parameter being estimated. 
*[[Omitted-variable bias]] is the bias that appears in estimates of parameters in a regression analysis when the assumed specification is incorrect, in that it omits an independent variable that should be in the model.
*In [[statistical hypothesis testing]], a test is said to be ''unbiased'' when the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis exceeds the significance level when the alternative is true ''and'' is less than or equal to the significance level when the null hypothesis is true.
*[[Systematic bias]] or [[systemic bias]] are external influences that may affect the accuracy of statistical measurements.
*[[Data-snooping bias]] comes from the misuse of data mining techniques.

==In judgment and decision making==
{{main|Cognitive bias}}

A cognitive bias is the human tendency to make systematic decisions in certain circumstances based on [[cognitive]] factors rather than evidence. Bias arises from various processes that are sometimes difficult to distinguish. These processes include information-processing shortcuts, motivational factors, and social influence.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, C. W. (2011) Bias: The Unconscious Deceiver. Bloomington, IN: Xlibris Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; Such biases can result from information-processing shortcuts called ''[[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristics]]''. They include errors in judgment, [[social attribution]], and memory. Cognitive biases are a common outcome of human thought, and often drastically skew the reliability of [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] and [[Evidence (law)|legal evidence]]. It is a phenomenon studied in [[cognitive science]] and [[social psychology]]. A cognitive bias also has the tendency to make systematic decisions in certain situations.

==In the media==
{{main|Media bias}}

Media bias is the bias of [[journalist]]s and [[news producer]]s within the [[mass media]], in the selection of which events and stories are reported and how they are covered.  The term "media bias" implies a pervasive or widespread bias contravening [[Journalism ethics and standards|the standards of journalism]], rather than the perspective of an individual journalist or article. The direction and degree of media bias in various countries is widely disputed.

Practical limitations to media neutrality include the inability of journalists to report all available stories and facts, and the requirement that selected facts be linked into a coherent narrative (Newton 1989).  Since it is impossible to report everything, selectivity is inevitable. [[Government]] influence, including overt and covert [[censorship]], biases the media in some countries. Market forces that result in a biased presentation include the [[ownership]] of the news source, [[concentration of media ownership]], the selection of [[Employment|staff]], the [[preference]]s of an intended [[audience]], and pressure from [[advertiser]]s.

Political bias has been a feature of the mass media since its birth with the invention of the [[printing press]]. The expense of early printing equipment restricted media production to a limited number of people. Historians have found that publishers often served the interests of powerful social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Heinrichs, ''The Printing Press (Inventions That Shaped the World)'', p. 53, Franklin Watts, 2005, ISBN 0-531-16722-4, ISBN 978-0-531-16722-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other aspects==
* Economic: when people/government interpret a law/contract in their favor for economic reasons.
* [[Inductive bias]] in machine learning.
* [[Cultural bias]]: Interpreting and judging phenomena in terms particular to one's own culture.
* [[Racism]], [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] and [[tribalism]]: Judging people or phenomena associated with people based on the race/ethnicity, region of origin, or tribe of the people, rather than based on more objective criteria.
* [[Sexism]]: Judging based on gender, rather than on more objective criteria.
* [[Sensationalism]]: Favouring the exceptional over the ordinary. However this sentence structure makes is sound like an appeal to popularity or normalcy fallacy. This is actually a more complex problem, whereby, the proponent elevates the importance of the evidence to more subjects than it is relevant. This is accomplished by willful bias, assumption or, putting conclusion ahead of evidence. In practice, this includes emphasizing, distorting, or fabricating exceptional news stories to boost popularity.
* [[Funding bias]] in scientific studies also known as the [[agent-principle dilemma]].
* [[Medical bias]] is also known as a physician having a [[conflict of interest]].&lt;ref&gt;Cain, D.M. and Detsky, A.S. [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=182115  Everyone's a Little Bit Biased (Even Physicians)] ''JAMA'' 2008;299(24):2893-289.&lt;/ref&gt;
