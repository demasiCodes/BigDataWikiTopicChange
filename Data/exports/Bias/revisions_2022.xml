'''Bias''' is a disproportionate weight ''in favor of'' or ''against'' an idea or thing, usually in a way that is [[Open-mindedness|closed-minded]], [[Prejudice|prejudicial]], or unfair. Biases can be innate or learned. People may develop biases for or against an individual, a group, or a belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steinbock|first1=Bonnie|title=Speciesism and the Idea of Equality|journal=Philosophy|date=1978|issue=204|pages=247–256|doi=10.1017/S0031819100016582|volume=53|s2cid=170331649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In science and engineering, a bias is a [[systematic error]]. [[Statistical bias]] results from an unfair [[Sample (statistics)|sampling]] of a population, or from an [[estimation]] process that does not give accurate results on average.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Welsh|first1=Matthew|last2=Begg|first2=Steve|date=2016|title=What have we learned? Insights from a decade of bias research|journal=The APPEA Journal|volume=56|issue=1|pages=435|doi=10.1071/aj15032|issn=1326-4966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word appears to [[Derivative (linguistics)|derive]] from [[Old Occitan|Old Provençal]] into [[Old French]] ''biais'', "sideways, askance, against the grain". Whence comes [[French language|French]] ''biais'', "a slant, a slope, an oblique".&lt;ref name=etymology&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/bias|title=Online Etymology Dictionary, ''Bias''|access-date=26 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems to have entered [[English (language)|English]] via the game of [[bowls]], where it referred to balls made with a greater weight on one side. Which expanded to the figurative use, "a one-sided tendency of the mind", and, at first especially in law, "undue propensity or prejudice".&lt;ref name=etymology /&gt;

==Types of bias==

===Cognitive biases===
{{Main|Cognitive bias|List of cognitive biases}}
A cognitive bias is a repeating or basic misstep in thinking, assessing, recollecting, or other cognitive processes.&lt;ref name=Chegg&gt;{{cite journal | title =Definition of Cognitive Bias | publisher =Chegg | url =http://www.chegg.com/homework-help/definitions/cognitive-bias-13 | access-date =1 September 2015 | url-status =live | archive-url =https://archive.today/20160509015823/http://www.chegg.com/homework-help/definitions/cognitive-bias-13 | archive-date =9 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a pattern of deviation from standards in judgment, whereby inferences may be created unreasonably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haselton, M.

====Anchoring====
{{Main|Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)|l1=Anchoring}}
Anchoring is a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|psychological heuristic]] that describes the propensity to rely on the first piece of [[information]] encountered when [[decision making|making decisions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Welsh|first1=Matthew B.|last2=Delfabbro|first2=Paul H.|last3=Burns|first3=Nicholas R.|last4=Begg|first4=Steve H.|date=2014|title=Individual differences in anchoring: Traits and experience|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|volume=29|pages=131–140|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2013.01.002|issn=1041-6080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"&gt;{{cite web | title = Anchoring bias in decision-making | website = Science Daily | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/anchoring.htm | access-date = September 29, 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150929180102/https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/anchoring.htm | archive-date = September 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Investopedia"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Anchoring Definition | publisher = Investopedia | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp | access-date = September 29, 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171023052312/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp | archive-date = October 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this [[heuristic]], individuals begin with an implicitly suggested reference point (the "anchor") and make adjustments to it to reach their estimate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For example, the initial price offered for a [[used car]] sets the standard for the rest of the [[negotiation]]s, so that [[price]]s lower than the initial price seem more reasonable even if they are still higher than what the car is worth.&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|year=1974|pages=1124–1131|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~camerer/Ec101/JudgementUncertainty.pdf|pmid=17835457|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817144047/http://www.hss.caltech.edu/%7Ecamerer/Ec101/JudgementUncertainty.pdf|archive-date=2014-08-17|bibcode=1974Sci...185.1124T|s2cid=143452957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Teach, "[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014027 Avoiding Decision Traps] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614061542/http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3014027 |date=2013-06-14 }}", [[CFO (magazine)|''CFO'']] (1 June 2004).

====Apophenia====
{{Main|Apophenia|Pareidolia}}{{See also|Hindsight bias}}
Apophenia, also known as patternicity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shermer |first=Michael |title=Patternicity: Finding Meaningful Patterns in Meaningless Noise |journal=Scientific American |volume=299 |issue=6 |pages=48 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1208-48 |pmid=19143444 |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=GrrlScientist |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2010/sep/25/michael-shermer-belief-self-deception |title=Michael Shermer: The pattern behind self-deception |newspaper=Guardian |date=29 September 2010 |access-date=2011-06-29 |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926040551/http://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2010/sep/25/michael-shermer-belief-self-deception |archive-date=26 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or agenticity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQO4y2bueAM|title=Why Do We Need a Belief in God with Michael Shermer|website=[[YouTube]] |date=2011-08-19|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314224302/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQO4y2bueAM|archive-date=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns within [[Randomness|random]] data. Apophenia is well documented as a [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]] for gambling. Gamblers may imagine that they see patterns in the numbers which appear in [[Lottery|lotteries]], [[card game]]s, or [[roulette wheel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterstone.wordpress.com/2007/05/24/apophenia-illusory-correlation/ |title=Apophenia &amp; Illusory Correlation « Paul Xavier Waterstone |publisher=Waterstone.wordpress.com |date=2007-05-24 |access-date=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One manifestation of this is known as the "[[gambler's fallacy]]".

Pareidolia is the visual or auditory form of apophenia. It has been suggested that pareidolia combined with [[hierophany]] may have helped ancient societies organize chaos and make the world intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rupestreweb.info/china.html |last1=Bustamante |first1=Patricio |last2=Yao |first2=Fay |last3=Bustamante |first3=Daniela |year=2010 |title=The worship to the mountains: a study of the creation myths of the chinese culture |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092744/http://www.rupestreweb.info/china.html |archive-date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bustamante |first1=Patricio |last2=Yao |first2=Fay |last3=Bustamante |first3=Daniela |year=2010 |title=Search for meanings: from pleistocene art to the worship of the mountains in early China.

====Attribution bias====
{{Main|Attribution bias}}
An attribution bias can happen when individuals assess or attempt to discover explanations behind their own and others' behaviors.&lt;ref name="Heider"&gt;Heider, F. (1958).

Rather than operating as objective perceivers, individuals are inclined to perceptual slips that prompt biased understandings of their social world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funder | first1 = D.C. | year = 1987 | title = Errors and mistakes: Evaluating the accuracy of social judgment | url = http://psy.ucsd.edu/%7Emckenzie/FunderPsychBull1987.pdf | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 101 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–90 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.101.1.75 | pmid = 3562704 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516210858/http://psy.ucsd.edu/~mckenzie/FunderPsychBull1987.pdf | archive-date = 2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nisbett and Ross 1980"&gt;Nisbett, R.E. &amp; Ross, L.

''Human inference: Strategies and shortcomings of social judgment'', Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; When judging others we tend to assume their actions are the result of internal factors such as [[personality]], whereas we tend to assume our own actions arise because of the necessity of external circumstances. There are a wide range of [[Attribution bias#List of attributional biases|sorts]] of attribution biases, such as the [[ultimate attribution error]], [[fundamental attribution error]], [[actor-observer bias]], and [[self-serving bias]].

====Confirmation bias====
[[File:Fred Barnard07.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A drawing of a man sitting on a stool at a writing desk|Confirmation bias has been described as an internal "[[Wikt:yes man|yes man]]", echoing back a person's beliefs like [[Charles Dickens]]' character [[Uriah Heep (character)|Uriah Heep]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite journal |title=How to Ignore the Yes-Man in Your Head |first=Jason |last=Zweig |journal=Wall Street Journal |date=November 19, 2009 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703811604574533680037778184 |access-date=2010-06-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214052645/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703811604574533680037778184 |archive-date=February 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{Main|Confirmation bias}}

Confirmation bias is the tendency to [[Research|search for]], [[Evaluation|interpret]], favor, and [[recall (memory)|recall]] information in a way that confirms one's [[belief]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] while giving disproportionately less attention to information that contradicts it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Plous | first=Scott | title=The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making | url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyjudgme00plou_528 | url-access=limited | pages=[https://archive.org/details/psychologyjudgme00plou_528/page/n201 233] | date=1993| isbn=9780070504776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is stronger for [[emotion]]ally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain [[attitude polarization]] (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), [[Confirmation bias#Persistence of discredited beliefs|belief perseverance]] (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and [[illusory correlation]] (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations). Confirmation biases contribute to [[overconfidence effect|overconfidence]] in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. Poor [[decision making|decisions]] due to these biases have been found in political and organizational contexts.&lt;ref name=cbiaspolitics&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickerson|first=Raymond S.|title=Confirmation Bias: A Ubiquitous Phenomenon in Many Guises|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=June 1998|volume=2|issue=2|pages=175–220|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175|s2cid=8508954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara W. Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara]] (1984). ''The March of Folly: From Troy to Vietnam''. New York: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Framing====
{{anchor|Cultural bias}} {{Main|Cultural bias|Framing (social sciences)}}
Framing involves the [[social construction]] of [[social phenomenon|social phenomena]] by [[mass media]] sources, [[Ideology|political or social movements]], [[Politician|political leaders]], and so on. It is an influence over how people organize, perceive, and communicate about [[reality]].&lt;ref name="Druckman2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Druckman |first1=J.N. |year=2001 |title=The Implications of Framing Effects for Citizen Competence |journal=Political Behavior |volume=23 |issue=3|pages=225–256 |doi=10.1023/A:1015006907312|s2cid=10584001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be positive or negative, depending on the audience and what kind of information is being presented. For political purposes, framing often presents facts in such a way that implicates a problem that is in need of a solution. Members of political parties attempt to frame issues in a way that makes a solution favoring their own political leaning appear as the most appropriate course of action for the situation at hand.&lt;ref name="van der Pas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van der Pas|first=D.|title=Making Hay While the Sun Shines: Do Parties Only Respond to Media Attention When The Framing is Right?|journal=Journal of Press/Politics|year=2014|volume=19|issue=1|pages=42–65|doi=10.1177/1940161213508207|s2cid=220652512 }}&lt;!--|access-date=6 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As understood in [[social theory]], framing is a [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] of [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], a collection of [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotes]] and [[stereotype]]s, that individuals rely on to understand and respond to events.&lt;ref name="Goffman1974"&gt;Goffman, E. (1974). ''Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; People use filters to make sense of the world, the choices they then make are influenced by their creation of a frame.

Cultural bias is the related phenomenon of interpreting and judging phenomena by standards inherent to one's own culture. Numerous such biases exist, concerning cultural norms for color, location of body parts, [[mate selection]], concepts of [[justice]], [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[logic]]al validity, acceptability of [[evidence]], and [[taboo]]s. Ordinary people may tend to imagine other people as basically the same, not significantly more or less valuable, probably attached emotionally to different groups and different land.

====Halo effect and horn effect====
{{Main|Halo effect|Horn effect}}

The name halo effect is based on the concept of the [[Halo (religious iconography)|saint's halo]], and is a specific type of [[confirmation bias]], wherein positive sentiments in one area cause questionable or unknown characteristics to be seen positively.

====Self-serving bias====
{{Main|Self-serving bias}}
Self-serving bias is the tendency for [[cognition|cognitive]] or [[perception|perceptual]] processes to be [[Cognitive distortion|distorted]] by the individual's need to maintain and enhance [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;Myers, D.G. (2015). ''Exploring Social Psychology'', 7th Edition.

====Status quo bias====
{{Main|Status quo bias}}
Status quo bias is an [[emotional bias]]; a preference for the current state of affairs. The current baseline (or status quo) is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss.
Status quo bias should be distinguished from a rational preference for the [[status quo]] ante, as when the current state of affairs is objectively superior to the available alternatives, or when imperfect information is a significant problem. A large body of evidence, however, shows that status quo bias frequently affects human decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Samuelson|first1=William|last2=Zeckhauser|first2=Richard|date=1988|title=Status quo bias in decision making|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7–59|doi=10.1007/bf00055564|issn=0895-5646|citeseerx=10.1.1.632.3193|s2cid=5641133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts of interest===
{{Main|Conflict of interest}}
A conflict of interest is when a [[person]] or [[organization|association]] has intersecting interests ([[finance|financial]], [[interest (emotion)|personal]], etc.) which could potentially corrupt. The potential conflict is autonomous of actual [[Inappropriateness|improper actions]], it can be found and intentionally defused before [[corruption]], or the appearance of corruption, happens. "A conflict of interest is a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgement or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Bernard|last1=Lo|first2=Marilyn J.|last2=Field|title=Conflict of Interest in Medical Research, Education, and Practice|publisher=[[National Academies Press]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-309-13188-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It exists if the circumstances are sensibly accepted to present a hazard that choices made may be unduly affected by auxiliary interests.&lt;ref name=Cain&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cain | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Detsky | first2 = A.S. | year = 2008 | title = Everyone's a Little Bit Biased (Even Physicians) | journal = JAMA | volume = 299 | issue = 24 | pages = 2893–289 | doi = 10.1001/jama.299.24.2893 | pmid = 18577735 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bribery====
{{Main|Bribery}}
Bribery is giving of money, goods or other forms of recompense to in order to influence the recipient's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title = What is BRIBERY? | dictionary = Black's Law Dictionary | url = http://thelawdictionary.org/bribery/ | access-date = September 30, 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151001204535/http://thelawdictionary.org/bribery/ | archive-date = October 1, 2015 | date = 2011-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bribes can include [[money]] (including [[gratuity|tips]]), [[Good (economics)|goods]], [[Chose (English law)|rights in action]], [[property]], [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]], [[Remuneration|emolument]], [[gift]]s, [[Employee benefit|perks]], [[Price skimming|skimming]], [[Influence peddling|return favors]], [[discounts and allowances|discounts]], [[sweetheart deal]]s, [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]], [[funding]], [[donation]]s, [[campaign contribution]]s, [[sponsorship]]s, [[stock options]], [[secret commission]]s, or [[promotion (rank)|promotions]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally T.

Political [[campaign contributions]] in the form of cash are considered [[Crime|criminal acts]] of bribery in some countries, while in the United States they are legal provided they adhere to election law. Tipping is considered bribery in some societies, but not others.

====Favoritism====
{{Main|In-group favoritism}}
Favoritism, sometimes known as in-group favoritism, or in-group bias, refers to a pattern of favoring members of one's [[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] over out-group members. This can be expressed in evaluation of others, in allocation of resources, and in many other ways.&lt;ref name=aronson&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. (2010).

====Lobbying====
[[File:Tabakslobby.jpg|thumb|Box offered by [[tobacco lobbyists]] to Dutch [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Kartika Liotard]] in September 2013]]
{{Main|Lobbying}}

Lobbying is the attempt to influence choices made by [[government|administrators]], frequently [[legislator|lawmakers]] or individuals from [[regulatory agency|administrative agencies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lobbying|title=lobbying|work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary.Com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150917052337/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lobbying|archive-date=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82529.stm|title=lobbying|work=BBC News|date=1 October 2008|access-date=24 March 2010|location=London|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103102647/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82529.stm|archive-date=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lobbyist|title=lobbyist|work=Random House Unabridged Dictionary|year=2006|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002030958/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lobbyist|archive-date=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobbyists may be among a legislator's [[Electoral district|constituencies]], or not; they may engage in lobbying as a [[business]], or not. Lobbying is often spoken of with [[contempt]], the implication is that people with inordinate [[Power (social and political)|socioeconomic power]] are [[corruption|corrupting]] the [[law]] in order to serve their own interests. When people who have a [[duty]] to act on behalf of others, such as elected officials with a duty to serve their constituents' interests or more broadly the [[common good]], stand to benefit by shaping the law to serve the interests of some private parties, there is a conflict of interest. This can lead to all sides in a debate looking to sway the issue by means of lobbyists.

====Regulatory issues====
{{Main|Industry self-regulation|Regulatory capture}}
Self-regulation is the process whereby an organization monitors its own adherence to legal, ethical, or safety standards, rather than have an outside, independent agency such as a third party entity monitor and enforce those standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Self-regulation dictionary definition | url = http://www.yourdictionary.com/self-regulation | publisher = yourdictionary.com | access-date = October 2, 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151005144250/http://www.yourdictionary.com/self-regulation | archive-date = October 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-regulation of any group can create a conflict of interest. If any organization, such as a corporation or government bureaucracy, is asked to eliminate unethical behavior within their own group, it may be in their interest in the short run to eliminate the appearance of unethical behavior, rather than the behavior itself.

Regulatory capture is a form of [[political corruption]] that can occur when a [[regulatory agency]], created to act in the [[public interest]], instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special [[interest group]]s that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Regulatory Capture Definition | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp | publisher = Investopedia | access-date = October 2, 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151003140220/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp | archive-date = October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulatory-capture-101-1412544509|title=Regulatory Capture 101|date=2014-10-06|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903202258/https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulatory-capture-101-1412544509|archive-date=2017-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory capture occurs because groups or individuals with a high-stakes interest in the outcome of policy or regulatory decisions can be expected to focus their resources and energies in attempting to gain the policy outcomes they prefer, while members of the public, each with only a tiny individual stake in the outcome, will ignore it altogether.&lt;ref name="nyt-tbl"&gt;Timothy B.

Shilling is deliberately giving spectators the feeling that one is an energetic autonomous [[customer|client]] of a [[seller|vendor]] for whom one is working. The effectiveness of shilling relies on [[crowd psychology]] to encourage other onlookers or audience members to purchase the goods or services (or accept the ideas being marketed). Shilling is illegal in some places, but legal in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |url=http://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/x030044/greeting-cards-america-inc-et-al |litigants=FTC v. Greeting Cards of America, Inc. et al - USA |court=S.D. Fla. |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of shilling is [[Review#Bought review|paid reviews]] that give the impression of being autonomous opinions.

===Statistical biases===
{{main|Bias (statistics)}}
Statistical bias is a systematic tendency in the process of data collection, which results in lopsided, misleading results. This can occur in any of a number of ways, in the way the sample is selected, or in the way data are collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rumsey |first=Deborah J. |author-link= Deborah J. Rumsey |url=https://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/how-to-identify-statistical-bias/ |title=HOW TO IDENTIFY STATISTICAL BIAS |publisher=Dummies.com |access-date=2018-08-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214195807/https://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/how-to-identify-statistical-bias/ |archive-date=2018-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a property of a [[statistics|statistical]] technique or of its results whereby the [[expected value]] of the results differs from the true underlying quantitative [[parameter#Statistics and econometrics|parameter]] being [[estimation theory|estimated]].

====Forecast bias====
{{main|Forecast bias}}
A forecast bias is when there are consistent differences between results and the forecasts of those quantities; that is: forecasts may have an overall tendency to be too high or too low.

====Observer-expectancy effect====
{{main|Observer-expectancy effect}}
The observer-expectancy effect is when a [[researcher|researcher's]] expectations cause them to subconsciously influence the people participating in an experiment. It is usually [[experimental control|controlled]] using a [[double-blind experiment|double-blind system]], and was an important reason for the development of double-blind experiments.

====Reporting bias and social desirability bias====
{{main|Reporting bias|Social desirability bias}}
In [[epidemiology]] and [[empirical research]], reporting bias is defined as "selective revealing or suppression of information" of undesirable behavior by subjects&lt;ref name="Porta2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Porta, Miquel|title=A Dictionary of Epidemiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7R-MLMyEgwC&amp;pg=PT275|access-date=27 March 2013|date=5 June 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-157844-1|page=275|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216010931/https://books.google.com/books?id=s7R-MLMyEgwC&amp;pg=PT275|archive-date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or researchers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cochrane.org/resources/handbook/ Green S, Higgins S, editors: Glossary.

It refers to a tendency to under-report unexpected or undesirable experimental results, while being more trusting of expected or desirable results. This can propagate, as each instance reinforces the status quo, and later experimenters justify their own reporting bias by observing that previous experimenters reported different results.

Social desirability bias is a bias within [[Social research|social science research]] where [[survey methodology|survey]] respondents can tend to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed positively by others.&lt;ref name="SDRdef"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Social Desirability Bias | publisher = psychologyconcepts.com | url = http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/social-desirability-bias/ | access-date = September 1, 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150831110944/http://www.psychologyconcepts.com/social-desirability-bias/ | archive-date = August 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can take the form of over-reporting laudable behavior, or under-reporting undesirable behavior. This bias interferes with the interpretation of average tendencies as well as individual differences. The inclination represents a major issue with [[Self-report study|self-report]] questionnaires; of special concern are self-reports of abilities, [[Personality|personalities]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]], and [[Recreational drug use|drug use]].&lt;ref name="SDRdef" /&gt;

====Selection bias====
{{main|Selection bias}}
[[File:Simple random sampling.PNG|thumb|[[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is supposed to collect of a representative [[statistical sample|sample]] of a [[population (statistics)|population]].]]
Selection bias is the conscious or unconscious bias introduced into a study by the way individuals, groups or data are selected for analysis, if such a way means that true randomization is not achieved, thereby ensuring that the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=44087 Dictionary of Cancer Terms → selection bias]. Retrieved on September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a sample that may be significantly different from the overall population.

===Prejudices===
{{Main|Bigotry|Prejudice|Cultural bias}}
Bias and prejudice are usually considered to be closely related.&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;"bias ...; prejudice", The New Merriam–Webster Dictionary, {{ISBN|0877799008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prejudice is prejudgment, or forming an opinion before becoming aware of the relevant facts of a case. The word is often used to refer to preconceived, usually unfavorable, judgments toward people or a person because of [[gender]], political opinion, [[social class]], [[Ageing|age]], [[disability]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[Race (human classification)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[language]], [[nationality]], or other personal characteristics. Prejudice can also refer to unfounded beliefs&lt;ref&gt;[[William James]] wrote: "A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices." [http://www.freemaninstitute.com/quotes.htm Quotable Quotes – Courtesy of The Freeman Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; and may include "any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosnow |first1=Ralph L. |title=Poultry and Prejudice |journal=Psychologist Today |date=March 1972 |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=53–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexism====
{{Main|Sexism}}
Sexism is [[discrimination]] based on a person's [[Sex and gender|sex or gender]]. Sexism can affect any gender, but it is particularly documented as affecting women and girls.&lt;!--NOTE: Consensus among WP:Reliable sources, assessed via WP:Due weight, is that sexism is typically against women. Before removing this text, raise the issue on the talk page first.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;There is a clear and broad consensus among academic scholars in multiple fields that sexism refers primarily to discrimination against women, and primarily affects women. See, for example:
* {{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=New Oxford American Dictionary |title=Sexism |edition=3 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199891535}} Defines sexism as "prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex."
* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Academic Edition |year=2015}} Defines sexism as "prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Notes that "sexism in a society is most commonly applied against women and girls. It functions to maintain patriarchy, or male domination, through ideological and material practices of individuals, collectives, and institutions that oppress women and girls on the basis of sex or gender."
* {{cite encyclopedia |last1=Cudd|first1=Ann E.|last2=Jones|first2=Leslie E.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=A Companion to Applied Ethics |year=2005 |publisher=Blackwell |location=London}} Notes that "'Sexism' refers to a historically and globally pervasive form of oppression against women."
* {{cite encyclopedia |last=Masequesmay|first=Gina|editor-last=O'Brien|editor-first=Jodi|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society |year=2008 |publisher=SAGE}} Notes that "sexism usually refers to prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Also states that "sexism is an ideology or practices that maintain patriarchy or male domination."
* {{cite encyclopedia |last=Hornsby |first=Jennifer|editor-last=Honderich|editor-first=Ted|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |edition=2 |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford}} Defines sexism as "thought or practice which may permeate language and which assume's women's inferiority to men."
* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Collins Dictionary of Sociology |year=2006 |publisher=Harper Collins}} Defines sexism as "any devaluation or denigration of women or men, but particularly women, which is embodied in institutions and social relationships."
* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Palgrave MacMillan Dictionary of Political Thought |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan}} Notes that "either sex may be the object of sexist attitudes... however, it is commonly held that, in developed societies, women have been the usual victims."
* {{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Love, Courtship, and Sexuality through History, Volume 6: The Modern World |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood}} "Sexism is any act, attitude, or institutional configuration that systematically subordinates or devalues women. Built upon the belief that men and women are constitutionally different, sexism takes these differences as indications that men are inherently superior to women, which then is used to justify the nearly universal dominance of men in social and familial relationships, as well as politics, religion, language, law, and economics."
* {{cite encyclopedia |last=Foster |first=Carly Hayden |editor-last=Kurlan|editor-first=George Thomas|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Political Science |title=Sexism |year=2011 |publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781608712434}} Notes that "both men and women can experience sexism, but sexism against women is more pervasive."
* {{cite encyclopedia |last=Johnson|first=Allan G.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell }} Suggests that "the key test of whether something is sexist... lies in its consequences: if it supports male privilege, then it is by definition sexist. I specify 'male privilege' because in every known society where gender inequality exists, males are privileged over females."
* {{cite book |last=Lorber |first=Judith |year=2011 |title=Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=5}} Notes that "although we speak of gender inequality, it is usually women who are disadvantaged relative to similarly situated men."

====Full text on net bias====
{{Main|FUTON bias}}
Full text on net (or FUTON) bias is a tendency of [[scholarly method|scholars]] to cite [[academic journal]]s with [[open access]]—that is, journals that make their full text available on the [[internet]] without charge—in their own writing as compared with [[Closed-access|toll access publications]]. Scholars can more easily discover and access articles that have their full text on the internet, which increases authors' likelihood of reading, quoting, and citing these articles, this may increase the [[impact factor]] of open access journals relative to journals without open access.&lt;ref name="pmid 15301326"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murali |first1=N.

====Publication bias====
{{main|Publication bias}}
Publication bias is a type of bias with regard to what academic [[research]] is likely to be published because of a tendency of researchers, and journal editors, to prefer some outcomes rather than others e.g. results showing a [[Statistical significance|significant]] finding, leads to a problematic bias in the published literature.&lt;ref name="Song2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Song | first1 = F. | last2 = Parekh | first2 = S. | last3 = Hooper | first3 = L. | last4 = Loke | first4 = Y.

===Biases in law enforcement===
====Driving while black====
{{main|Driving while black}}
Driving while black refers to the [[racial profiling]] of [[African American]] [[driving|drivers]]. The phrase implies that a motorist might be pulled over by a [[police]] officer, questioned, and searched, because of a [[Racism|racial bias]].&lt;ref name=DWB_matters&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=D.|date=1999|url=http://academic.udayton.edu/race/03justice/dwb01.htm|title=The stories, the statistics, and the law: Why 'Driving While Black' matters|work=84 Minnesota Law Review|pages=265–326|access-date=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/10/23/thirteen-ways-of-looking-at-a-black-man|title=Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man|last=Gates|first=Henry L.|date=1995-10-16|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biases in media===
{{main|Media bias|Media manipulation}}
{{Anchor|Media bias}}
Media bias is the bias or perceived bias of [[journalist]]s and [[news producer]]s within the [[mass media]] in the selection of events, the stories that are reported, and how they are covered. The term generally implies a pervasive or widespread bias violating [[Journalism ethics and standards|the standards of journalism]], rather than the perspective of an individual journalist or article.&lt;ref&gt;[https://umd.academia.edu/StefanoRivolta/Papers/1052068/Strategic_Maneuvering_and_Media_Bias_in_Political_News_Magazine_Opinion_Articles ''Strategic Maneuvering and Media Bias in Political News Magazine Opinion Articles''], Stefano Mario Rivolta, 7 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The level of media bias in different nations is debated. There are also [[watchdog journalism|watchdog]] groups that report on media bias.

Practical limitations to media neutrality include the inability of journalists to report all available stories and facts, the requirement that selected facts be linked into a coherent narrative, [[government]] influence including overt and covert [[censorship]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpj.org/reports/2006/05/10-most-censored-countries.php "10 Most Censored Countries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016063824/https://cpj.org/reports/2006/05/10-most-censored-countries.php |date=2015-10-16 }}, Committee to Protect Journalists, 2 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the influence of the owners of the news source, [[concentration of media ownership]], the selection of staff, the preferences of an intended [[audience]], and pressure from [[advertiser]]s.

Bias has been a feature of the mass media since its birth with the invention of the [[printing press]]. The expense of early printing equipment restricted media production to a limited number of people. Historians have found that publishers often served the interests of powerful social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Heinrichs, ''The Printing Press (Inventions That Shaped the World)'', p. 53, Franklin Watts, 2005, {{ISBN|0-531-16722-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-531-16722-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Agenda setting====
{{main|Agenda-setting theory}}
Agenda setting describes the capacity of the media to focus on particular stories, if a news item is covered frequently and prominently, the audience will regard the issue as more important. That is, its [[Salience (language)#Public opinion|salience]] will increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCombs|first=M|author2=Reynolds, A|title=News influence on our pictures of the world|journal=Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gatekeeping====
{{main|Gatekeeping (communication)}}
Gatekeeping is the way in which information and news are filtered to the public, by each person or corporation along the way. It is the "process of culling and crafting countless bits of information into the limited number of messages that reach people every day, and it is the center of the media's role in modern public life. [...] This process determines not only which information is selected, but also what the content and nature of the messages, such as news, will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shoemaker|first=Pamela J.|title=Gatekeeping Theory|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415981392|author2=Vos, Tim P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sensationalism====

Sensationalism is when events and topics in news stories and pieces are overhyped to present skewed impressions of events, which may cause a misrepresentation of the truth of a story.&lt;ref name="fair"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120205021104/http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=7&amp;issue_area_id=49 "Issue Area: Sensationalism."] [[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting]].

===Other contexts===
====Educational bias====
{{main|Bias in education}}
Bias in education refers to real or perceived bias in the educational system. The content of school textbooks is often the issue of debate, as their target audience is young people, and the term "whitewashing" is used to refer to selective removal of critical or damaging evidence or comment.&lt;ref name="7forms"&gt;{{cite web | last = Sadker | first = David | title = Seven Forms of Bias in Instructional Materials | website = sadker.org | url = http://www.sadker.org/curricularbias.html | access-date = 3 September 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151021055904/http://www.sadker.org/curricularbias.html | archive-date = 21 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washpost"&gt;{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Valerie | title = Proposed Texas textbooks are inaccurate, biased and politicized, new report finds | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 12 September 2014 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/09/12/proposed-texas-textbooks-are-inaccurate-biased-and-politicized-new-report-finds/ | access-date = 3 September 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150908172705/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/09/12/proposed-texas-textbooks-are-inaccurate-biased-and-politicized-new-report-finds/ | archive-date = 8 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitewashhist"&gt;{{cite web | last = Czitrom | first = Daniel | title = Texas school board whitewashes history | website = cnn.com | publisher = CNN | date = 22 March 2010 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/03/18/czitrom.texas.textbooks/ | access-date = 3 September 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150328170047/http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/03/18/czitrom.texas.textbooks/ | archive-date = 28 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious bias in textbooks is observed in countries where religion plays a dominant role. There can be many forms of educational bias. Some overlooked aspects, occurring especially with the pedagogical circles of public and private schools—sources that are unrelated to fiduciary or mercantile impoverishment which may be unduly magnified—include teacher bias as well as a general bias against women who are going into STEM research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanmentalhealthfundation.org|title=How to Get Your Ex Boyfriend Back - Tips to Win Back His Love and Get Him Back|website=www.americanmentalhealthfundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Crisis Counseling with Children," Van Ornum and Murdock, 1990, NY: Crossroad/Continuum.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inductive bias====
{{main|Inductive bias}}
Inductive bias occurs within the field of [[machine learning]]. In machine learning one seeks to develop [[algorithm]]s that are able to ''learn'' to anticipate a particular output. To accomplish this, the learning algorithm is given training cases that show the expected connection. Then the learner is tested with new examples. Without further assumptions, this problem cannot be solved exactly as unknown situations may not be predictable.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1980 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DesJardinsandGordon1995&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DesJardins | first1 = M. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = D. F. | title = Evaluation and selection of biases in machine learning | series = Machine Learning Journal | volume = 5 | pages = 1–17 | year = 1995 | url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/article/desjardins95evaluation.html | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090116042751/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/article/desjardins95evaluation.html | archive-date = 2009-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inductive bias of the learning algorithm is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs given inputs that it has not encountered.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1980&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mitchell | first = T. M. | title = The need for biases in learning generalizations | place = New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA | publisher = Rutgers University | series = CBM-TR 5-110 | year = 1980 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.19.5466 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may bias the learner towards the correct solution, the incorrect, or be correct some of the time. A classical example of an inductive bias is [[Occam's Razor]], which assumes that the simplest consistent hypothesis is the best.

====Insider trading====
{{Main|Insider trading}}
Insider trading is the trading of a [[public company]]'s [[stock]] or other [[security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[bond (finance)|bonds]] or [[Option (finance)|stock options]]) by individuals with access to [[market moving information|non-public information]] about the company. In [[Insider trading#Legal differences among jurisdictions|various countries]], trading based on insider information is illegal because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information as the investor with insider information could potentially make far larger profits that a typical investor could make.

====Match fixing====
{{Main|Match fixing|Spot-fixing}}
In organized [[sports]], match fixing occurs when a match is played to a completely or partially pre-determined result, violating the rules of the game and often the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = match-fixing | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] dictionaries | url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/match-fixing | access-date = September 23, 2015 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150831115837/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/match-fixing | archive-date = August 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a variety of reasons for this, but the most common is in exchange for a payoff from gamblers. Players might also intentionally perform poorly to get an advantage in the future (such as a better [[draft pick]], or an easier opponent in a [[Playoffs|playoff]]), or to rig a [[handicap (sports)|handicap]] system. Match-fixing generally refers to fixing the final result of the game. Another form of match-fixing, known as [[spot-fixing]], involves fixing small events within a match which can be gambled upon, but which are unlikely to prove decisive in determining the final result of the game.

===Implicit bias===
{{main|implicit stereotype}}An '''implicit bias''', or '''implicit stereotype''', is the unconscious attribution of particular qualities to a member of a certain social group.&lt;ref name="GandB95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = A. G. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = M. R. | year = 1995 | title = Implicit social cognition: Attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 4–27 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4| pmid = 7878162 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.411.2919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implicit stereotypes are shaped by experience and based on learned associations between particular qualities and social categories, including race and/or gender. Individuals' perceptions and behaviors can be influenced by the implicit stereotypes they hold, even if they are unaware/unintentionally hold such stereotypes. Implicit bias is an aspect of implicit [[social cognition]]: the phenomenon that perceptions, attitudes, and stereotypes operate without conscious intention. The existence of implicit bias is supported by a variety of scientific articles in psychological literature. Implicit stereotype was first defined by psychologists [[Mahzarin Banaji]] and [[Anthony Greenwald]] in 1995.
