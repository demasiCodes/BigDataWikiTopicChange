In the first half of the [[twentieth century]], many such programs were instituted in many countries around the world, usually as part of [[eugenics]] programs intended to prevent the reproduction of members of the population considered to be carriers of undesirable [[Genetics|genetic]] traits. 

==Overview==
Usually such programs advocated sterilization by means of [[vasectomy]] in males and [[salpingectomy]] or [[tubal ligation]] in females, as they were not operations which significantly affected sexual drive or the personality of the individuals operated upon (unlike, for example, [[castration]]). It has been argued that this increased the seemingly innocuous nature of the operations, adding a veneer of scientific [[objectivity]] and detachment. Some of these operations were carried out not only against the will of the patient, but without their knowledge, at the same time as other operations. 

Today compulsory sterilization programs are usually seen as overly coercive and blunt attempts at [[genetic engineering]] which focused disproportionately on poor and disenfranchized groups. The most well-known compulsory sterilization programs were those of [[Nazi Germany]] (which sterilized over 400,000 individuals in the 1930s and 1940s), the [[United States]] (which sterilized over 64,000 individuals from 1900s through the 1970s), and many Scandinavian countries. Sweden sterlized the highest proportion of their own citizen, 62,000 individuals from the 1930s through the 1970s within the population of +6,000,000 where it was made condition for receiving welfare, release from institution or prisons or keeping custody of children.

Plans for forced sterilization for the purposes of avoiding [[overpopulation]] are sometimes, but not usually, directly related to a eugenic intent. (See [[population control]] for more information on this type of sterilization.)

==United States==
[[Image:Sterilization states.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A poster from a 1921 [[eugenics]] conference proudly displayed which U.S. states had by then implemented sterilization legislation.]]

The first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of eugenics was the [[United States]]. The principal targets of the American program were the [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] and the [[mental illness|mentally ill]], but also targeted under many state laws were the [[deaf]], the [[blindness|blind]], the [[epilepsy|epileptic]], and the physically deformed. [[Indigenous people of the United States|Native Americans]] were sterilized against their will in many states, often without their knowledge, while they were in a hospital for some other reason (e.g. after giving birth). Some sterilizations also took place in prisons and other penal institutions, targeting [[criminality]], but they were in the relative minority.  In the end, over 65,000 individuals were sterilized in 33 states under state compulsory sterilization programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;An overview of U.S. eugenics and sterilization is in [[Daniel Kevles]], ''In the name of eugenics: Genetics and the uses of human heredity'' (New York: Knopf, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first state to introduce compulsory sterilization legislation was [[Michigan]], in [[1897]] but the law failed to garner enough votes by legislators to be adopted. Eight years later [[Pennsylvania]]'s state legislators passed a sterilization that was vetoed by the governor. [[Indiana]] became the first state to enact sterilization legislation in [[1907]] followed closely by [[Washington]] and [[California]] in [[1909]]. Sterilization rates across the country were relatively low (California being the sole exception) until the [[1927]] [[Supreme Court]] case ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'' which legitimized the forced sterilization of patients at a [[Virginia]] home for the [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]]. The number of sterilizations performed per year increased until another Supreme Court case, ''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma]]'', [[1942]], complicated the legal situation by ruling against sterilization of criminals if the equal protection clause of the constitution was violated.  That is, if sterilization was to be performed, then it could not exempt white collar criminals.  &lt;ref&gt;On the legal history of eugenic sterilization in the U.S., see Paul Lombardo, "Eugenic Sterilization Laws," essay in the [http://www.eugenicsarchive.org Eugenics Archive], available online at http://www.eugenicsarchive.org/html/eugenics/essay8text.html.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most sterilization laws could be divided into three main categories of motivations: ''eugenic'' (concerned with heredity), ''therapeutic'' (part of an even-then obscure medical theory that sterilization would lead to vitality), or ''punitive'' (as a punishment for criminals), though of course these motivations could be combined in practice and theory (sterilization of criminals could be both punitive and eugenic, for example). ''Buck v. Bell'' asserted only that eugenic sterilization was constitutional, whereas ''Skinner v. Oklahoma'' ruled specifically against punitive sterilization, for example. Most operations only worked to prevent reproduction (such as severing the ''[[vas deferens]]'' in males), though some states ([[Oregon]] and [[North Dakota]] in particular) had laws which called for the use of [[castration]]. In general, most sterilizations were performed under ''eugenic'' statutes, in state-run psychiatric hospitals and homes for the mentally disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Reilly, ''The surgical solution: a history of involuntary sterilization in the United States'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; There was never a federal sterilization statute, though eugenicist [[Harry H. Laughlin]], whose state-level "Model Eugenical Sterilization Law" was the basis of the statute affirmed in ''Buck v. Bell'', proposed the structure of one in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;A copy of Harry Laughlin's "Model Eugenical Sterilization Law" (including the federal proposal) is available online at: http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~wellerst/laughlin/.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], public opinion towards eugenics and sterilization programs became more negative in the light of the connection with the [[genocide|genocidal]] policies of [[Nazi Germany]], though a significant number of sterilizations continued in a few states until the early 1960s. The [[Oregon]] Board of Eugenics, later renamed the Board of Social Protection, existed until 1983, with the last forcible sterilization occurring in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Sullivan, "State will admit sterilization past", ''Portland Oregonian'' (November 15, 2002). Available online at 
http://www.open.org/~people1/eugenics/eugenics_article_6.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[commonwealth]] [[Puerto Rico]] had a sterilization program as well. Some states continued to have sterilization laws on the books for much longer after that, though they were rarely if ever used. California sterilized more than any other state by a wide margin, and was responsible for over a third of all sterilization operations. Information about the California sterilization program was produced into book form and widely disseminated by eugenicists [[E.S. Gosney]] and [[Paul B. Popenoe]], which was said by the government of [[Adolf Hitler]] to be of key importance in proving that large-scale compulsory sterilization programs were feasible.&lt;ref&gt;On California sterilizations and their connection to the Nazi program, see: Stefan Kühl, ''The Nazi connection: Eugenics, American racism, and German National Socialism'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994); Alexandra Stern, ''Eugenic nation : faults and frontiers of better breeding in modern America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005); and Wendy Kline, ''Building a better race: gender, sexuality, and eugenics from the turn of the century to the baby boom'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the governors of many states have made public apologies for their past programs beginning with Virginia and followed by Oregon and California. None have offered to compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and would of course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, ''[[Poe v. Lynchburg Training School &amp; Hospital]]'' (1981), was filed in the courts on the grounds that the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing. However, the petitioners were granted some compensation as the stipulations of the law itself, which required informing the patients about their operations, had not been carried out in many cases.

==Germany==
:{{main|Nazi eugenics}}
[[Image:Wir stehen nicht allein.jpg|thumb|250px|"We do not stand alone": Nazi poster from 1936 with flags of other countries with compulsory sterilization legislation.]]

The most infamous sterilization program of the 20th century took place under the most infamous regime of the 20th century: the [[Third Reich]]. One of the first acts by [[Adolf Hitler]] after achieving total control over the [[Germany|German]] state was to pass the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (''Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses'') in July [[1933]]. The law was signed in by Hitler himself, and over 200 eugenic courts were created specifically as a result of the law. Under the German law, any doctor in the Reich was required to report patients of theirs who were [[mentally retarded]], [[mentally ill]] (including [[schizophrenia]] and [[manic depression]]), [[epilepsy|epileptic]], [[blindness|blind]], [[deafness|deaf]], or physically deformed, and a steep monetary penalty was imposed for any patients who were not properly reported. Individuals suffering from [[alcoholism]] or [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Chorea]] could also be sterilized. The individual's case was then presented in front of a court of [[Nazism|Nazi]] officials and public health officers who would review their medical records, take testimony from friends and colleagues, and eventually decide whether or not to order a sterilization operation performed on the individual, using force if necessary. Though not explicitly covered by the law, 400 mixed-race "[[Rhineland Bastard]]s" were also sterilized beginning in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Proctor, ''Racial hygiene: Medicine under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988), and Gisela Bock, "Nazi sterilization and reproductive policies" in Dieter Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine: creating the master race'' (Washington, D.C.: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of [[World War II]], over 400,000 individuals were sterilized under the German law and its revisions, most within its first four years of being enacted. When the issue of compulsory sterilization was brought up at the [[Nuremberg trials]] after the war, many Nazis defended their actions on the matter by indicating that it was the United States itself from whom they had taken inspiration. The Nazis had many other eugenics-inspired [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies]], including their [[T-4 Euthanasia Program|"euthanasia" program]] in which around 200,000 people institutionalized or suffering from birth defects were put to death.

==Canada==
{{unreferenced}}

Although far less well-known than the [[Nazi eugenics]] and [[United States|American]] eugenic sterilization programs, two Canadian provinces performed compulsory sterilization programs with eugenic aims. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgement]], and [[surgery]] as the American system. One notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.
===Alberta===
{{main|Alberta Eugenics Board}}
The most notorious sterilization program in Canadian history was afforded via the passing of the Alberta Sexual Sterilization Act of 1928. From the years 1928 to 1972, sterilizations, both compulsory and optional, were performed on "unfit" individuals of varying ages and ethnicities. In total, over 2800 procedures were performed. Initially, the act only provisioned sterilizations where consent was given by the subject or legal guardian of the subject, depending on the competency of the individual scheduled to undergo the operation. The 1937 amendment to the act allowed for sterilizations to be carried out without consent in the case of those deemed mentally defective. Sterilization of individuals deemed [[mentally ill]] still required consent. At the end of World War II, while other eugenic sterilization programs were being phased out, Alberta continued on, even increasing the scope of eligibility for sterilizations. They continued until 1972, when approximately 50 persons were operated upon.

===Targeted Sterilization?===
The eugenic programs of Nazi Germany and the United States are strongly suggestive of racial, religious, and cultural targeting in their victims. Not surprisingly, a statistical study done on sterilization victims in Alberta has yielded data supporting the theory that its sterilization program was biased as well. Minors, because of their legal dependency on adults, were almost always assigned as "mental defectives", thus bypassing the parental consent requirement. Albertan aboriginals and [[métis]], regardless of age, were also targeted. Aboriginal people represented only 2.5% of the general population in Alberta, but made up 6% of the institutionalized population. Towards the end of Alberta's sterilization program, aboriginals and métis made up 25% of the sterilizations performed. Furthermore, those of aboriginal ancestry were disproportionately assigned the "mentally deficient" rating, which denied them their legal rights and made them eligible to sterilization without consent. Women, particularly women who were young, poor, and unmarried, were also disproportionately represented; they were thought to be at high risk for prostitution or at the very least promiscuity, activities suspected of breeding further immorality. And while it was conceded that sterilization would not change the behavior of these women, it would prevent them from bearing similarly 'defective' progeny.

===Aftermath===
Despite the inaccuracy of IQ testing and tremendous grey area in classifying the mentally defective, nearly 3000 people were rendered sterile by the Sexual Sterilization Act. The true nature of the act was revealed when [[Leilani Muir]], a former inmate of the Michener Centre (also known as the Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives, PTS), discovered in [[1971]] that she had been sterilized. After being admitted to the PTS at age 10 as an unwanted and abused child, Leilani was given a substandard education. She was inaccurately designated a mentally defective [[moron]] (an individual with an IQ between 51 and 70), effectively nullifying her [[human rights]]. She was administered powerful antipsychotic agents without any due cause, as she had not manifested any symptoms of psychosis during her residency at the PTS. Eventually she was given an impromptu [[IQ test]], on which she scored a 64. Shortly thereafter, she was taken before the Eugenics Board, and sterilization was authorized pending her mother's consent (which was readily given).

In 1995, Leilani was awarded $750,000CDN and $230,000CDN in damages for her wrongful and humiliating labeling as a moron and her subsequent sterilization. Since the victory, another 1300 cases have been opened, several of them concerning inviduals who may have actual mental disabilities. It is unlikely they will be awarded any settlements based on stigmatization, but they may win suits based on involuntary sterilization, which is now considered [[Battery (crime)|battery]] under Canadian law.

===British Columbia===
As in other jurisdictions in the early 20th century, prejudice against physical and mental disability, and concern over societal costs of caring for the disabled, existed in British Columbia. The devaluing and eventual enmity to disabled life popularized rapidly, and spread from disabled children to disabled adults.

Additionally, the substantial immigration rate of the 1910s and 1920s spurred a feeling of [[xenophobia]] among the [[Protestant]], educated elite of British Columbia. Slavic immigrants in particular were accused of having very high incidence of undesired characteristics, which are now generally attributed to culture shock and language barriers. The aversion to "abnormal" or "strange" people coupled with the perceived societal drain caused by immigrants, the deformed, mentally ill, and mentally disabled created an environment conducive to the enactment of a sexual sterilization act.

Thus, in July 1933, five years after Alberta, British Columbia passed its own sexual sterilization act. A three member Eugenics Board comprised of a psychiatrist, a social worker, and a judge was given the duty of authorizing the sterilization of any institutionalized person who was deemed capable of propagating undesirable social characteristics. Since such social problems as criminality, prostitution, and addiction/alcoholism were believed to have a biological (and thus heritable) cause, almost any institutionalized individual could be found eligible. Although the records concerning BC's Sexual Sterilization Act have since been lost or destroyed, it is thought that only a few hundred individuals were operated upon before the law was silently repealed in 1973.

Canadian sterilization laws were only enacted in Alberta and British Columbia, which could be attributed to their Protestant denominations. [[Pope Pius XI]] of the [[Catholic Church]] denounced surgical intervention in reproductive matters, making the more Catholic regions (such as Ontario, Quebec, or the Maritime provinces) an inhospitable place to lobby for eugenic sterilization of the disabled. The introduction of progressive, left-leaning governments in Alberta and B.C. also had a hand in strengthening eugenic legislation. Left-leaning parties were eager to embrace new ideas, especially those that held a promise of economic turnaround. Additionally, it has been suggested that a Westernist attitude of self reliance resulted in the provinces hanging on to these policies in order to "stick to their guns" and appear strong and defiant in the face of the East.

===Aftermath===
After seeing a precendent set by Leilani Muir in her successful legal action against the government of Alberta, the British Columbia Public Guardian and Trustee filed similar lawsuits to protect the legal rights of the sterilized disabled. Thus far, 18 lawsuits have been filed against the government of British Columbia regarding the sterilization act. The suits allege that the sterilizations were involuntary, non-therapeutic, and that they were done for the convenience of the hospital. These lawsuits were filed in 2001, and since, several of the plaintiffs have died. In 2003, the cases were dismissed. Early in 2005, however, that judgement was overturned by the British Columbia Court of Appeal. In December of 2005, nine sterilized women were awarded compensation in an out-of-court settlement, totalling $450,000CDN ($50,000CDN per plaintiff).

===Beyond Alberta and British Columbia===
Although eugenic sterilization was never instituted in Ontario, the issue saw considerable debate concurrent with the enactment of sterilization laws in Alberta and British Columbia. The formation of the Eugenics Society of Canada (ESC) in 1930 sought to organize supporters of eugenics into a coherent group in order to make their lobbying of the government more effective. Founded in Ontario, the ESC boasted a large number of physicians in its ranks, including Clarence Hincks, one of the most devoted proponents of the Alberta Sexual Sterilization Act. Other notable members included the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, Dr. H. A. Bruce, and eminent psychiatrist Clarence B. Farrar, who had been head of the Toronto Psychiatric Hospital since [[1925]]. As social traits like criminality and promiscuity began to edge off the list of heritable traits, the ESC found itself adapting its strategy to that of birth control, while maintaining a focus on economic benefit. It garnered considerable support, but was never able to table eugenic sterilization effectively in the political arena. The ESC met its end shortly after a public relations blunder in 1938, when a representative implied the ESC and the Nazi party sought to achieve similar goals through similar means. It is not surprising then, that when World War II broke out in [[1939]], the ESC lost nearly all of its support.

Recent court discussions in [[Manitoba]] have investigated the legality and ethical permissibility of involuntary sterilization of the mentally disabled. Focusing on those individuals found legally incompetent, the [[1990]] and [[1992]] reports outlined the scenarios where an involuntary sterilization could be warranted.
As stated by the 1990 discussion, three conditions are necessary for an individual to undergo any medical procedure.
* The individual must be informed of both the nature, and risks/benefits of the procedure. &lt;BR&gt;
* The consent must be voluntary, not the product of coercion, threat, or fraud.
* The individual must be competent enough to give the above consent.&lt;BR&gt;

Individuals who are legally incompetent include minors and sufficiently-disabled adults.&lt;BR&gt;

The discussion reached a consensus that involuntary sterilization (or sterilization with substituted consent) is only permissible if it has an explicit positive effect on the physical or mental health of the individual: this is called therapeutic sterilization. One such case involved was a seriously disabled girl with an aversive phobia to blood, who was scheduled to undergo a hysterectomy. The rationale of the surgery was not eugenic, but rather to protect the girl from the direct mental trauma that would likely arise upon initiation of menses. This judgement was seen to be on the very threshold between therapeutic and nontherapeutic surgical intervention.

This discussion also cites a landmark case in substituted consent known as the Mrs. E. vs. Eve case. In it, a mother, "Mrs. E.", wished to have her moderately intellectually disabled daughter "Eve" sterilized to save her the emotional distress potentially caused by pregnancy and childbirth. Additionally, it was argued that Eve would neither be capable of using any other method of contraception, nor caring for a child should she become pregnant. Since the sterilization was not explicitly therapeutic and carried grave physical harm and an intrusion on Eve's rights, Mrs. E. could not be given the authority to have her daughter sterilized. It was then explored whether or not the government itself could make the decision, using &lt;i&gt;[[parens patriae]]&lt;/i&gt; jurisdiction. &lt;i&gt;Parens patriae&lt;/i&gt; allows the government to make authorizations in the "best interests" where no other source of consent can be attained; this includes children and mentally disabled persons. In the Eve case, the risks were deemed too high and the benefits too obscure to authorize a nontherapeutic sterilization via &lt;i&gt;parens patriae&lt;/i&gt; juristiction, since a surgical sterilization is an irreversible procedure.

==India &amp; China==
While India and China have not engaged in eugenic programs of sterilization, they did institute forcible or coercive family planning  regimes in order to control their exploding populations.

India's state of emergency between 1975 and 1977 included an infamous family planning initiative beginning April 1976, which involved the vasectomy of thousands of men and tubal ligation of women, either for payment or under coercive conditions. The son of then-Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Sanjay Gandhi]], was largely blamed for what turned out to be a failed program.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite news | title=The Indira enigma | date=May 11, 2001 | accessdate=July 28, 2006 | publisher=[[Frontline]] | url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1809/18090740.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong backlash against any initiative associated with family planning followed the highly controversial program, which continues into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite news | title=Male involvement and contraceptive methods for men | date=September 1996 | accessdate=July 28, 2006 | publisher=[[Frontline]] | url=http://www.malecontraceptives.org/articles/ringheim_article.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
In 1997 it was disclosed that [[Sweden]] had a strong sterilization program, sterilizing around 62,000 individuals over a period of 40 years until 1976. The program was meant primarily to prevent mental illness and disease, and was thus supported by the government, but as in Canada and the US, racial politics also became involved, as there was a strong belief in the connection between race and genetic integrity among leading scientists and those carrying out the sterilizations. In the later decades it was primarily the mentally ill who were forcibly sterilized. The Swedish state subsequently paid out damages to those who were sterilized.

==Other countries==
Eugenics programs including forced sterilization existed in most Northern European countries, as well as other more or less Protestant countries. Some programs, such as Canada's and Sweden's, lasted well into the 1970s. Other countries that had notably active sterilization programs include [[Australia]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Iceland]], and some countries in [[Latin America]] (including [[Panama]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Broberg and Nils Roll-Hansen, eds., ''Eugenics And the Welfare State: Sterilization Policy in Demark, Sweden, Norway, and Findland'' (Michigan State University Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Home Secretary]] [[Winston Churchill]] introduced a bill that included forced sterilization. Writer [[G.K. Chesterton]] led a successful effort to defeat that clause of the 1913 Mental Deficiency Act. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has been a notable opponent of eugenics and sterilization programs. In [[Peru]], former president [[Alberto Fujimori]] (1990-2000) pressured 200,000 indigenous people in rural areas (mainly [[Quechua]]s and [[Aymara]]s) into being sterilized &lt;ref&gt; {{Cite news | title=Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru | date=July 24, 2002 | accessdate=April 30, 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm}} &lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, forced sterlization and sometimes forced abortion were routine in Leper colonies, long after treatments for Hansen Disease had been established. There are also a number of testimonies stating that newborn babies were killed shortly after birth. 

The [[Soviet Union]] imposed forced sterilization on female workers deported from [[Romania]] to Soviet labor camps. This occurred after [[World War II]], when [[Romania]] was supposed to supply reconstruction workforce (according to the armistice convention).&lt;ref&gt;A link to the testimony of such a deportee [http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol_44654/comunism___dora_dumitru__sterilizata_in_deportarea_din_urss.html] (in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]] and [[China]] have also at various times implemented sterilization campaigns as a [[population control]] policy, though only the latter has made any previous overtures towards any potential eugenic motivations.
