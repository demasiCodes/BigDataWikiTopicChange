'''Compulsory sterilization''', also known as '''forced''' or '''coerced sterilization''', is a government-mandated program to [[Involuntary treatment|involuntarily]] [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilize]] a specific group of people. Sterilization removes a person's capacity to reproduce, and is usually done through surgical procedures. Several countries implemented sterilization programs in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Webster University, Forced Sterilization.

==Affected populations==
Governmental family planning programs emerged in the late 19th century and have continued to progress through the 21st century. During this time, feminists began advocating for reproductive choice, but eugenicists and hygienists were advocating for low income and disabled peoples to be sterilized or have their fertility tightly regulated in order to "clean" or "perfect" nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population and Reproductive Rights: Feminists Perspectives from the South|last=Correa|first=Sonia|publisher=Zed Books Ltd|year=1994|isbn=978-1856492843|location=London|page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dbzfZ5EDLsC&amp;pg=PA11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pregnancy and Power: A Short History of Reproductive Politics in America|last=Solinger|first=Rickie|publisher=New York University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0814798287|location=New York|page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ngTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second half of the 20th century saw national governments uptake of neo-Malthusian ideology that directly linked population growth to increased (and uncontrollable) poverty, which during the embrace of capitalism, meant that countries were unable to economically develop due to this poverty.{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}}

Much of these governmental population control programs were focused on using sterilization as the main avenue to reduce high birth rates, even though public acknowledgement that sterilization made an impact on the population levels of the developing world is still widely lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Matters of Choice: Puerto Rican Women's Struggle for Reproductive Freedom|last=Lopez|first=Iris|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0813543734|location=New Brunswick|page=xiii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pGzdr4r1pMMC&amp;pg=PR13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early population programs of the 20th century were marked as part of the eugenics movement, with [[Nazi eugenics|Nazi Germany's programs]] providing the most well-known examples of sterilization of disabled people, paired with encouraging ethnic Germans who fit the "[[Aryan race]]" phenotype to rapidly reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Polish Doctor in the Nazi Camps: My Mother's Memories of Imprisonment, Immigration, and a Life Remade|last=Rylko-Bauer|first=Barbara |author-link=Barbara Rylko-Bauer |publisher=University of Oklahoma |year=2014 |isbn= 978-0806145860|pages=91–92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VrqAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, population control programs focused on the "third world" to help curtail over population of poverty areas that were beginning to "develop" (Duden 1992).

As of 2013, 24 countries in Europe required sterilization for legal gender recognition and 16 countries did not provide for any possibility to change legal gender at all, which meant that transgender people could have challenges applying for jobs, opening bank accounts, boarding planes, or may not be able to do these things at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2013-05-17|title=24 Countries in Europe Require Sterilization of Trans People|url=https://tgeu.org/24-countries-in-europe-still-require-sterilization-from-trans-people/|access-date=2022-01-04|website=TGEU|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report references the involuntary sterilization of a number of specific population groups. They include:

* Women, especially in relation to coercive population control policies, and particularly including women living with [[HIV]], indigenous and ethnic minority girls and women. Indigenous and ethnic minority women often face "wrongful stereotyping based on gender, race and ethnicity".
** Funding of mothers on welfare by HEW (Health, Education, and Welfare) covers roughly 90% of cost and doctors are likely to concur with the compulsory sterilization of mothers on welfare.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dear Sisters|last1=Baxandall|first1=Rosalyn|last2=Gordon|first2=Linda|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0-465-01707-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dearsistersdispa0000unse/page/151 151–152]|url=https://archive.org/details/dearsistersdispa0000unse/page/151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to cease welfare occur when women are hesitant to consent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Disabled people]], especially those with [[intellectual disability]]. Women with intellectual disabilities are "often treated as if they have no control, or should have no control, over their sexual and reproductive choices". Other rationales include menstrual management for "women who have or are perceived to have difficulties coping with or managing menses, or whose health conditions (such as epilepsy) or behaviour are negatively affected by menses." Men with intellectual disabilities are also sterilized, sometimes using the justification that it provides greater sexual freedom.&lt;ref name="Barton-Hanson 2015 pp. 49–73"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barton-Hanson | first=Renu | title=Sterilization of men with intellectual disabilities | journal=Medical Law International | publisher=Sage Publications | volume=15 | issue=1 | year=2015 | issn=0968-5332 | doi=10.1177/0968533215592444 | pages=49–73| s2cid=146218981 | url=https://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/17519/1/Sterilisation%20of%20men%20with%20intellectual%20disability%20EPRINT%20FINAL.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Intersex]] persons, who "are often subjected to cosmetic and other non-medically indicated surgeries performed on their reproductive organs, without their [[informed consent]] or that of their parents, and without taking into consideration the views of the children involved", often as a "sex-normalizing" treatment.
* [[Transgender]] persons, "as a prerequisite to receiving gender-affirmative treatment and gender-marker changes".

The report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies.&lt;ref name="who-2014" /&gt;

== As a part of human population planning ==
Human population planning is the practice of artificially altering the rate of growth of a human population. Historically, human population planning has been implemented by limiting the population's [[birth rate]], usually by government mandate, and has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of [[poverty]], [[carrying capacity|environmental concerns]], religious reasons, and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. While population planning can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, some programs have exposed them to exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |title=Interact Worldwide Downloads |publisher=Interact Worldwide |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115221710/http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |archive-date=15 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===

[[Bangladesh]] has a long-running government-operated civilian sterilization program as a part of its population control policy, which targets mainly poor women and men. The government offers 2,000 [[Bangladeshi taka|Bangladeshi Taka]] (US$24) for women who are persuaded to undergo [[tubal ligation]] and for men who are persuaded to undergo [[vasectomy]]. Women are also offered a [[sari]] and men are offered a [[kurta]] to wear for undergoing sterilization. The referrer, who persuades the woman or man to undergo sterilization gets 300 Bangladeshi Taka (US$3.60).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd/site/field_office/3354b838-2016-11e7-8f57-286ed488c766|title=পরিবার পরিকল্পনা {{!}} উত্তরখান ইউনিয়ন {{!}} উত্তরখান ইউনিয়ন|website=uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112185603/http://uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd/site/field_office/3354b838-2016-11e7-8f57-286ed488c766|archive-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the targeted number of sterilizations per month was 600–1,000 in contrast to the insertion of 25,000 [[IUDs]], which was increased in 1978 to about 50,000 sterilizations per month on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=AR|first1=Khan|last2=I|first2=Swenson|date=1978|title=Acceptability of male sterilization in Bangladesh: its problems and perspectives|url=https://www.popline.org/node/444385|journal=Bangladesh Development Studies|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113002952/https://www.popline.org/node/444385|archive-date=2017-11-13|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 50% rise in the amount paid to men coincided with a doubling of the number of vasectomies between 1980 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=L|first1=Liskin|last2=JM|first2=Pile|last3=WF|first3=Quillan|date=1983|title=Vasectomy—safe and simple|url=https://www.popline.org/node/402465|journal=Population Reports.

One study conducted in 1977, when incentives were only equivalent to US$1.10 (at that time), indicated that between 40% and 60% of the men chose vasectomy because of the payment, who otherwise did not have any serious urge to get sterilized.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Khan|first1=Atiqur Rahman|last2=Swenson|first2=Ingrid E.|last3=Rahman|first3=Azizur|date=1979-01-01|title=A Follow-up of Vasectomy Clients in Rural Bangladesh|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=11–14|doi=10.1002/j.1879-3479.1979.tb00108.x|issn=1879-3479|pmid=39831|s2cid=22375165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 1982, Bangladesh's military ruler [[Lieutenant general (Bangladesh)|Lieutenant General]] [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] launched a two-year mass sterilization program for Bangladeshi women and men. About 3,000 women and men were planned to be sterilized on 16 December 1982 (the opening day). Ershad's government trained 1,200 doctors and 25,000 field workers who must conduct two tubal ligations and two vasectomies each month to earn their salaries. The government wanted to persuade 1.4 million people, both women and men to undergo sterilization within two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/14/The-Bangladesh-government-plans-a-mass-voluntary-sterilization-of/3265408690000/|title=The Bangladesh government plans a mass voluntary sterilization of...|work=UPI|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113002940/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/14/The-Bangladesh-government-plans-a-mass-voluntary-sterilization-of/3265408690000/|archive-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; One population control expert called it 'the largest sterilization program in the world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/15/Impoverished-Bangladesh-plans-sterilization-program/6350408776400/|title=Impoverished Bangladesh plans sterilization program|work=UPI|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112185727/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/15/Impoverished-Bangladesh-plans-sterilization-program/6350408776400/|archive-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1983, 40,000 government field workers were employed in Bangladesh's 65,000 villages to persuade women and men to undergo sterilization and to promote usage of birth-control across the country.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Food subsidies under the group feeding program (VGF) were given to only those women with certificates showing that they had undergone tubal ligation.&lt;ref&gt;Miles and Shiva 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1977 study, a one-year follow-up of 585 men sterilized at vasectomy camps in Shibpur and Shalna in rural Bangladesh showed that almost half of the men were dissatisfied with their vasectomies.{{fact|date=September 2023}}

58% of the men said their ability to work had decreased in the last year. 2–7% of the men said their sexual performance decreases. 30.6% of the Shibpur and 18.9% of the Shalna men experienced severe pain during the vasectomy. The men also said they had not received all of the incentives they had been promised.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to another study on 5042 women and 264 men who underwent sterilization, complications such as painful urination, shaking chills, fever for at least two days, frequent urination, bleeding from the incision, sore with pus, stitches or skin breaking open, weakness and [[dizziness]] arose after the sterilization.{{fact|date=September 2023}}

The person's sex, the sponsor and workload in the sterilization center, and the dose of [[sedative]]s administered to women were significantly associated with specific postoperative complaints. Five women died during the study, resulting in a death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 tubectomies (tubal ligations); four deaths were due to [[respiratory arrest]] caused by overuse of sedatives. The death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 tubectomies (tubal ligation) in this study is similar to the 10.0 deaths/10,000 cases estimated on the basis of a 1979 follow-up study in an Indian female sterilization camp. The presence of a complaint before the operation was generally a good predictor of postoperative complaints. Centers performing fewer than 200 procedures were associated with more complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=M. J.|last2=Rochat|first2=R.

According to another study based on 20 sterilization-attributable deaths in [[Dacca Division|Dacca]] (now Dhaka) and [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]] Divisions in Bangladesh, from 1 January 1979, to 31 March 1980, overall, the sterilization-attributable death-to-case rate was 21.3 deaths/100,000 sterilizations. The death rate for vasectomy was 1.6 times higher than that for tubal ligation. [[Anesthesia]] overdosage was the leading cause of death following tubal ligation along with [[tetanus]] (24%), where intraperitoneal hemorrhage (14%), and infection other than tetanus (5%) was other leading causes of death.{{fact|date=September 2023}}

Two women (10%) died from [[pulmonary embolism]] after tubal ligation; one (5%) died from each of the following: [[anaphylaxis]] from anti-tetanus serum, [[heat stroke]], [[small bowel obstruction]], and aspiration of vomitus. All seven men died from scrotal infections after vasectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=D. A.|last2=Peterson|first2=H. B.|last3=Rosenberg|first3=M. J.|last4=Fishburne|first4=J.

According to a second epidemiologic investigation of deaths attributable to sterilization in Bangladesh, where all deaths resulting from sterilizations performed nationwide between 16 September 1980 and 15 April 1981, were investigated and analyzed, nineteen deaths from tubal ligation were attributed to 153,032 sterilizations (both tubal ligation and vasectomy), for an overall death-to-case rate of 12.4 deaths per 100,000 sterilizations. This rate was lower than that (21.3) for sterilizations performed in Dacca (now Dhaka) and Rajshahi Divisions from 1 January 1979 to 31 March 1980, although this difference was not statistically significant. Anesthesia overdosage, tetanus, and [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding) were the leading causes of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=D. A.|last2=Satterthwaite|first2=A.

Bangladesh is planning to introduce a sterilization program in its overcrowded [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee camps, where nearly a million refugees are fighting for space, after efforts to encourage birth control failed. Since 25 August 2017, more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from [[Rakhine State|Rakhine state]], [[Myanmar]] to neighboring Bangladesh, which is a Muslim majority country, following a military crackdown against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine. Sabura, a Rohingya mother of seven, said her husband believed the couple could support a large family.

"I spoke to my husband about birth control measures. But he is not convinced. He was given two condoms but he did not use them," she said. "My husband said we need more children as we have land and property (in Rakhine). We don't have to worry to feed them."

District family planning authorities have managed to distribute just 549 packets of condoms among the refugees, amid reports they are reluctant to use them. They have asked the government to approve a plan to provide vasectomies for men and tubectomies (tubal ligation) for women in the camps.

One volunteer, Farhana Sultana, said the women she spoke to believed birth control was a sin and others saw it as against the tenets of Islam.

Bangladeshi officials say about 20,000 Rohingya refugee women are pregnant and 600 have given birth since arriving in the country, but this may not be accurate as many births take place without formal medical help.

Every month 250 Bangladeshis undergo sterilization routinely under the government's sterilization program in the border district of [[Cox's Bazar District|Cox's Bazar]], where the Rohingya refugee Muslims have taken shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|title=Bangladesh to offer sterilisation to Rohingya in refugee camps|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=2017-10-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104150415/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|archive-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|title=Bangladesh 'plans to offer to sterilise Rohingya Muslims' as refugee population grows|date=2017-10-29|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113003155/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|archive-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Compulsory sterilization in Canada}}

Two Canadian provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]) performed compulsory sterilization programs in the 20th century with eugenic aims. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system. However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.

The ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' of Alberta was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir's case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|title=Alberta Apologizes for Forced Sterilization|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|access-date=19 June 2013|date=9 November 1999|work=[[CBC News]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123020740/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|archive-date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1VoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397%2C1039102 |title=Victims of sterilization finally get day in court.

In the 20th century, the eugenics movement grew in Canada, using forced sterilization as a method to control indigenous populations, alongside the [[Indian Act]] of 1876.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Indigenous Women in Canada Are Still Being Sterilized Without Their Consent|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/9keaev/indigenous-women-in-canada-are-still-being-sterilized-without-their-consent|access-date=2021-04-07|website=www.vice.com|date=9 September 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-native physicians worked in the health system created for the native population and were encouraged to carry out sterilizations as a form of family planning.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; From the 1960s to the 1980s, aboriginal birth rate fell from 47% to 28%, and sterilization laws began to be repealed in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; However, Indigenous women have come forward to report instances of coerced sterilization into 2018.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Attorney Alisa Lombard has led several lawsuits on behalf of these Indigenous women with the support of the International Justice Resource Center (IJRC).&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2018-04-30|title=Forced Sterilization of Indigenous Women in Canada|url=https://ijrcenter.org/forced-sterilization-of-indigenous-women-in-canada/|access-date=2021-04-07|website=International Justice Resource Center|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IJRC has noted the extent of the modern-day sterilization is unknown due to the lack of extensive investigation.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; After the Canadian government was publicly questioned by the UN regarding its involvement, it pledged to share any documentation of these events in its possession.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;

===China===
{{See also|One-child policy|Two-child policy}}

In 1978, Chinese authorities became concerned with the possibility of a baby boom that the country could not handle, and they initialized the [[one-child policy]]. In order to effectively deal with the complex issues surrounding childbirth, the Chinese government placed great emphasis on family planning. Because this was such an important matter, the government thought it needed to be standardized, and so to this end laws were introduced in 2002.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Thousands at risk of forced sterilization in China | date=22 April 2010 | access-date=9 April 2012 | publisher=[[Amnesty International]] | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314193515/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | archive-date=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws uphold the basic tenets of what was previously put into practice, outlining the rights of the individuals and outlining what the Chinese government can and cannot do to enforce policy.

However, accusations have been raised from groups such as [[Amnesty International]], who have claimed that practices of compulsory sterilization have been occurring for people who have already reached their one child quota.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International" /&gt; These practices run contrary to the stated principles of the law, and seem to differ on a local level.

The Chinese government appears to be aware of these discrepancies in policy implementation on a local level. For example, The National Population and Family Planning Commission put forth in a statement that, "Some persons concerned in a few counties and townships of Linyi did commit practices that violated law and infringed upon legitimate rights and interests of citizens while conducting family planning work." This statement comes in reference to some charges of forced sterilization and abortions in Linyi city of Shandong Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=China acts on forced abortion | date=20 September 2005 | access-date=9 April 2012 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210000256/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | archive-date=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy requires a "social compensation fee" for those who have more than the legal number of children.

[[Czechoslovakia]] carried out a policy to sterilize some [[Romani people|Romani]] women, starting in 1973. In some cases the sterilization was in exchange for social welfare benefits, and those affected were given written agreements describing what was to be done to them which they were unable to read due to illiteracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6409699.stm Sterilized Roma accuse Czechs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915024859/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6409699.stm |date=2017-09-15 }}, [[BBC]], 12 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The dissidents of the [[Charter 77|Charter 77 movement]] denounced these practices in 1977–78 as a [[genocide]], but they continued through the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsdesk.org/2006/06/12/for_gypsies_eug/ For Gypsies, Eugenics is a Modern Problem – Czech Practice Dates to Soviet Era] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016031746/http://newsdesk.org/2006/06/12/for_gypsies_eug/ |date=2015-10-16 }}, [[Newsdesk]], 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 report by the Czech government's independent ombudsman, [[Otakar Motejl]], identified dozens of cases of coercive sterilization between 1979 and 2001, and called for criminal investigations and possible prosecution against several health care workers and administrators, re Law on Atrocities relevant pre-1990, CR (ChR).&lt;ref name=Czech&gt;[http://www.ochrance.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/ENGLISH/Sterilisation.pdf Final Statement of the Public Defender of Rights in the Matter of Sterilisations Performed in Contravention of the Law and Proposed Remedial Measures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809003521/http://www.ochrance.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/ENGLISH/Sterilisation.pdf |date=2014-08-09 }}, Czech government, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colombia ===
The time period of 1964–1970 started Colombia's population policy development, including the foundation of PROFAMILIA and through the Ministry of Health the family planning program promoted the use of IUDs, the Pill, and sterilization as the main avenues for contraception. By 2005, Colombia had one of the world's highest contraceptive usage rates at 76.9%, with female sterilization being the highest percentage of use at just over 30% (second highest is the IUD at around 12% and the pill around 10%)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the Odds: Colombia's Role in the Family Planning Revolution|last=Measham and Lopez-Escobar|first=Anthony, Guillermo|publisher=World Bank Publisher|year=2007|pages=121–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Measham and Lopez-Escobar 2007). In Colombia during the 1980s, sterilization was the second most popular choice of pregnancy prevention (after the Pill), and public healthcare organizations and funders (USAID, AVSC, IPPF) supported sterilization as a way to decrease abortions rates. While not directly forced into sterilization, women of lower socio-economic standing had significantly less options to afford family planning care as sterilizations were subsidized.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reproductive Rights and Wrongs: The Global Politics of Population Control|last=Hartmann|first=Betsy|publisher=Haymarket Books|year=2016|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first acts by [[Adolf Hitler]] after the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] gave him de facto legal dictatorship over the [[Germany|German]] state was to pass the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (''Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses'') in July 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jkswAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3703%2C266241 |title=Eugenics Courts Named in Reich.

Under it, all doctors in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] were required to report any patients of theirs who were deemed [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], characterized [[mentally ill]] (including [[schizophrenia]] and [[manic depression]]), [[epilepsy|epileptic]], blind, deaf, or physically deformed, and a steep monetary penalty was imposed for any patients who were not properly reported. Individuals with [[alcoholism]] or [[Huntington's disease]] could also be sterilized. The individual's case was then presented in front of a court of [[Nazism|Nazi]] officials and public health officers who would review their medical records, take testimony from friends and colleagues, and eventually decide whether or not to order a sterilization operation performed on the individual, using force if necessary. Though not explicitly covered by the law, 400 mixed-race "[[Rhineland Bastard]]s" were also sterilized beginning in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Proctor, ''Racial hygiene: Medicine under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988), and Gisela Bock, "Nazi sterilization and reproductive policies" in Dieter Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine: creating the master race'' (Washington, D.C.: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zzsbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=50wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1710,6396277|title=The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339243252_From_Kraepelin_to_Karadzic_Psychiatry%27s_Long_Road_to_Genocide] "From Kraepelin to Karadzic: Psychiatry's Long Road to Genocide"  Author Robert Kaplan.

By the end of [[World War II]], over 400,000 individuals were sterilized under the German law and its revisions, most within its first four years of being enacted. When the issue of compulsory sterilization was brought up at the [[Nuremberg trials]] after the war, many Nazis defended their actions on the matter by indicating that it was the United States itself from whom they had taken inspiration. The Nazis had many other eugenics-inspired [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies]], including their [[T-4 Euthanasia Programme|"euthanasia" programme]] in which around 70,000 people institutionalized or with birth defects were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', Chapter VI, first section (London, 1991, rev. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guatemala ===
Guatemala is one country that resisted family planning programs, largely due to lack of governmental support, including [[Guatemalan Civil War|civil war]] strife, and strong opposition from both the Catholic Church and Evangelical Christians until 2000, and as such, has the lowest prevalence of contraceptive usage in Latin America. In the 1980s, the archbishop of the country accused USAID of mass sterilizations of women without consent, but a President Reagan backed commission found the allegations to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guatemala: The Pioneering Days of the Family Planning Movement|last=Santiso-Galvez and Bertrand|first=Roberto; Jane T.|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2007|pages=137–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President reacted favorably and sent the bill back to the Maharashtra government with suggested amendments that would be necessary for an enactment, but before the measure could be passed, new elections were called and the legislation was not passed.&lt;ref&gt;Leela Visaria and Rajani R.

According to [[Human Rights Law Network]]:{{blockquote|In September 2016, the Supreme Court of India directed the Union Government to ensure the discontinuation of 'sterilization camps' within the following three years and to induce the state governments to follow suit. It also charged the government to ensure proper monitoring of the programme, investigate sterilization failures, complications or deaths, and increase the compensation amount in these cases. It further ordered the implementation of established legal, medical and technical standards for sterilization [...] Women were made to lay on bare mattresses for the surgeries, with no post-surgery recuperation facilities. Often the women were made to wait up to five hours after registering, and by the time they reached the operating table their an aesthetic would have worn off. In places like Bhubaneshwar, Odisha and Ferozpur, Uttar Pradesh, the doctors conducting surgeries would use bicycle pumps instead of an insufflator, to introduce air into the women's abdomens (as reported by Shreelatha Menon). The doctor in Bhubaneshwar stated that he had done over 60,000 tubectomies and many of them with bicycle pumps. In Kaparfora, Bihar, a woman was operated upon, even though she was pregnant, and suffered a miscarriage as a result. [...] Today, while laws may not announce eugenic aims, hidden agenda to dispose of "undesirables" in society can still be discovered by looking beyond the face of the law. While many population control policies may appear benign on their face, upon further investigation the stated medical reasons for sterilization and the identification of groups to which the law applies are revealed to be morally and legally suspect. For example, compulsory sterilization law laws often target LGBT+ people, especially transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Mistreatment and Coercion: Unethical Sterilization in India|url=https://hrln.org/uploads/2018/10/Mistreatment-and-Coercion-Unethical-Sterilization-in-India.pdf |website=Human Rights Law Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{long quote|date=October 2023}}}}

===Kenya===
In Kenya, HIV was considered an ongoing issue, and the governor believed that compulsory sterilization of women infected with HIV could stop the spread of the virus. In 2012, a report titled "Robbed of Choice" sparked outrage. The report outlined the experiences of 40 women infected with HIV that had been sterilized against their will. 5 of the 40 women filed a lawsuit against the government of Kenya, claiming violations of their Health and Human Rights.&lt;ref name="hhrjournal.org"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Boston|first1=677 Huntington Avenue|last2=Ma 02115 +1495‑1000|date=2015-07-16|title=High Court of Kenya to Address Forced Sterilization of HIV-Positive Women and Collection of Names of People Living With HIV|url=https://www.hhrjournal.org/2015/07/kenya-forced-sterilization-hiv/|access-date=2021-04-09|website=Health and Human Rights|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boston"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Boston|first1=677 Huntington Avenue|last2=Ma 02115 +1495‑1000|date=2015-07-21|title=Kenya, Forced Sterilization, &amp; Women with HIV|url=https://fxb.harvard.edu/2015/07/21/kenya-forced-sterilization-and-women-with-hiv/|access-date=2022-01-04|website=FXB Center for Health &amp; Human Rights {{!}} Harvard University|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the women who were sterilized knew nothing about the procedure or its consequences, which was one reason they did not push the issue.

===Mexico===
Civil Society Organizations such as Balance, Promocion para el Desarrollo y Juventud, A.C., have received in the last years numerous testimonies of women living with HIV in which they inform that misinformation about the virus transmission has frequently lead to compulsory sterilization. Although there is enough evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed to reduce mother-to-child transmission risks, there are records of HIV-positive women forced to undergo sterilization or have agreed to be sterilized without adequate and sufficient information about their options."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres.

In addition, most of these women reported that health providers told them that living with HIV cancelled their right to choose the number and spacing of the children they want to have as well as the right to choose the contraceptive method of their choice; provided misleading information about the consequences for their health and that of their children and denied them access to treatments that reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission in order to coerce them into sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres.

{{Further|Forced sterilization in Peru}}
{{see also|Plan Verde}}
In [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of the ''[[Programa Nacional de Población]]'', a sterilization program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news | title=Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | date=24 July 2002 | access-date=30 April 2006 | work=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630062037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | archive-date=30 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous people]] (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented on 28 July 1995. The plan was principally financed using funds from [[USAID]] (36 million dollars), the [[Nippon Foundation]], and later, the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA).&lt;ref name=Diplo&gt;[http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 Stérilisations forcées des Indiennes du Pérou] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510120620/http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 |date=2014-05-10 }}, ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September 1995, Fujimori presented a Bill that would revise the "General Law of Population", in order to allow sterilization. Several contraceptive methods were also legalized, all measures that were strongly opposed by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], as well as the Catholic organization [[Opus Dei]]. In February 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) itself congratulated Fujimori on his success in controlling demographic growth.&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt;

On 25 February 1998, a representative for USAID testified before the U.S. government's [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Committee on International Relations]], to address controversy surrounding Peru's program. He indicated that the government of Peru was making important changes to the program, in order to:

* Discontinue their campaigns in tubal ligations and vasectomies.
* Make clear to health workers that there are no provider targets for voluntary surgical contraception or any other method of contraception.
* Implement a comprehensive monitoring program to ensure compliance with family planning norms and informed consent procedures.
* Welcome Ombudsman Office investigations of complaints received and respond to any additional complaints that are submitted as a result of the public request for any additional concerns.
* Implement a 72-hour "waiting period" for people who choose tubal ligation or vasectomy. This waiting period will occur between the second counseling session and surgery.
* Require health facilities to be certified as appropriate for performing surgical contraception as a means to ensure that no operations are done in makeshift or substandard facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USAID Testimony: House International Relations Committee, Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, 2/25/98|url=http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|publisher=USAID|access-date=23 August 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906034940/http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|archive-date=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2001, Minister of Health [[Luis Solari De La Fuente|Luis Solari]] launched a special commission into the activities of the voluntary surgical contraception, initiating a parliamentary commission tasked with inquiring into the "irregularities" of the program, and to put it on an acceptable footing. In July 2002, its final report ordered by the Minister of Health revealed that between 1995 and 2000, 331,600 women were sterilized, while 25,590 men submitted to vasectomies.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt; The plan, which had the objective of diminishing the number of births in areas of poverty within Peru, was essentially directed at the indigenous people living in deprived areas (areas often involved in internal conflicts with the Peruvian government, as with the [[Shining Path]] guerilla group). Deputy Dora Núñez Dávila made the accusation in September 2003 that 400,000 indigenous people were sterilized during the 1990s. Documents proved that President Fujimori was informed, each month, of the number of sterilizations done, by his former Ministers of Health, Eduardo Yong Motta (1994–96), Marino Costa Bauer (1996–1999) and [[Alejandro Aguinaga]] (1999–2000).&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt; A study by sociologist {{ill|Giulia Tamayo León|es}}, ''Nada Personal'' (in English: Nothing Personal), showed that doctors were required to meet quotas. According to ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', "tubal ligation festivals" were organized through program publicity campaigns, held in the ''[[pueblos jóvenes]]'' (in English: shantytowns). In 1996 there were, according to official statistics, 81,762 tubal ligations performed on women, with a peak being reached the following year, with 109,689 ligatures, then only 25,995 in 1998.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

On 21 October 2011, Peru's Attorney General José Bardales decided to reopen an investigation into the cases, which had been halted in 2009 under the statute of limitations, after the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] ruled that President Fujimori's sterilization program involved crimes against humanity, which are not time-limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 Thousands of Forced Sterilization Cases Reopened in Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235249/http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 |date=2014-04-26 }} Impunity Watch, published 14 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2021-03-01|title=Peru forced sterilisations case reaches key stage|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56201575|access-date=2022-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear as to any progress in matter of the execution (debido ejecución sumaria) of the suspect in the course of any proof of their relevant accusations in the legal sphere of the constituted people in vindication of the rights of the people of South America.

[[Reginald McKenna]], who succeeded Churchill as Home Secretary, introduced the [[Feeble-Minded Control Bill]], a bill that would enact forcible sterilization of such individuals; the bill gained the support of the [[Church of England|Anglican]] archbishops of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]], that included forced sterilization. Despite support for the bill by the Anglican [[Primates in the Anglican Communion|primates]], English writer [[G. K. Chesterton]] and the [[Catholic Church in the United Kingdom]] led a successful effort to defeat that clause's inclusion in what would eventually become the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913|1913 Mental Deficiency Act]], though the final act did create a scheme for state-enforced [[Involuntary commitment|confinement of mentally disabled persons]] in specialized institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Martin.

In one specific case in 2015, the [[Court of Protection]] of the [[United Kingdom]] ruled that a woman with six children and an IQ of 70 should be sterilized for her own safety because another pregnancy would have been a "significantly life-threatening event" for her and the fetus and was not related to eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=James Gallagher |date=4 February 2015 |title=Mother of six 'can be sterilised' – court ruling |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-31128969 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208051831/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-31128969 |archive-date=8 February 2015 |access-date=12 February 2015 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Progressive Era]] ({{circa|1890}} to 1920), the United States was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Iredale |first=Rachel |year=2000 |title=Eugenics And Its Relevance To Contemporary Health Care |journal=Nursing Ethics |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=205–14 |doi=10.1177/096973300000700303 |pmid=10986944 |s2cid=37888613}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas C. Leonard]], professor at Princeton University, describes American eugenics and sterilization as ultimately rooted in economic arguments and further as a central element of Progressivism alongside wage controls, restricted immigration, and the introduction of [[pension]] programs.&lt;ref name="Leonard2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leonard |first=Thomas C. |year=2005 |title=Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era |url=https://www.princeton.edu/%7Etleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf |url-status=live |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=207–224 |doi=10.1257/089533005775196642 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218214328/http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf |archive-date=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heads of the programs were avid proponents of eugenics and frequently argued for their programs which achieved some success nationwide mainly in the first half of the 20th century.

Eugenics had two essential components. First, its advocates accepted as axiomatic that a range of mental and physical handicaps—blindness, deafness, and many forms of [[mental disorder|mental illness]]—were largely, if not entirely, hereditary in cause. Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses could be used as the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration. The most direct policy implications of eugenic thought were that "mental defectives" should not produce children, since they would only replicate these deficiencies, and that such individuals from other countries should be kept out of the polity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hansen, King |first=Randall, Desmond |date=Summer 2017 |title=Eugenic Ideas, Political Interests, and Policy Variance: Immigration and Sterilization Policy in Britain and the U.S |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248650104 |url-status=live |journal=World Politics |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=237–263 |doi=10.1353/wp.2001.0003 |pmid=18193564 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809053048/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Randall_Hansen/publication/248650104_Eugenic_Ideas_Political_Interests_and_Policy_Variance_Immigration_and_Sterilization_Policy_in_Britain_and_the_US/links/5548bc640cf27c5000668062/Eugenic-Ideas-Political-Interests-and-Policy-Variance-Immigration-and-Sterilization-Policy-in-Britain-and-the-US.pdf |archive-date=2017-08-09 |access-date=2018-09-23 |s2cid=19634871}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal targets of the American sterilization programs were intellectually disabled people and the mentally ill, but also targeted under many state laws were the deaf, the blind, people with epilepsy, and the physically deformed. While the claim was that the focus was mainly the mentally ill and disabled, the definition of this during that time was much different from today's. At this time, there were many women that were sent to institutions under the guise of being "[[feeble-minded]]" because they were promiscuous or became pregnant while unmarried.

A relative minority of sterilizations targeting crime took place in [[Incarceration in the United States|prisons and other penal institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Alexandra Stern|Alexandra Minna Stern]], Ph.D. of University of Michigan in Spanish newspaper [[El País]] published on 12 July 2013 [http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715102459/http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html|date=2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, over 65,000 individuals were sterilized in 33 states under state compulsory sterilization programs in the United States, in all likelihood without the perspectives of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Open WorldCat"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kevles |first=Daniel |title=In the name of eugenics: Genetics and the uses of human heredity |date=12 April 1985 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0-394-50702-6 |edition=1st |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first state to introduce a compulsory sterilization bill was [[Michigan]], in 1897, but the proposed law failed to pass. Eight years later [[Pennsylvania]]'s state legislators passed a sterilization bill that was vetoed by the governor. [[Indiana]] became the first state to enact sterilization legislation in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;The Indiana Supreme Court overturned the law in 1921 in {{Cite journal |title=Williams et al v.

After World War II, public opinion towards eugenics and sterilization programs became more negative in the light of the connection with the [[genocide|genocidal]] policies of [[Nazi Germany]], though a significant number of sterilizations continued in a few states through the 1970s. Between 1970 and 1976, Indian Health Services sterilized between 25 and 42 percent of women of reproductive age who came in seeking healthcare services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=A 1970 Law Led to the Mass Sterilization of Native American Women.

(Mirrored in ''Eugene Register-Guard'', 16 November 2002, at [[Google News]].)&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]] had a sterilization program as well. Some states continued to have sterilization laws on the books for much longer after that, though they were rarely if ever used. California sterilized more than any other state by a wide margin, and was responsible for over a third of all sterilization operations. Information about the California sterilization program was produced into book form and widely disseminated by eugenicists [[E. S. Gosney]] and [[Paul Popenoe]], which was said by the government of Adolf Hitler to be of key importance in proving that large-scale compulsory sterilization programs were feasible.&lt;ref&gt;On California sterilizations and their connection to the Nazi program, see: Stefan Kühl, ''The Nazi connection: Eugenics, American racism, and German National Socialism'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994); Alexandra Stern, ''Eugenic nation: faults and frontiers of better breeding in modern America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005); and Wendy Kline, ''Building a better race: gender, sexuality, and eugenics from the turn of the century to the baby boom'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, the governors of many states have made public apologies for their past programs beginning with Virginia and followed by Oregon&lt;ref name="oregonapology" /&gt; and California. Few have offered to compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and would of course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, ''[[Poe v. Lynchburg Training School &amp; Hospital]]'' (1981), was filed in the courts on the grounds that the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing. However, the petitioners were granted some compensation because the stipulations of the law itself, which required informing the patients about their operations, had not been carried out in many cases.

The inability to pay for the cost of raising children has been a reason courts have ordered coercive or compulsory sterilization.

Elaine Riddick was a survivor of rape, and in the United States, she was one of the many that were considered not worthy enough for reproductive, which is why she was sterilized. Riddick did not know she was sterilized until after she got married, and Elaine and her husband wanted to grow their family. After finding out that she was also a victim of compulsory sterilization, Riddick's attorney stated that one reason behind compulsory sterilization was that they did not want the less fortunate, disabled people or those who came from a background of criminal behavior to have children. Riddick did file a lawsuit against the state of North Carolina. Riddick did not win because the jury felt that her sterilization was not done against her will. The governor stated that the compensation was out of their budget range.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{Citation |title=Inside Story Americas - Forced sterilisation: Time for compensation? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pyiVuYAznk  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/_pyiVuYAznk |archive-date=2021-12-22 |url-status=live|language=en |access-date=2021-04-09}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Railey of the ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]'' believed that this was devastating of the decision that was made. He believes that compensation was a way for sorrow. Many other people received compensation for many different reasons, which was so different for Riddick and others sterilized against their will.&lt;ref name="youtube.com" /&gt;

As of 19 July 2021 it was reported that:{{blockquote|"under new provisions signed into California's budget this week, the state will offer reparations for the thousands of people who were sterilized in California institutions, without adequate consent, often because they were deemed "criminal", "feeble-minded" or "deviant"."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2021-07-19|title=Survivors of California's forced sterilizations: 'It's like my life wasn't worth anything'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/19/california-forced-sterilization-prison-survivors-reparations|access-date=2022-01-04|website=the Guardian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The program will be the first in the nation to provide compensation to modern-day survivors of prison system sterilizations, like Dillon, whose attorney obtained medical records to show that, while she was an inmate in the Central California women's facility in Chowchilla, surgeons had removed her ovaries during what was supposed to be an operation to take a biopsy and remove a cyst.

The investigations sparked by her case, which is featured in the documentary Belly of the Beast, showed hundreds of inmates had been sterilized in prisons without proper consent as late as 2010, even though the practice was by then illegal.

The new California reparations program will also seek to compensate hundreds of living survivors of the state's earlier eugenics campaign, which was first codified into state law in 1909 and wasn't repealed until 1979."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Independent Lens {{!}} Belly of the Beast {{!}} Season 22 {{!}} Episode 4|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/belly-of-the-beast-7puv5r/|language=en|access-date=2022-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;}}

==== Georgia immigration detention center 2020 ====
In Georgia there was a sudden spike within the United States in 2020. Reports show that illegal hysterectomies were performed in Georgia on immigrants at [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]'s Irwin County center. The physicians who performed the unnecessary hysterectomies believe that they do not have as much knowledge or authority over themselves due to the women being immigrants. The woman who remained anonymous claimed that she complained to officials at the Irwin County center that the physician Mahendra Amin was performing nonconsensual and invasive procedures. Despite him denying the allegations against himself, his case is still an ongoing federal investigation. After continuing the investigation, one of the nurses named Dawn Wooten came out saying that she felt that this same physician was performing involuntary sterilization. This called for an independent team of medical experts plus nine board-certified OB's to review more than 3,200 pages of medical records from 19 women that had unnecessary hysterectomies performed on them.

==== Effect on disabled persons ====
As stated previously, eugenics in the United States spread to target mentally disabled persons. Sterilization rates across the country were relatively low, with the sole exception of California, until the 1927 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'', which upheld under the [[U.S. Constitution]] the forced sterilization of patients at a [[Virginia]] home for intellectually disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Buck v.

The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) believes that mental disability is not a reason to deny sterilization.

In addition to child abuse cases, some politicians proposed bills mandating Norplant use among women on public assistance as a requirement to maintain welfare benefits.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; As noted above, some judges offered probation in lieu of prison time to women who agreed to use Norplant, while other court cases have ordered parents to cease childbearing until regaining custody of their children after abuse cases. Some legal scholars and ethicists argue such practices are inherently coercive.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Furthermore, such scholars link these practices to eugenic policies of the 19th and early 20th century, highlighting how such practices not only targeted poor people, but disproportionately impacted minority women and families in the U.S., particularly black women.

In the late 1970s, to acknowledge the history of forced and coercive sterilizations and prevent ongoing eugenics/population control efforts, the federal government implemented a standardized informed consent process and specific eligibility criteria for government funded sterilization procedures.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Borrero |first1=Sonya |last2=Zite |first2=Nikki |last3=Creinin |first3=Mitchell D. |date=October 2012 |title=Federally Funded Sterilization: Time to Rethink Policy? |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=102 |issue=10 |pages=1822–1825 |doi=10.2105/ajph.2012.300850 |issn=0090-0036 |pmc=3490665 |pmid=22897531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue the extensive consent process and 30-day waiting period go beyond preventing instances of coercion and serve as a barrier to desired sterilization for women relying on public insurance.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Though formal eugenics laws are no longer routinely implemented and have been removed from government documents, instances of reproductive coercion still take place in U.S. institutions today.

=====1940s–1950s=====

Unemployment and widespread poverty would continue to grow in Puerto Rico in the 40s, both threatening U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico and acting as a deterrent for future investment.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In an attempt to attract additional U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico, another round of liberalizing trade policies were implemented and referred to as "[[Operation Bootstrap]]."&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Despite these policies and their relative success, unemployment and poverty in Puerto Rico remained high, high enough to prompt an increase in [[emigration]] from Puerto Rico to the United States between 1950 and 1955.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; The issues of [[immigration]], Puerto Rican poverty, and threats to U.S. private investment made population control concerns a prime political and social issue for the United States.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

The 50s also saw the production of social science research supporting sterilization procedures in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Princeton's [[Office of Population Research]], in collaboration with the Social Research Department at the University of Puerto Rico, conducted interviews with couples regarding sterilization and other birth control.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Their studies concluded that there was a significant need and desire for permanent birth control among Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In response, Puerto Rico's governor and Commissioner of health opened 160 private, temporary birth control clinics with the specific purpose of sterilization.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

Also during this era, private birth control clinics were established in Puerto Rico with funds provided by wealthy Americans.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; [[Joseph Sunnen]], a wealthy American Republican and industrialist, established the [[Sunnen Foundation]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; The foundation funded new birth control clinics under the title "La Asociación Puertorriqueña el Biensestar de la Familia" and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in an experimental project to determine if a formulaic program could be used to control population growth in Puerto Rico and beyond.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

=====Sterilization procedures and [[coercion]]=====
From beginning of the 1900s, U.S. and Puerto Rican governments espoused rhetoric connecting the poverty of Puerto Rico with overpopulation and the "hyper-fertility" of Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name="Lopez"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lopez |first=Iris |date=1993 |title=Agency And Constraint: Sterilization And Reproductive Freedom Among Puerto Rican Women In New York City |journal=Urban Anthropology and Studies of Cultural Systems and World Economic Development |volume=22 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such rhetoric combined with eugenics ideology of reducing "population growth among a particular class or ethnic group because they are considered...a social burden," was the philosophical basis for the 1937 birth control legislation enacted in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; A Puerto Rican Eugenics Board, modeled after a similar board in the United States, was created as part of the bill, and officially ordered ninety-seven involuntary sterilizations.&lt;ref name="Briggs"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Briggs |first=Laura |title=Reproducing Empire: Race, Sex, Science, and U.S. Imperialism in Puerto Rico |date=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-22255-7 |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legalization of sterilization was followed by a steady increase in the popularity of the procedure, both among the Puerto Rican population and among physicians working in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Ramirez de Arellano |first1=Annette B. |title=Colonialism, Catholicism, and Contraception: A History of Birth Control in Puerto Rico |last2=Seipp |first2=Conrad |date=1983 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-0-8078-1544-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though sterilization could be performed on men and women, women were most likely to undergo the procedure.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented hospital policy to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; There is additional evidence that true [[informed consent]] was not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

By 1949 a survey of Puerto Rican women found that 21% of women interviewed had been sterilized, with sterilizations being performed in 18% of all hospital births statewide as a routine post-partum procedure, with the sterilization operation performed before women left the hospitals after giving birth.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; As for the birth control clinics founded by Sunnen, the Puerto Rican Family Planning Association reported that around 8,000 women and 3,000 men had been sterilized in Sunnen's privately funded clinics.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; At one point, the levels of sterilization in Puerto Rico were so high that they alarmed the Joint Committee for Hospital Accreditation, who then demanded that Puerto Rican hospitals limit sterilizations to ten percent of all hospital deliveries in order to receive accreditation.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; The high popularity of sterilization continued into the 60s and 70s, during which the Puerto Rican government made the procedures available for free and reduced fees.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; The effects of the sterilization and contraception campaigns of the 1900s in Puerto Rico are still felt in Puerto Rican cultural history today.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;

======Controversy and opposing viewpoints======
There has been much debate and scholarly analysis concerning the legitimacy of choice given to Puerto Rican women with regards to sterilization, reproduction, and birth control, as well as with the ethics of economically motivated mass sterilization programs.

Some scholars, such as Bonnie Mass&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; and Iris Lopez,&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt; have argued that the history and popularity of mass sterilization in Puerto Rico represents a government-led eugenics initiative for [[population control]].&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elena"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Gutierrez |first1=Elena R. |last2=Fuentes |first2=Liza |date=2009–2010 |title=Population Control by Sterilization: The Cases of Puerto Rican and Mexican-Origin Women in the United States |journal=Latino(a) Research Review |volume=7 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite the private and government funding of sterilization, coercive practices, and the eugenics ideology of Puerto Rican and American governments and physicians as evidence of a mass sterilization campaign.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elena" /&gt;

On the other side of the debate, scholars like Laura Briggs&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; have argued that evidence does not substantiate claims of a mass sterilization program.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; She further argues that reducing the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico to a state initiative ignores the legacy of Puerto Rican feminist activism in favor or birth control legalization and the individual agency of Puerto Rican women in making decisions about family planning.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;

=====Effects=====
When the United States took census of Puerto Rico in 1899, the birth rate was 40 births per one thousand people.&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; By 1961, the birth rate had dropped to 30.8 per thousand.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In 1955, 16.5% of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized, this jumped to 34% in 1965.&lt;ref name= "Mass" /&gt;

In 1969, sociologist [[Harriet Presser]] analyzed the 1965 Master Sample Survey of Health and Welfare in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=Presser&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Presser |first=Harriet B. |date=November 1969 |title=The Role of Sterilization in Controlling Puerto Rican Fertility |journal=Population Studies |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=343–361 |doi=10.2307/2172875 |jstor=2172875 |pmid=22073953}}&lt;!--|access-date=10 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She specifically analyzed data from the survey for women ages 20 to 49 who had at least one birth, resulting in an overall sample size of 1,071 women.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; She found that over 34% of women aged 20–49 had been sterilized in Puerto Rico in 1965.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt;

Presser's analysis also found that 46.7% of women who reported they were sterilized were between the ages of 34 and 39.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Of the sample of women sterilized, 46.6% had been married 15 to 19 years, 43.9% had been married for 10-to-14 years, and 42.7% had been married for 20-to-24 years.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Nearly 50% of women sterilized had three or four births.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Over 1/3 of women who reported being sterilized were sterilized in their twenties, with the average age of sterilization being 26.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt;

A survey by a team of Americans in 1975 confirmed Presser's assessment that nearly 1/3 of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; As of 1977, Puerto Rico had the highest proportion of childbearing-aged persons sterilized in the world.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In 1993, [[ethnographic]] work done in New York by [[anthropologist]] Iris Lopez&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt; showed that the history of sterilization continued to effect the lives of Puerto Rican women even after they immigrated to the United States and lived there for generations.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt; The history of the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico meant that Puerto Rican women living in America had high rates of female family members who had undergone sterilization, and it remained a highly popular form of birth control among Puerto Rican women living in New York.&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt;

===Uzbekistan===
According to reports, {{as of|2012|lc=y}}, forced and coerced sterilization are current Government policy in [[Uzbekistan]] for women with two or three children as a means of forcing population control and to improve maternal mortality rates.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-2012-04-12&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17612550 BBC News: Uzbekistan's policy of secretly sterilizing women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405112247/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17612550 |date=2015-04-05 }} [[BBC]], published 2012-04-12, accessed 2012-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-cc-2012-04-12&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01fjx63 Crossing Continents: Forced Sterilization in Uzbekistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903195248/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01fjx63 |date=2016-09-03 }} [[BBC]], published 2012-04-12, accessed 2012-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moscow-2010-03-10&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/uzbeks-face-forced-sterilization/401279.html Uzbeks Face Forced Sterilization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019203218/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/uzbeks-face-forced-sterilization/401279.html |date=2013-10-19 }} [[The Moscow Times]] published 2010-03-10, accessed 2012-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Antelava |first=Natalia |date=12 April 2012 |title=Uzbekistan's policy of secretly sterilising women |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17612550 |newspaper=BBC World Service |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302071400/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17612550 |archive-date=2 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Antelava |first=Natalia |date=12 April 2012 |title=Uzbekistan's policy of secretly sterilising women |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17612550 |newspaper=BBC World Service |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405112247/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17612550 |archive-date=5 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, a report by the [[United Nations Committee Against Torture]] reported that "the large number of cases of forced sterilization and removal of reproductive organs of women at reproductive age after their first or second pregnancy indicate that the Uzbek government is trying to control the birth rate in the country" and noted that such actions were not against the national Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/docs/ngos/omctuzbekistan39.pdf Shadow Report: UN Committee Against Torture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109020604/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/docs/ngos/omctuzbekistan39.pdf |date=2014-11-09 }} [[United Nations]], authors Rapid Response Group and OMCT, published November 2007, accessed 2012-04-12&lt;/ref&gt; in response to which the Uzbek delegation to the associated conference was "puzzled by the suggestion of forced sterilization, and could not see how this could be enforced."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/DDAD7F2786699CA7C12573910072F598?opendocument Press Release: Committee Against Torture Hears Response of Uzbekistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113184223/http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/DDAD7F2786699CA7C12573910072F598?opendocument |date=2009-01-13 }} [[United Nations]], published 2007-10-12, accessed 2012-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a report by journalist Natalia Antelava, doctors reported that the Ministry of Health told doctors they must perform surgical sterilizations on women. One doctor reported, "It's ruling number 1098 and it says that after two children, in some areas after three, a woman should be sterilized.", in a loss of the former surface decency of Central Asian mores in regard of female chastity.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hackel |first=Joyce |title=Doctors in Uzbekistan Say Government Forcibly Sterilizing Women |website=PRI's The World |date=12 April 2012 |url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/04/doctors-in-uzbekistan-say-government-forcibly-sterilizing-women/ |publisher=Theworld.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830133502/http://www.theworld.org/2012/04/doctors-in-uzbekistan-say-government-forcibly-sterilizing-women/ |archive-date=30 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Ministry of Health passed a decree stating all clinics in Uzbekistan should have sterilization equipment ready for use. The same report also states that sterilization is to be done on a voluntary basis with the informed consent of the patient.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"/&gt; In the 2010 Human Rights Report of Uzbekistan, there were many reports of forced sterilization of women along with allegations of the government pressuring doctors to sterilize women in order to control the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154489.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Uzbekistan |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |website=2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices |date=8 April 2011 |access-date=23 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320140820/https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154489.htm |archive-date=20 March 2020 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors also reported to Antelava that there are quotas they must reach every month on how many women they need to sterilize. These orders are passed on to them through their bosses and, allegedly, from the government.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"/&gt;

On 15 May 2012, during a meeting with the Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] in [[Moscow]] the Uzbek president Islam Karimov said: "we are doing everything in our hands to make sure that the population growth rate [in Uzbekistan] does not exceed 1.2–1.3"&lt;ref name="RFE/RL"&gt;{{cite news|title="Akhborot" censors Karimov|url=http://www.ozodlik.org/content/article/24584171.html|access-date=17 May 2012|newspaper=[[RFE/RL]]'s Uzbek Service|date=17 May 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529011406/http://www.ozodlik.org/content/article/24584171.html|archive-date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Uzbek version of [[RFE/RL]] reported that with this statement Karimov indirectly admitted that forced sterilization of women is indeed taking place in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="RFE/RL" /&gt; The main Uzbek television channel, O'zbekiston, cut out Karimov's statement about the population growth rate while broadcasting his conversation with Putin.&lt;ref name="RFE/RL" /&gt;
It is unclear if there is any genocidal conspiracy in regard of the Mongol type involved, in connection with genetic drain of this type through lack of their reproduction.

Despite international agreement concerning the inhumanity and illegality of forced sterilization, it has been suggested that the Government of Uzbekistan continues to pursue such programs.&lt;ref name=bbc-news-2012-04-12 /&gt;
