'''Compulsory sterilization''', also known as '''forced''' or '''coerced sterilization''', programs are government policies which force people to undergo surgical or other [[Human sterilization|sterilization]]. The reasons governments implement sterilization programs vary in purpose and intent.&lt;ref name="who-2014"&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/eliminating-forced-sterilization/en/ Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization: An interagency statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711130919/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/eliminating-forced-sterilization/en/ |date=2015-07-11 }}, [[World Health Organization]], May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 20th century, several such programs were instituted in countries around the world, usually as part of [[eugenics]] programs intended to prevent the reproduction of members of the population considered to be carriers of defective [[Genetics|genetic]] traits.&lt;ref&gt;Webster University, Forced Sterilization. Retrieved on August 30, 2014. {{cite web |url=http://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/forcedsterilization.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907114059/http://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/forcedsterilization.html |archivedate=2015-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bases for compulsory sterilization have included general population growth management, sex discrimination, "sex-normalizing" surgeries of [[intersex]] persons, limiting the spread of HIV,&lt;ref name="who-2014" /&gt; and reducing the population of ethnic groups. The last is counted as an act of genocide under the [[Statute of Rome]]. Some countries require transgender people to undergo sterilization before [[Legal aspects of transsexualism|gaining legal recognition of their gender]], a practice that [[Juan E. Méndez]], the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on [[Convention Against Torture|torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment]] cites as a violation of the [[Yogyakarta Principles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/Regularsession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf|format=PDF|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (A/HRC/22/53)|at=para.&amp;nbsp;78|publisher=Ohchr.org|accessdate=2013-10-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824161117/http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compulsory sterilization has been proposed as a means of [[human population planning]].

==Affected populations==

In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]], [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement''. The report references the involuntary sterilization of a number of specific population groups. They include:

* [[Women]], especially in relation to coercive population control policies, and particularly including women living with [[HIV]], indigenous and ethnic minority girls and women. Indigenous and ethnic minority women often face "wrongful stereotyping based on gender, race and ethnicity".
** Funding of welfare mothers by HEW (Health, Education, and Welfare) covers roughy 90% of cost and doctors are likely to concur with the compulsory sterilization of welfare mothers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dear Sisters|last=Baxandall|first=Rosalyn|last2=Gordon|first2=Linda|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0-465-01707-2|location=New York, NY|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to cease welfare occur when women do are hesitant to consent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Disabled people]], often perceived as asexual. Women with intellectual disabilities are "often treated as if they have no control, or should have no control, over their sexual and reproductive choices". Other rationales include menstrual management for "women who have or are perceived to have difficulties coping with or managing menses, or whose health conditions (such as epilepsy) or behaviour are negatively affected by menses."
* [[Intersex]] persons, who "are often subjected to cosmetic and other non-medically indicated surgeries performed on their reproductive organs, without their informed consent or that of their parents, and without taking into consideration the views of the children involved", often as a "sex-normalizing" treatment.
* [[Transgender]] persons, "as a prerequisite to receiving gender-affirmative treatment and gender-marker changes".

The report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies.&lt;ref name="who-2014" /&gt;

== As a part of human population planning ==
[[Human population planning]] is the practice of artificially altering the rate of growth of a human population. Historically, human population planning has been implemented by limiting the population's [[birth rate]], usually by government mandate, and has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of [[poverty]], [[carrying capacity|environmental concerns]], [[religion|religious reasons]], and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. While population planning can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, some programs have exposed them to exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |title=Interact Worldwide Downloads |publisher=Interact Worldwide |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115221710/http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |archivedate=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1977 textbook ''[[Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment]]'', the authors discussed in this encyclopedic textbook the possible role of a wide variety of formulations to address human overpopulation. This included the possibility of compulsory sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Egnor |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/08/the_inconvenient_truth_about_p023831.html |title=The Inconvenient Truth About Population Control, Part 2; Science Czar John Holdren's Endorsement of Involuntary Sterilization |website=evolutionnews.org |date=August 14, 2009 |access-date=October 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005193751/http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/08/the_inconvenient_truth_about_p023831.html |archivedate=October 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A government might utilize [[sortition]] to select those to be sterilized in order to avoid accusations of bias or having any other adverse agenda. In ''Ecoscience'', in the chapter entitled "The Human Predicament: Finding A Way Out", the authors speculate about pharmaceuticals that might be developed to sterilize people. Some partial fulfillments of these predictions are the birth control drugs in [[Norplant]] and [[Depo-Provera]]. See also [[sterilization (medicine)#Pharmacological]]. One can further speculate about pharmaceuticals designed to permanently sterilize the gestating human fetus ''in utero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/072109_holdren2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095317/http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/072109_holdren2.pdf/ |archivedate=2016-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

=== International law ===
The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits forced sterilization (Article 39).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rm.coe.int/168046031c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531114057/https://rm.coe.int/168046031c |archivedate=2017-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Widespread or systematic forced sterilization has been recognized as a [[Crime against Humanity]] by the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] in the explanatory memorandum. This memorandum defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive - A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113112157/http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf |date=2016-01-13 }}'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation.

=== Bangladesh ===

[[Bangladesh]] has a long running government operated civilian exploitative [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] program as a part of its population control policy, where poor women and men are mainly targeted. The government offers 2000 [[Bangladeshi taka|Bangladeshi Taka]] (24 USD) for the woman who are persuaded to undergo [[tubal ligation]] and for the man who are persuaded to undergo [[vasectomy]]. Women are also offered a [[sari]] (a [[garment]] worn by women in [[Indian subcontinent]]) and men are offered a [[lungi]] (a [[garment]] for men) to wear for undergoing sterilization. The referrer, who persuades the woman or man to undergo sterilization gets 300 Bangladeshi Taka (3.60 USD).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd/site/field_office/3354b838-2016-11e7-8f57-286ed488c766|title=পরিবার পরিকল্পনা {{!}} উত্তরখান ইউনিয়ন {{!}} উত্তরখান ইউনিয়ন|website=uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112185603/http://uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd/site/field_office/3354b838-2016-11e7-8f57-286ed488c766|archivedate=2017-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the targeted number of sterilizations per month was 600-1000 in contrast to the insertion of 25,000 [[IUDs]], which was increased in 1978 to about 50,000 sterilizations per month on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AR|first=Khan|last2=I|first2=Swenson|date=1978|title=Acceptability of male sterilization in Bangladesh: its problems and perspectives|url=https://www.popline.org/node/444385|journal=Bangladesh Development Studies|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113002952/https://www.popline.org/node/444385|archivedate=2017-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 50% rise in the amount paid to men coincided with a doubling of the number of vasectomies between 1980 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Liskin|last2=JM|first2=Pile|last3=WF|first3=Quillan|date=1983|title=Vasectomy--safe and simple|url=https://www.popline.org/node/402465|journal=Population Reports.

Ershad's government trained 1,200 doctors and 25,000 field workers who must conduct two tubal ligations and two vasectomies each month to earn their salaries.

The men also said they had not received all of the incentives they had been promised.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to another study on 5042 women and 264 men who underwent sterilization, complications such as painful urination, shaking chills, fever for at least 2 days, frequent urination, bleeding from the incision, sore with pus, stitches or skin breaking open, weakness and [[dizziness]] arose after the sterilization. The person's sex, the sponsor and workload in the sterilization center, and the dose of [[sedative]]s administered to women were significantly associated with specific postoperative complaints. Five women died during the study, resulting in a death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 [[Tubal ligation|tubectomies]] (tubal ligations); four deaths were due to [[respiratory arrest]] caused by overuse of sedatives. The death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 tubectomies (tubal ligation) in this study is similar to the 10.0 deaths/10,000 cases estimated on the basis of a 1979 follow-up study in an Indian female sterilization camp. The presence of a complaint before the operation was generally a good predictor of postoperative complaints. Centers performing fewer than 200 procedures were associated with more complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=M. J.|last2=Rochat|first2=R.

[[Bangladesh]] is planning to introduce sterilization program in its overcrowded [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee camps, where nearly a million refugees are fighting for space, after efforts to encourage birth control failed. Since 25 August 2017, more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have been fled from [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] state, [[Myanmar]] to neighboring Bangladesh, which is a Muslim majority country, following a military crackdown against [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] Muslims in Rakhine state, Myanmar. Sabura, a Rohingya mother of seven, said her husband believed the couple could support a large family.

“I spoke to my husband about birth control measures. But he is not convinced. He was given two condoms but he did not use them,” she said.

“My husband said we need more children as we have land and property (in [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]]). We don’t have to worry to feed them,” she said.

District family planning authorities have managed to distribute just 549 packets of condoms among the refugees, amid reports they are reluctant to use them. They have asked the government to approve a plan to provide [[Vasectomy|vasectomies]] for men and [[Tubal ligation|tubectomies]] (tubal ligation) for women in the camps.

One volunteer, Farhana Sultana, said the women she spoke to believed birth control was a sin and others saw it as against the tenets of Islam.

Bangladeshi officials say about 20,000 [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee women are pregnant and 600 have given birth since arriving in the country, but this may not be accurate as many births take place without formal medical help.

Every month 250 [[Bangladeshis|Bangladeshi]] people undergo sterilization routinely under government's sterilization program in the border town of [[Cox's Bazar District|Cox’s Bazar]], where the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee Muslims have taken shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|title=Bangladesh to offer sterilisation to Rohingya in refugee camps|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2017-10-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104150415/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|archivedate=2017-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|title=Bangladesh ‘plans to offer to sterilise Rohingya Muslims’ as refugee population grows|date=2017-10-29|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113003155/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|archivedate=2017-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Compulsory sterilization in Canada}}

Two Canadian provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]) performed compulsory sterilization programs in the 20th century with eugenic aims. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system. However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.

The [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir’s case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|title=Alberta Apologizes for Forced Sterilization|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|accessdate=June 19, 2013|date=November 9, 1999|work=[[CBC News]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123020740/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1VoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kecFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397%2C1039102 Victims of sterilization finally get day in court.

As recently as 2017, a number of Indigenous women were not permitted to see their newborn babies unless they agreed to sterilization. Over 60 women are involved in a lawsuit in this case.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-november-13-2018-1.4902679/indigenous-women-kept-from-seeing-their-newborn-babies-until-agreeing-to-sterilization-says-lawyer-1.4902693&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/18/canada-indigenous-women-coerced-sterlilization-class-action-lawsuit Human rights groups call on Canada to end coerced sterilization of indigenous women] The Guardian, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In 1978, Chinese authorities became concerned with the possibility of a baby boom that the country could not handle, and they initialized the [[one-child policy]]. In order to effectively deal with the complex issues surrounding childbirth, the Chinese government placed great emphasis on family planning. Because this was such an important matter, the government thought it needed to be standardized, and so to this end laws were introduced in 2002.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Thousands at risk of forced sterilization in China | date=April 22, 2010 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | publisher=[[Amnesty International]] | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314193515/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | archivedate=March 14, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws uphold the basic tenets of what was previously put into practice, outlining the rights of the individuals and outlining what the Chinese government can and cannot do to enforce policy.

However, recently accusations have been raised from groups such as [[Amnesty International]], who have claimed that practices of compulsory sterilization have been occurring for people who have already reached their one child quota. These practices run contrary to the stated principles of the law, and seem to differ on a local level. An especially egregious example, according to Amnesty International, has been occurring in Puning City, [[Guangdong Province]]. The sterilization drive in this city was in accordance with regulations outlined by the government in the Population and Family Planning Law of 2002. This drive, also known as the [[Iron Fist Campaign]], also is said to have used coercive methods in order to ensure that close to 10,000 women were sterilized, including detaining elderly family members. It is unclear whether support of the increase of the now 90% Han Chinese majority here plays a role&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

The Chinese government appears to be aware of these discrepancies in policy implementation on a local level. For example, The National Population and Family Planning Commission put forth in a statement that, “Some persons concerned in a few counties and townships of Linyi did commit practices that violated law and infringed upon legitimate rights and interests of citizens while conducting family planning work.” This statement comes in reference to some charges of forced sterilization and abortions in Linyi city of Shandong Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=China acts on forced abortion | date=September 20, 2005 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210000256/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | archivedate=February 10, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remains unclear to what extent the government has prosecuted or disciplined the officials in charge of family planning in the country.

The policy requires a "social compensation fee" for those who have more than the legal number of children. According to Forbes editor Heng Shao, critics claims this fee is a toll on the poor but not the rich.&lt;ref&gt;Enforcement of One-Child Policy Targets 'The Rich and Famous' in Zhangzhou, China, ''[[Forbes]]'', September 20, 2013. {{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2013/09/20/enforcement-of-one-child-policy-targets-the-rich-and-famous-in-zhangzhou-china/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909011431/https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2013/09/20/enforcement-of-one-child-policy-targets-the-rich-and-famous-in-zhangzhou-china/ |archivedate=2017-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases registered in the Chinese legal system (cf.

One of the first acts by [[Adolf Hitler]] after the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] gave him de facto legal dictatorship over the [[Germany|German]] state was to pass the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (''Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses'') in July 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jkswAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XKgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3703%2C266241 Eugenics Courts Named in Reich.

The Montreal Gazette. June 20, 1934.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The law was signed by Hitler himself, and over 200 eugenic courts were created specifically as a result of this law. Under it, all doctors in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] were required to report any patients of theirs who were deemed [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], characterized [[mentally ill]] (including [[schizophrenia]] and [[manic depression]]), [[epilepsy|epileptic]], blind, deaf, or physically deformed, and a steep monetary penalty was imposed for any patients who were not properly reported. Individuals suffering from [[alcoholism]] or [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] could also be sterilized. The individual's case was then presented in front of a court of [[Nazism|Nazi]] officials and public health officers who would review their medical records, take testimony from friends and colleagues, and eventually decide whether or not to order a sterilization operation performed on the individual, using force if necessary. Though not explicitly covered by the law, 400 mixed-race "[[Rhineland Bastard]]s" were also sterilized beginning in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Proctor, ''Racial hygiene: Medicine under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988), and Gisela Bock, "Nazi sterilization and reproductive policies" in Dieter Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine: creating the master race'' (Washington, D.C.: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zzsbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=50wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1710%2C6396277 Wallace R.

By the end of [[World War II]], over 400,000 individuals were sterilised under the German law and its revisions, most within its first four years of being enacted. When the issue of compulsory sterilisation was brought up at the [[Nuremberg trials]] after the war, many Nazis defended their actions on the matter by indicating that it was the United States itself from whom they had taken inspiration. The Nazis had many other eugenics-inspired [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies]], including their [[T-4 Euthanasia Programme|"euthanasia" programme]] in which around 70,000 people institutionalised or suffering from birth defects were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', Chapter VI, first section (London, 1991, rev. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

India's state of emergency [[The Emergency (India)|between 1975 and 1977]] included a family planning initiative that began in April 1976 through which the government hoped to lower India's ever increasing population.

In the late 2000s, reports in the Israeli media claimed that injections of long-acting contraceptive Depo-Provera had been forced on hundreds of [[Ethiopian Jews in Israel|Ethiopian-Jewish immigrants]] both in transit camps in Ethiopia and after their arrival in Israel. In 2009, feminist NGO [[Haifa Women's Coalition]] published a first survey on the story, which was followed up by [[Israeli Educational Television]] a few years later. Ethiopian-Jewish women said they were intimidated or tricked into taking the shot every three months, sometimes presented to them as vaccine. In 2016 Israel's State Comptroller concluded his inquiry into the affair by claiming that injections of Depo-Provera had not been forced on the women; however, the Comptroller had refused to hear complainants' testimony, and his probe into the role of the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] (JDC), whose activists had looked after the women in the Ethiopian transit camps, left open questions, since the JDC official who had handled family programming in Ethiopia refused to give the Comptroller any information.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-forced-birth-control-probe-wouldn-t-hear-complainants-testimony-1.5396634&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first part of the [[Shōwa era]], Japanese governments promoted increasing the number of healthy Japanese, while simultaneously decreasing the number of people deemed to have mental retardation, disability, genetic disease and other conditions that led to inferiority in the Japanese gene pool.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1940_on_20131210024331"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=R.

The ''Leprosy Prevention laws'' of 1907, 1931 and 1953, permitted the segregation of patients in sanitariums where forced abortions and sterilization were common and authorized punishment of patients "disturbing peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hansen's sanitarium were houses of horrors |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20050128a1.html |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2005-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606085432/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20050128a1.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}, {{cite journal |first=Hajime |last=Sato |title=Abolition of leprosy isolation policy in Japan: policy termination through leadership |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=29–46 |date=February 2002 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2002.tb02126.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the colonial Korean ''Leprosy prevention ordinance'', Korean patients were also subjected to hard labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Korean Hansens patients seek redress |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2004-02-26 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040226a4.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120605020715/search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040226a4.html |archivedate=2012-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Race Eugenic Protection Law'' was submitted from 1934 to 1938 to the Diet.

According to the ''Eugenic Protection Law'' (1948), sterilization could be enforced on criminals "with genetic predisposition to commit crime", patients with genetic diseases including mild ones such as total color-blindness, [[hemophilia]], [[albinism]] and [[ichthyosis]], and mental affections such as [[schizophrenia]], [[manic-depression]] possibly deemed occurrent in their opposition and [[epilepsy]], the sickness of Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soshiren.org/shiryou/yuseihogohou.html |title=SOSHIREN / 資料・法律−優生保護法 |publisher=Soshiren.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209082910/http://www.soshiren.org/shiryou/yuseihogohou.html |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mental sicknesses were added in 1952.

===Peru===
In [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of the ''[[Programa Nacional de Población]]'', a sterilization program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | date=July 24, 2002 | accessdate=April 30, 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630062037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | archivedate=June 30, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous people]] (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented on July 28, 1995. The plan was principally financed using funds from [[USAID]] (36 million dollars), the [[Nippon Foundation]], and later, the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA).&lt;ref name=Diplo&gt;[http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 Stérilisations forcées des Indiennes du Pérou] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510120620/http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 |date=2014-05-10 }}, ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 1995, Fujimori presented a Bill that would revise the "General Law of Population", in order to allow sterilization. Several contraceptive methods were also legalized, all measures that were strongly opposed by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], as well as the Catholic organization [[Opus Dei]]. In February 1996, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) itself congratulated Fujimori on his success in controlling demographic growth.&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt;

On February 25, 1998, a representative for USAID testified before the U.S. government's [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Committee on International Relations]], to address controversy surrounding Peru's program. He indicated that the government of Peru was making important changes to the program, in order to:

* Discontinue their campaigns in tubal ligations and vasectomies.
* Make clear to health workers that there are no provider targets for voluntary surgical contraception or any other method of contraception.
* Implement a comprehensive monitoring program to ensure compliance with family planning norms and informed consent procedures.
* Welcome Ombudsman Office investigations of complaints received and respond to any additional complaints that are submitted as a result of the public request for any additional concerns.
* Implement a 72-hour "waiting period" for people who choose tubal ligation or vasectomy. This waiting period will occur between the second counseling session and surgery.
* Require health facilities to be certified as appropriate for performing surgical contraception as a means to ensure that no operations are done in makeshift or substandard facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USAID Testimony: House International Relations Committee, Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, 2/25/98|url=http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|publisher=USAID|accessdate=August 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906034940/http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|archivedate=September 6, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2001, Minister of Health [[Luis Solari De La Fuente|Luis Solari]] launched a special commission into the activities of the voluntary surgical contraception, initiating a parliamentary commission tasked with inquiring into the "irregularities" of the program, and to put it on an acceptable footing. In July 2002, its final report ordered by the Minister of Health revealed that between 1995 and 2000, 331,600 women were sterilized, while 25,590 men submitted to vasectomies.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt; The plan, which had the objective of diminishing the number of births in areas of poverty within Peru, was essentially directed at the indigenous people living in deprived areas (areas often involved in internal conflicts with the Peruvian government, as with the [[Shining Path]] guerilla group). Deputy Dora Núñez Dávila made the accusation in September 2003 that 400,000 indigenous people were sterilized during the 1990s. Documents proved that President Fujimori was informed, each month, of the number of sterilizations done, by his former Ministers of Health, Eduardo Yong Motta (1994–96), Marino Costa Bauer (1996–1999) and [[Alejandro Aguinaga]] (1999–2000).&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt; A study by sociologist {{ill|Giulia Tamayo León|es}}, ''Nada Personal'' (in English: Nothing Personal), showed that doctors were required to meet quotas. According to ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', "tubal ligation festivals" were organized through program publicity campaigns, held in the ''[[pueblos jóvenes]]'' (in English: shantytowns). In 1996 there were, according to official statistics, 81,762 tubal ligations performed on women, with a peak being reached the following year, with 109,689 ligatures, then only 25,995 in 1998.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

On October 21, 2011, Peru's Attorney General José Bardales decided to reopen an investigation into the cases, which had been halted in 2009 under the statute of limitations, after the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] ruled that President Fujimori’s sterilization program involved [[crimes against humanity]], which are not time-limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 Thousands of Forced Sterilization Cases Reopened in Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235249/http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 |date=2014-04-26 }} Impunity Watch, published November 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear as to any progress in matter of the execution (debido ejecución sumaria) of the suspect in the course of any proof of their relevant accusations in the legal sphere of the constituted people in vindication of the rights of the people of South America. It may carry a parallel to any suspect cases for international investigation in any other continent, and be in the sphere of medical genocide.

The eugenistic legislation was enacted in 1934 and was formally abolished in 1976.

===Switzerland===
In October 1999, Margrith von Felten suggested to the [[National Council of Switzerland]] in the form of a general proposal to adopt legal regulations that would enable reparation for persons sterilized against their will. According to the proposal, reparation was to be provided to persons who had undergone the intervention without their consent or who had consented to sterilization under coercion.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} According to Margrith von Felten:
{{cquote|The history of eugenics in Switzerland remains insufficiently explored. Research programmes are in progress. However, individual studies and facts are already available. For example:

The report of the Institute for the History of Medicine and Public Health "Mental Disability and Sexuality. Legal sterilization in the [[Vaud]] Canton between 1928 and 1985" points out that coercive sterilizations took place until the 1980s, it is unclear if the ethnographic impact has been duly investigated and if Hun-descendant French have been affected, as well as prehistoric human descendant communities. The act on coercive sterilizations of the Vaud Canton was the first law of this kind in the European context.

Hans Wolfgang Maier, head of the Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich pointed out in a report from the beginning of the century that 70% to 80% of [[abortion|terminations]] were linked to sterilization by doctors. In the period from 1929 to 1931, 480 women and 15 men were sterilized in Zurich in connection with termination.

Following agreements between doctors and authorities such as the 1934 "Directive For Surgical Sterilization" of the Medical Association in Basle, eugenic indication to sterilization was recognized as admissible.

A statistical evaluation of the sterilizations performed in the Basle women's hospital between 1920 and 1934 shows a remarkable increase in sterilizations for a psychiatric indication after 1929 and a steep increase in 1934, when a coercive sterilization act came into effect in nearby National Socialist Germany.

A study by the Swiss Nursing School in Zurich, published in 1991, documents that 24 mentally disabled women aged between 17 and 25 years were sterilized between 1980 and 1987. Of these 24 sterilizations, just one took place at the young woman's request.

Having evaluated sources primarily from the 1930s (psychiatric files, official directives, court files, etc.), historians have documented that the requirement for free consent to sterilization was in most of cases not satisfied. Authorities obtained the "[[Informed consent|consent]]" required by the law partly by persuasion, and partly by enforcing it through coercion and threats. Thus the recipients of social benefits were threatened with removal of the benefits, women were exposed to a choice between placement in an institution or sterilization, and abortions were permitted only when women simultaneously consented to sterilization.

More than fifty years after ending the National Socialist dictatorship in Germany, in which racial murder, euthanasia and coerced sterilizations belonged to the political programme, it is clear that eugenics, with its idea of "[[life unworthy of life]]" and "racial purity" permeated even democratic countries. The idea that a "healthy nation" should be achieved through targeted medical/social measures was designed and politically implemented in many European countries and in the U.S.A in the first half of this century. It is a policy incomparable with the inconceivable horrors of the Nazi rule; yet it is clear that authorities and the medical community were guilty of the methods and measures applied, i.e. coerced sterilizations, prohibitions of marriages and child removals – serious violations of human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}}}

Switzerland refused, however, to vote a reparations Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Eugenics had two essential components. First, its advocates accepted as axiomatic that a range of mental and physical handicaps—blindness, deafness, and many forms of mental illness—were largely, if not entirely, hereditary in cause. Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses could be used as the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration. The most direct policy implications of eugenic thought were that “mental defectives” should not produce children, since they would only replicate these deficiencies, and that such individuals from other countries should be kept out of the polity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansen, King|first=Randall, Desmond|date=Summer 2017|title=Eugenic Ideas, Political Interests, and Policy Variance: Immigration and Sterilization Policy in Britain and the U.S|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248650104|journal=World Politics|volume=53|pages=237–263|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809053048/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Randall_Hansen/publication/248650104_Eugenic_Ideas_Political_Interests_and_Policy_Variance_Immigration_and_Sterilization_Policy_in_Britain_and_the_US/links/5548bc640cf27c5000668062/Eugenic-Ideas-Political-Interests-and-Policy-Variance-Immigration-and-Sterilization-Policy-in-Britain-and-the-US.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal targets of the American sterilization programs were the [[Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] and the [[Mental illness|mentally ill]], but also targeted under many state laws were the deaf, the blind, people with [[epilepsy]], and the physically deformed.

At this time, there were many women that were sent to institutions under the guise of being “[[feeble-minded]]" because they were promiscuous or became pregnant while unmarried.

Some sterilizations took place in [[Incarceration in the United States|prisons and other penal institutions]], targeting [[criminality]], but they were in the relative minority.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Alexandra Stern|Alexandra Minna Stern]], Ph.D. of University of Michigan in Spanish newspaper [[El País]] published on 12 Julz 2013 [http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715102459/http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html |date=2013-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, over 65,000 individuals were sterilized in 33 states under state compulsory sterilization programs in the United States, in all likelihood without the perspectives of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Open WorldCat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kevles|first=Daniel|title=In the name of eugenics: Genetics and the uses of human heredity|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-50702-6|edition=1st|date=April 12, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], public opinion towards eugenics and sterilization programs became more negative in the light of the connection with the [[genocide|genocidal]] policies of [[Nazi Germany]], though a significant number of sterilizations continued in a few states through the 1970s. The [[Oregon]] Board of Eugenics, later renamed the Board of Social Protection, existed until 1983,&lt;ref name=oregonapology&gt;{{cite web |author=Governor John Kitzhaber |authorlink=John Kitzhaber |date=December 2, 2002 |title=Proclamation of Human Rights Day, and apology for Oregon's forced sterilization of institutionalized patients |url=http://archivedwebsites.sos.state.or.us/Governor_Kitzhaber_2003/governor/speeches/s021202.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528024042/http://archivedwebsites.sos.state.or.us/Governor_Kitzhaber_2003/governor/speeches/s021202.htm |archivedate=May 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the last forcible sterilization occurring in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Sullivan.

(Mirrored in ''Eugene Register-Guard'', November 16, 2002, at [[Google News]].)&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] [[Puerto Rico]] had a sterilization program as well. Some states continued to have sterilization laws on the books for much longer after that, though they were rarely if ever used. California sterilized more than any other state by a wide margin, and was responsible for over a third of all sterilization operations. Information about the California sterilization program was produced into book form and widely disseminated by eugenicists [[E.S. Gosney]] and [[Paul B. Popenoe]], which was said by the government of [[Adolf Hitler]] to be of key importance in proving that large-scale compulsory sterilization programs were feasible.&lt;ref&gt;On California sterilizations and their connection to the Nazi program, see: Stefan Kühl, ''The Nazi connection: Eugenics, American racism, and German National Socialism'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994); Alexandra Stern, ''Eugenic nation: faults and frontiers of better breeding in modern America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005); and Wendy Kline, ''Building a better race: gender, sexuality, and eugenics from the turn of the century to the baby boom'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, the governors of many states have made public apologies for their past programs beginning with Virginia and followed by Oregon&lt;ref name=oregonapology/&gt; and California. Few have offered to compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and would of course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, ''[[Poe v. Lynchburg Training School &amp; Hospital]]'' (1981), was filed in the courts on the grounds that the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing. However, the petitioners were granted some compensation because the stipulations of the law itself, which required informing the patients about their operations, had not been carried out in many cases.

The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) believes that mental disability is not a reason to deny sterilization.

The inability to pay for the cost of raising children has been a reason courts have ordered coercive or compulsory sterilization.

Abortion remained heavily restricted. By 1965, approximately 34 percent of women of childbearing age had been sterilized, two thirds of whom were still in their early twenties The law was repealed on June 8, 1960.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

=====1940s-1950s=====

Unemployment and widespread poverty would continue to grow in Puerto Rico in the 40s, threatening both U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico and acting as a deterrent for future investment.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In an attempt to attract additional U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico, another round of liberalizing trade policies were implemented and referred to as “[[Operation Bootstrap]].”&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Despite these policies and their relative success, unemployment and poverty in Puerto Rico remained high, high enough to prompt an increase in [[emigration]] from Puerto Rico to the United States between 1950 and 1955.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; The issues of [[immigration]], Puerto Rican poverty, and threats to U.S. private investment made population control concerns a prime political and social issue for the United States.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

The 50s also saw the production of social science research supporting sterilization procedures in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Princeton’s [[Office of Population Research]], in collaboration with the Social Research Department at the University of Puerto Rico, conducted interviews with couples regarding sterilization and other birth control.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Their studies concluded that there was a significant need and desire for permanent birth control among Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In response, Puerto Rico’s governor and Commissioner of health opened 160 private, temporary birth control clinics with the specific purpose of sterilization.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

Also during this era, private birth control clinics were established in Puerto Rico with funds provided by wealthy Americans.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; [[Joseph Sunnen]], a wealthy American Republican and industrialist, established the [[Sunnen Foundation]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; The foundation funded new birth control clinics under the title “La Asociación Puertorriqueña el Biensestar de la Familia” and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in an experimental project to determine if a formulaic program could be used to control population growth in Puerto Rico and beyond.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

=====Sterilization Procedures and [[Coercion]]=====
From beginning of the 1900s, U.S. and Puerto Rican governments espoused rhetoric connecting the poverty of Puerto Rico with overpopulation and the “hyper-fertility” of Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Iris|title=Agency And Constraint: Sterilization And Reproductive Freedom Among Puerto Rican Women In New York City|journal=Urban Anthropology and Studies of Cultural Systems and World Economic Development|date=1993|volume=22|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such rhetoric combined with eugenics ideology of reducing “population growth among a particular class or ethnic group because they are considered...a social burden,” was the philosophical basis for the 1937 birth control legislation enacted in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; A Puerto Rican Eugenics Board, modeled after a similar board in the United States, was created as part of the bill, and officially ordered ninety-seven involuntary sterilizations.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briggs|first1=Laura|title=Reproducing Empire: Race, Sex, Science, and U.S. Imperialism in Puerto Rico|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-0-520-22255-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legalization of sterilization was followed by a steady increase in the popularity of the procedure, both among the Puerto Rican population and among physicians working in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramirez de Arellano|first1=Annette B.|last2=Seipp|first2=Conrad|title=Colonialism, Catholicism, and Contraception: A History of Birth Control in Puerto Rico|date=1983|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-1544-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though sterilization could be performed on men and women, women were most likely to undergo the procedure.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented hospital policy to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "B" /&gt; This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; There is additional evidence that true [[informed consent]] was not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

By 1949 a survey of Puerto Rican women found that 21% of women interviewed had been sterilized, with sterilizations being performed in 18% of all hospital births statewide as a routine post-partum procedure, with the sterilization operation performed before women left the hospitals after giving birth.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; As for the birth control clinics founded by Sunnen, the Puerto Rican Family Planning Association reported that around 8,000 women and 3,000 men had been sterilized in Sunnen's privately funded clinics.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; At one point, the levels of sterilization in Puerto Rico were so high that they alarmed the Joint Committee for Hospital Accreditation, who then demanded that Puerto Rican hospitals limit sterilizations to ten percent of all hospital deliveries in order to receive accreditation.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; The high popularity of sterilization continued into the 60s and 70s, during which the Puerto Rican government made the procedures available for free and reduced fees.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; The effects of the sterilization and contraception campaigns of the 1900s in Puerto Rico are still felt in Puerto Rican cultural history today.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;

======Controversy and Opposing Viewpoints======
There has been much debate and scholarly analysis concerning the legitimacy of choice given to Puerto Rican women with regards to sterilization, reproduction, and birth control, as well as with the ethics of economically motivated mass sterilization programs.

Some scholars, such as Bonnie Mass&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; and Iris Lopez,&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; have argued that the history and popularity of mass sterilization in Puerto Rico represents a government-led eugenics initiative for [[population control]].,&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elena&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Elena R.|last2=Fuentes|first2=Liza|title=Population Control by Sterilization: The Cases of Puerto Rican and Mexican-Origin Women in the United States|journal=Latino(a) Research Review|date=2009–2010|volume=7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite the private and government funding of sterilization, coercive practices, and the eugenics ideology of Puerto Rican and American governments and physicians as evidence of a mass sterilization campaign.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Elena" /&gt;

On the other side of the debate, scholars like Laura Briggs&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; have argued that evidence does not substantiate claims of a mass sterilization program.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; She further argues that reducing the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico to a state initiative ignores the legacy of Puerto Rican feminist activism in favor or birth control legalization and the individual agency of Puerto Rican women in making decisions about family planning.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;

=====Effects=====
When the United States took census of Puerto Rico in 1899, the birth rate was 40 births per one thousand people.&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; By 1961, the birth rate had dropped to 30.8 per thousand.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In 1955, 16.5% of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized, this jumped to 34% in 1965.&lt;ref name= "Mass" /&gt;

In 1969, sociologist [[Harriet Presser]] analyzed the 1965 Master Sample Survey of Health and Welfare in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=Presser&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Presser|first1=Harriet B.|title=The Role of Sterilization in Controlling Puerto Rican Fertility|journal=Population Studies|date=November 1969|volume=23|issue=3|pages=343–361|doi=10.2307/2172875|jstor=2172875}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She specifically analyzed data from the survey for women ages 20 to 49 who had at least one birth, resulting in an overall sample size of 1,071 women.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; She found that over 34% of women aged 20–49 had been sterilized in Puerto Rico in 1965.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt;

Presser’s analysis also found that 46.7% of women who reported they were sterilized were between the ages of 34 and 39.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Of the sample of women sterilized, 46.6% had been married 15 to 19 years, 43.9% had been married for 10 to 14 years, and 42.7% had been married for 20 to 24 years.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Nearly 50% of women sterilized had three or four births.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Over 1/3 of women who reported being sterilized were sterilized in their twenties, with the average age of sterilization being 26.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt;

A survey by a team of Americans in 1975 confirmed Presser's assessment that nearly 1/3 of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; As of 1977, Puerto Rico had the highest proportion of childbearing-aged persons sterilized in the world.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In 1993, [[ethnographic]] work done in New York by [[anthropologist]] Iris Lopez&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; showed that the history of sterilization continued to effect the lives of Puerto Rican women even after they immigrated to the United States and lived there for generations.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; The history of the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico meant that Puerto Rican women living in America had high rates of female family members who had undergone sterilization, and it remained a highly popular form of birth control among Puerto Rican women living in New York.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;

===Mexico===
“Civil Society Organizations such as Balance, Promocion para el Desarrollo y Juventud, A.C., have received in the last years numerous testimonies of women living with HIV in which they inform that misinformation about the virus transmission has frequently lead to compulsory sterilization. Although there is enough evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed to reduce mother-to-child transmission risks, there are records of HIV-positive women forced to undergo sterilization or have agreed to be sterilized without adequate and sufficient information about their options.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres.

“A [http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19462/html report] made in El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua concluded that women living with HIV, and whose health providers knew about it at the time of pregnancy, were six times more likely to experience forced or coerced sterilization in those countries. In addition, most of these women reported that health providers told them that living with HIV cancelled their right to choose the number and spacing of the children they want to have as well as the right to choose the contraceptive method of their choice; provided misleading information about the consequences for their health and that of their children and denied them access to treatments that reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission in order to coerce them into sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres.

This happens even when the health norm [http://www.salud.gob.mx/unidades/cdi/nom/005ssa23.html NOM 005-SSA2-1993] states that family planning is “the right of everyone to decide freely, responsibly and in an informed way the number and spacing of their children and to obtain specialized information and proper services” and that “the exercise of this right is independent of gender, age, and social or legal status of persons”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Based on a report by journalist Natalia Antelava, doctors reported that the Ministry of Health told doctors they must perform surgical sterilizations on women. One doctor reported, “It's ruling number 1098 and it says that after two children, in some areas after three, a woman should be sterilized.”, in a loss of the former surface decency of Central Asian mores in regard of female chastity.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hackel |first=Joyce |title=Doctors in Uzbekistan Say Government Forcibly Sterilizing Women |website=PRI's The World |date=April 12, 2012 |url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/04/doctors-in-uzbekistan-say-government-forcibly-sterilizing-women/ |publisher=Theworld.org |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119162605/http://www.theworld.org/2012/04/doctors-in-uzbekistan-say-government-forcibly-sterilizing-women/ |archivedate=January 19, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Ministry of Health passed a decree stating all clinics in Uzbekistan should have sterilization equipment ready for use. The same report also states that sterilization is to be done on a voluntary basis with the informed consent of the patient.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"/&gt; In the 2010 Human Rights Report of Uzbekistan, there were many reports of forced sterilization of women along with allegations of the government pressuring doctors to sterilize women in order to control the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154489.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Uzbekistan |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |author=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |website=2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices |date=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052726/https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154489.htm |archivedate=June 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors also reported to Antelava that there are quotas they must reach every month on how many women they need to sterilize. These orders are passed on to them through their bosses and, allegedly, from the government.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"/&gt;

On May 15, 2012, during a meeting with the Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] in [[Moscow]] the Uzbek president Islam Karimov said: "we are doing everything in our hands to make sure that the population growth rate [in Uzbekistan] does not exceed 1.2-1.3"&lt;ref name="RFE/RL"&gt;{{cite news|title="Akhborot" censors Karimov|url=http://www.ozodlik.org/content/article/24584171.html|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=[[RFE/RL]]'s Uzbek Service|date=17 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529011406/http://www.ozodlik.org/content/article/24584171.html|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Uzbek version of [[RFE/RL]] reported that with this statement Karimov indirectly admitted that forced sterilization of women is indeed taking place in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="RFE/RL" /&gt; The main Uzbek television channel, O'zbekiston, cut out Karimov's statement about the population growth rate while broadcasting his conversation with Putin.&lt;ref name="RFE/RL" /&gt;
It is unclear if there is any genocidal conspiracy in regard of the Mongol type involved, in connection with genetic drain of this type through lack of their reproduction.

Despite international agreement concerning the inhumanity and illegality of forced sterilization, it has been suggested that the Government of Uzbekistan [[#Uzbekistan|continues to pursue such programs]].&lt;ref name=bbc-news-2012-04-12 /&gt;

===Other countries===
Eugenics programs including forced sterilization existed in most Northern European countries, as well as other more or less Protestant countries. Other countries that had notably active sterilisation programmes include [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Gunnar Broberg]] and [[Nils Roll-Hansen]], eds., ''Eugenics And the Welfare State: Sterilization Policy in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland'' (Michigan State University Press, 2005), it is unclear whether genocide investigations in regard of Hun descendant and pure Aryan types has been undertaken, and if concealment is attempted through the prevalence of cremation and allegation of psychiatric treatment facial mimicry of Mongolian types.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Iceland]], and some countries in [[Latin America]] (including [[Panama]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Home Secretary]] [[Winston Churchill]] was a noted advocate, and his successor [[Reginald McKenna]] introduced a bill that included forced sterilisation. Writer [[G. K. Chesterton]] led a successful effort to defeat that clause of the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913|1913 Mental Deficiency Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Martin.

In 2015, the [[Court of Protection]] of the [[United Kingdom]] ruled that a woman with six children and an IQ of 70 should be sterilized for her own safety because another pregnancy would have been a "significantly life-threatening event" for her and the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=James Gallagher |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-31128969 |title=Mother of six 'can be sterilised' - court ruling |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=February 4, 2015 |accessdate=February 12, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208051831/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-31128969 |archivedate=February 8, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
