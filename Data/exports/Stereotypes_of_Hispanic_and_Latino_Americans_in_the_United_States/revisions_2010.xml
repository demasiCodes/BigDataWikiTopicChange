In 2003, Serafín Méndez-Méndez and Diane Alverio of the [[National Association of Hispanic Journalists]] reported the following findings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nahj.org/NAHJbrownoutreport03.pdf |title=Network Brownout 2003: The Portrayal of Latinos in Network Television News, 2002 |author=Serafín Méndez-Méndez |coauthors=Diane Alverio |accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher=National Association of Hispanic Journalists |date=December, 2003}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Latino-related stories make up less than 1% of all the stories that appear on [[television network|network]] newscasts, even though Latinos make up more than 13% of the [[Demographics of the United States|U.S. population]].
* [[Crime]], [[terrorism]], [[poverty]] and [[welfare]], and [[illegal immigration]] accounted for 66% of all network stories about Latinos in 2001. 
* The arrest of suspected terrorist [[José Padilla (alleged terrorist)|Jose Padilla]], for allegedly plotting to detonate a "[[dirty bomb]]", occupied a central role in the coverage of Latinos in 2001, with 21 network stories or 18% of all stories that aired on Latinos.
* "The number of Latino-related [[crime]] and [[youth gang]] stories in 2002 was grossly excessive when compared to statistics on crimes involving Latinos."
* "Illegal immigration continues to be an important focus of network news coverage of Latinos."

EthnicMajority.com, a minority empowerment organization, states: "Who we see, hear, and read on television, radio, newspapers, and in movies has a great deal of influence on shaping the attitudes of all Americans. How [[African American|African]], [[Hispanic]] (Latino), and [[Asian American]]s are portrayed in these mediums often stereotypes and reinforces negative images of each ethnic group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnicmajority.com/media_home.htm |title=Diversity in the Media and Entertainment Industries |accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher=EthnicMajority.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
National media watch group [[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting]] (FAIR) points out that in contrast to the media's overrepresentation of minorities as criminals and druggies is their underrepresentation as experts and analysts. FAIR's studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s documented that 92% of ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s  U.S. guests were [[White American|white]], 90% of the ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|NewsHour]]'''s guests were white, and 26 out of 27 repeat commentators on [[National Public Radio]] over a four-month period were white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2527 |title=Racism and Mainstream Media |last=Cohen |first=Jeff |accessdate=2008-06-04 |publisher=Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting |date=1999-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[White Hispanic|White U.S. Hispanics and Latinos]] are often overlooked in the U.S. [[mass media]] and in general American social perceptions, where being "Hispanic or Latino" is often incorrectly given a racial value, usually mixed-race, that is, [[mestizo]], [[mulatto]], or [[zambo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/june97/rodriguez_6-18.html |title=A CULTURAL IDENTITY |author=[[Richard Rodriguez]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rawstory.com/exclusives/tryferis/hispanic.htm |title=Separated by a common language: The case of the white Hispanic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latinos in general are often depicted as all being part of one homogeneous cultural or ethnic group and/or having no defining characteristics; if a country of origin is specified, it is almost invariably either [[Mexico]] or [[Puerto Rico]], regardless of whence the individual or group in question actually hails.
