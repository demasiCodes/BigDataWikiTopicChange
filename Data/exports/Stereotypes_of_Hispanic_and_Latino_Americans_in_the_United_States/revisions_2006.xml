This article primarily discusses Latino stereotypes present in [[United States|American]] culture, but the same or similar stereotypes are present in many other Western societies as well.  [[ethnic stereotypes|Stereotypical]] representations of people of [[Latino]] heritage are often manifested in a society's [[Mass media|media]], [[literature]], [[theatre]] and other creative expressions, but often have very real repercussions for [[Latin Americans]] in daily interactions and in [[current events]].  

In 2003, Serafin Mendez-Mendez and Diane Alverio of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists reported the following findings:
* Latino-related stories make up less than 1% of all the stories that appear on network newscasts, even though Latinos make up more than 13% of the population.
* Crime, terrorism, and illegal immigration accounted for 66% of all network stories about Latinos in 2001.
* The arrest of suspected terrorist [[José Padilla (alleged terrorist)|Jose Padilla]], for allegedly plotting to detonate a "[[dirty bomb]]", occupied a central role in the coverage of Latinos in 2001, with 21 network stories or 18% of all stories that aired on Latinos.
* The number of Latino-related crime stories in 2002 was grossly excessive when compared to statistics on crimes involving Latinos.
* Illegal immigration continues to be an important focus of network news coverage of Latinos.
* Latinos continue to remain virtually absent from network news coverage. &lt;ref&gt;Mendez-Mendez, Serafin and Alverio, Diane. [http://www.nahj.org/NAHJbrownoutreport03.pdf "Network Brownout 2003: The Portrayal of Latinos in Network Television News, 2002."]&lt;/ref&gt;

EthnicMajority.com, a minority empowerment organization, states: "Who we see, hear, and read on television, radio, newspapers, and in movies has a great deal of influence on shaping the attitudes of all Americans. How African, Hispanic (Latino), and Asian Americans are portrayed in these mediums often stereotypes and reinforces negative images of each ethnic group." &lt;ref&gt;EthnicMajority.com. [http://www.ethnicmajority.com/media_home.htm Diversity in the Media and Entertainment Industries.]&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Michigan students Brian Schulz and Jessica Farris made the following statements in their report, "Latino Representation in the Media":
* Latinos as a whole remain the most underrepresented group on television. Although they encompass about 12.5% of the national population, Latinos only account for 2% of characters on television. Furthermore, when they are represented on television, they are portrayed in unfavorable roles such as janitors, drug-dealers, and perpetrators of crime.
* Latinos are more likely to be seen in mug shots than non-Hispanic whites. Latinos were 10% more likely to be featured in stories about judicial and crime news, news of riots and demonstrations, and accident and disaster news than whites.
* Stories in which Latinos are the victims of violent crimes are less likely to appear on primetime news.
* In "reality" shows such as ''Cops'' and ''America's Most Wanted'', Latinos were more likely to be portrayed as criminal perpetrators than non-Hispanic whites. Very few Latino officers were featured in segments of ''Cops''.
* Latinos have historically been portrayed as having difficulty speaking English.
* ''Kingpin'', a Hispanic version of ''The Sopranos'', has been described as "one of the most violent and sexually explicit television shows ever to be shown on a broadcast network" (''USA Today'', 2003). Throughout the show, Latinos are brutally violent and often pictured as glorified drug dealers. Latino males are stereotypically portrayed as the "Latin Lover," the "greaser," and the "bandito". Latina women are portrayed as deviant, "frilly señoritas" or "volcanic temptresses," while unintelligent and passive Latino families are portrayed as deviant and dependent. &lt;ref&gt;Schulz, Brian and Farris, Jessica.

National media watch group Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) points out that the flip side of media's overrepresentation of minorities as criminals and druggies is their underrepresentation as experts and analysts. FAIR's studies in the late 1980s and early '90s documented that 92% of ''Nightline'' 's U.S. guests were white, 90% of the ''NewsHour'' 's guests were white, and 26 out of 27 repeat commentators on National Public Radio over a four-month period were white. &lt;ref&gt;Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting.

[[Univision]], the largest Latino cable station, shows an almost universal bias toward white Latinos despite a giant population of [[Afro-Latin Americans]].

Examples of Latin stereotypes include:  [[Scarface]] which perpetuates the stereotype that latinos are incestuous megalomaniacs.  [[Selena]] which features the stereotypical homely latina with big dreams.  Latinos are often portrayed as knife-wielding; [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]], [[Training Day]], [[Robin Williams: Live]]. [[Con Air]] hit several points with the stereotypical [[homosexual]] latino felon. Another stereotype includes that they don't know [[English language|English]] very well in contrast to the general population.
