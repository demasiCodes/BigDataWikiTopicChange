According to this theory, inequality may exist and persist between demographic groups even when economic agents are rational and non-prejudiced.

The theory was pioneered by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Edmund Phelps]] &lt;ref&gt;Fang, Hanming and Andrea Moro, 2011, "Theories of Statistical Discrimination and Affirmative Action: A Survey," in Jess Benhabib, Matthew Jackson and Alberto Bisin, eds: Handbook of Social Economics, Vol. 1A, Chapter 5, The Netherlands: North Holland, 2011, pp. 133-200. Available as [http://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/15860.html NBER Working Papers 15860], National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discrimination can result in a self-reinforcing [[vicious circle]] over time, as the atypical individuals from the discriminated group are discouraged from participating in the market,&lt;ref name="Rodgers2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=William M. Rodgers|title=Handbook on the Economics of Discrimination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RiVATAL4Om0C&amp;pg=PA223|year=2009|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84720-015-0|pages=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; or improving their skills as their (average) return on investment (education etc.) is less than for the non-discriminated group.&lt;ref name="Dau-Schmidt2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. G. Dau-Schmidt|title=Labor and Employment Law and Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NE5AK4P6kWsC&amp;pg=PA304|year=2009|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-78195-306-8|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related form of (theorized) statistical discrimination is based on group [[variance]]s, assuming equal averages. For discrimination to occur in this scenario, the decision maker needs to be [[risk averse]]; such a decision maker will prefer the group with the lower variance.&lt;ref name="England1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paula England|title=Comparable Worth: Theories and Evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFLk3v19b0gC&amp;pg=PA58|year=1992|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-202-30348-2|pages=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even assuming two theoretically identical group distributions (in all respects, including average and variance), a risk averse decision maker will prefer the group for which a measurement (test) exists that minimizes the [[error term]].&lt;ref name="England1992"/&gt; For example, if two groups, A and B, have theoretically identical distributions of test scores well above the average for the entire population, but group A's estimate is considered more reliable because a large amount of data may be available for group A in comparison to group B, then if two people, one from A and one from B apply for a job, using statistical discrimination, A is hired, because it is perceived that his group score is a more reliable estimate, so a risk-averse decision maker sees group B's group score as more likely to be luck. Conversely, if the two groups are below average, B is hired, because group A's negative score is believed to be a better estimate.

It has been suggested that home mortgage lending discrimination against [[African Americans]], which is illegal in the [[United States]], may be partly caused by statistical discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandfed.org/Research/Commentary/1995/1100.pdf Rooting Out Discrimination in Home Mortgage Lending -]&lt;/ref&gt;

Market forces are expected to penalize some forms of statistical discrimination; for example, a company capable and willing to test its job applicants on relevant metrics is expected to do better than one that relies only on group averages for employment decisions.&lt;ref name="Nechyba2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas J.
