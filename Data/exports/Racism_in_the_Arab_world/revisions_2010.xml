Witnesses wrote in 1976 about the "deplorable racism of the Arab world," and that it goes back a long time. &lt;ref&gt;Ebony – Apr 1976 – Page 15 Vol. 31, No. 6 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Q-YDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA15]&lt;/ref&gt;

The previously forbidden topics of race and racism in the Arab world are being explored more since the rise of independent media.  In one example, [[Al-Jazeera]]'s critical coverage of the [[Darfur crisis]] led to the arrest and conviction of its Khartoum bureau chief.&lt;ref&gt;''Middle East report'': Issues 234-235; Issues 237-241 , Middle East Research &amp; Information Project, 2005, p. 54, p 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racist attitudes==
[[The Guardian]]'s journalist [[Brian Whitaker]] wrote on ''The race taboo,'' an excerpt: &lt;blockquote&gt;The existence of racist attitudes within Arab countries is often denied, resulting in scandalous displays of prejudice against certain ethnic groups. The Arab countries, mostly are in denial. The A to Z of ethnic and religious groups in the Middle East embraces Alawites, Armenians, Assyrians, Baha'is, Berbers, Chaldeans, Copts, Druzes, Ibadis, Ismailis, Jews, Kurds, Maronites, Sahrawis, Tuareq, Turkmen, Yazidis and Zaidis (by no means an exhaustive list), and yet serious discussion of ethnic/religious diversity and its place in society is a long-standing taboo.
If the existence of non-Arab or non-Muslim groups is acknowledged at all, it is usually only to declare how wonderfully everyone gets along.
&lt;ref&gt;Brian Whitaker: The existence of racist attitudes within some Arab countries is often denied, resulting in scandalous displays of prejudice against certain ethnic groups.

[[Mona Edeltahawy]] is a columnist for [[Egypt]]'s Al Masry Al Youm and [[Qatar]]'s Al Arab wrote in the [[New York Times]] "'''Racism The Arab world's dirty secret'''" she cites witnessing to racist attacks by Arab Egyptians on blacks when no one objects to it, she admits:
''We are a racist people in Egypt and we are in deep denial about it. On my Facebook page, I blamed racism for my argument and an Egyptian man wrote to deny that we are racists and used as his proof a program on Egyptian Radio featuring Sudanese songs and poetry!
Our silence over racism not only destroys the warmth and hospitality we are proud of as Egyptians, it has deadly consequences''.

She concludes that nothing but [[racism]] is behind police cracking down on 5,000 Sudanese refugees, or beating to death many of them including women and children
and what she calls "bloody statistics in [[Egypt]].

She continues on her witnessing: "The racism I saw on the Cairo Metro has an echo in the Arab world at large, where the suffering in Darfur goes ignored because its victims are black and because those who are creating the misery in Darfur are not Americans or Israelis and we only pay attention when America and Israel behave badly."

Lamenting: "We love to cry "Islamophobia" when we talk about the way Muslim minorities are treated in the West and yet we never stop to consider how we treat minorities and the most vulnerable among us."

She cites how instances in the U.S. where Arabs/Muslims have been – rarely – treated bad, yet, most have interfered against this, whereas in Egypt (as well as in the Arab world) the racist deafening silence is horrendously telling about the Arab racist society. &lt;ref name=mona&gt;Racism The Arab world's dirty secret, Mona Edeeltahawy, [[New York Times]], December 10, 2008 [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/opinion/10iht-edeltahawy.1.18556273.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==

Author draws parallel between Arab nationalism and Turkish nationalism, both were "likewise evolving into the "racial" stage, the ideal being a great "Pan-Arab" empire, embracing not merely the ethnically Arab peninsula-homeland, [[Syria]], and [[Mesopotamia]], but also the Arabized regions of [[Egypt]], [[Tripoli]], [[France|French]] [[North Africa]] and the [[Sudan]]."
&lt;ref&gt;''The New World of Islam'' by Lothrop Stoddard, 2009, History, p. 201 [http://books.google.com/books?id=IDAnAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA201], ''The Middle East, abstracts and index,'' Part 4 about "Jihadi Movements Worldwide: Abstracts &amp; Documents", p. 1111, from Library Information and Research Service Published by Northumberland Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Tarek Fatah explains that&lt;blockquote&gt; the majority of the Arab constitutions declare the sharia as the basis of legislation, prevent&lt;nowiki&gt;[ing]&lt;/nowiki&gt; most of the countries that pretend to be Islamic States from living up to the standards set by the 1948 United Nations Declaration of Universal Human Rights. It also legitimizes the notion of racial and religious superiority, and allows for multiple levels of citizenship and widespread and systemic discrimination against racial and religious minorities living within a state's borders. Invariably, the human rights of the weak and dispossessed, the minorities and women, the disabled and the heretics, are trampled upon without the slightest sense of guilt or wrongdoing. Men and women are imprisoned, routinely tortured and often killed, while numbed citizens, fearful of offending Islam, unsure about their own rights, insecure about their own identities, allow these violations to continue. By looking the other way, the intelligentsia and middle classes have become complicit in these crimes. They justify their inaction as patriotism, where they stand in solidarity with the Islamic State, with the misguided idea that those who fight for universal human rights are somehow working for Western imperialism or represent the interests of Judeo-Christian civilization.
&lt;ref&gt;''Chasing a Mirage: The Tragic Illusion of an Islamic State,'' by Tarek Fatah [http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090424.wbkdonnerexcerpt_fatah/BNStory/globebooks/home?cid=al_gam_mostemail]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Christians of Iraq]] site published an extensive historic account on "The Foolishness of imposing Oppressive Arab Nationalism on Non Arabs, Non-Arab Muslim minorities such as the Amazigh, or Berbers, Kurds, and Turkmen found themselves officially out of favor. They faced the prospect of becoming "Arabized" or of being denied political and even civil rights. Groups that identified themselves as neither Arab nor Muslim had it even worse: Southern Sudanese, Copts, Jews, and Assyrians were plunged into a protracted nightmare that saw their communities ground into anonymity, forcing many to emigrate permanently. Even Maronites, whose retention of political power in Lebanon immunized them from utter marginalization, watched with alarm as Arab nationalist propaganda increasingly portrayed them as a foreign and sinister element in the heart of the Arab nation." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.christiansofiraq.com/ArabismMar236.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Walid Phares]] writes about Arabism's denial of identity of millions of indigenous non-Arab nations as an ethnic cleansing on a politico-cultural level. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabicbible.com/christian/intro_arab_christians.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A writer on the [[Durban]] conference regarding racism suggests: That stressing out that "Arabism is racism" would have been an interesting debating topic. Yet, he adds that "the [[OIC]]
countries were very clever in how they deflected the [[slavery]] issue that could so easily have been turned on them with a vengeance."&lt;ref&gt;''Out of step: life-story of a politician : politics and religion in a world at war'' by Jack Brian Bloom, Indiana University, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Muslim]] activists have also expressed that, "Arabism is racism, pure and simple."&lt;ref&gt;Africa events, Volume 7, published by Dar es Salaam Ltd., 1991, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;, There was Sheikh Mustafa al-Maraghi, who in a famous 1938 essay dismissed the goal of [pan] Arab unity as racist
&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=9casPE-sbXIC&amp;pg=PA29&lt;/ref&gt;,
[[Arab]] [[Muslim]] authors in "Arab-[[Iran]]ian relations": &lt;blockquote&gt;Much ink has flowed on the issue of Arab nationalism. Some people believe it to be a racist movement, advocating the superiority of the Arabs.

Haseeb, Markaz Dirāsāt al-Waḥdah al-Arabīyah, Beirut, Lebanon, published by Centre for Arab Unity Studies, 1998, p. 368 [http://books.google.com/books?id=UaptAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=superiority]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Islamic activist: talks about "the rise of Pan-Arab racism towards non-Arabized Black Africans that still reverberate through regions of the Sudan, Central Africa, Western and Northern Sahara and East Africa." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.proudfleshjournal.com/issue5/bin-wahad.html&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Muslim]] scholar writes that "the Ba'th party, which sowed a Pan-Arabist ideology, was responsible for the genocide of Kurdish people in Iraq as well as the genocide of Shiite Arabs in Iraq. and that "Pan-Arabism does not recognize minorities living in the Arab world. Everybody in this "world" is an Arab."

[[Ali A. Allawi]], the former [[Iraq]]i Minister of Defense and Finance, envisioning a peaceful Iraq: "Arabism, racism and sectarianism – would be dethroned. Iraq would be at peace with itself and with its region." &lt;ref&gt;Ali A. Allawi, ''The occupation of Iraq: winning the war, losing the peace'' p. 438 [http://books.google.com/books?id=Cwc3_TTqYhsC&amp;pg=PA438]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960's, the [[France|French]] Comite d' Action de Defense De- mocratique published a pamphlet titled Racism and Pan-Arabism, it's introduction followed by an article by the well known [[France|French]] sociologist, anthropologist &amp; political leader: [[Jackes Soustelle]] to fight against all kinds of racism, this was followed by a paper by Shlomo Friedrich on "Pan-Arabism: A New Racist Menace?" who offered a sharp critique of [[Nasser]]'s book The Philosophy of the Revolution, and it terms it a mere pale imitation of [[Hitler]]'s [[Mein Kampf]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=Xt7f6WBEP0EC&amp;pg=PA187&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Liberation Forces of Mauritania]] Speaking on Slavery and Genocide in the Sahel, said "those two governments" (Sudan &amp; Mauritania) "went to the same school—the school of Arabization. The professor was [[Saddam Hussein]], and the doctrine was developed in [[Egypt]] by [[Nasser]]. They follow the pattern of [[Ba'athism]] and [[Nasserism]]. implement a policy of Arabization in [[Mauritania]] and [[Sudan]]." &lt;ref&gt;http://towardfreedom.com/home/content/view/902&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism – overview==

Jon Lewis (a Mid-East expert whose works on the Arab world's persecution of minorities have appeared in the [[Wall Street Journal]], [[Forward]], In the National Interest, Middle East Quarterly and other prestigious publications) laments the media coverage of Darfur, its lack of historic context, clarifying that Darfur is but one example of Arab racism toward non-Arabs within the broader "Arab world."  he believes that the Darfur genocide, "must be viewed not solely as a case of an Islamic jihad, but also as a case of Arab racism", he also draws parallels to Saddam Hussein's genocide against Kurds and the [[Algeria]]n government's repression of the Kaybles."
He adds that without downplaying the Islamic Jihad aspect in both the [[Kurds]] and Kabyles who are primarily [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]], yet, "we cannot understand the violence in [[Darfur]] (and Iraq, for that matter) without examining the persistence of intra-Muslim ethnic conflict in the region and Arab racism."

In an interview 'White Skin, Black Mask' [[Alteria|Algerian]] author Kamel Riahi explained:
"It might come as a surprise to you to learn that Negro was the term people called my black grandfather. I consider myself as someone of a Negro decent, although I am not black. Perhaps my wide nose proves this theory. Therefore, I am sympathetic towards the blacks ideologically, by heritage and by history. We, the whites, will not be liberated until we liberate ourselves from the racist views we have of other races and religions."
He goes on in denouncing the massive common racism in the Arab world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We still curse each other using "you’re Jewish" or "you’re Kurdish", this is also racial and religious discrimination. Watch any Egyptian sitcom and tell me about the image of the Sudanese character. Listen to the Tunisian jokes about the Libyans or jokes about people from Hums in Greater Syria. Listen to the debates regarding noble families and family lineage… even horses now are divided between what is considered "noble" and what is not. We are racists to the bones. Attempting to hide or silence this fact will not help with the matter because we are a sick society which still suffers from the complexes of color and race.&lt;ref&gt;White skin black mask interview with Kamel Riahi [http://beirut39.blogspot.com/2010/03/white-skin-black-mask-interview-with.html] [http://kamelriahi.elaphblog.com/Posts.aspx?U=1291&amp;A=44329]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some charge that "ultra-Arabism and Jihadism have been responsible for widespread pesecution and genocide." such Saddam's using chemical weapons and gas against the [[Kurds]] during the bombings of Halabja in northern Iraq. "The Kurds, a non-Arab people whose language belongs to the Iranian group, have suffered from persecution under the Baath of Iraq and Syria, especially since the departure of British and French forces in the late 1940s." (Kurds are also claiming rights in Iran and Turkey.) The Berbers, the pre-Arab native peoples of have been victomized by the Arabs in North Africa.
