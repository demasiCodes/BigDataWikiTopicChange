'''Racism in the Arab world''' covers an array of forms of intolerance against non-Arab groups, minorities in the Middle East and Arab rule on sub-Saharan Africans.

The previously forbidden topics of race and racism in the Arab world have been explored more since the rise of independent media. In one example, [[Al-Jazeera]]'s critical coverage of the [[Darfur crisis]] led to the arrest and conviction of its Khartoum bureau chief.&lt;ref&gt;''Middle East report'': Issues 234-235; Issues 237-241 , Middle East Research &amp; Information Project, 2005, p. 54, p 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racist attitudes==
[[The Guardian]]'s journalist [[Brian Whitaker]] wrote on ''the race taboo,'' an excerpt: &lt;blockquote&gt;Racism is a worldwide phenomenon. In some countries it's met with disapproval, in others with denial. The A to Z of ethnic and religious groups in the Middle East embraces Alawites, Armenians, Assyrians, Baha'is, Berbers, Chaldeans, Copts, Druzes, Ibadis, Ismailis, Jews, Kurds, Maronites, Sahrawis, Tuareq, Turkmen, Yazidis and Zaidis (by no means an exhaustive list), and yet serious discussion of ethnic/religious diversity and its place in society is a long-standing taboo.
If the existence of non-Arab or non-Muslim groups is acknowledged at all, it is usually only to declare how wonderfully everyone gets along.
&lt;ref&gt;Brian Whitaker: The existence of racist attitudes within some Arab countries is often denied, resulting in scandalous displays of prejudice against certain ethnic groups. Friday 8 September 2006, [[The Guardian]][http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/sep/08/racisminthemiddleeast]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mona Eltahawy]], a columnist for [[Egypt]]'s Al Masry Al Youm and [[Qatar]]'s Al Arab, wrote in the [[New York Times]] an article titled, '''Racism The Arab world's dirty secret'''. She was a witness to racist attacks by Arab Egyptians on blacks and stated: "We are a racist people in Egypt and we are in deep denial about it. On my Facebook page, I blamed racism for my argument and an Egyptian man wrote to deny that we are racists and used as his proof a program on Egyptian Radio featuring Sudanese songs and poetry! Our silence over racism not only destroys the warmth and hospitality we are proud of as Egyptians, it has deadly consequences." She believed [[racism]] was behind a police crackdown on 5,000 [[Sudanese refugees]] and the beating to death of some women and children. She added: "The racism I saw on the Cairo Metro has an echo in the Arab world at large, where the suffering in Darfur goes ignored because its victims are black and because those who are creating the misery in Darfur are not Americans or Israelis and we only pay attention when America and Israel behave badly." She criticized the country's attitudes: "We love to cry 'Islamophobia' when we talk about the way Muslim minorities are treated in the West and yet we never stop to consider how we treat minorities and the most vulnerable among us." While noting that racist incidents are condemned in the United States, she said that in Egypt, as well as in the Arab world, there is a culture of silence toward racist incidents which reflects negatively on Arab society.&lt;ref name=mona&gt;Racism The Arab world's dirty secret, Mona Eltahawy, [[New York Times]], December 10, 2008 [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/opinion/10iht-edeltahawy.1.18556273.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations against specific Arab governments==

According to [[Holly Burkhalter]] of [[Human Rights Watch]], in a statement made in testimony before the Congress of the United States, "It is fair to say that the Mauritanian government practices undeclared apartheid and severely discriminates on the basis of race."&lt;ref name="ChristopherWise"&gt;Yambo Ouologuem: postcolonial writer, Islamic militant, Christopher Wise, Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1999, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racist incidents by Arabs==
[[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] singer [[Haifa Wehbe]] released an album containing lyrics calling [[Nubian people|Nubian]] black people in Egypt "monkeys".

In Lebanon in June 2010, Lebanese Internal Security Forces crashed a Sudanese cancer fundraiser in [[Beirut]]. During the incident, the Lebanese Arabs called the Sudanese "animals" and "niggers", while physically hitting them with batons. They used extreme physical force and violence against the Sudanese and also used racial epithets. The Sudanese, who held citizenship of Sudan, were legally residing in Lebanon. While pressing their boots on the bodies of the Sudanese, the Lebanese made the Sudanese lie postrate with their stomachs touching the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lebanon seeks to contain fallout from raid on Sudanese cancer fundraising event|author=(ST)|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/Lebanon-seeks-to-contain-fallout,35454|newspaper=SUDAN TRIBUNE|date=June 20, 2010|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Relations between Sudan and Lebanon turn sour.|author=ASHARQ AL AWSAT|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Relations+between+Sudan+and+Lebanon+turn+sour.-a0231714936|newspaper=The Middle East Reporter|year=2010|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gulf Arab countries, specifically Kuwait Arabs have behaved in a racist and violent manner towards Blacks, Kurds and South Asians like [[India]]ns, [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]]s, [[Bangladeshi people|Bangladeshi]]s, [[Afghanistan|Afghans]], [[Sri Lankans]] and other foreigners.

There have been reports of discrimination against Pakistani, [[Indian people|Indians]], [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], [[Malaysian people|Malaysians]] and [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesians]], particularly toward house-maids and blue collar labour.

The national news papers have standardised job classifieds with references by employers, seeking candidates who are e.g. " Western Educated", "Arab Educated", "Indian Educated" ... to denote the employers' racial preference in a candidate. Candidates of different national / ethnic origins are offered different pay and employment contracts based on their ethnic origin.

According to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), Black African immigrants to Egypt often face physical violence and verbal abuse at the hands of the general public and law enforcement officials. refugee from Sudan are especially targeted, with racial slurs like "oonga boonga" and "samara" (meaning "black") constituting the most typical insults. The EIPR attributes the violence and abuse to both a lack of government efforts at disseminating information, raising awareness and dispelling myths with regard to the economic contributions made by the newcomers, and stereotyping on the part of the Egyptian media.&lt;ref name="EIPR"&gt;[http://eipr.org/en/report/2010/03/06/635/639 Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights - III. Racist attitudes and Racially-Motivated Identity Checks and Detentions]&lt;/ref&gt; Black women are also targets of sexual harassment.&lt;ref name=racismdivide/&gt; As a remedy, the EIPR recommends that the Egyptian government "should intensify and accelerate efforts to combat racist and xenophobic views towards migrant workers, especially those of Black African origin, and to promote awareness of their positive contribution to society. The government should train all personnel working in the field of criminal justice and law enforcement officials in the spirit of respect for human rights and non-discrimination on ethnic or racial grounds."&lt;ref name="EIPR"/&gt;

==Ideology==
Author draws parallel between Arab nationalism and Turkish nationalism, both were "likewise evolving into the "racial" stage, the ideal being a great "Pan-Arab" empire, embracing not merely the ethnically Arab peninsula-homeland, [[Syria]], and [[Mesopotamia]], but also the Arabized regions of [[Egypt]], [[Tripoli]], [[France|French]] [[North Africa]] and the [[Sudan]]."
&lt;ref&gt;''The New World of Islam'' by Lothrop Stoddard, 2009, History, p. 201 [http://books.google.com/books?id=IDAnAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA201], ''The Middle East, abstracts and index,'' Part 4 about "Jihadi Movements Worldwide: Abstracts &amp; Documents", p. 1111, from Library Information and Research Service Published by Northumberland Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Tarek Fatah explained that&lt;blockquote&gt; the majority of the Arab constitutions declare the sharia as the basis of legislation, prevent&lt;nowiki&gt;[ing]&lt;/nowiki&gt; most of the countries that pretend to be Islamic States from living up to the standards set by the 1948 United Nations Declaration of Universal Human Rights. It also legitimizes the notion of racial and religious superiority, and allows for multiple levels of citizenship and widespread and systemic discrimination against racial and religious minorities living within a state's borders. Invariably, the human rights of the weak and dispossessed, the minorities and women, the disabled and the heretics, are trampled upon without the slightest sense of guilt or wrongdoing. Men and women are imprisoned, routinely tortured and often killed, while numbed citizens, fearful of offending Islam, unsure about their own rights, insecure about their own identities, allow these violations to continue. By looking the other way, the intelligentsia and middle classes have become complicit in these crimes. They justify their inaction as patriotism, where they stand in solidarity with the Islamic State, with the misguided idea that those who fight for universal human rights are somehow working for Western imperialism or represent the interests of Judeo-Christian civilization.

[[Christians of Iraq]] site published an extensive historic account on "the Foolishness of imposing Oppressive Arab Nationalism on Non Arabs, Non-Arab Muslim minorities such as the Amazigh, or Berbers, Kurds, and Turkmen found themselves officially out of favor. They faced the prospect of becoming "Arabized" or of being denied political and even civil rights. Groups that identified themselves as neither Arab nor Muslim had it even worse: Southern Sudanese, Copts, Jews, and Assyrians were plunged into a protracted nightmare that saw their communities ground into anonymity, forcing many to emigrate permanently. Even Maronites, whose retention of political power in Lebanon immunized them from utter marginalization, watched with alarm as Arab nationalist propaganda increasingly portrayed them as a foreign and sinister element in the heart of the Arab nation." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiansofiraq.com/ArabismMar236.html |title=The Foolishness of imposing Oppressive Arab Nationalism on Non Arabs |publisher=Christiansofiraq.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism – overview==

Jon Lewis (a Mid-East expert whose works on the Arab world's persecution of minorities have appeared in the [[Wall Street Journal]], [[The Forward|Forward]], In the National Interest, Middle East Quarterly and other prestigious publications) laments the media coverage of Darfur, its lack of historic context, clarifying that Darfur is but one example of Arab racism toward non-Arabs within the broader "Arab world."  he believes that the Darfur genocide, "must be viewed not solely as a case of an Islamic jihad, but also as a case of Arab racism", he also draws parallels to Saddam Hussein's genocide against Kurds and the [[Algeria]]n government's repression of the Kaybles."
He adds that without downplaying the Islamic Jihad aspect in both the [[Kurds]] and Kabyles who are primarily [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]], yet, "we cannot understand the violence in [[Darfur]] (and Iraq, for that matter) without examining the persistence of intra-Muslim ethnic conflict in the region and Arab racism."

In an interview 'White Skin, Black Mask' the Tunisian-born, [[Alteria|Algerian]] author [[Kamel Riahi]] explained:
"It might come as a surprise to you to learn that Negro was the term people called my black grandfather. I consider myself as someone of a Negro decent, although I am not black. Perhaps my wide nose proves this theory. Therefore, I am sympathetic towards the blacks ideologically, by heritage and by history. We, the whites, will not be liberated until we liberate ourselves from the racist views we have of other races and religions."
He goes on in denouncing the massive common racism in the Arab world:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We still curse each other using "you’re Jewish" or "you’re Kurdish", this is also racial and religious discrimination. Watch any Egyptian sitcom and tell me about the image of the Sudanese character. Listen to the Tunisian jokes about the Libyans or jokes about people from Hums in Greater Syria. Listen to the debates regarding noble families and family lineage… even horses now are divided between what is considered "noble" and what is not. We are racists to the bones. Attempting to hide or silence this fact will not help with the matter because we are a sick society which still suffers from the complexes of color and race.&lt;ref&gt;White skin black mask interview with Kamel Riahi [http://beirut39.blogspot.com/2010/03/white-skin-black-mask-interview-with.html] [http://kamelriahi.elaphblog.com/Posts.aspx?U=1291&amp;A=44329]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some charge that "ultra-Arabism and Jihadism have been responsible for widespread pesecution and genocide." such Saddam's using chemical weapons and gas against the [[Kurds]] during the bombings of Halabja in northern Iraq. "The Kurds, a non-Arab people whose language belongs to the Iranian group, have suffered from persecution under the Baath of Iraq and Syria, especially since the departure of British and French forces in the late 1940s." (Kurds are also claiming rights in Iran and Turkey.) The Berbers, the pre-Arab native peoples of have been victomized by the Arabs in North Africa.
