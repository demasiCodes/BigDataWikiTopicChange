They are of interest because of the apparent prevalence in the aftermath of the [[Cold War]] and because they frequently result in [[war crime]]s such as [[genocide]].

Two controversial questions about ethnic wars is whether they have become more or less prevalent in the post-Cold War period and whether they are really about ethnicity at all. Actual research shows that the fall of [[Communism]] and the increase in the number of democratic states were accompanied by a sudden and dramatic decline in total warfare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars, and the number of [[refugees]] and [[displaced person]]s [http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/conflict.htm].

There are a number of political scientists who refer to the concept of ethnic wars as a myth because they argue that the root causes of ethnic conflict do not involve ethnicity but rather institutional, political, and economic factors.  These political scientists argue that the concept of ethnic war is misleading because it leads to the conclusion that certain groups are doomed to fight each other when in fact the wars between them are the result of political decisions. Opposing groups may substitute ethnicity for the underlying factors to simplify identification of friend and foe.

A classic example of the reformulation of economic differences as ethnic differences is found in [[Rwanda]].  In a 1930s census, all people owning ten or more head of cattle were classified as Tutsi; everyone else was classified as Hutu.
