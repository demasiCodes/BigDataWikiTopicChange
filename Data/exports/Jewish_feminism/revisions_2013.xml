'''Jewish feminism''' is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and [[social status]] of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major branches of Judaism.

In its modern form, the Jewish feminist movement can be traced to the early 1970s in the United States. According to [[Judith Plaskow]], who has focused on feminism in [[Reform Judaism]], the main issues for early Jewish feminists were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or ''[[minyan]]'', the exemption from [[Positive time-bound mitzvot|positive time-bound]] ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'', and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate [[Jewish view of marriage#Divorce|divorce]].&lt;ref name=Plaskow1997&gt;Plaskow, Judith. "Jewish Feminist Thought" in Frank, Daniel H. &amp; Leaman, Oliver. ''History of Jewish Philosophy'', Routledge, first published 1997; this edition 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Paula Hyman]], two articles published in the 1970s on the role of [[women in Judaism]] were particularly influential: "The Unfreedom of Jewish Women," published in 1970 in the ''Jewish Spectator'' by its editor, [[Trude Weiss-Rosmarin]], which criticized the treatment of women in [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and an article by [[Rachel Adler]], then an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]] and currently a professor at the [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]], called "[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:_aHy1mQXk-wJ:jwa.org/feminism/_html/_pdf/JWA001c.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgKmt25OwE0fl_Yilu_Ayd2XrtUpxtH52C6zkfrOLO9kO3MY2xVhkqGBpT6zzezOqIk1LBVxYL-V6FOndSiaBz7r2-hb4hLFEXlO_0b69WFpJG3VFbA2re0sEij_EvX3Ji0fDdu&amp;sig=AHIEtbRjKD8kuUm-7s5FWSmOBXwcs6djSA&amp;pli=1 The Jew Who Wasn't There: Halacha and the Jewish Woman]," published in 1971 in ''Davka,'' a countercultural magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Rachel.

== Agunah ==

[[Agunah]] ({{lang-he|עגונה}}, plural: agunot (עגונות); literally 'anchored or chained') is a [[halakha|halachic]] term for a [[Jewish]] woman who is "chained" to her [[marriage]]. The classic case of this is a man who has left on a journey and has not returned, or has gone into battle and is [[missing in action|MIA]]. It also refers to a woman whose husband refuses, or is unable, to grant her an official bill of [[divorce]], known as a ''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]''. The problem of get-refusal became more widespread when Jews lived in countries where civil divorce was available, separate from religious divorce. Outside Israel, an ''agunah'' could obtain a civil divorce and remarry via [[civil marriage]], as non-Israeli legal systems generally do not recognize the ''agunah'' status, but an ''agunah'' would not typically pursue a second marriage, since her first marriage is still valid according to halakha, therefore any other sexual relationships would constitute [[adultery]] from her first husband. Furthermore, according to halakha, any children born by an agunah are considered [[mamzer]]im (bastards). The earliest prenuptial agreement for the prevention of get-refusal was developed and accepted by the Rabbinical Council of Morocco on December 16, 1953 ("Sefer Hatakanot", Vol. 1, The Institute for Moroccan Jewish Tradition, Jerusalem). The prenuptial agreement gained further approbation in 1981 from Rabbi Shalom Messas, chief rabbi of Jerusalem ("Sefer Tevuot Shemesh", Jerusalem 1981). Following Rabbi Messas' involvement, the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] actively pursued this issue (“The RCA Commission: Solving the Problem of Gittin", Hamevaser, Vol. 22 No. 2, October 27, 1983). The latest in a series of RCA resolutions -- "that since there is a significant agunah problem in America and throughout the Jewish world, no rabbi should officiate at a wedding where a proper prenuptial agreement on get has not been executed”—was passed on May 18, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100772 Rabbinical Council of America (RCA)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the International Rabbinic Fellowship (IRF), an international organization of (as of 2012) 150 Modern Orthodox rabbis, passed a resolution saying that, "IRF Rabbis may not officiate at a wedding unless the couple has signed a halachic prenuptial agreement. IRF Rabbis are further encouraged to participate ritually only in weddings in which the couple has signed a halachic prenuptial agreement. Ritual participation includes but is not limited to reading the [[ketubah]], serving as a witness, and making one of the [[sheva berachot]]." This makes the IRF the only Orthodox rabbinical organization in the world to require its members to use a halachic pre-nuptial agreement in any wedding at which they officiate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalrabbinicfellowship.org/news/international-rabbinic-fellowship-takes-historic-step-prevent-future-agunot International Rabbinic Fellowship Takes Historic Step to Prevent Future Agunot | International Rabbinical Fellowship&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1950s, some Conservative rabbis have used the [[Lieberman clause]], named for Talmudic scholar and [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] (JTS) professor [[Saul Lieberman]], in the ''[[ketuba]]'', requiring that a get be granted if a civil divorce is ever issued.  Most Orthodox rabbis have rejected the Lieberman clause, although leaders of the Conservative movement claim that the original intent was to find a solution that could be used by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis alike, and that leaders of Orthodox Judaism's [[Rabbinical Council of America]], and respected Orthodox rabbis, including [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], supposedly recognized the clause as valid. Later, because some civil courts viewed the enforcement of a religious document as a violation of the [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] principle of the [[separation of church and state]],  Conservative rabbis began to require couples to sign a separate letter, stating that the clause had been explained to them as part of pre-marital counseling, and that both parties understood and agreed to its conditions, recognizing that this letter would constitute a separate civil document, enforceable in a civilian court. However, many Conservative rabbis, including some on the movement's own [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards|law committee]], had growing misgivings about the clause for religious reasons.

In 1968, by a unanimous vote of the law committee, it was decided that the Joint Bet Din of the Conservative movement could annul marriages as a last resort, based on the Talmudic principle of ''hafka'at kiddushin.'' According to Rabbi Mayer Rabinowitz, the Chairman of the Joint Bet Din of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Movement]], just the threat of this action was sometimes enough to compel the former husband to grant a get.

In 1990 Agunah Day was established by ICAR - The International Coalition for Agunah Rights - to raise public awareness of the plight of the Agunah and galvanize action to solve the problem. It is observed on the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]] date of the [[Fast of Esther]].

In 1995 the Israeli parliament gave the rabbinical court expanded legal power to sanction men who refuse to give their wives a ''get'' by suspending their driver's licenses, seizing their bank accounts, preventing travel abroad and even imprisoning those who do not comply with an order to grant a divorce; however, women's groups say the 1995 law is not very effective because the court uses sanctions in less than 2% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-fg-israel-divorce-problems-20130726,0,4730957.story Israel divorce law traps women in marriages that died long ago - latimes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Justice Menachem HaCohen of the [[Jerusalem]] Family Court offered new hope to ''agunot'' when he ruled that a man refusing his wife a ''get'' must pay her NIS 425,000 in punitive damages, because "[R]efusal to grant a ''get'' constitutes a severe infringement on her ability to lead a reasonable, normal life, and can be considered emotional abuse lasting several years." He noted that "[T]his is not another sanction against someone refusing to give a ''get'', intended to speed up the process of granting a ''get'', and this court is not involving itself in any future arrangements for the granting of a ''get'', but rather, it is a direct response to the consequences that stem from not granting a ''get'', and the right of the woman to receive punitive damages." This ruling stemmed from the Public Litigation Project initiated by the advocacy organization [[Center for Women's Justice Israel|Center for Women's Justice]] as one of a number of successful lawsuits filed in Israeli civil courts claiming financial damages against recalcitrant husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Susan|title=The Tort of Get Refusal: Why Tort and Why Not?|journal=Conversations|series=Orthodoxy: Family &amp; Gender Issues|issue=5|url=http://www.jewishideas.org/articles/tort-get-refusal-why-tort-and-why-not|accessdate=July 19, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110703092706/http://www.jewishideas.org/articles/tort-get-refusal-why-tort-and-why-not| archivedate= 3 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 [[David Ben-Gurion]] agreed that the authority in matters of marriage and divorce would be invested in the hands of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and an agreement was signed stating that (among other matters), known as the "status quo letter." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/10/civil-marriage-israel-jews-secular-orthodox-rabbinical-court.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 the [[Knesset]] enacted the Rabbinical Courts Jurisdiction (Marriage and Divorce) Law, 5713 – 1953. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02840.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 1 of the Law states, "Matters of marriage and divorce of Jews in Israel, being citizens or residents of the State, shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02840.html&lt;/ref&gt; The substantive provision of section 2 of this Law further states: "Marriages and divorces of Jews shall be performed in Israel in accordance with Jewish religious law" (din torah). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02840.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, a Muslim woman in Israel may petition for and receive a divorce through the Sharia courts without her husband's consent under certain conditions, and a marriage contract may provide for other circumstances in which she may obtain a divorce without her husband's consent. A Muslim man in Israel may divorce his wife without her consent and without petitioning the court.&lt;ref name="hr2010"&gt;2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories.

In 2006, Israel’s Supreme Court ruled that women should be allowed to deliver eulogies and that the burial societies, or chevra kadisha, should not impose gender segregation in the cemetery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/religion/article/israeli_chief_rabbinical_council_oks_eulogies_by_women_20120612 Israeli Chief Rabbinical Council OKs eulogies by women | Religion | Jewish Journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling was in response to an incident in [[Petach Tikvah]] in which a woman was stopped from eulogizing her father.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, the court’s ruling was not backed up by the Religious Services Ministry until 2012, when Israel’s Chief Rabbinical Council ruled that women can deliver eulogies at funerals, but that it is up to the community rabbi to decide on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In 2010, Israel passed the Civil Union Law, allowing a couple to marry civilly in Israel if they are both registered as officially not belonging to any religion. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.myjewishlearning.com/israel/Contemporary_Life/Society_and_Religious_Issues/Freedom_of_Religion/civil_marriage_in_israel.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2010, the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] outlawed public gender segregation in Jerusalem's [[Mea Shearim]] neighborhood in response to a petition submitted after extremist Haredi men physically and verbally assaulted women for walking on a designated men's only road. However, in January 2011, a ruling of the [[Israeli High Court of Justice]] allowed the continuation of the gender segregation in public buses on a strictly voluntary basis for a one-year experimental period.&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=Jerusalem Post |title=Court scraps ‘mehadrin’ buses |date=January 6, 2011 |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?ID=202456&amp;R=R1 |accessdate=2011-03-08 | first=Dan |last=Izenberg |first2=Jonah |last2=Mandel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a [[halacha|halachic]] ruling which allows women, for the first time, to say the [[Kaddish]] prayer in memory of their deceased parents.&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4396702,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, the [[Religious Judges Law]] in Israel was amended to say that at least four women must be included in the religious judges' nomination committee, including a female advocate in the religious courts, and the total number of committee members shall be eleven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=9919 Israel Hayom | In a first, women to sit on rabbinic judges selection panel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, after engaging in [[civil disobedience]] for over two decades, a judge ruled that a 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls at the [[Western Wall]] had been misinterpreted and that [[Women of the Wall]] prayer gatherings at the [[Western Wall]] should not be deemed illegal.&lt;ref name=civildisobedience&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/world/middleeast/israeli-law-curbing-womens-prayer-up-for-review.html |title=Israel to Review Curbs on Women's Prayer at Western Wall |first=Jodi |last=Rudoren |work=The New York Times |date=December 25, 2012 |accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jewish feminist theology ==

Various versions of [[feminist theology]] exist within the Jewish community.

Some of these theologies promote the idea that it is important to have a feminine characterisation of God within the [[siddur]] (Jewish prayerbook) and service.

In 1976, [[Rita Gross]] published the article "Female God Language in a Jewish Context" (Davka Magazine 17), which Jewish scholar and feminist [[Judith Plaskow]] considers "probably the first article to deal theoretically with the issue of female God-language in a Jewish context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Gender_and_Feminism/Feminist_Thought/Theology.shtml |title=Jewish Feminist Theology: A Survey |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhushara.com/book/torah/cardoza/ssin.htm |title=Standing at Sinai |publisher=Dhushara.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Gross was Jewish herself at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SJs-aLqCiF8C&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=rita+gross+jew&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=j1I9T8y6Loy_0QGp4qHpBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6wEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=rita%20gross%20jew&amp;f=false |title=Jewish Mysticism and Kabbalah: New Insights and Scholarship - Frederick Greenspahn - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The experience of praying with ''Siddur Nashim'' [the first Sabbath prayer book to refer to God using female pronouns and imagery]  ... transformed my relationship with God. For the first time, I understood what it meant to be made in God's image. To think of God as a woman like myself, to see Her as both powerful and nurturing, to see Her imaged with a woman's body, with womb, with breasts – this was an experience of ultimate significance. Was this the relationship that men have had with God for all these millennia? How wonderful to gain access to those feelings and perceptions.}} ''Siddur Nashim'' was self-published in 1976 by [[Naomi Janowitz]] and [[Margaret Wenig]]. In 1990 [[Margaret Wenig]] wrote the sermon, "[http://books.google.com/books?id=pSGafFWQ4GQC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=%22god+is+a+woman+and+she+is+growing%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MWzlUfDfHpau4APHtIGwCw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22god%20is%20a%20woman%20and%20she%20is%20growing%20older%22&amp;f=false God is a Woman and She is Growing Older]," which as of 2011 has been published ten times (three times in German) and preached by rabbis from Australia to California.&lt;ref&gt;http://huc.edu/faculty/faculty/MargaretWenig.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Paula Reimers ("Feminism, Judaism, and God the Mother", ''Conservative Judaism'' '''46''' (1993)) comments:
{{quote|Those who want to use God/She language want to affirm womanhood and the feminine aspect of the deity. They do this by emphasizing that which most clearly distinguishes the female experience from the male. A male or female deity can create through speech or through action, but the metaphor for creation which is uniquely feminine is birth. Once God is called female, then, the metaphor of birth and the identification of the deity with nature and its processes become inevitable}}

Ahuva Zache affirms that using both masculine and feminine language for God can be a positive thing, but reminds her Reform Jewish readership that God is beyond gender (''Is God male, female, both or neither? How should we phrase our prayers in response to God’s gender?'', in the Union for [[Reform Judaism]]'s iTorah, [http://urj.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=11422]):

{{quote|Feminine imagery of God does not in any way threaten Judaism. On the contrary, it enhances the Jewish understanding of God, which should not be limited to masculine metaphors. All language that humans use to describe God is only a metaphor. Using masculine and feminine metaphors for God is one way to remind ourselves that gendered descriptions of God are just metaphors. God is beyond gender.}}

These views are highly controversial even within liberal Jewish movements.&lt;ref&gt;"This genderless God also represents a profound betrayal of the Torah narrative."  Matthew Berke, "God and Gender in Judaism", in Copyright (c) 1996 ''First Things'' 64 (June/July 1996): 33–38&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] and many [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jews]]
hold that it is wrong to use English female pronouns for God, viewing such usage as an intrusion of modern feminist ideology into Jewish tradition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Liberal prayerbooks tend increasingly to also avoid male-specific words and pronouns, seeking that all references to God in translations be made in gender-neutral language. For example, the [[Liberal Judaism (UK)|UK Liberal movement]]'s ''Siddur Lev Chadash'' (1995) does so, as does the [[Reform Judaism (UK)|UK Reform Movement]]'s ''Forms of Prayer'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thejc.com/articles/the-slimline-siddur-a-touch-bob-dylan The slimline siddur with a touch of Bob Dylan | The Jewish Chronicle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwpjc.org/slc.htm Siddur Lev Chadash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mishkan T'filah]], the American Reform Jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to God as “He” have been removed, and whenever Jewish patriarchs are named (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), so also are the matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah.) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/03/us/03prayerbook.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthodox Judaism and Jewish feminism==

===Haredi opposition to Jewish feminism===

[[Haredi Judaism]] views all forms of feminism, whether in "Jewish" or non-Jewish forms as unnecessary, on the grounds that Torah Judaism believes in wholeness, in the valid claims of contrasting aspects: in being part of a society while remaining a unique people; in being part of a community while maintaining one's individuality; in being a full-fledged part of the world while also being a woman. The Haredi vision of womanhood can be summed up in King Solomon's poem "A Woman of Valor," which praises a woman for qualities such as wisdom, courage, creativity, business acumen, and the profound insight to recognize how to relate to individuals according to their specific needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aish.com/societywork/women/Feminism_and_Judaism.asp |title=Feminism &amp; Judaism |last=Heller |first=Rebbetzin Tziporah |publisher=aish.com |date=8 January 2000 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore there is no movement within Haredi Judaism to train women as [[rabbi]]s. While most Haredi women receive schooling in [[Beis Yaakov]] schools designed for them exclusively, the curriculum of these schools does not teach [[Talmud]] and neither encourages nor teaches its female students to study the same subjects as young Haredi men in the Haredi [[yeshiva]]s.

The most important thrust of Haredi education for girls and young women is to educate, train and encourage them to become wives and mothers within large families devoted to the [[Torah Judaism]] way of life. In some Haredi communities, the education of girls in secular subjects (such as mathematics) is superior to that of boys.  This is partly because of the greater time devoted to sacred subjects in the case of boys, and partly because many Haredi women work in paid jobs to enable their husbands to engage in full-time Torah study or to bring in a second income.

===Modern Orthodox Judaism and Jewish feminism===

Modern Orthodox feminism, like its Conservative and Reform/Reconstructionist counterparts, seeks to change the position of women in [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (''halakha''), life, and leadership. However, it differs in several key respects. Firstly, its stated approach accepts the Orthodox belief that Jewish law is divine in origin, and as such, Orthodox Jewish feminists say they seek change only in a manner that can be defended in terms of Jewish law, and try to work with, rather than against, the rabbinate.

Therefore, in conflicts between halakha and arguments from egalitarianism, Orthodox feminists say they have remained loyal to halakha, though this is disputed by other feminists and anti-feminist Orthodox Jews. Secondly, Orthodox feminism neither requires precisely equal roles between men and women, as has been the tendency in Conservative Judaism, nor does it seek to overthrow the religious tradition and substitute new sources and traditions, as has been suggested by Reform feminists such as [[Rachel Adler]] and [[Judith Plaskow]]. Rather, accepting the possibility that somewhat different approaches may be appropriate for men and women, Orthodox feminism generally seeks support for acceptable means to change women's halakhic status, a significant presence and role within the public communal service, and new, supplemental traditions, or the reinstitution of old traditions, of importance to women's lives and worship. Orthodox feminism tends to focus on specific, practical issues, such as the problems of [[agunah]], fostering women's education, leadership, and participation, and arguments for involvement in specific rituals.

One reason for a different agenda for Modern Orthodox feminism is its need to focus on issues which became largely non-existent in liberal branches of Judaism prior to the appearance of Jewish feminism in the 1970s.&lt;!--did they?--&gt; These issues include the [[agunah]] problem arising from Jewish women's lack of power to initiate a religious divorce, problems of access to advanced religious education, and matters of physical access and personal comfort in matters of [[tzniut]] (modesty), such as, for example, the construction of [[mechitza|''mechitzot'']] which eliminates the physical separation of men and women during services.

Also in 2013, the first class of female [[halacha|halachic]] advisers trained to practice in the US graduated; they graduated from the North American branch of [[Nishmat]]’s yoetzet halacha program in a ceremony at Congregation Sheartith Israel, Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Manhattan. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/landmark-us-program-graduates-first-female-halachic-advisers/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in [[halacha|Jewish religious law]], schools, and rituals ==

In 1955, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of Conservative Judaism declared that women were eligible to chant the blessings before and after the reading of the Torah.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/conservative-judaism-in-united-states Conservative Judaism in the United States | Jewish Women's Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, the first Orthodox Jewish women's [[tefillah]] (prayer) group was created, on the holiday of [[Simhat Torah]] at [[Lincoln Square Synagogue]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/womens-tefillah-movement Women's Tefillah Movement | Jewish Women's Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] passed a takkanah (ruling) allowing women to count in a [[minyan]] equally with men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Also in 1973, the United Synagogue of America, Conservative Judaism’s congregational association (now called the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism) resolved to allow women to participate in synagogue rituals and to promote equal opportunity for women for positions of leadership, authority, and responsibility in congregational life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1974, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] adopted a series of proposals that equalized men and women in all areas of ritual, including serving as prayer leaders.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1972, a group of ten New York Jewish feminists calling themselves ''Ezrat Nashim'' (the [[Mechitza|women's section in a synagogue]], but also "women's help"), took the issue of equality for women to the 1972 convention of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movement's [[Rabbinical Assembly]], presenting a document on 14 March that they named the "[http://books.google.com/books?id=vVETCrICwO8C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=%22jewish+women+call+for+a+change%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=euiXT8TILIL30gHN2onxBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jewish%20women%20call%20for%20a%20change%22&amp;f=false Call for Change]."  The rabbis received the document in their convention packets, but ''Ezrat Nashim'' presented it during a meeting with the rabbis' wives. The Call for Change demanded that women be accepted as witnesses before Jewish law, be considered as bound to perform all [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]], be allowed full participation in religious observances, have equal rights in marriage and be allowed to initiate divorce, be counted in the [[minyan]], and be permitted to assume positions of leadership in the synagogue and within the general Jewish community. [[Paula Hyman]], who was a member of ''Ezrat Nashim'', wrote that: "We recognized that the subordinate status of women was linked to their exemption from positive time-bound ''mitzvot'' (commandments), and we therefore accepted increased obligation as the corollary of equality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/feminism/_html/JWA039.htm Paula Hyman], ''Jewish Women and the Feminist Revolution'', Jewish Women's Archive. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of Conservative Judaism voted to count men and women equally as members of a [[minyan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1973/09/11/archive/women-equal-with-men-in-minyan Women Equal with Men in Minyan | Jewish Telegraphic Agency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Book of Numbers]], the well dries up immediately following Miriam’s death.&lt;ref name="dropbox1"/&gt; Furthermore, some Jews include an orange on the seder plate. The orange represents the fruitfulness for all Jews when all marginalized peoples are included, particularly women and gay people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Tamara Cohen | url = http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Passover/The_Seder/Seder_Plate_and_Table/Orange.shtml | title = An Orange on the Seder Plate | accessdate = 28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An incorrect but common rumor says that this tradition began when a man told [[Susannah Heschel]] that a woman belongs on the bimah as an orange on the seder plate; however, it actually began when in the early 1980s, while when speaking at Oberlin College Hillel, Susannah Heschel was introduced to an early feminist Haggadah that suggested adding a crust of bread on the seder plate, as a sign of solidarity with Jewish lesbians (as some would say there's as much room for a lesbian in Judaism as there is for a crust of bread on the seder plate).&lt;ref name="ritualwell"&gt;[http://www.ritualwell.org/holidays/passover/onthesedertable/primaryobject.2005-07-08.9776011383 Jewish Rituals for On the Seder Table].

In October 1983, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] (JTS), the main educational institution of the Conservative movement, announced its decision to accept women as rabbis and cantors. [[Paula Hyman]] took part in the vote as a member of the JTS faculty.

In 1997 Gail Billig became the first female president of a major Orthodox synagogue, at Congregation Ahavath Torah in Englewood, N.J.&lt;ref name="womensenews.org"/&gt;

In 2002, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of Conservative Judaism adapted a [[responsum]] by Rabbi David Fine, [http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf ''Women and the Minyan''], which provides an official religious-law foundation for counting women in a minyan and explains the current Conservative approach to the role of women in prayer. In 2002, the CJLS adapted a [[responsum]] by Rabbi David Fine, [http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf ''Women and the Minyan''], which provides an official religious-law foundation for women counting in a minyan and explains the current Conservative approach to the role of women in prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf]|194&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This responsum holds that although Jewish women do not traditionally have the same obligations as men, Conservative women have, as a collective whole, voluntarily undertaken them. Because of this collective undertaking, the Fine responsum holds that Conservative women are eligible to serve as agents and decision-makers for others.  The responsum also holds that traditionally-minded communities and individual women can opt out without being regarded by the Conservative movement as sinning.  By adopting this responsum, the CJLS found itself in a position to provide a considered Jewish-law justification for its egalitarian practices, without having to rely on potentially unconvincing arguments, undermine the religious importance of community and clergy, ask individual women intrusive questions, repudiate the ''halakhic'' tradition, or label women following traditional practices as sinners.

In 2005, the [[Kohenet Institute]] was founded by Rabbi Jill Hammer and Holly Shere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/thisweek/aug/14/2006/kohenet-hebrew-priestess-institute This Week in History - Kohenet: the Hebrew Priestess Institute, Launches its first Training Institute in Accord, NY | Jewish Women's Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kohenet Institute]], based at the [[Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center]] in Connecticut, offers a two-year course of study to women who are then ordained as Jewish priestesses.&lt;ref name="kohenet.org"&gt;[http://www.kohenet.org/institute/ Kohenet: Hebrew Priestess Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"&gt;[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/68940/jewish-american-priestess-kohenet-institute-ordains-women-for-a-new-jewish-/ Jewish American Priestess: Kohenet Institute ordains women for a new Jewish world | j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  “Kohenet” is a feminine variation on “kohan,” meaning priest.&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"/&gt; The Kohenet Institute's training involves earth-based spiritual practices that they believe harken back to pre–rabbinic Judaism; a time when, according to Kohenet’s founders, women took on many more (and much more powerful) spiritual leadership roles than are commonly taken by women today.&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"/&gt; A Jewish priestess may, according to Kohenet, act as a rabbi, but the two roles are not the same.&lt;ref name="kohenet.org"/&gt;

In 2006, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of Conservative Judaism adopted three [[responsum|responsa]] on the subject of [[niddah]], which reaffirmed an obligation of Conservative women to abstain from sexual relations during and following [[menstruation]] and to immerse in a [[mikvah]] prior to resumption, while liberalizing observance requirements including shortening the length of the [[niddah]] period, lifting restrictions on non-sexual contact during niddah, and reducing the circumstances under which spotting and similar conditions would mandate abstinence.&lt;ref name="RabbiIntro"&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Mikveh_Introduction.doc Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz, Mikveh and the Sanctity of Family Relations, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabbiGrossman"&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Grossman-Niddah.pdf Rabbi Susan Grossman, MIKVEH AND THE SANCTITY OF BEING CREATED HUMAN, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabbiReisner"&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Reisner-Niddah.pdf Rabbi Avram Reisner, OBSERVING NIDDAH IN OUR DAY: AN INQUIRY ON THE STATUS OF PURITY AND THE PROHIBITION OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH A MENSTRUANT, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabbiBerkowitz"&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Berkowitz-Niddah.pdf Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz, RESHAPING THE LAWS OF FAMILY PURITY FOR THE MODERN WORLD, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women as soferim ===
A Sofer, Sopher, Sofer SeTaM, or Sofer ST"M (Heb: "scribe", סופר סת״ם) is a Jewish scribe who can transcribe Torah scrolls, tefillin and mezuzot, and other religious writings.  (ST"M, סת״ם, is an abbreviation for Sefer Torahs, Tefillin, and Mezuzot. The plural of sofer is "soferim", סופרים.) Forming the basis for the discussion of women becoming soferim, [[Talmud|Talmud Gittin]] 45b states: "Sifrei Torah, tefillin and mezuzot written by a heretic, a star-worshipper, a slave, a woman, a minor, a [[Cuthean]], or an [[Apostasy in Judaism|apostate Jew]], are unfit for ritual use."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geniza.net/ritual/women.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The rulings on [[Mezuzah]] and [[Tefillin]] are virtually undisputed among those who hold to the [[Talmud|Talmudic Law]]. While [[Arba'ah Turim]] does not include women in its list of those ineligible to write Sifrei Torah, some see this as proof that women are permitted to write a Torah scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Tur, [[Wikisource:Shulchan Aruch/Orach Chaim/271|Orah Hayyim 271]].&lt;/ref&gt; However today, virtually all Orthodox (both Modern and Ultra) authorities contest the idea that a woman is permitted to write a [[Sefer Torah]]. Yet women are permitted to inscribe [[Ketubah|Ketubot]] (marriage contracts), STaM not intended for ritual use, and other writings of [[Sofrut]] beyond simple STaM. In 2003 Canadian [[Aviel Barclay]] became the world's first known traditionally trained female sofer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forward.com/articles/3614/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jwablog.jwa.org/soferet&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[Jen Taylor Friedman]], a British woman, became the first female sofer to scribe a [[Sefer Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forward.com/articles/11604/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the first [[Sefer Torah]] scribed by a group of women (six female sofers, who were from Brazil, Canada, Israel, and the United States) was completed;&lt;ref&gt;http://jta.org/news/article/2010/10/15/2741313/womens-torah-dedicated-in-seattle&lt;/ref&gt; this was known as the [[Women's Torah Project]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/59670/cjms-resident-scribe-takes-part-in-group-torah-project-in-seattle/&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 2010 until spring 2011, [[Julie Seltzer]], one of the female sofers from the Women's Torah Project, scribed a [[Sefer Torah]] as part of an exhibition at the [[Contemporary Jewish Museum]] in [[San Francisco]]. This makes her the first American female sofer to scribe a [[Sefer Torah]]; Julie Seltzer was born in Philadelphia and is non-denominationally Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/59670/cjms-resident-scribe-takes-part-in-group-torah-project-in-seattle/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecjm.org/index.php?option=com_ccevents&amp;scope=prgm&amp;task=detail&amp;fid=8&amp;oid=563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/arts/design/08sfculture.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/61328/cjm-to-celebrate-end-of-groundbreaking-torah-project&lt;/ref&gt; From spring 2011 until August 2012 she scribed another [[Sefer Torah]], this time for the Reform congregation Beth Israel in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=286912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbisd.org/news-and-stories/87-news-and-stories/1158-a-special-open-house-with-torah-scribe-julie-seltzer-observe-the-completion-of-our-torah&lt;/ref&gt; Seltzer was taught mostly by [[Jen Taylor Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=286912&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22nd, 2013, [[Congregation Beth Elohim]] of New York dedicated a new Torah, which members of Beth Elohim said was the first Torah in New York City to be completed by a woman.&lt;ref&gt;http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/congregation-beth-elohim-in-park-slope-dedicates-new-torah-for-150th-anniversary-1.6119015&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah was scribed by Linda Coppleson. &lt;ref&gt;http://torah.cbebk.org/about/our-soferet/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in Humanistic Judaism ==
[[Humanistic Judaism]] is a movement in [[Judaism]] that offers a nontheistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life. It defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people and encourages humanistic and secular Jews to celebrate their Jewish identity by participating in Jewish holidays and life cycle events (such as weddings and bar and bat mitzvah) with inspirational ceremonies that draw upon but go beyond traditional literature. Humanistic Judaism ordains both men and women as rabbis, and its first rabbi was a woman, [[Tamara Kolton]], who was ordained in 1999. &lt;ref name="shj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/shjbios.htm |title=Society for Humanistic Judaism - Rabbis and Leadership |publisher=Shj.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first cantor was also a woman, [[Hazzan Deborah Davis|Deborah Davis]], ordained in 2001; however, Humanistic Judaism has since stopped ordaining cantors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jmwc.org/Women/womend.html |title=Contributions of Jewish Women to Music and Women to Jewish Music |publisher=JMWC |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] issued a statement in 1996 stating in part, "we affirm that a woman has the moral right and should have the continuing legal right to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy in accordance with her own ethical standards. Because a decision to terminate a pregnancy carries serious, irreversible consequences, it is one to be made with great care and with keen awareness of the complex psychological, emotional, and ethical implications." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shj.org/Choice.htm Society for Humanistic Judaism - Reproductive Choice Abortion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They also issued a statement in 2011 condemning the then-recent passage of the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act” by the U.S. House of Representatives, which they called "a direct attack on a woman’s right to choose". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shj.org/NewsAbortionFunding.html Society for Humanistic Judaism Condemns Limit on Choice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 they issued a resolution opposing conscience clauses that allow religious-affiliated institutions to be exempt from generally applicable requirements mandating reproductive healthcare services to individuals or employees. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.shj.org/ConscienceClauses.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 they issued a resolution stating in part, "Therefore, be it resolved that: The Society for Humanistic Judaism wholeheartedly supports the observance of [[Women's Equality Day]] on August 26 to commemorate the anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing women to vote; The Society condemns gender discrimination in all its forms, including restriction of rights, limited access to education, violence, and subjugation; and The Society commits itself to maintain vigilance and speak out in the fight to bring gender equality to our generation and to the generations that follow." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.shj.org/WomensEqualityDay.html&lt;/ref&gt;
