'''Jewish feminism''' is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within [[Judaism]] and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major branches of Judaism. 

In its modern form, the movement can be traced to the early 1970s in the [[United States]]. According to [[Judith Plaskow]], who has focused on feminism in [[Reform Judaism]], the main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or ''[[minyan]]'', the exemption from positive time-bound ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'', and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate [[Jewish view of marriage#Divorce|divorce]].&lt;ref name=Plaskow1997&gt;Plaskow, Judith. "Jewish Feminist Thought" in Frank, Daniel H. &amp; Leaman, Oliver. ''History of Jewish Philosophy'', Routledge, first published 1997; this edition 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the movement==
According to historian [[Paula Hyman]], two articles published in 1970 on the [[role of women in Judaism]] were particularly influential. "The Unfreedom of Jewish Women," published in the ''Jewish Spectator'' by its editor, [[Trude Weiss-Rosmarin]], criticized the treatment of women in [[Halakha|Jewish law]], followed in 1972 by an article by [[Rachel Adler]], then an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]] and currently a professor at the [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]], called "The Jew Who Wasn't There: Halakhah and the Jewish Woman," published in ''Davka'' a countercultural magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Rachel. ""The Jew Who Wasn't There: Halakhah and the Jewish Woman." ''Davka'' (Summer 1972) 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, a group of ten New York feminists calling themselves ''Ezrat Nashim'' (the [[Mechitza|women's section in a synagogue]], but also "women's help"), took the issue of equality for women to the 1972 convention of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movement's [[Rabbinical Assembly]], presenting a document on March 14 that they named the "Call for Change."  The rabbis received the document in their convention packets, but ''Ezrat Nashim'' presented it during a meeting with the rabbis' wives.

The "Call for Change" demanded that women be accepted as witnesses before Jewish law, be considered as bound to perform all [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]], be allowed full participation in religious observances, have equal rights in marriage and be allowed to initiate divorce, be counted in the [[minyan]], and be permitted to assume positions of leadership in the synagogue and within the general Jewish community. Paula Hyman, who was a member of ''Ezrat Nashim'', wrote that: "We recognized that the subordinate status of women was linked to their exemption from positive time-bound ''mitzvot'' (commandments), and we therefore accepted increased obligation as the corollary of equality."&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Women's Archive''.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven years later, in October 1983, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary]] (JTS), the main educational institution of the Conservative Movement, announced its decision to accept women into the Rabbinical School. Hyman took part in the vote as a member of the [[JTS]] faculty.

==Orthodox Judaism==
===Haredi Judaism and its opposition to feminism===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=August 2007}}
[[Haredi Judaism]] views all forms of feminism, whether in "Jewish" or non-Jewish forms as not in keeping with the ancient heritage of Judaism. There is no movement within Haredi Judaism to train women as [[rabbi]]s or to grant them an equal status with Haredi men in religious practices. While most Haredi women receive schooling in [[Bais Yaakov]] schools designed for them exclusively, the curriculum of these schools does not teach [[Talmud]] and neither encourages nor teaches its female students to become co-equal Talmudists and Halakhists with the young Haredi men of the Haredi [[yeshiva]]s.

The most important thrust of Haredi education for girls and young women is to educate, train and encourage them to become future wives and successful mothers who can raise large families of children devoted to the [[Torah Judaism]] way of life.  In some Haredi communities, however, the education of girls in secular subjects such as mathematics is superior to that of boys.  This is partly because of the greater time devoted to sacred subjects in the case of boys, and partly because many Haredi women work in paid jobs to enable their husbands to engage in full-time Torah study.

===Modern Orthodox Judaism and feminism===
Modern Orthodox feminism, like its Conservative and Reform/Reconstructionist counterparts, seeks to improve the position of women in [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (''halakha''), life, and leadership. However, it differs in several key respects. Firstly, its stated approach accepts the Orthodox belief that Jewish law is divine in origin, and as such, Orthodox Jewish feminists say they seek change only in a manner that can be defended in terms of Jewish law, and try to work with, rather than against, the rabbinate.

Therefore, in conflicts between halakha and arguments from egalitarianism, Orthodox feminists say they have remained loyal to halakha, though this is disputed by other feminists and anti-feminist Orthodox Jews. Secondly, Orthodox feminism neither requires precisely equal roles between men and women, as has been the tendency in Conservative Judaism, nor does it seek to overthrow the religious tradition and substitute new sources and traditions, as has been suggested by Reform feminists such as Rachel Adler and Judith Plaskow. Rather, accepting the possibility that somewhat different approaches may be appropriate for men and women, Orthodox feminism generally seeks support for acceptable means to improve women's halakhic status, a significant presence and role within the public communal service, and new, supplemental traditions, or the reinstitution of old traditions, of importance to women's lives and worship. Orthodox feminism tends to focus on specific, practical issues, such as the problems of [[agunah]], fostering women's education, leadership, and participation, and arguments for involvement in specific rituals.

One reason for a different agenda for Modern Orthodox feminism is its need to focus on issues which became largely non-existent in liberal branches of Judaism prior to the appearance of Jewish feminism in the 1970s.&lt;!--did they?--&gt; These issues include the [[agunah]] problem arising from a lack of legal power in certain circumstances to initiate a divorce, problems of access to advanced religious education, and matters of physical access and personal comfort in matters of [[tzniut]] (modesty), such as, for example, the construction of [[mechitza|''mechitzot'']] which permit women to see and hear services. (See [[Mechitza#Proper height of synagogue mechitza]])  &lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Blu. On Women and Judaism: A View from Tradition. Jewish Publication Society of America, 1981 &lt;!--page number?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Tamar. ''Expanding the Palace of Torah: Orthodoxy and Feminism. Brandeis University Press, 2004. &lt;!--page number?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Blu Greenberg]] founded the [[Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]] (JOFA) to advocate for women's increased participation in Modern Orthodox Jewish life and to create a community for women and men dedicated to such change. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jofa.org Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Orthodox feminism from within Orthodox Judaism have disputed its claims to Orthodox legitimacy, including its claims to accept the divinity of Jewish law and to work within legitimate halakhic processes.
