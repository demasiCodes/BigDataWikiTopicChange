Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major branches of Judiasm. 

In its modern form, the movement can be traced to the early 1970s in the [[United States]]. According to [[Judith Plaskow]], who has focused on feminism in [[Reform Judaism]], the main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or ''[[minyan]]'', the exemption from positive time-bound ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'', and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate [[Jewish view of marriage#Divorce|divorce]]. &lt;ref name=Plaskow1997&gt;Plaskow, Judith.

==Origins of the movement==
{{jf}}
According to historian [[Paula Hyman]], two articles published in 1970 on the [[role of women in Judaism]] were particularly influential. "The Unfreedom of Jewish Women," published in the ''Jewish Spectator'' by its editor, [[Trude Weiss-Rosmarin]], criticized the treatment of women in [[Halakha|Jewish law]], followed in 1972 by an article by [[Rachel Adler]], then an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]] and currently a professor at the [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]], called "The Jew Who Wasn't There: Halakhah and the Jewish Woman," published in ''Davka'' a countercultural magazine. &lt;ref&gt;Adler, Rachel. ""The Jew Who Wasn't There: Halakhah and the Jewish Woman." ''Davka'' (Summer 1972) 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism in [[Conservative Judaism]]==
In 1972, a group of ten [[New York]] feminists calling themselves ''Ezrat Nashim'' (the [[Mechitza|women's courtyard]] or the women's section in a [[synagogue]]), took the issue of equality for women to the 1972 convention of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movement's [[Rabbinical Assembly]], presenting a document on March 14 that they named the "Call for Change."  The rabbis received the document in their convention packets, but ''Ezrat Nashim'' presented it during a meeting with the rabbis' wives.

The "Call for Change" demanded that women be accepted as witnesses before Jewish law, be considered as bound to perform all [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]], be allowed full participation in religious observances, have equal rights in marriage and be allowed to initiate divorce, be counted in the [[minyan]], and be permitted to assume positions of leadership in the synagogue and within the general Jewish community. Paula Hyman, who was a member of ''Ezrat Nashim'', wrote that: "We recognized that the subordinate status of women was linked to their exemption from positive time-bound ''mitzvot'' (commandments), and we therefore accepted increased obligation as the corollary of equality." &lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Women's Archive''&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven years later, in October 1983, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary]] (JTS), the main educational institution of the Conservative Movement, announced its decision to accept women into the Rabbinical School. Hyman took part in the vote as a member of the [[JTS]] faculty

==Feminism in [[Orthodox Judaism]]==
In 1997, [[Blu Greenberg]] founded the [[Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]] to educate and advocate for women's increased participation in Orthodox Jewish life and to create a community for women and men dedicated to such change. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jofa.org Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Orthodox feminism, like its Conservative and Reform/Reconstructionist counterparts, seeks to improve the position of women in Jewish law, life, and leadership. However, it differs in several key respects. Firstly, it fundamentally accepts and is loyal to the Divinity of Jewish law. Accepting that Jewish law is G-d's, not ours, it seeks change only in a manner that can be defended as a traditional and legitimately Jewish and halakhic process, and it seeks to work with rather than against the rabbinate and the halakhic process. Therefore, in conflicts between halakha and arguments from egalitarianism, Orthodox feminists have remained loyal to halakha, even in the face of severe criticism from both anti-Orthodox feminists and anti-feminist Orthodox. Secondly, Orthodox Feminism neither requires precisely equal roles between men and women, as has been the tendency in Conservative Judaism, nor does it seek to overthrow the religious tradition and substitute new sources and traditions, as has been suggested by Reform feminists such as Rachel Adler and Judith Plaskow. Rather, accepting the possibility that somewhat different approaches may be appropriate for men and women, Orthodox feminism generally seeks support for acceptable means to improve women's [[halakha|halakhic]] (religious-legal) status, a significant presence and role within the public communal service, and new, supplemental traditions, or the reinstitution of old traditions, of importance to women's lives and worship, within what it regards as the traditional manner in which laws are interpreted and new prayers and customs adopted within traditional Judaism historically. Orthodox Feminism tends to focus on specific, practical issues, such as the problems of [[agunah]], fostering women's education, leadership, and participation, and arguments for involvement in specific rituals. 

One reason for a different agenda for Orthodox feminism is its need to focus on issues which became largely non-existent in more liberal branches of Judaism prior to the appearance of Jewish feminism in the 1970s. These issues include the [[agunah]] problem arising from a lack of legal power in certain circumstances to initiate a divorce, problems of access to advanced religious education, and matters of physical access and personal comfort in matters of [[tzniut]] (modesty), such as, for example, the construction of [[mechitza|''mechitzot'']] which permit women to see and hear services.
