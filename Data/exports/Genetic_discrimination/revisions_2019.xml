{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Genetic discrimination''' occurs when people treat others (or are treated) differently because they have or are perceived to have a [[gene]] [[mutation]](s) that causes or increases the risk of an [[Genetic disorder|inherited disorder]]. It may also refer to any and all discrimination based on the [[genotype]] of a person rather than their individual merits, including that related to race. Some legal scholars have argued for a more precise and broader definition of genetic discrimination: "Genetic discrimination should be defined as when an individual is subjected to negative treatment, not as a result of the individual’s physical manifestation of disease or disability, but solely because of the individual’s genetic composition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic Testing Meets Big Data: Torts and Contract Law Issues|ssrn = 2460891|date = 2014|location = Rochester, NY|first = Ifeoma|last = Ajunwa | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic Discrimination is considered to have its foundations in genetic determinism and genetic essentialism,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic Data and Civil Rights|ssrn = 2460897|date = 2015|location = Harvard Civil Rights- Civil Liberties Law Review|first = Ifeoma|last = Ajunwa}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the concept of '''genism''', i.e. distinctive human characteristics and capacities are [[genetic determinism|determined by genes]].&lt;ref name="Annas 2003"&gt;{{cite paper|last=Annas |first=George |authorlink=George Annas | name-list-format = vanc |title=Genism, Racism, and the Prospect of Genetic Genocide |date=2003 |url=http://www.gjga.org/inside.asp?a=1&amp;action=item&amp;source=documents&amp;id=19 |access-date=2008-07-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726104538/http://www.gjga.org/inside.asp?a=1&amp;action=item&amp;source=documents&amp;id=19 |archive-date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic discrimination takes different forms depending on the country and the protections that have been taken to limit genetic discrimination, such as GINA in the United States that protects people from being barred from working or from receiving healthcare as a result of their genetic makeup.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The idea of genetic discrimination has been investigated in films such as ''Gattaca'', showing the potential outcome if genetic discrimination is not prevented.

==Legal status==

=== United States ===
[[File:H.R. 493 - Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) (27946508696).jpg|thumb|On May 21st, 2008, George W. Bush signed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, protecting individuals from genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ginahelp.org/|title=GINAhelp.org - Your GINA Resource|website=ginahelp.org|access-date=2019-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Genetic discrimination is illegal in the U.S. after passage of the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA) on May 21, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/05/the-genetic-inf/|title=Genetic Discrimination by Insurers, Employers Becomes a Crime|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush, and]] passed in the US Senate by a vote of 49-0 and in the House of Representatives by 414-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feldman EA | title = The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA): public policy and medical practice in the age of personalized medicine | journal = Journal of General Internal Medicine | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 743–6 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22314637 | doi = 10.1007/s11606-012-1988-6 | pmc = 3358381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation bars employers from using individuals’ genetic information when making [[Recruitment|hiring]], [[firing]], job placement, or [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]] decisions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[https://www.genome.gov/pages/policyethics/geneticdiscrimination/saponhr493.pdf Statement of Administration policy], Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; GINA also protects individuals from genetic discrimination in healthcare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hudson KL, Holohan MK, Collins FS | title = Keeping pace with the times--the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 | language = EN | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 358 | issue = 25 | pages = 2661–3 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18565857 | doi = 10.1056/nejmp0803964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, GINA itself does not define what genetic information is, leaving it up for debate.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGuire AL, Majumder MA | title = Two cheers for GINA? | language = En | journal = Genome Medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 6 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19348693 | pmc = 2651591 | doi = 10.1186/gm6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2008 GINA Act, individuals could be denied insurance, either partially or fully, based on genetic tests they had received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Otlowski|first=M.|last2=Taylor|first2=S.|last3=Bombard|first3=Y.|date=2012-09-12|title=Genetic Discrimination: International Perspectives|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-090711-163800|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=433–454|doi=10.1146/annurev-genom-090711-163800|issn=1527-8204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was passed in 2008 there were 201 cases that cited GINA in 2010 and 333 in 2014. It wasn’t until 2013 that a company actually faced penalties under GINA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Natasha | name-list-format = vanc|date=2015-06-25|title=Why the 'devious defecator' case is a landmark for US genetic-privacy law|journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature.2015.17857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health insurance discrimination====
In 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that some individuals avoid genetic testing out of fear that it will would impede their ability to purchase insurance or find a job. They also reported that evidence of actual discrimination was rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/health/24dna.html?_r=2&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=Genetic&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|title=Insurance Fears Lead Many to Shun DNA Tests|last=Harmon|first=Amy | name-list-format = vanc |access-date=2018-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016 insurance company GWG Life was found to be collecting saliva samples in order to offer lower rates to people who are epigenetically healthier than others of their age. While this is positive discrimination, this does suggest future potential classification of clients by genetic data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dupras C, Song L, Saulnier KM, Joly Y | title = Epigenetic Discrimination: Emerging Applications of Epigenetics Pointing to the Limitations of Policies Against Genetic Discrimination | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 9 | pages = 202 | date = 2018-06-08 | pmid = 29937773 | pmc = 6002493 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2018.00202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the 2008 GINA Act does protect against genetic discrimination pertaining to health insurance, it does not protect against genetic discrimination under other forms of insurance, such as life, disability or long-term care insurance. Therefore, patients are enjoying less protection against genetic discrimination in comparison with other peer countries, such as France, Switzerland, Australia and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=BélislePipon&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bélisle-Pipon JC, Vayena E, Green R, Cohen IG | title = Genetic testing, insurance discrimination and medical research: what the United States can learn from peer countries | journal = Nature Medicine | date = 2019 | doi = 10.1038/s41591-019-0534-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 2008 GINA offers no protection for home/mortgage insurance or when an employer has 15 or less employees. Excluded from the Act are also parties who are covered under Veterans Health Administration or Indian Health Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/discrimination|title=What is genetic discrimination? |website=Genetics Home Reference |access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because a variety of medical tests serve as proxies for genetic information, proponents of insurer access to genetic information argue that it does not require specific limiting legislation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; However, this represents an important problem for recruiting participants to medical research according to other scholars stressing that protecting American against discrimination may only happen with the advent of a voluntary moratorium by the insurance industry.&lt;ref name=BélislePipon/&gt;

==== Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing ====
Direct-to-consumer genetic testing was first offered in 1997 by [[GeneTree]], a now defunct family history website. These tests are easily accessible on the market and popularized by companies such as [[23andMe]] and [[Ancestry.com]]. These genetic kits are expensive and disproportionately serve wealthy individuals. As a result, when the data collected from testing is sold to research companies, it represents a biased sample of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dna-privacy-at-home-tests-23andme-ancestrydna-sell-data-to-third-parties|title=Behind at-home DNA testing companies sharing genetic data with third parties|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration]] additionally halted all 23andMe marketing in 2013 over unsubstantiated claims 23andMe made regarding disease diagnosis and prevention. The firm was allowed to continue sales after it stopped providing health information to customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zettler PJ, Sherkow JS, Greely HT | title = 23andMe, the Food and Drug Administration, and the future of genetic testing | journal = JAMA Internal Medicine | volume = 174 | issue = 4 | pages = 493–4 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24535082 | doi = 10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.14706 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
On May 4, 2017, Bill S-201, the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, received Royal Assent and became law in Canada.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/S-201/royal-assent|title=Public Bill (Senate) S-201 (42-1) - Royal Assent - Genetic Non-Discrimination Act - Parliament of Canada |access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite government opposition in the House of Commons, it survived the lower house by the support of backbench Liberals and the totality of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]], [[New Democratic Party|NDP]] and [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]] MPs. The Genetic Non-Discrimination Act makes it a crime for anyone to require an individual to undergo genetic testing as a condition for the provision of goods or services, or as a condition for entering or continuing a contract.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Act also forbids anyone from refusing to enter into a goods or services agreement with another person on the grounds that that person has refused to disclose the results of an already completed genetic test. One who contravenes these prohibitions is liable to being fined (up to $1 million) and/or imprisoned (up to 5 years).

Accordingly, one effect of this legislation will be to prohibit insurance providers from demanding that a prospective client undergo a genetic test - or to disclose an existing test - as a prerequisite to the provision of insurance coverage.

=== United Kingdom ===
The Equality Act of 2010 prohibits the use of genetic information for employment decisions such as hiring and promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents?view=plain|title=Equality Act 2010|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While no formal law exists banning the use of genetic information for insurance policy decisions, the Government of the United Kingdom and the Association of British Insurers voluntarily entered a moratorium from 2014 to 2019 to refrain from using genetic information with regards to insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abi.org.uk/globalassets/sitecore/files/documents/publications/public/2014/genetics/concordat-and-moratorium-on-genetics-and-insurance.pdf Concordat and Moratorium on Genetics and Insurance].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
In Australia, genetic information is less likely to influence health insurance coverage decisions as health insurance is "community rated," meaning that all individuals pay the same amount regardless of their history or genetic makeup.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/genetic-discrimination|title=Genetic discrimination {{!}} NHMRC|website=www.nhmrc.gov.au|access-date=2019-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is legal for life insurance companies to utilize genetic tests in determining premium costs due to risks that could be present.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Life insurance companies can require individuals to report genetic testing results if they have already been tested, but cannot force individuals to take genetic tests.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiller|first=Jane|last2=Otlowski|first2=Margaret|last3=Lacaze|first3=Paul|date=2017-12-13|title=Should Australia Ban the Use of Genetic Test Results in Life Insurance?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5733354/|journal=Frontiers in Public Health|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fpubh.2017.00330|issn=2296-2565|pmc=5733354|pmid=29322039}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies are able to require individuals to disclose genetic testing results from research and direct-to-consumer tests.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Argentina ===
Genetic discrimination is a rising issue in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valdovinos|first=Carlos Fernandez|date=2005-11-01|title=Growth, inequality, and social equity in Argentina|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/895241468201589540/Growth-inequality-and-social-equity-in-Argentina|language=en|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health plans discriminate against those who have disabilities or who have genetic conditions.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Penchaszadeh|first=Victor B.|date=July 2015|title=Ethical issues in genetics and public health in Latin America with a focus on Argentina|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524838/|journal=Journal of Community Genetics|volume=6|issue=3|pages=223–230|doi=10.1007/s12687-015-0217-5|issn=1868-310X|pmc=4524838|pmid=25666434}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past decade, however, National Law 26689 was  passed providing patients with the right to not experience discrimination as a result of genetic conditions.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

==Genetic testing in the workplace==

Some people have genes that make them more susceptible to developing a disease as a result of an occupational exposure. For example, workers with beryllium sensitivity and [[Berylliosis|chronic beryllium disease]] are more likely to carry the gene [[HLA-DPB1]] than workers without these conditions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Department for Health and Human Services (2009). ''Genetics in the Workplace: Implications for Occupational Safety and Health''. Washington, D.C.: DHHS.&lt;/ref&gt; By offering optional genetic testing to workers and allowing only the workers to see their own results, employers could protect genetically susceptible individuals from certain occupational diseases. A beryllium manufacturing company initiated a pilot program to test prospective workers for the HLA-DPB1 gene at a university-based laboratory. The company paid for the testing and counseling but received results that did not identify which workers had the gene.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1991, the American Medical Association Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs suggested that the following five conditions must be satisfied in order for genetic screening by an employer to be appropriate:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* The disease must develop so rapidly that monitoring would be ineffective in preventing it.
* The genetic test is highly accurate.
* The genetic variation results in an unusually elevated susceptibility to occupational illness.
* Undue expense is needed to protect susceptible workers by lowering the level of the toxic substance in the workplace.
* The worker must provide informed consent prior to being tested.

Several occupational health screening measures similar to genetic testing are already taking place. For example, in 1978, DuPont reported testing African American applicants for sickle cell trait and restricted these workers from exposure to nitro and amino compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brandt-Rauf PW, Brandt-Rauf SI | title = Genetic testing in the workplace: ethical, legal, and social implications | journal = Annual Review of Public Health | volume = 25 | pages = 139–53 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15015916 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research indicates that workers or applicants would not take advantage of genetic testing due to fear of discrimination. A 1995 poll of the general public found that over 85% are concerned about access to use of genetic information by insurers and employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller PS | title = Genetic discrimination in the workplace | journal = Genetics in Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 165–6 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11388754 | doi = 10.1097/00125817-200105000-00001 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230728/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in the case of the beryllium manufacturer described above, so few workers participated in the genetic testing that the company decided instead to pursue an “enhanced preventive model of workplace controls.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

==Popular culture==

''Genoism'' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[Andrew Niccol]], director and writer of the 1997 film ''[[Gattaca]]'', used to describe unethical and illegal genetic discrimination. Predictions of physical and mental performance are computed via [[genetics]] from [[DNA]] collected from hair, fingernails, skin flakes, spit swabs, eyelashes, etc.  Upon birth, a number of genetically-induced characteristics are calculated: physical and intellectual capacity, life expectancy, probable successful diseases, and likely causes of death, all determined via [[blood sample]]s and [[genetic testing]]. Job interviews, health insurance purchasing, and even potential dates can be sized up according to the perceived quality of the person's DNA due to advancements in [[genome sequencing]].  This put an ironic twist to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[sexual selection]] for good [[genes]]. According to the movie, "We now have discrimination down to a [[science]]."

{{quote|My father was right. It didn't matter how much I lied on my resume. My real resume was in my cells. Why should anybody invest all that money to train me when there were a thousand other applicants with a far cleaner profile? Of course, it's illegal to discriminate, 'genoism' it's called. But no one takes the law seriously. If you refuse to disclose, they can always take a sample from a door handle or a handshake, even the saliva on your application form. If in doubt, a legal [[drug test]] can just as easily become an illegal peek at your future in the company.|Vincent Freeman ([[Ethan Hawke]])|''[[Gattaca]]'', 1997}}
