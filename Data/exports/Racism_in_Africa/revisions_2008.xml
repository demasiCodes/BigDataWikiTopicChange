==Botswana==
Since the mid-1990s the central government of [[Botswana]] has been trying to move [[Bushmen]] out of the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] even though the national constitution guarantees the Bushmen the right to live there in perpetuity. As of October 2005, the government has resumed its policy of forcing all Bushmen off their lands in the Game Reserve, using armed police and threats of violence or death.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/10/29/wbot29.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2005/10/29/ixworld.html

==Democratic Republic of Congo==
On [[5 July]] [[1960]], five days after the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] gained independence from Belgium, the [[Force Publique]] garrison near [[Léopoldville]] mutinied against its white officers and attacked numerous European targets. This caused the fear amongst the approximately 100,000 [[white African|whites]] still resident in the Congo and mass exodus from the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/united_nations_congo.htm ::UN:: History Learning Site]&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the [[Second Congo War|Congo Civil War]], [[Pygmies]] were hunted down like game animals and eaten. Both sides of the war regarded them as "subhuman" and some say their flesh can confer magical powers. UN human rights activists reported in [[2003]] that rebels had carried out acts of [[cannibalism]]. Sinafasi Makelo, a representative of [[Mbuti]] pygmies, has asked the [[UN Security Council]] to recognise cannibalism as a crime against humanity and an act of [[genocide]]. The Pygmies are believed to be the [[indigenous peoples|original inhabitants]] of the vast rainforests of [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article123435.ece Rebels 'eating Pygmies' as mass slaughter continues in Congo despite peace agreement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3869489.stm DR Congo pygmies 'exterminated']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1404601,00.html Pygmies struggle to survive in war zone where abuse is routine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2933524.stm DR Congo Pygmies appeal to UN]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ivory Coast==
In the past recent years the Ivory Coast has seen a resurgence in ethnic tribal hatred and religious intolerance.  In addition to the many victims among the various tribes of the northern and southern regions of the country that have perished in the ongoing conflict, foreigners residing or visiting the Ivory Coast have also been subjected to violent attacks. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the Ivory Coast government is guilty of fanning ethnic hatred for its own political ends.&lt;ref&gt;
[news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/Africa/1932930.stm Ivory Coast "fanning ethnic hatred"]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2004, the [[Congrès Panafricaine des Jeunes Patriotes|Young Patriots]] of Abidjan, strongly [[nationalist]] organisation, rallied by the State media, plundered possessions of foreign nationals in [[Abidjan]]. Calls for violence against whites and non-Ivorians were broadcast on national radio and TV after the Young Patriots seized control of its offices. Rapes, beatings, and murders of white expatriates and local [[Arab diaspora|Lebanese]] followed. Thousands of expatriates and Lebanese fled. The attacks drew international condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/11/19/wapp19.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/11/19/ixnewstop.html The night westerners were hunted for being white - Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200411/s1242699.htm Europeans flee Ivory Coast violence. 13/11/2004.

==Madagascar==
Ethnic tensions in Madagascar often produce violent conflict between the highlanders and coastal peoples. The Merina people in particular are often the targets of violence especially during political campaigns to elect a new president.&lt;ref&gt;

==Mauritania==
{{Further|[[Slavery in modern Africa]]}}
[[Slavery in Mauritania]] persists despite its abolition in 1980 and affects the descendants of black Africans abducted into [[slavery]] before generations, who live now in [[Mauritania]] as "black [[Moors]]" or ''[[haratin]]'' and who partially still serve the "white Moors", or ''bidhan'', as slaves. The practice of slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors. For centuries, the so-called Haratin lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by these Moors. Social attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide is still very alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L18334379.htm Reuters AlertNet - Slavery still exists in Mauritania]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ruling bidanes (the name means literally white-skinned people) are descendants of the [[Sanhaja]] [[Berbers]] and [[Beni Hassan]] Arab tribes who emigrated  to northwest [[Africa]] and present-day [[Western Sahara]] and [[Mauritania]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. Many descendants of the Beni Hassan tribes today still adhere to the [[supremacist]] ideology of their ancestors. This ideology has led to oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups in the Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522 Fair elections haunted by racial imbalance]&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to some estimates, as many to 600,000 black Mauritanians, or 20% of the population, are still enslaved, many of them used as [[bonded labour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1458_abolition/page4.shtml The Abolition season on BBC World Service]&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery in Mauritania was finally criminalized in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6938032.stm Mauritanian MPs pass slavery law]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Morocco==
[[History of the Jews under Muslim rule|Jews]] and [[Christians]] were expelled from [[Morocco]] and [[Islamic Spain]] during the reign of [[Berber people|Berber]] dynasty of [[Almohads]] in the [[12th century]]. Almohads gave a choice of either death or conversion to [[Islam]], or exile.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} Some, such the family of [[Maimonides]], fled east to more tolerant [[Islam by country|Muslim lands]], while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 The Forgotten Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/IntergroupTO/JewishMuslim/Almohads.htm The Almohads]&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish population were confined to [[mellah]]s in [[Morocco]] beginning from the [[15th century]]. In cities, a ''mellah'' was surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway. In contrast, rural ''mellahs'' were separate villages inhabited solely by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/017/morocco.html The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G. Bennett]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Niger==
In October 2006, [[Niger]] announced that it would deport to Chad the so called ''[[Diffa Arabs]]'': [[Arabs]] living in the Diffa region of eastern Niger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6087048.stm BBC NEWS | Africa |Niger starts mass Arab expulsions]&lt;/ref&gt; This population numbered about 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25138454.htm Reuters AlertNet - Niger's Arabs say expulsions will fuel race hate]&lt;/ref&gt; While the government was rounding Arabs in preparation for the deportation, two girls died, reportedly after fleeing government forces, and three women suffered miscarriages. Niger's government had eventually suspended a controversial decision to deport Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6081416.stm BBC NEWS | Africa |Niger's Arabs to fight expulsion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?docid=469638881e UNHCR |Refworld - The Leader in Refugee Decision Support]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Niger, where the practice of [[slavery]] was outlawed in 2003, a study has found that more than 800,000 people are still slaves, almost 8% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=813618&amp;page=1 The Shackles of Slavery in Niger]&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4250709.stm Born to be a slave in Niger] By Hilary Andersson, BBC Africa Correspondent, Niger&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery dates back for centuries in Niger and was finally criminalised in 2003, after five years of lobbying by [[Anti-Slavery International]] and Nigerian human-rights group, Timidria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0310/p07s01-woaf.html On the way to freedom, Niger's slaves stuck in limbo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Descent-based slavery, where generations of the same family are born into [[debt bondage|bondage]], is traditionally practiced by at least four of Niger’s eight ethnic groups. The slave masters are mostly from the lighter-skinned [[nomadic]] tribes — the [[Tuareg]], [[Fulani]], [[Toubou]] and [[Arabs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2005/september/bondage.php?page=3 Born into Bondage]&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially rife among the warlike [[Tuareg]], in the wild deserts of north and west Niger, who roam near the borders with Mali and Algeria. In the region of Say on the right bank of the river Niger, it is estimated that three-quarters of the population around 1904-1905 was composed of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/PDF/Full%20English%20Slavery%20in%20Niger.pdf Slavery in Niger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the Tuareg swelled the ranks of their black slaves during war raids into other peoples’ lands. War was then the main source of supply of slaves, although many were bought at slave markets, run mostly by indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=53497 NIGER: Slavery - an unbroken chain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=813618&amp;page=1 The Shackles of Slavery in Niger]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[January 25]], [[1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; In September, 2000, the [[U.S. State Department]] alleged that "the Sudanese government's support of [[slavery]] and its continued military action which has resulted in numerous deaths are due in part to the victims' religious beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/05/state.dept.religion/index.html U.S. State Department report says 'religious intolerance remains far too common' around world.

The United States government's [[Sudan Peace Act]] of [[October 21]], [[2002]] accused [[Sudan]] of genocide in an [[Second Sudanese Civil War|ongoing civil war]] which has cost more than 2,000,000 lives and has displaced more than 4,000,000 people since the war started in [[1983]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2002/14531.htm U.S. Department of State: Sudan Peace Act] [[October 21]], [[2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that as many as 200,000 people had been taken into slavery during the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] (1983-2005). The slaves are mostly [[Dinka]] people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iabolish.org/slavery_today/in_depth/sudan-genocide.html War and Genocide in Sudan]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/livewire/archived/the_lost_children_of_sudan/ The Lost Children of Sudan]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2004]], it became widely known that there was an [[Darfur conflict|organised campaign]] by Janjaweed militias (nomadic [[Arab]] shepherds with the support of Sudanese government troops) to get rid of 80 black African groups from the [[Darfur]] region of western Sudan. These peoples include the Fur, Zaghawa and Massalit.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Clayton ''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1107849_2,00.html Desert hides world's worst humanitarian crisis]'' in [[The Times]] [[May 13]], [[2004]], Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Andersson''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1358234_1,00.html Genocide lays waste Darfur’s land of no men]'' in [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]] [[November 14]], [[2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mukesh Kapila ([[United Nations]] humanitarian coordinator) is quoted as saying: "This is more than just a conflict. It is an organised attempt [by Khartoum] to do away with a group of people.

Prior to the 16th centry, the bulk of slaves exported from Africa were shipped from [[East Africa]] to the [[Arabian peninsula]]. [[Zanzibar]] became a leading port on this trade. Arab slave traders differed from European ones in that they would often conduct raiding expeditions themselves, sometimes penetrating deep into the continent. They also differed in that their market greatly preferred the purchase of female slaves over male ones. Zanzibar was once East Africa's main slave-trading port, and under Omani Arabs in the 19th century as many as 50,000 slaves were passing through the city each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/data/2001/10/01/html/ft_20011001.6.html Swahili Coast]&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[David Livingstone]] wrote of the slave trade: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''To overdraw its evils is a simple impossibility.... We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed through the body and lying on the path. [Onlookers] said an Arab who passed early that morning had done it in anger at losing the price he had given for her, because she was unable to walk any longer. We passed a woman tied by the neck to a tree and dead.... We came upon a man dead from starvation.... The strangest disease I have seen in this country seems really to be broken heartedness, and it attacks free men who have been captured and made slaves.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Livingstone estimated that 80,000 Africans died each year before ever reaching the slave markets of [[Zanzibar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6510675.stm Remembering East African slave raids], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chi.gospelcom.net/GLIMPSEF/Glimpses/glmps111.shtml David Livingstone; Christian History Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilotguides.com/destination_guide/africa/tanzania_and_zanzibar/slave_trade.php The blood of a nation of Slaves in Stone Town]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.geocities.com/goldenmaggot.t21@btinternet.com/zanzibar.html Zanzibar]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zanzibar Revolution]] of January 12, 1964 put an end to the local Arab dynasty. As many as 17,000 Arabs were massacred by the descendants of black African [[Arab slave trade|slaves]], according to reports, and thousands of others were detained and their property either confiscated or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel4.empireschildren.co.uk/category/chapters/index.php?chapter=472&amp;cat=3 Country Histories - Empire's Children]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://whosfaultisit.blogspot.com/2006/09/homemade-genocide-arab-world-is.html |title=A Homemade Genocide  |last=Heartman |first=Adam |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[2006-09-26]] |publisher=Who's Fault Is It?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunisia==
The accession of the Almohade dynasty to the throne of the [[Maghreb]] provinces in 1146 proved very disastrous to the [[Jews]] of [[Tunis]]. Jews as well as [[Christians]] were compelled either to embrace [[Islam]] or to leave the country. [[Abd al-Mu'min]]'s successors pursued the same course, and their severe measures resulted either in emigration or in forcible conversions. Soon becoming suspicious of the sincerity of the new converts, the Almohades compelled them to wear a special garb, with a yellow cloth for a head-covering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/045/8.html The History of The Jews of Tunisia]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Racist opinions occurred in the works of some [[Arab]]-[[Muslim]] historians and geographers: so in the 14th century AD, the Tunisian [[Ibn Khaldun]] could write:   
&lt;blockquote&gt;- :''"beyond [known peoples of black West Africa] to the south there is no civilization in the proper sense. There are only humans who are closer to dumb animals than to rational beings. They live in thickets and caves, and eat herbs and unprepared grain. They frequently eat each other. They cannot be considered human beings."'' ''"...the Negro nations are, as a rule, submissive to slavery, because (Negroes) have little that is (essentially) human and possess attributes that are quite similar to those of dumb animals..."''&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.al-eman.com/islamlib/viewchp.asp?BID=163&amp;CID=8#s3].

==Uganda==
Former British colonies in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] have many citizens of [[South Asian]] descent. They were brought there by the [[British Empire]] from [[British India]] to do clerical work in Imperial service.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"&gt;General Amin and the Indian Exodus from Uganda
Hasu H. Patel, Issue: A Journal of Opinion, Vol. 2, No. 4 (Winter, 1972), pp. 12-22
doi:10.2307/1166488&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent case being the [[ethnic cleansing]] of Indian (sometimes simply called "[[Asian people|Asian]]") minority in [[Uganda]] by strongman [[dictator]] and [[human-rights]] violator [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;. 

The 1968 Committee on "Africanization in Commerce and Industry" in Uganda made far-reaching Indophobic proposals. A system of work permits and trade licenses
was introduced in 1969 in order to restrict the role of Indians in economic and professional activities. Indians were segregated and discriminated against in all walks of life. After Amin came to power, he exploited these divisions to spread propaganda against Indians involving [[stereotyping]] and [[scapegoating]] the Indian minority. Indians were stereotyped as "only traders" and so "inbred" to their profession. Indians were attacked as "dukawallas" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time).&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;. 

In the 1970s [[Uganda]] and other East African nations implemented racist policies that targeted the Asian population of the region. Uganda under [[Idi Amin]]'s leadership was particularly most virulent in its anti-Asian policies. In August 1972, Idi Amin declared what he called an "economic war", a set of policies that included the expropriation of properties owned by Asians and Europeans. Uganda's 80,000 Asians were mostly [[India]]ns born in the country, whose ancestors had come to Uganda when the country was still a British colony. [http://www.ugandamission.net/aboutug/articles/amin.html] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/7/newsid_2492000/2492333.stm] Indians were stereotyped as "greedy, conniving", without any racial identity or loyalty but "always cheating, conspiring and plotting" to subvert Uganda. Amin used this propaganda to justify a campaign of "de-Indianization", eventually resulting in the expulsion and [[ethnic cleansing]] of Uganda's Indian minority.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;. 

[[India]] had refused to accept them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/uk-indians-taking-care-of-business/2006/03/07/1141701511987.html UK Indians taking care of business]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the expelled Indians settled in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/england/suffolk/article_1.shtml Uganda's loss, Britain's gain]&lt;/ref&gt; The forced expulsion of Uganda's entire Asian population attests to the persecution of Asian peoples residing in the country at the time. Today, Asian/Indian residents of Uganda continue to face marginalization being given an inferior status.
