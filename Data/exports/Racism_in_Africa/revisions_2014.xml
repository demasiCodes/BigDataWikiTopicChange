During the colonial people in African nations were divided by [[race]] and the societies were arranged in a racial hierarchy. Colonialism led to racism being inscribed in to the colonial laws by the colonizers and led to the creation of race-based nations from the 1800s until the 1960s. Indirect rule and direct ruled administrations meant that African nations were ruled by White minority governments. Blacks, Indians, Arabs and Multi-racial people during the colonial period were discriminated against. The racial stratification meant that discrimination was legal and part of everyday society.

[[Race]] and [[racism]] continues to be a factor in the post-colonial context.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culanth.org/articles/702-race-in-africa-today-a-commentary&lt;/ref&gt; It is a colonial legacy that continues to affect African countries in new and old forms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20638352?uid=3739936&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104541578641&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial Era Racism==
Racism and colonization were interrelated.&lt;ref name="reunionblackfamily.com"&gt;http://www.reunionblackfamily.com/apps/blog/show/17999836-racism-and-colonialism-were-symmetrically-related-in-africa-under-white-rule&lt;/ref&gt; Racism was used to justify colonialism. It imposed and produced the conquest of African nations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/critic/racism-algeria.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the colonial imagination Africans had to move from their "primitive" existence to a modern European one. Africans were seen as primitive and backward in development due to the racist ideas of [[Social Darwinism]].&lt;ref name="reunionblackfamily.com"/&gt; The relationship between the colonized and colonizer was mediated by race and a system of racism that disadvantaged Blacks, Asians and Arabs.

==Botswana==
Since the mid-1990s the central government of [[Botswana]] has been trying to move [[Bushmen]] out of the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] even though the national constitution guarantees the Bushmen the right to live there in perpetuity. As of October 2005, the government has resumed its policy of forcing all Bushmen off their lands in the game reserve using armed police and threats of violence or death.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/10/29/wbot29.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2005/10/29/ixworld.html

==Burundi==
{{Further|Burundian Genocide}}
{{See also|Dominant minority}}

Beginning about 1880, [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] missionaries arrived in the Great Lakes region. Later, when German forces occupied the area during [[World War I]], the conflict and efforts for Catholic [[Religious conversion|conversion]] became more pronounced. As the Tutsi resisted conversion, the missionaries found success only among the [[Hutu]]. In an effort to reward conversion, the colonial government confiscated traditionally Tutsi land and reassigned it to Hutu tribes, igniting a conflict that has lasted into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Berg"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulanu.org/tutsi/jews-africa.php|first=Irwin M.|last=Berg|publisher=''Kulanu  Highlights''|title=Jews in Central Africa|accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was ruled as a colony by [[Germany]] (before [[World War I]]) and [[Belgium]]. Because Tutsis had been the tradiitional governing elite, both colonial powers kept this system and allowed only the Tutsi to be educated and only they could participate in the colonial government. Such discriminatory policies engendered resentment.

When the Belgians took over the colony, they believed the colony could be better governed if they continued to identify the different populations. In the 1920s, they required people to identify with a particular ethnic group and classified them in censuses. European colonists viewed Africans in general as children who needed to be guided, but noted the Tutsi to be the ruling culture in Rwanda-Burundi. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In 1959, Belgium reversed its stance and allowed the majority Hutu to assume control of the government through universal elections after independence. This partly reflected internal Belgian domestic politics, who later saw the discrimination against the Hutu majority as similar to oppression within Belgium  suffered from the Flemish-Walloon conflict. They saw the democratization and empowerment of the Hutu as a just response to the Tutsi domination. The Belgian policies wavered and flip-flopped considerably during this period leading up to [[Burundi#Independence and civil war|independence of Burundi]] and [[History of Rwanda#Strife and independence|Rwanda]].

The Hutu majority had [[Rwanda Revolution|revolted]] against the Tutsi but was unable to take power. Tutsis fled and created exile communities outside Rwanda in Uganda and Tanzania. Since the nation's independence, more extremist Tutsi came to power and oppressed the Hutus, especially those who were educated.&lt;ref name="Michael Bowen 1972, p. 49"&gt;Michael Bowen, ''Passing by;: The United States and genocide in Burundi'', 1972, (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1973), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="René Lemarchand 1974"&gt;René Lemarchand, ''Selective genocide in Burundi'' (Report - Minority Rights Group; no. 20, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rene Lemarchand 1996"&gt;Rene Lemarchand, ''Burundi: Ethnic Conflict and Genocide'' (New York: Woodrow Wilson Center and [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996)

The Belgian-sponsored [[Rwandan monarchy|Tutsi monarchy]] survived until 1959, when [[Kigeli V of Rwanda|Kigeli V]] was exiled from the colony (then called [[Ruanda-Urundi]]). In Burundi, Tutsis, who are the minority, maintained control of the government and military.

In [[Burundi]], [[Burundi genocide#May to July, 1972|a campaign of genocide]] was conducted against the country's Hutu population in 1972,&lt;ref name="usip.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bowen, ''Passing by;: The United States and genocide in Burundi'', 1972, (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1973), 49 pp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;René Lemarchand, ''Selective genocide in Burundi'' (Report - Minority Rights Group; no. 20, 1974), 36 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rene Lemarchand, ''Burundi: Ethnic Conflict and Genocide'' (New York: Woodrow Wilson Center and [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996), 232 pp.

==Ethiopia==
{{main|Shanqella}}
Racism in [[Ethiopia]] has traditionally been directed at the country's [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] ethnic minorities, as well as other individuals with similarly pronounced "[[Negroid]]" physical features. Collectively, these groups are locally known as [[Shanqella]] or ''barya'', derogatory terms originally denoting slave descent, irrespective of the individual's family history.&lt;ref name="Suhlig"&gt;{{cite book|last=Uhlig|first=Siegbert|title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=3447047461|pages=489–490|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nobesFx6E7oC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=Blair|title=Ethiopia: The Country That Cut Off Its Head: A Diary of the Revolution|year=1975|publisher=Robson Books|isbn=0903895501|page=117|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q7sJAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the Shanqella constituted most of the slave labour in the ruling local [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] societies.&lt;ref name="Cidsaeeet"&gt;{{cite book|last=Congrès international des sciences anthropologiques et ethnologiques, Pierre Champion|title=VIe [i.e. Sixième] Congrès international des sciences anthropologiques et ethnologiques, Paris, 30 juillet-6 août 1960: Ethnologie. 2 v|year=1963|publisher=Musée de l'homme|page=589|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EksRAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abyssinians ([[Habesha people|Habesha]] highlanders) were also noted as having actively hunted the Shanqella during the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Rsfisher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Richard Swainson|title=The Book of the World|year=1852|page=622|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ik4BAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the abolition of the slave trade in the 1940s, the freed Shanqella and ''barya'' were typically employed as unskilled labour.&lt;ref name="Cidsaeeet"/&gt; Racial discrimination against the ''barya'' or Shanqella communities in Ethiopia still exists, affecting access to political and social opportunities and resources.&lt;ref name="Suhlig"/&gt;

Traditionally, racism against perceived ''barya'' transcended class and remained in effect regardless of social position or parentage. As a result, former President of Ethiopia [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] was virtually absent from the country's controlled press in the first few weeks of his seizure of power. He also consciously avoided making public appearances, here too on the belief that his "Negroid" appearance would not sit well with the country's deposed political elite, particularly the [[Amhara people|Amhara]].&lt;ref name="Nwswket"&gt;{{cite book|title=Newsweek, Volume 85, Issues 1-8|year=1975|publisher=Newsweek|page=13|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KibkAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Mengistu's rise to prominence was hailed by the southern Shanqella groups as a personal victory, with one of their own having made good.&lt;ref name="Thomson"/&gt;

Although other populations in Ethiopia have faced varying degrees of discrimination, little of that adversity has by contrast been on account of racial differences. It is instead more typically rooted in disparities in class and competition for economic status. The often socio-economically disadvantaged [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Gurage people|Gurage]] are thus not considered by the highlander groups as being racially ''barya'', owing to their similar physical features and common Afro-Asiatic ancestry.&lt;ref name="Cidsaeeet"/&gt;

In terms of traditional perceptions, the Shanqella likewise racially contrast themselves from the Afro-Asiatic populations. The Anywaa ([[Anuak people|Anuak]]) Nilotes of southern Ethiopia consequently regard the Amhara, Oromo, [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigray]] and other Afro-Asiatic groups collectively as ''gaala'' in contradistinction to themselves.&lt;ref name="Kfukui"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katsuyoshi Fukui, Eisei Kurimoto, Masayoshi Shigeta|title=Ethiopia in Broader Perspective: Papers of the XIIIth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, Kyoto, 12-17 December 1997, Volume 2|year=1997|publisher=Shokado Book Sellers|isbn=487974977X|page=804|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ILRyAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ivory Coast==
In the past recent years the [[Ivory Coast]] has seen a resurgence in ethnic tribal hatred and religious intolerance.  In addition to the many victims among the various tribes of the northern and southern regions of the country that have perished in the ongoing conflict, foreigners residing or visiting the Ivory Coast have also been subjected to violent attacks. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the Ivory Coast government is guilty of fanning ethnic hatred for its own political ends.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[Congrès Panafricain des Jeunes et des Patriotes|Young Patriots]] of Abidjan, strongly [[nationalist]] organisation, rallied by the State media, plundered possessions of foreign nationals in [[Abidjan]]. Calls for violence against whites and non-Ivorians were broadcast on national radio and TV after the Young Patriots seized control of its offices. Rapes, beatings, and murders of white expatriates and local [[Arab diaspora|Lebanese]] followed. Thousands of expatriates and Lebanese fled. The attacks drew international condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/11/19/wapp19.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/11/19/ixnewstop.html The night westerners were hunted for being white - Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200411/s1242699.htm Europeans flee Ivory Coast violence. 13 November 2004.

==Kenya==
{{Main|Ethnic conflicts in Kenya|}}
{{See also|2007-2008 Kenyan crisis}}

'''[[Ethnic conflict]]s''' in [[Kenya]] occur frequently, although most are minor skirmishes a significant increase in the severity of these conflicts between the country's various ethnic groups began in the early nineties, culminating into the eventual nation-wide [[2007–08 Kenyan crisis]] that occurred right after the winner of the presidential election was declared in December 27, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questia.com/library/109266381/undercurrents-of-ethnic-conflicts-in-kenya Undercurrents of Ethnic Conflicts in Kenya by John O. Oucho | Questia, Your Online Research Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the ethnic conflicts in Kenya tend to usually more often occur only between the nation's larger ethnic groups such as the: [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], [[Luhya people|Luhya]], [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] and the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]].

==Liberia==
{{Further|Americo-Liberian}}
{{See also|Dominant minority}}

[[Americo-Liberian]]s are an ethnic group in Liberia that trace their ancestry to free-born and formerly [[History of slavery in the United States|enslaved African-Americans]] who immigrated to [[Africa]] the 19th century to become [[Founding Fathers|founders]] of Liberia a country that was created by [[American Colonization Society]] from land that was colonized by the U.S. The society was created to allow the return of freed [[African Americans]] from the recently abolished slave trade to what was considered greater freedom in [[Africa]].

Soon after [[colonization]] and immigrating the Americo-Liberians believing they were superior both culturally, ethnically, and religiously enslaved the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] population and tried to reeducate the them by forcing their beliefs and culture on them while enslaving them and forcing them to work on their newly created plantations modeled after the very same forms of slave labour practices that the U.S. practiced. This can be seen in the fact that Americo-Liberians converted most of the indigenous population into practicing [[Christianity]] and Liberia is now a Christian majority nation even though before that most of the population practiced traditional African religions. Owing to their belief of racial superiority Americo-Liberians rarely intermarried with the Indigenous population for fear that it would dilute their racial purity/superiority this is can seen in that majority of Liberia's presidents throughout Liberia's history when Americo-Liberians ruled the nation despite making up only a disproportionately small amount of the country's population were [[Mulatto]]es.

After enslaving the Indigenous population the Americo-Liberians dominated the nation politically, socially, economically and culturally this is true in the fact that for 133 years after independence, the Republic of Liberia was a one-party ruled nation by the Americo-Liberian dominated [[True Whig Party]]. Americo-Liberians have dominated Liberia's politic since its founding back in 1820 until [[Samuel Doe]] led a military coup in 1980. There is controversy on how Americo-Liberians held on to power for so long. Some attribute it to the fact that divisions were based on "light-skin vs. dark skin" particularly because the first president was a light skinned Mulatto. Although other observers attribute it to the [[Masonic Order of Liberia]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0808/p25s04-woaf.html?related For Liberians, old ties to US linger | csmonitor.com]&lt;/ref&gt; During the military coup most of the powerful Americo-Liberian families fled to America in the 1980s after President [[William Tolbert]] was assassinated for fear of being  assassinated themselves.

Due to the tyranny of their reign which eventually led to the infamous coup in 1980 to liberate/overthrow the country from Americo-Liberian rule and return the power to the Indigenous Liberians which constitute the majority of the nation's population. The effects of Americo-Liberian rule thereafter that resulted after the coup was that much of the indigenous population did not know how to decide who should be the ruler(s) of the nation due to the fact that much of the Indigenous population did not know how to rule a society due to the oppression dealt to them by Americo-Liberians for generations and that there was much political instability due ethnic tensions which led to the subsequent civil wars and the destruction of the country's economy leading Liberia to currently being the 3rd most impoverished nation in the world with about 85% of the society's population living below the international poverty line.

==Madagascar==
Ethnic tensions in Madagascar often produce violent conflict between the highlanders and coastal peoples. The [[Merina people]] in particular are often the targets of violence especially during political campaigns to elect a new president.&lt;ref&gt;

==Mali==
{{main|Slavery in Mali}}
Slavery continues to exist in Mali in all ethnic groups of the country but particularly among the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] communities. The French formally abolished slavery in 1905, but many slaves remained with their masters until 1946 when large emancipation activism occurred.&lt;ref name=Mauxion&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mauxion|first=Aurelien|title=Moving to Stay: ''Iklan'' Spatial Strategies Towards Socioeconomic Emancipation in Northern Mali, 1898-1960|journal=The Journal of African History|year=2012|volume=53|issue=2|pages=195–213|url=|doi=10.1017/s0021853712000394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first government of independent Mali tried to end slavery, but these efforts were undermined with the military dictatorship from 1968 until 1991.

==Mauritania==
{{Main|Slavery in Mauritania}}
{{Further2|[[Slavery in modern Africa]]}}
[[Slavery in Mauritania]] persists despite its abolition in 1980 and affects the descendants of black Africans abducted into [[slavery]] before generations, who live now in [[Mauritania]] as "black [[Moors]]" or ''[[haratin]]'' and who partially still serve the "white Moors", or ''bidhan'', as slaves. The practice of slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors. For centuries, the so-called Haratin lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by these Moors. Social attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide is still very alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L18334379.htm Reuters AlertNet - Slavery still exists in Mauritania]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling bidanes (the name means literally white-skinned people) are descendants of the [[Sanhaja]] [[Berber people|Berbers]] and [[Beni Ḥassān]] Arab tribes who emigrated  to northwest Africa and present-day [[Western Sahara]] and Mauritania during the [[Middle Ages]]. Many descendants of the Beni Ḥassān tribes today still adhere to the [[supremacist]] ideology of their ancestors. This ideology has led to oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups in Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522 Fair elections haunted by racial imbalance]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some estimates, as many to 600,000 black Mauritanians, or 20% of the population, are still enslaved, many of them used as [[bonded labour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1458_abolition/page4.shtml The Abolition season on BBC World Service]&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery in Mauritania was finally criminalized in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6938032.stm Mauritanian MPs pass slavery law]&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors, majority of whom were women and children, were eventually put in [[concentration camp]]s, such as that at [[Shark Island Concentration Camp|Shark Island]], where the German authorities forced them to work as slave labour for German military and settlers, all prisoners were categorised into groups fit and unfit for work, and pre-printed death certificates indicating "death by exhaustion following privation" were issued.&lt;ref&gt;The colonising camera: photographs in the making of Namibian history Wolfram Hartmann, Jeremy Silvester, Patricia Hayes, page 118, University of Cape Town Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The British government published their well-known account of the German genocide of the Nama and Herero peoples in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Bart Gewald, Jeremy Silvester, "Words Cannot Be Found: German Colonial Rule in Namibia : An Annotated Reprint of the 1918 Blue Book (Sources on African History, 1)", Brill Academic Publishers, annotated edition (1 June 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical experiments were performed on the Herero and Nama people by the Germans much similar to the ways the Germans did to the [[European Jews]] during the [[Holocaust]]. [[Eugen Fischer]], a German anthropologist, came to the concentration camps to conduct medical experiments on race,&lt;ref name="Mamdani, p. 12"&gt;Mamdani, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; using children of Herero people and [[mulatto]] children of Herero women and German men as test subjects.&lt;ref name="Mamdani, p. 12"/&gt; Other experiments were made by Dr Bofinger, who injected Herero that were suffering from scurvy with various substances including arsenic and opium; afterwards he researched the effects of these substances by performing autopsies on dead bodies&lt;ref&gt;The Kaiser's Holocaust: Germany's Forgotten Genocide and the Colonial Roots of Nazism, page 225, Casper Erichsen, David Olusoga,  Faber and Faber  2010&lt;/ref&gt;

With the closure of concentration camps all surviving Herero were distributed as labourers for settlers in the German colony, and from that time on, all Herero over the age of seven were forced to wear a metal disc with their labour registration number,&lt;ref name="Mamdani, p. 12"/&gt; and banned from owning land or cattle, a necessity for pastoral society.&lt;ref&gt;Production, Reproduction and Communication of Armed Violence Aparna Rao, Michael Bollig and Monika Böck,page 89, Berghahn Books 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the Herero and Namaqua genocide influenced the [[Nazis]] and [[Nazi Germany]].

In 1985, the [[United Nations]]' [[Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights#Whitaker Report|Whitaker Report]] classified the aftermath as an attempt to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples of [[South-West Africa]], and therefore one of the earliest attempts at genocide in the 20th century.

==Niger==
In October 2006, [[Niger]] announced that it would deport to Chad the so-called ''[[Diffa Arabs]]'': [[Arabs]] living in the Diffa region of eastern Niger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6087048.stm BBC NEWS | Africa |Niger starts mass Arab expulsions]&lt;/ref&gt; This population numbered about 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25138454.htm Reuters AlertNet - Niger's Arabs say expulsions will fuel race hate]&lt;/ref&gt; While the government was rounding up Arabs in preparation for the deportation, two girls died, reportedly after fleeing government forces, and three women suffered miscarriages. Niger's government had eventually suspended a controversial decision to deport Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6081416.stm BBC NEWS | Africa |Niger's Arabs to fight expulsion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?docid=469638881e UNHCR |Refworld - The Leader in Refugee Decision Support]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Niger, where the practice of [[slavery]] was outlawed in 2003, a study has found that more than 800,000 people are still slaves, almost 8% of the population.&lt;ref name="The Shackles of Slavery in Niger"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=813618&amp;page=1 The Shackles of Slavery in Niger]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4250709.stm Born to be a slave in Niger] By Hilary Andersson, BBC Africa Correspondent, Niger&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery dates back for centuries in Niger and was finally criminalised in 2003, after five years of lobbying by [[Anti-Slavery International]] and Nigerian human-rights group, Timidria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0310/p07s01-woaf.html On the way to freedom, Niger's slaves stuck in limbo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Descent-based slavery, where generations of the same family are born into [[debt bondage|bondage]], is traditionally practiced by at least four of Niger's eight ethnic groups. The slave masters are mostly from the lighter-skinned [[nomadic]] tribes — the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Fulani]], [[Toubou]] and Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2005/september/bondage.php?page=3 Born into Bondage]&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially rife among the warlike Tuareg, in the wild deserts of north and west Niger, who roam near the borders with Mali and Algeria. In the region of Say on the right bank of the river Niger, it is estimated that three-quarters of the population around 1904&amp;ndash;1905 was composed of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/PDF/Full%20English%20Slavery%20in%20Niger.pdf Slavery in Niger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the Tuareg swelled the ranks of their black slaves during war raids into other peoples’ lands. War was then the main source of supply of slaves, although many were bought at slave markets, run mostly by indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="The Shackles of Slavery in Niger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=53497 NIGER: Slavery - an unbroken chain]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republic of the Congo==
In the [[Republic of Congo]], where Pygmies make up 2% of the population, many Pygmies live as [[slaves]] to [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] masters. The nation is deeply stratified between these two major ethnic groups.  The Pygmy slaves belong from birth to their Bantu masters in a relationship that the Bantus call a time-honored tradition.  Even though the Pygmies are responsible for much of the hunting, fishing and manual labor in jungle villages, Pygmies and Bantus alike say Pygmies are often paid at the master's whim; in cigarettes, used clothing, or even nothing at all. As a result of pressure from [[UNICEF]] and human-rights activists, a law that would grant special protections to the Pygmy people is awaiting a vote by the Congo parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/110/story/552528.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090228160138/http://newsobserver.com/110/story/552528.html |archivedate=2009-02-28 |title=Congo's Pygmies live as slaves |work=The News &amp; Observer |first=Katie |last=Thomas |date=March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/16/world/as-the-world-intrudes-pygmies-feel-endangered.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=As the World Intrudes, Pygmies Feel Endangered |author=Nicholas D.

Beginning about 1880, [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] missionaries arrived in the Great Lakes region. Later, when German forces occupied the area during [[World War I]], the conflict and efforts for Catholic [[Religious conversion|conversion]] became more pronounced. As the Tutsi resisted conversion, the missionaries found success only among the [[Hutu]]. In an effort to reward conversion, the colonial government confiscated traditionally Tutsi land and reassigned it to Hutu tribes, igniting a conflict that has lasted into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Berg"/&gt;

The area was ruled as a colony by [[Germany]] (before [[World War I]]) and [[Belgium]]. Because Tutsis had been the tradiitional governing elite, both colonial powers kept this system and allowed only the Tutsi to be educated and only they could participate in the colonial government. Such discriminatory policies engendered resentment.

When the Belgians took over the colony, they believed the colony could be better governed if they continued to identify the different populations. In the 1920s, they required people to identify with a particular ethnic group and classified them in censuses. European colonists viewed Africans in general as children who needed to be guided, but noted the Tutsi to be the ruling culture in Rwanda-Burundi. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In 1959, Belgium reversed its stance and allowed the majority Hutu to assume control of the government through universal elections after independence. This partly reflected internal Belgian domestic politics, who later saw the discrimination against the Hutu majority as similar to oppression within Belgium  suffered from the Flemish-Walloon conflict. They saw the democratization and empowerment of the Hutu as a just response to the Tutsi domination. The Belgian policies wavered and flip-flopped considerably during this period leading up to [[Burundi#Independence and civil war|independence of Burundi]] and [[History of Rwanda#Strife and independence|Rwanda]].

The Hutu majority had [[Rwanda Revolution|revolted]] against the Tutsi but was unable to take power. Tutsis fled and created exile communities outside Rwanda in Uganda and Tanzania. Since the nation's independence, more extremist Tutsi came to power and oppressed the Hutus, especially those who were educated.&lt;ref name="Michael Bowen 1972, p. 49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="René Lemarchand 1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rene Lemarchand 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usip.org"/&gt; Their actions led to the deaths of up to 200,000 Hutus.&lt;ref name="allan.stam.googlepages.com"&gt;[http://allan.stam.googlepages.com/Rwandaoped0405042.pdf Christian Davenport and Allan Stam, "Rwanda 1994: Genocide + Politicide"]&lt;/ref&gt; Overt discrimination from the colonial period was continued by different Rwandan and Burundian governments, including identity cards that distinguished Tutsi and Hutu.

The Belgian-sponsored [[Rwandan monarchy|Tutsi monarchy]] survived until 1959, when [[Kigeli V of Rwanda|Kigeli V]] was exiled from the colony (then called [[Ruanda-Urundi]]). In Rwanda, the political power was transferred from the minority Tutsi to the majority Hutu.&lt;ref&gt;Adekunle, Julius. 2007. Culture and Customs of Rwanda. P.17&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rwanda, a Tutsi rebel group, the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]], invaded Rwanda from Uganda, which started a civil war against Rwanda's Hutu government in 1990. A peace agreement was signed, but violence erupted again, culminating in the [[Rwandan Genocide]] of 1994, when Hutu extremists killed&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/evil/etc/slaughter.html| title = Timeline of the genocide| accessdate = 2006-12-30| publisher = PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; an estimated 800,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsis.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | title = How the genocide happened | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1288230.stm | publisher = BBC| date = 2004-04-01| accessdate = 2006-10-31 | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 30% of the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]] population of Rwanda were also killed.&lt;ref name="irin"&gt;{{cite news | title = Minorities Under Siege: Pygmies today in Africa | url = http://www.irinnews.org/webspecials/pygmy/52529.asp | publisher = UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs| year = 2006| accessdate = 2006-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bantu (also called ''Wagosha'') are an ethnic minority group in [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Cal"&gt;[http://www.cal.org/co/bantu/somali_bantu.pdf Bantu - People]&lt;/ref&gt; They are the descendants of people from various [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] ethnic groups originating in what are modern-day [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]] and [[Mozambique]] who were sold into slavery as part of the recent [[Arab slave trade]].&lt;ref name="Cal"/&gt; Bantus are ethnically, physically and culturally distinct from [[Somali people|Somalis]], and have remained marginalized ever since their arrival in Somalia.&lt;ref name="Cal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Randol Barker et al., ''Principles of Ambulatory Medicine'', 7 edition, (Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins: 2006), p.633&lt;/ref&gt;

Bantu adult and children slaves (referred to collectively as ''jareer'' by their Somali masters&lt;ref name="USRCLS"&gt;Catherine Lowe Besteman, ''Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), pp. 83-84&lt;/ref&gt;) were purchased in the slave market exclusively to do undesirable work on plantation grounds.&lt;ref name="USRCLS"/&gt; They toiled under the control of and separately from their Somali patrons. In terms of legal considerations, Bantu slaves were also devalued. Additionally, Somali social mores strongly discouraged, censured and looked down upon any kind of sexual contact with Bantu slaves. Freedom for these plantation slaves was also often acquired through escape.&lt;ref name="USRCLS"/&gt;

In addition to Bantu plantation slaves, Somalis sometimes enslaved peoples of [[Oromo people|Oromo]] pastoral background that were captured during wars and raids on Oromo settlements.&lt;ref name="USRCLS2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Bridget Anderson, ''World Directory of Minorities'', (Minority Rights Group International: 1997), p. 456.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were marked differences in terms of the perception, capture and treatment of the Oromo pastoral slaves versus the Bantu plantation slaves. On an individual basis, Oromo subjects were also not viewed as racially ''jareer'' by their Somali captors.&lt;ref name="USRCLS2"&gt;Catherine Lowe Besteman, ''Unraveling Somalia: Race, Class, and the Legacy of Slavery'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1999), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery was by no means just restricted to the European slave trade. During the [[Difaqane]], the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] under [[Shaka]] overran many smaller tribes and enslaved them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isic.org/sisp/index.htm?fx=destination&amp;loc_id=131114&amp;section=culture|title=Destinations: South Africa - Pre 20th Century History|publisher=International Student Travel Conveduration|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery in South Africa was officially [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in 1833 with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/huk-1833act.htm|title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833|date=1833-10-29|publisher=Houses of Parliament, Palace of Westminster, London.|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of racism and discriminatory practices during the colonial period, such as the allocation of rations during the [[Siege of Ladysmith]]

Even [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]] who worked to eradicate racism and in particular racism that affected the Indian communities in South Africa, was not immune to racism during this period. In one of his [[Gandhi#Early South African articles|early articles]] for the ''[[Indian Opinion]]'' he writes:

Prior to the 16th century, the bulk of slaves exported from Africa were shipped from East Africa to the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. [[Zanzibar]] became a leading port on this trade. Arab slave traders differed from European ones in that they would often conduct raiding expeditions themselves, sometimes penetrating deep into the continent. They also differed in that their market greatly preferred the purchase of female slaves over male ones. Zanzibar was once East Africa's main slave-trading port, and under Omani Arabs in the 19th century as many as 50,000 slaves were passing through the city each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/data/2001/10/01/html/ft_20011001.6.html Swahili Coast]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Livingstone]] wrote of the slave trade:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''To overdraw its evils is a simple impossibility.... We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed through the body and lying on the path. [Onlookers] said an Arab who passed early that morning had done it in anger at losing the price he had given for her, because she was unable to walk any longer. We passed a woman tied by the neck to a tree and dead.... We came upon a man dead from starvation.... The strangest disease I have seen in this country seems really to be broken heartedness, and it attacks free men who have been captured and made slaves.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Livingstone estimated that 80,000 Africans died each year before ever reaching the slave markets of Zanzibar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6510675.stm Remembering East African slave raids], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chi.gospelcom.net/GLIMPSEF/Glimpses/glmps111.shtml David Livingstone; Christian History Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilotguides.com/destination_guide/africa/tanzania_and_zanzibar/slave_trade.php The blood of a nation of Slaves in Stone Town]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://uk.geocities.com/goldenmaggot.t21%40btinternet.com/zanzibar.html&amp;date=2009-10-24+21:10:34  Zanzibar]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zanzibar Revolution]] of January 12, 1964 put an end to the local Arab dynasty. As many as 17,000 Arabs were massacred by the descendants of black African [[Arab slave trade|slaves]], according to reports, and thousands of others were detained and their property either confiscated or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel4.empireschildren.co.uk/category/chapters/index.php?chapter=472&amp;cat=3 Country Histories - Empire's Children]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whosfaultisit.blogspot.com/2006/09/homemade-genocide-arab-world-is.html |title=A Homemade Genocide  |last=Heartman |first=Adam |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2006-09-26 |publisher=Who's Fault Is It?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunisia==
The accession of the Almohade dynasty to the throne of the [[Maghreb]] provinces in 1146 proved very disastrous to the [[Jews]] of [[Tunis]]. Jews as well as [[Christians]] were compelled either to embrace [[Islam]] or to leave the country. [[Abd al-Mu'min]]'s successors pursued the same course, and their severe measures resulted either in emigration or in forcible conversions. Soon becoming suspicious of the sincerity of the new converts, the Almohades compelled them to wear a special garb, with a yellow cloth for a head-covering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/045/8.html The History of The Jews of Tunisia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistranslations of Arab scholars and geographers from this time period have led many to attribute certain racist attitudes that weren't prevalent until the 18th and 19th century to writings made centuries ago.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/pss/3590803 Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldun Orientalist, by Abdelmajid Hannoum  © 2003 Wesleyan University.&lt;/ref&gt; Although bias against those of very black complexion existed in the Arab world in the 15th century it didn't have as much stigma as it later would. Older translations of Ibn Khaldun, for example in [http://books.google.com/books?id=6swTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 The Negro land of the Arabs Examined and Explained] which was written in 1841 gives excerpts of older translations that were not part of later colonial propaganda and show black Africans in a generally positive light.

:'' When the conquest of the West (by the Arabs) was completed, and merchants began to penetrate into the interior, they saw no nation of the Blacks so mighty as Ghanah, the dominions of which extended westward as far as the Ocean. The King's court was kept in the city of Ghanah, which, according to the author of the Book of Roger (El Idrisi), and the author of the Book of Roads and Realms (El Bekri), is divided into two parts, standing on both banks of the Nile, and ranks among the largest and most populous cities of the world. The people of Ghanah had for neighbours, on the east, a nation, which, according to historians, was called Susu; after which came another named Mali; and after that another known by the name of Kaukau ; although some people prefer a different orthography, and write this name Kagho. The last-named nation was followed by a people called Tekrur. The people of Ghanah declined in course of time, being overwhelmed or absorbed by the Molaththemun (or muffled people;that is, the Morabites), who, adjoining them on the north towards the Berber country, attacked them, and, taking possession of their territory, compelled them to embrace the Mohammedan religion. The people of Ghanah, being invaded at a later period by the Susu, a nation of Blacks in their neighbourhood, were exterminated, or mixed with other Black nations. [&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=6swTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA61 The Negro land of the Arabs Examined and Explained&lt;/ref&gt;]

==Uganda==
Former British colonies in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] have many citizens of [[South Asian]] descent. They were brought there by the [[British Empire]] from [[British India]] to do clerical work in Imperial service.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"&gt;General Amin and the Indian Exodus from Uganda
Hasu H. Patel, ''Issue: A Journal of Opinion'', Vol. 2, No. 4 (Winter, 1972), pp. 12-22 {{doi|10.2307/1166488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent case of anti-Indian racism was the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Indian (sometimes simply called "Asian") minority in [[Uganda]] by strongman [[dictator]] and [[human-rights]] violator [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;

The 1968 Committee on "Africanization in Commerce and Industry" in Uganda made far-reaching Indophobic proposals. A system of work permits and trade licenses
was introduced in 1969 in order to restrict the role of Indians in economic and professional activities. Indians were segregated and discriminated against in all walks of life. After Amin came to power, he exploited these divisions to spread propaganda against Indians, [[stereotyping]] and [[scapegoating]] the Indian minority. Indians were stereotyped as "only traders" and so "inbred" to their profession. Indians were attacked as "dukawallas" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time).&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;

In the 1970s Uganda and other East African nations implemented racist policies that targeted the Asian population of the region. Uganda under Idi Amin's leadership was particularly virulent in its anti-Asian policies. In August 1972, Idi Amin declared what he called an "economic war", a set of policies that included the expropriation of properties owned by Asians and Europeans. Uganda's 80,000 Asians were mostly Indians born in the country, whose ancestors had come to Uganda when the country was still a British colony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugandamission.net/aboutug/articles/amin.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/7/newsid_2492000/2492333.stm | work=BBC News | title=1972: Asians given 90 days to leave Uganda | date=1972-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indians were stereotyped as "greedy" and "conniving", without any racial identity or loyalty but "always cheating, conspiring and plotting" to subvert Uganda. Amin used this propaganda to justify a campaign of "de-Indianization", eventually resulting in the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Uganda's Indian minority.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;

India had refused to accept them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/uk-indians-taking-care-of-business/2006/03/07/1141701511987.html UK Indians taking care of business]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the expelled Indians settled in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/england/suffolk/article_1.shtml Uganda's loss, Britain's gain]&lt;/ref&gt; The forced expulsion of Uganda's entire Asian population attests to the persecution of Asian peoples residing in the country at the time. Today, Asian/Indian residents of Uganda continue to face marginalization, being given an inferior status.

Since independence, in recent years there has been a surge in violence and racism against the dwindling white community and particularly against white farmers. On 18 September 2010 droves of white people were chased away from participating in the constitutional outreach programme in Harare at the weekend, in which violence and confusion marred the process with similar incidents occurring in Graniteside. In [[Mount Pleasant, Harare|Mount Pleasant]], white families were subjected to a torrent of abuse by suspected Zanu PF supporters who later drove them away shouting racial slurs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zimdiaspora.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4026:racism-against-white-zimbabweans-reach-shocking-levels&amp;catid=38:travel-tips&amp;Itemid=18&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been many illegal seizures of farm land owned by white farmers by the government and pro government supporters.
