==Ivory Coast==
In 2001, [[Ivory Coast]] saw a resurgence in ethnic tribal hatred and religious intolerance.  In addition to the many victims among the various tribes of the northern and southern regions of the country that have perished in the ongoing conflict, foreigners residing or visiting Ivory Coast have also been subjected to violent attacks. According to a report by Human Rights Watch in 2001, the Ivory Coast government was guilty of fanning ethnic hatred for its own political ends.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[Congrès Panafricain des Jeunes et des Patriotes|Young Patriots]] of Abidjan, a strongly [[nationalist]] organisation, rallied by the state media, plundered possessions of foreign nationals in [[Abidjan]]. Rapes and beatings of persons of European and Lebanese descent followed. No deaths were reported. Thousands of expatriates and white or ethnic Lebanese Ivorians fled the country. The attacks drew international condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/11/19/wapp19.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/11/19/ixnewstop.html|title=News|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200411/s1242699.htm Europeans flee Ivory Coast violence. 13 November 2004.

==Mauritania==
{{Main|Slavery in Mauritania}}
{{further|Slavery in modern Africa}}
[[Slavery in Mauritania]] persists despite its abolition in 1980 and mostly affects the descendants of black Africans abducted into [[slavery]] who now live in [[Mauritania]] as "black [[Moors]]" or ''[[haratin]]'' and who partially still serve the "white Moors", or ''bidhan'', as slaves. The practice of slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors. For centuries, the ''haratin'' lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by these Moors. Social attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L18334379.htm|title=Thomson Reuters Foundation|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling ''bidanes'' (literally white-skinned people) are descendants of the [[Sanhaja]] [[Berber people|Berbers]] and [[Beni Ḥassān]] Arab tribes who emigrated to northwest Africa and present-day [[Western Sahara]] and Mauritania during the [[Middle Ages]]. Many descendants of the Beni Ḥassān tribes today still adhere to the [[supremacist]] ideology of their ancestors, which has caused the oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups in Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522|title=IRIN Africa - MAURITANIA: Fair elections haunted by racial imbalance - Mauritania - Governance - Human Rights|work=IRINnews|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some estimates, as many as 600,000 black Mauritanians, or 20% of the population, are still enslaved, many of them used as [[bonded labour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1458_abolition/page4.shtml|title=BBC World Service - The Abolition season on BBC World Service|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery in Mauritania was criminalized in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6938032.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - Mauritanian MPs pass slavery law|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namibia==
{{Main|Herero and Namaqua genocide}}

On 12 January 1904, the [[Herero people]], led by [[Samuel Maharero]], rebelled against [[Germany|German]] [[German colonial empire|colonial rule]]. In August, German general [[Lothar von Trotha]] defeated the Herero in the [[Battle of Waterberg]] and drove them into the desert of [[Omaheke]], where most of them died of thirst. In October, the [[Nama people]] also rebelled against the Germans, suffering a similar fate.

The violence eventually led to a genocide of the Herero and Nama people by the Germans, known as the [[Herero and Namaqua genocide]]. In total, 24,000 to 100,000 Herero and 10,000 Nama died.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Genocide and Reparations Claims in the 21st Century: The Socio-Legal Context of Claims under International Law by the Herero against Germany for Genocide in Namibia, 1904-1908 (PSI Reports) by Jeremy Sarkin-Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Empire, Colony, Genocide: Conquest, Occupation and Subaltern Resistance in World History (War and Genocide) (War and Genocide) (War and Genocide) A.

Some sources also claim that the German colonial army systematically poisoned desert wells.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Totten, William S. Parsons, Israel W.

In 1926, except for archive copies, records of the genocide were withdrawn and destroyed following a decision of the then Legislative Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=28&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=54620&amp;no_cache=1, ‘Stolen’ Blue Book was just misplaced] 23.04.2009

Thus, when the Blue Book was withdrawn from the public after Germany and England came to an agreement about how to share access to GSWA minerals, this was not censorship; it was just business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors, majority of whom were women and children, were eventually put in [[concentration camp]]s, such as the one at [[Shark Island Concentration Camp|Shark Island]], where the German authorities forced them to work as slaves for German military and settlers. All prisoners were categorized into groups fit and unfit for work, and pre-printed death certificates indicating "death by exhaustion following privation" were issued.&lt;ref&gt;The colonising camera: photographs in the making of Namibian history Wolfram Hartmann, Jeremy Silvester, Patricia Hayes, page 118, University of Cape Town Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The British government published their widely known account of the German genocide of the Nama and Herero peoples in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Bart Gewald, Jeremy Silvester, "Words Cannot Be Found: German Colonial Rule in Namibia : An Annotated Reprint of the 1918 Blue Book (Sources on African History, 1)", Brill Academic Publishers, annotated edition (1 June 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Herero died later of disease, overwork and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing |last=Michael Mann |page=105 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Hitler's African Victims: The German Army Massacres of Black French Soldiers in 1940 |page=83 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food in the camps was extremely scarce, consisting of rice with no additions.&lt;ref&gt;The practice of war Production, Reproduction and Communication of Armed Violence Edited by Aparna Rao, Michael Bollig and Monika Böck, page 92, Berghahn Books; 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Shootings, hangings and beatings were common,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Rethinking resistance: revolt and violence in African history |page=282 |last=Klaas van Walraven |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[sjambok]] was used by guards who treated the forced labourers harshly. Medical experiments were performed on the Herero and Nama people by the Germans, similar to those performed on the [[European Jews]] during the [[Holocaust]]. [[Eugen Fischer]], a German anthropologist, came to the concentration camps to conduct medical experiments on race,&lt;ref name="Mamdani, p. 12"&gt;Mamdani, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; using children of Herero people and [[mulatto]] children of Herero women and German men as test subjects.&lt;ref name="Mamdani, p. 12"/&gt; Other experiments were made by Dr Bofinger, who injected Herero that were suffering from scurvy with various substances including arsenic and opium; afterwards he researched the effects of these substances by performing autopsies on the dead bodies&lt;ref&gt;The Kaiser's Holocaust: Germany's Forgotten Genocide and the Colonial Roots of Nazism, page 225, Casper Erichsen, [[David Olusoga]],  Faber and Faber 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

With the closure of concentration camps, all surviving Herero were distributed as labourers for settlers in the German colony, and from then on, all Herero over the age of seven were forced to wear a metal disc with their labour registration number,&lt;ref name="Mamdani, p. 12"/&gt; and banned from owning land or cattle, a necessity in pastoral society.&lt;ref&gt;Production, Reproduction and Communication of Armed Violence Aparna Rao, Michael Bollig and Monika Böck,page 89, Berghahn Books 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the [[United Nations]]' [[Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights#Whitaker Report|Whitaker Report]] classified the aftermath as an attempt to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples of [[South-West Africa]], and therefore one of the earliest attempts at genocide in the 20th century. The German government recognised and apologised for the events in 2004, but has ruled out financial compensation or land reparation for the victims' descendants.&lt;ref name="BBC08142004"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3565938.stm|title = Germany admits Namibia genocide|date = 2004-08-14|accessdate = 2008-04-23|work = [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, there was only minor media attention in Germany on this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Alexander| last=Krabbe| url=http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&amp;no=180988&amp;rel_no=1| title=Remembering Germany's African Genocide| work=[[OhmyNews International]] | accessdate=2004-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, [[Niger]] announced that it would deport to Chad the "[[Diffa Arabs]]", [[Arabs]] living in the Diffa region of eastern Niger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6087048.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - Niger starts mass Arab expulsions|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=2006-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their population numbered about 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25138454.htm|title=Thomson Reuters Foundation|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the government was rounding up Arabs in preparation for the deportation, two girls died, reportedly after fleeing government forces, and three women suffered miscarriages.

In Niger, while the practice of [[slavery]] was outlawed in 2003, a study has found that more than 800,000 people are still slaves, almost 8% of the population.&lt;ref name="The Shackles of Slavery in Niger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=813618&amp;page=1|title=The Shackles of Slavery in Niger|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=2006-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4250709.stm Born to be a slave in Niger] By Hilary Andersson, BBC Africa Correspondent, Niger&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery dates back centuries in Niger and was criminalised after five years of lobbying by [[Anti-Slavery International]] and Nigerian human-rights group, Timidria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0310/p07s01-woaf.html|title=On the way to freedom, Niger's slaves stuck in limbo|author=The Christian Science Monitor|journal=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=2005-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descent-based slavery, where generations of the same family are born into [[debt bondage|bondage]], is traditionally practiced by at least four of Niger's eight ethnic groups. The slave masters are mostly from the lighter-skinned [[nomadic]] tribes: the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Fulani]], [[Toubou]] and Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2005/september/bondage.php?page=3|title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places - Smithsonian|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially rife among the warlike Tuareg, located in the wild deserts of north and west Niger, who roam near the borders with Mali and Algeria. In the region of Say on the right bank of the river Niger, it is estimated that three-quarters of the population around 1904&amp;ndash;1905 was composed of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/PDF/Full%20English%20Slavery%20in%20Niger.pdf|title=Anti-Slavery|author=dotMailer|accessdate=17 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306073532/http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/PDF/Full%20English%20Slavery%20in%20Niger.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the Tuareg swelled the ranks of their black slaves by conducting war raids into other peoples’ lands. War was the main source of supply of slaves, although many were bought at slave markets, run mostly by indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="The Shackles of Slavery in Niger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=53497|title=IRIN Africa - NIGER: Slavery - an unbroken chain - Niger - Gender Issues - Human Rights|work=IRINnews|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=2005-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Somalia==
The [[Somali Bantu]] ethnic minority face significant [[stigmatization]] in Somali society due to their differing physical appearance and ancestry from the [[Cushitic]]-origin majority of Somalia. Racialized [[epithets]] targeted at the Somali Bantu community exist such as 'adoon' (slave) similar in connotation to the Arabic term [[abeed]]. The [[marginalization]] of the Somali Bantu community is primarily based on [[racial|ethnoracial]] factors, unlike the marginalization of the [[Madhiban]] and other Somali-origin minorities which is primarily based on their status as a [[socially constructed]] [[caste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Eno|first1=Mohamed A.|last2=Eno|first2=Mohamed A.|last3=Kusow|first3=Abdi M.|date=2014-01-01|title=Racial and caste prejudice in Somalia|url=https://journals.co.za/content/aa_joss/1/2/EJC167583|journal=Journal of Somali Studies|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|issn=2056-5674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic [[Somalis]] and populations of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] stock are genetically divergent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hodgson|first1=Jason A.|last2=Mulligan|first2=Connie J.|last3=Al-Meeri|first3=Ali|last4=Raaum|first4=Ryan L.|date=2014-06-12|title=Early Back-to-Africa Migration into the Horn of Africa |journal=PLOS Genetics |volume=10|issue=6|pages=e1004393|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004393 |pmc=4055572|pmid=24921250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Schlebusch|first1=Carina M.|last2=Malmström|first2=Helena|last3=Günther|first3=Torsten|last4=Sjödin|first4=Per|last5=Coutinho|first5=Alexandra|last6=Edlund|first6=Hanna|last7=Munters|first7=Arielle R.|last8=Vicente|first8=Mário|last9=Steyn|first9=Maryna|date=2017-11-03|title=Southern African ancient genomes estimate modern human divergence to 350,000 to 260,000 years ago|journal=Science|language=en|volume=358|issue=6363|pages=652–655|doi=10.1126/science.aao6266|issn=0036-8075|pmid=28971970|bibcode=2017Sci...358..652S|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racially-motivated attacks on Somali Bantus have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiodalsan.com/sawirro-nin-muqdisho-lagu-dilay-kadibna-la-gubay/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921060220/https://www.radiodalsan.com/sawirro-nin-muqdisho-lagu-dilay-kadibna-la-gubay/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-09-21|title=Dalsan Warar Sugan|website=www.radiodalsan.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caasimada.net/muqdisho-nin-kasoo-jeeda-qabiil-laga-awood-badan-yahay-oo-loo-dilay-loona-gubay-gabar-uu-guursaday/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921060057/https://www.caasimada.net/muqdisho-nin-kasoo-jeeda-qabiil-laga-awood-badan-yahay-oo-loo-dilay-loona-gubay-gabar-uu-guursaday/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-09-21|title=Caasimada|website=www.caasimada.net|date=2018-09-21|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism is still prevalent in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ecco/stichproben/Nr6_Interview_Moleah.pdf|title=Interview with Prof. Alfred Tokollo Moleah, South African Ambassador to Vienna |last=Englert|first=Birgit|publisher=Universität Wien|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] might have removed the legal framework allowing [[institutionalised racism]], however, racism in South Africa both predates and encompasses more than just the institutionalised racism of apartheid.

===Colonialism===
The establishment of the [[Dutch East India Company]] settlement at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1652 brought with it the established slave labor practices of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iziko.org.za/sh/resources/slavery/slavery_world.html|title=Slavery at the Cape|publisher=Iziko Museums of Cape Town|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these slaves were imported from the company's more established settlements in India and the East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/solidarity/indiasa3.html|title=Indian Slaves in South Africa|publisher=[[African National Congress]]|accessdate=2008-11-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080622023927/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/solidarity/indiasa3.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery in South Africa was officially [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in 1833 with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/huk-1833act.htm|title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833|date=1833-10-29|publisher=Houses of Parliament, Palace of Westminster, London.|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of racism and discriminatory practices during the colonial period, such as the allocation of rations during the [[Siege of Ladysmith]]

===Apartheid racism===
{{See also|South Africa under apartheid}}
Apartheid (Afrikaans pronunciation: {{IPA-af|aˈpartɦɛit|}}; an Afrikaans word meaning "separateness", or "the state of being apart", literally "apart-hood") was a system of racial segregation in South Africa enforced through legislation by the National Party (NP), the governing party from 1948 to 1994. Under apartheid, the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. Apartheid was developed after World War II by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated National Party and Broederbond organizations. The ideology was also enforced in South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate (revoked in 1966 via United Nations Resolution 2145), until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990. By extension, the term is currently used for forms of systematic segregation established by the state authority in a country against the social and civil rights of a certain group of citizens due to ethnic prejudices.

=== Post-Apartheid racism ===

{{Main|Racism in South Africa#Post-Apartheid racism|l1=Post-Apartheid racism}}

While institutional racism still exists against black South Africans in the private sector, racism against white South Africans is on the rise{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}). Some speculate this is due to black South Africans feeling that not enough has been done to address the inequalities that were a direct result of Apartheid.

Foreign nationals from other African countries are increasingly subjected to violent xenophobic and racist attacks by black South Africans.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/15/south-africa-attacks-foreign-nationals&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Sudan insists that the whole matter is no more than the traditional tribal [[feud]]ing over resources.&lt;ref&gt;Jok Madut Jok (2001), p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government's [[Sudan Peace Act]] of October 21, 2002 accused Sudan of genocide in an [[Second Sudanese Civil War|ongoing civil war]] which has cost more than 2,000,000 lives and has displaced more than 4,000,000 people since the war started in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2002/14531.htm U.S. Department of State: Sudan Peace Act] October 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], people were taken into slavery; estimates of abductions range from 14,000 to 200,000. Abduction of [[Dinka people|Dinka]] women and children was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery, Abduction and Forced Servitude in Sudan|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/af/rls/rpt/2002/10445.htm|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=20 March 2014|date=22 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, it became publicly known that there was an [[Darfur conflict|organised campaign]] by Janjaweed militias (nomadic Arab shepherds with the support of Sudanese government troops) to get rid of 80 black African groups from the [[Darfur]] region of western Sudan. These peoples include the Fur, Zaghawa and Massalit.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Clayton ''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1107849_2,00.html Desert hides world's worst humanitarian crisis]'' in [[The Times]] May 13, 2004, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Andersson''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1358234_1,00.html Genocide lays waste Darfur’s land of no men]'' in [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]] November 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunisia==

The accession of the Almohade dynasty to the throne of the [[Maghreb]] provinces in 1146 proved disastrous to the [[Jews]] of [[Tunis]]. Jews as well as [[Christians]] were compelled either to embrace [[Islam]] or to leave the country. [[Abd al-Mu'min]]'s successors pursued the same course, and their severe measures resulted either in emigration or in forcible conversions. Soon becoming suspicious of the sincerity of the new converts, the Almohades compelled them to wear a special garb, with a yellow cloth for a head-covering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/045/8.html|title=THE HISTORY OF THE JEWS OF TUNISIA|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistranslations of Arab scholars and geographers from this time period have led many to attribute certain racist attitudes that were not prevalent until the 18th and 19th century to writings made centuries ago.&lt;ref&gt;Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldun Orientalist, by Abdelmajid Hannoum  © 2003 Wesleyan University. {{JSTOR|3590803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although bias against those of very black complexion existed in the Arab world in the 15th century, it did not carry as much stigma as it later would. Older translations of [[Ibn Khaldun]], for example in [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_6swTAAAAYAAJ/page/n68 &lt;!-- pg=61 --&gt; The Negro land of the Arabs Examined and Explained] which was written in 1841 gives excerpts of older translations that were not part of later colonial propaganda and show black Africans in a generally positive light.

:'' When the conquest of the West (by the Arabs) was completed, and merchants began to penetrate into the interior, they saw no nation of the Blacks so mighty as Ghanah, the dominions of which extended westward as far as the Ocean. The King's court was kept in the city of Ghanah, which, according to the author of the Book of Roger (El Idrisi), and the author of the Book of Roads and Realms (El Bekri), is divided into two parts, standing on both banks of the Nile, and ranks among the largest and most populous cities of the world. The people of Ghanah had for neighbours, on the east, a nation, which, according to historians, was called Susu; after which came another named Mali; and after that another known by the name of Kaukau; although some people prefer a different orthography, and write this name Kagho. The last-named nation was followed by a people called Tekrur. The people of Ghanah declined in course of time, being overwhelmed or absorbed by the Molaththemun (or muffled people;that is, the Morabites), who, adjoining them on the north towards the Berber country, attacked them, and, taking possession of their territory, compelled them to embrace the Mohammedan religion. The people of Ghanah, being invaded at a later period by the Susu, a nation of Blacks in their neighbourhood, were exterminated, or mixed with other Black nations.

Ibn Khaldun suggests a link between the decline of Ghana and rise of the Almoravids. However, there is little evidence of there actually being an Almoravid conquest of Ghana [&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~amcdouga/Hist446/readings/conquest_in_west_african_historiography.pdf Not Quite Venus from the Waves: The Almoravid Conquest of Ghana in the Modern Historiography of Western Africa by Pekka Masonen; Humphrey J.

==Uganda==
Former British colonies in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] have many citizens of [[South Asian]] descent. They were brought by the [[British Empire]] from [[British India]] to do clerical work in imperial service.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"&gt;General Amin and the Indian Exodus from Uganda
Hasu H. Patel, ''Issue: A Journal of Opinion'', Vol. 2, No. 4 (Winter, 1972), pp. 12-22 {{doi|10.2307/1166488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent case of anti-Indian racism was the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Indian (called Asian) minority in [[Uganda]] by strongman [[dictator]] and [[human rights]] violator [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;

The 1968 Committee on "Africanization in Commerce and Industry" in Uganda made far-reaching Indophobic proposals. A system of work permits and trade licenses
was introduced in 1969 in order to restrict the role of Indians in economic and professional activities. Indians were segregated and discriminated against in all walks of life. After Amin came to power, he exploited these divisions to spread propaganda against Indians, [[stereotyping]] and [[scapegoating]] the Indian minority. Indians were stereotyped as "only traders" and so "inbred" to their profession. Indians were attacked as "dukawallas" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time).&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;

In the 1970s Uganda and other East African nations{{which|date=June 2016}} implemented racist policies that targeted the Asian population of the region. Uganda under Idi Amin's leadership was particularly virulent in its anti-Asian policies. In August 1972, Idi Amin declared what he called an "economic war", a set of policies that included the expropriation of properties owned by Asians and Europeans. Uganda's 80,000 Asians were mostly Indians born in the country, whose ancestors had come to Uganda when the country was still a British colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugandamission.net/aboutug/articles/amin.html|title=Idi Amin|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/7/newsid_2492000/2492333.stm | work=BBC News | title=1972: Asians given 90 days to leave Uganda | date=1972-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indians were stereotyped as "greedy" and "conniving", without any racial identity or loyalty but "always cheating, conspiring and plotting" to subvert Uganda. Amin used this propaganda to justify a campaign of "de-Indianization", eventually resulting in the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Uganda's Indian minority.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;
India refused to accept the expelled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/uk-indians-taking-care-of-business/2006/03/07/1141701511987.html|title=UK Indians taking care of business|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015|date=2006-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the expelled Indians settled in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/england/suffolk/article_1.shtml|title=BBC - Legacies - Immigration and Emigration - England - Suffolk - Uganda's loss, Britain's gain - Article Page 1|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forced expulsion of Uganda's entire Asian population attests to the persecution of Asian peoples residing in the country at the time.{{According to whom|date=June 2020}}

==Zimbabwe==
{{Main|Racism in Zimbabwe}}
In the 19th century, the [[Southern Rhodesia|British colonized]] Zimbabwe and imposed racist economic and social organzation within their territory. White colonists held full citizenship rights, as well as other significant economic and legal advantages over indigenous African people. Racial division would continue under [[Rhodesia]]n governance, sparking an armed struggle to overthrow white rule led by the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZAPU) and the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU). This conflict culminated in the establishment of the modern state of [[Zimbabwe]]. The coalition of African forces was fragile, and the government led by [[Robert Mugabe]] and the majority-[[Shona people|Shona]] ZANU committed massacres against [[Northern Ndebele people]] in ZAPU strongholds, producing resentment between the African ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mlambo|first=Alois S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yr8dAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=A+history+of+Zimbabwe&amp;pg=PR10|title=A History of Zimbabwe|date=2014-04-07|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-86752-8|location=|pages=222–224, 254–256|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of armed conflict, the white minority in Zimbabwe continued to exert disproportionate control over the economy, owned the majority of arable land in Zimbabwe, and maintained racially segregated social circles. White settlers were protected by generous provisions established by the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], and thus continued to exert significant political and legal control over the African population. Wide disparities existed in access to sports, education and housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Masocha|first1=Vincent|last2=Mugari|first2=Abisha|date=2015-11-30|title=Sport and Racial Inequality: An Analysis of Pre-Independence Zimbabwe (1890-1979)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285236038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ZANU-led government did not engage in significant expropriation of white settlers despite promising land reform to the African population, with one white commercial farmer commenting that Mugabe's government in the early 1980s was "the best government for farmers that this country has ever seen". Dissatisfaction with the slow pace of land reform led to the illegal seizing of white-owned land by African peasants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The government responded with heavy-handed repression against the African peasants.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mlambo|first=Alois S.|date=2012-11-26|title=Becoming Zimbabwe or becoming Zimbabwean : identity, nationalism and state building in the historical context of Southern Africa.|hdl=2263/20491|url=https://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/20491|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resentment of continued white control of the economy continued through the 1990s, spurred by the perception that the white business community was disinterested in improving the economic lot of the African population or otherwise changing the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cheater|first=Angela|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKOEAgAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22racism+in+zimbabwe%22&amp;pg=PA117|title=The Anthropology of Power|date=2003-12-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-65048-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000, as the [[ZANU–PF|ZANU-PF]] government grew political isolated, it increasingly criticized the white population's segregationism and racism,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and began to encourage violent farm invasions against the white population, which drew condemnations from the international community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zimbabwe today continues to be fractured by enmity along racial lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abednico|first=Siambombe|date=2017-06-01|title=A wrong without design : assessing racism and white color crime in Zimbabwe|url=https://journals.co.za/content/journal/10520/EJC-9d895db50|journal=AFFRIKA Journal of Politics, Economics and Society|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=127–134|doi=10.31920/2075-6534/2017/v7n1a7|issn=1998-4936}}&lt;/ref&gt;
