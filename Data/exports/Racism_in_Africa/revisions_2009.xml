==Botswana==
Since the mid-1990s the central government of [[Botswana]] has been trying to move [[Bushmen]] out of the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] even though the national constitution guarantees the Bushmen the right to live there in perpetuity. As of October 2005, the government has resumed its policy of forcing all Bushmen off their lands in the Game Reserve, using armed police and threats of violence or death.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/10/29/wbot29.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2005/10/29/ixworld.html

==Ivory Coast==
In the past recent years the Ivory Coast has seen a resurgence in ethnic tribal hatred and religious intolerance.  In addition to the many victims among the various tribes of the northern and southern regions of the country that have perished in the ongoing conflict, foreigners residing or visiting the Ivory Coast have also been subjected to violent attacks. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the Ivory Coast government is guilty of fanning ethnic hatred for its own political ends.&lt;ref&gt;
[news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/Africa/1932930.stm Ivory Coast "fanning ethnic hatred"]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2004, the [[Congrès Panafricaine des Jeunes Patriotes|Young Patriots]] of Abidjan, strongly [[nationalist]] organisation, rallied by the State media, plundered possessions of foreign nationals in [[Abidjan]]. Calls for violence against whites and non-Ivorians were broadcast on national radio and TV after the Young Patriots seized control of its offices. Rapes, beatings, and murders of white expatriates and local [[Arab diaspora|Lebanese]] followed. Thousands of expatriates and Lebanese fled. The attacks drew international condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/11/19/wapp19.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/11/19/ixnewstop.html The night westerners were hunted for being white - Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200411/s1242699.htm Europeans flee Ivory Coast violence. 13/11/2004.

Ethnic tensions in Madagascar often produce violent conflict between the highlanders and coastal peoples. The Merina people in particular are often the targets of violence especially during political campaigns to elect a new president.&lt;ref&gt;

==Mauritania==
{{Further|[[Slavery in modern Africa]]}}
[[Slavery in Mauritania]] persists despite its abolition in 1980 and affects the descendants of black Africans abducted into [[slavery]] before generations, who live now in [[Mauritania]] as "black [[Moors]]" or ''[[haratin]]'' and who partially still serve the "white Moors", or ''bidhan'', as slaves. The practice of slavery in Mauritania is most dominant within the traditional upper class of the Moors. For centuries, the so-called Haratin lower class, mostly poor black Africans living in rural areas, have been considered natural slaves by these Moors. Social attitudes have changed among most urban Moors, but in rural areas, the ancient divide is still very alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L18334379.htm Reuters AlertNet - Slavery still exists in Mauritania]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ruling bidanes (the name means literally white-skinned people) are descendants of the [[Sanhaja]] [[Berbers]] and [[Beni Hassan]] Arab tribes who emigrated  to northwest [[Africa]] and present-day [[Western Sahara]] and [[Mauritania]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. Many descendants of the Beni Hassan tribes today still adhere to the [[supremacist]] ideology of their ancestors. This ideology has led to oppression, discrimination and even enslavement of other groups in the Mauritania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522 Fair elections haunted by racial imbalance]&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to some estimates, as many to 600,000 black Mauritanians, or 20% of the population, are still enslaved, many of them used as [[bonded labour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1458_abolition/page4.shtml The Abolition season on BBC World Service]&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery in Mauritania was finally criminalized in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6938032.stm Mauritanian MPs pass slavery law]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Morocco==
[[History of the Jews under Muslim rule|Jews]] and [[Christians]] were expelled from [[Morocco]] and [[Islamic Spain]] during the reign of [[Berber people|Berber]] dynasty of [[Almohads]] in the 12th century. Almohads gave a choice of either death or conversion to [[Islam]], or exile.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Some, such the family of [[Maimonides]], fled east to more tolerant [[Islam by country|Muslim lands]], while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 The Forgotten Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/IntergroupTO/JewishMuslim/Almohads.htm The Almohads]&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish population were confined to [[mellah]]s in [[Morocco]] beginning from the 15th century. In cities, a ''mellah'' was surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway. In contrast, rural ''mellahs'' were separate villages inhabited solely by the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/017/morocco.html The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G. Bennett]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Niger==
In October 2006, [[Niger]] announced that it would deport to Chad the so called ''[[Diffa Arabs]]'': [[Arabs]] living in the Diffa region of eastern Niger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6087048.stm BBC NEWS | Africa |Niger starts mass Arab expulsions]&lt;/ref&gt; This population numbered about 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25138454.htm Reuters AlertNet - Niger's Arabs say expulsions will fuel race hate]&lt;/ref&gt; While the government was rounding Arabs in preparation for the deportation, two girls died, reportedly after fleeing government forces, and three women suffered miscarriages. Niger's government had eventually suspended a controversial decision to deport Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6081416.stm BBC NEWS | Africa |Niger's Arabs to fight expulsion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?docid=469638881e UNHCR |Refworld - The Leader in Refugee Decision Support]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Niger, where the practice of [[slavery]] was outlawed in 2003, a study has found that more than 800,000 people are still slaves, almost 8% of the population.&lt;ref name="The Shackles of Slavery in Niger"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/Story?id=813618&amp;page=1 The Shackles of Slavery in Niger]&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4250709.stm Born to be a slave in Niger] By Hilary Andersson, BBC Africa Correspondent, Niger&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery dates back for centuries in Niger and was finally criminalised in 2003, after five years of lobbying by [[Anti-Slavery International]] and Nigerian human-rights group, Timidria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0310/p07s01-woaf.html On the way to freedom, Niger's slaves stuck in limbo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Descent-based slavery, where generations of the same family are born into [[debt bondage|bondage]], is traditionally practiced by at least four of Niger’s eight ethnic groups. The slave masters are mostly from the lighter-skinned [[nomadic]] tribes — the [[Tuareg]], [[Fulani]], [[Toubou]] and [[Arabs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2005/september/bondage.php?page=3 Born into Bondage]&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially rife among the warlike [[Tuareg]], in the wild deserts of north and west Niger, who roam near the borders with Mali and Algeria. In the region of Say on the right bank of the river Niger, it is estimated that three-quarters of the population around 1904-1905 was composed of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/PDF/Full%20English%20Slavery%20in%20Niger.pdf Slavery in Niger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the Tuareg swelled the ranks of their black slaves during war raids into other peoples’ lands. War was then the main source of supply of slaves, although many were bought at slave markets, run mostly by indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="The Shackles of Slavery in Niger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=53497 NIGER: Slavery - an unbroken chain]&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism is still a fact of life in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/ecco/stichproben/Nr6_Interview_Moleah.pdf|format=PDF|title=Interview with Prof. Alfred Tokollo Moleah, South African Ambassador to Vienna |last=Englert|first=Birgit|publisher=Universität Wien|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]] might have removed the legal framework allowing [[institutionalised racism]], but racism in [[South Africa]] both predates and encompasses more than just the institutionalised racism of apartheid.

===Colonial racism===
The establishment of the [[Dutch East India Company]] settlement at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1652 brought with it the established slave labor practices of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iziko.org.za/sh/resources/slavery/slavery_world.html|title=Slavery at the Cape|publisher=Iziko Museums of Cape Town|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these slaves were imported from the companies more established settlement in India and the East Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/solidarity/indiasa3.html|title=Indian Slaves in South Africa|publisher=[[African National Congress]]|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Slavery was by no mean just restricted to the European slave trade. During the [[Difaqane]] the [[Zulu]] under [[Shaka]] overrun many smaller times and enslaved them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isic.org/sisp/index.htm?fx=destination&amp;loc_id=131114&amp;section=culture|title=Destinations: South Africa - Pre 20th Century History|publisher=International Student Travel Conveduration|accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery in [[South Africa]] was officially [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in 1833 with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/huk-1833act.htm|title=Slavery Abolition Act 1833|date=1833-10-29|publisher=Houses of Parliament, Palace of Westminster, London.|accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of racism and discriminatory practices during the colonial period, such as the allocation of rations during the [[Siege of Ladysmith]]
{{quote|For Whites—Biscuit, 1/4 lb.; Maize meal, 3 oz.&lt;br&gt;
For Indians and Kaffirs—Maize meal, 8 oz.&lt;br&gt;
Europeans—Fresh meat, 1 lb.&lt;br&gt;
Kaffirs—Fresh meat, 1-1/4 lbs. (Chiefly horseflesh.)&lt;br&gt;
For White men—Coffee or tea, 1/12 oz.; pepper, 1/64 oz.; salt, 1/3 oz.; sugar, 1 oz.; mustard, 1/20 oz.; Vinegar, 1/12 gill.&lt;br&gt;
For Indians—a little rice.| H. W. Nevinson &lt;ref&gt;{{gutenberg|no=16603|name=Ladysmith, The Diary of a Siege by Henry W. Nevinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]] who worked to eradicate racism and in particular racism that affected the Indian communities in South Africa, was not immune to racism during this period. In one of his [[Gandhi#Early South African articles|early articles]] for the ''[[Indian Opinion]]'' he writes: 
{{quote|Kaffirs are as a rule uncivilised - the convicts even more so. They are troublesome, very dirty and live almost like animals.| Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|volume=8|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The United States government's [[Sudan Peace Act]] of October 21, 2002 accused [[Sudan]] of genocide in an [[Second Sudanese Civil War|ongoing civil war]] which has cost more than 2,000,000 lives and has displaced more than 4,000,000 people since the war started in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2002/14531.htm U.S. Department of State: Sudan Peace Act] October 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that as many as 200,000 people had been taken into slavery during the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] (1983-2005).

In 2004, it became widely known that there was an [[Darfur conflict|organised campaign]] by Janjaweed militias (nomadic [[Arab]] shepherds with the support of Sudanese government troops) to get rid of 80 black African groups from the [[Darfur]] region of western Sudan. These peoples include the Fur, Zaghawa and Massalit.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Clayton ''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1107849_2,00.html Desert hides world's worst humanitarian crisis]'' in [[The Times]] May 13, 2004, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Andersson''[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1358234_1,00.html Genocide lays waste Darfur’s land of no men]'' in [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]] November 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 16th century, the bulk of slaves exported from Africa were shipped from [[East Africa]] to the [[Arabian peninsula]]. [[Zanzibar]] became a leading port on this trade. Arab slave traders differed from European ones in that they would often conduct raiding expeditions themselves, sometimes penetrating deep into the continent. They also differed in that their market greatly preferred the purchase of female slaves over male ones. Zanzibar was once East Africa's main slave-trading port, and under Omani Arabs in the 19th century as many as 50,000 slaves were passing through the city each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/data/2001/10/01/html/ft_20011001.6.html Swahili Coast]&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[David Livingstone]] wrote of the slave trade: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''To overdraw its evils is a simple impossibility.... We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed through the body and lying on the path. [Onlookers] said an Arab who passed early that morning had done it in anger at losing the price he had given for her, because she was unable to walk any longer. We passed a woman tied by the neck to a tree and dead.... We came upon a man dead from starvation.... The strangest disease I have seen in this country seems really to be broken heartedness, and it attacks free men who have been captured and made slaves.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Livingstone estimated that 80,000 Africans died each year before ever reaching the slave markets of [[Zanzibar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6510675.stm Remembering East African slave raids], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chi.gospelcom.net/GLIMPSEF/Glimpses/glmps111.shtml David Livingstone; Christian History Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilotguides.com/destination_guide/africa/tanzania_and_zanzibar/slave_trade.php The blood of a nation of Slaves in Stone Town]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.geocities.com/goldenmaggot.t21@btinternet.com/zanzibar.html Zanzibar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tunisia==
The accession of the Almohade dynasty to the throne of the [[Maghreb]] provinces in 1146 proved very disastrous to the [[Jews]] of [[Tunis]]. Jews as well as [[Christians]] were compelled either to embrace [[Islam]] or to leave the country. [[Abd al-Mu'min]]'s successors pursued the same course, and their severe measures resulted either in emigration or in forcible conversions. Soon becoming suspicious of the sincerity of the new converts, the Almohades compelled them to wear a special garb, with a yellow cloth for a head-covering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/045/8.html The History of The Jews of Tunisia]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mistranslations of Arab scholars and geographers from this time period have lead many to attribute certain racist attitudes that weren't prevalent until the 18th and 19th century to writings made centuries ago.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/pss/3590803 Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldun Orientalist, by Abdelmajid Hannoum  © 2003 Wesleyan University.&lt;/ref&gt; Although bias against those of very black complexion existed in the Arab world in the 15th century it didn't have as much stigma as it later would.

:'' When the conquest of the West (by the Arabs) was completed, and merchants began to penetrate into the interior, they saw no nation of the Blacks so mighty as Ghanah, the dominions of which extended westward as far as the Ocean. The King's court was kept in the city of Ghanah, which, according to the author of the Book of Roger (El Idrisi), and the author of the Book of Roads and Realms (El Bekri), is divided into two parts, standing on both banks of the Nile, and ranks among the largest and most populous cities of the world. The people of Ghanah had for neighbours, on the east, a nation, which, according to historians, was called Susu; after which came another named Mali; and after that another known by the name of Kaukau ; although some people prefer a different orthography, and write this name Kagho. The last-named nation was followed by a people called Tekrur. The people of Ghanah declined in course of time, being overwhelmed or absorbed by the Molaththemun (or muffled people;that is, the Morabites), who, adjoining them on the north towards the Berber country, attacked them, and, taking possession of their territory, compelled them to embrace the Mohammedan religion. The people of Ghanah, being invaded at a later period by the Susu, a nation of Blacks in their neighbourhood, were exterminated, or mixed with other Black nations.

The 1968 Committee on "Africanization in Commerce and Industry" in Uganda made far-reaching Indophobic proposals. A system of work permits and trade licenses
was introduced in 1969 in order to restrict the role of Indians in economic and professional activities. Indians were segregated and discriminated against in all walks of life. After Amin came to power, he exploited these divisions to spread propaganda against Indians involving [[stereotyping]] and [[scapegoating]] the Indian minority. Indians were stereotyped as "only traders" and so "inbred" to their profession. Indians were attacked as "dukawallas" (an occupational term that degenerated into an anti-Indian slur during Amin's time).&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;.

In the 1970s [[Uganda]] and other East African nations implemented racist policies that targeted the Asian population of the region. Uganda under [[Idi Amin]]'s leadership was particularly most virulent in its anti-Asian policies. In August 1972, Idi Amin declared what he called an "economic war", a set of policies that included the expropriation of properties owned by Asians and Europeans. Uganda's 80,000 Asians were mostly [[India]]ns born in the country, whose ancestors had come to Uganda when the country was still a British colony.

Amin used this propaganda to justify a campaign of "de-Indianization", eventually resulting in the expulsion and [[ethnic cleansing]] of Uganda's Indian minority.&lt;ref name="Amin-Indophobia"/&gt;.

[[India]] had refused to accept them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/uk-indians-taking-care-of-business/2006/03/07/1141701511987.html UK Indians taking care of business]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the expelled Indians settled in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/england/suffolk/article_1.shtml Uganda's loss, Britain's gain]&lt;/ref&gt; The forced expulsion of Uganda's entire Asian population attests to the persecution of Asian peoples residing in the country at the time. Today, Asian/Indian residents of Uganda continue to face marginalization being given an inferior status.
