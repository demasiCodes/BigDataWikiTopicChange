Though people may use other labels, or none at all,&lt;ref name="AmPsycholAssn-whatis" /&gt; sexual orientation is usually discussed in terms of three categories, [[heterosexuality]], [[homosexual orientation|homosexuality]], and [[bisexuality]]; and [[asexuality]] is increasingly recognized as a fourth. The first three exist along a [[heterosexual-homosexual continuum|continuum]] that ranges from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual, including various forms of bisexuality in between. This continuum does not suit everyone, however, as some people identify as asexual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asexuality.org/home/ Asexuality Visibility and Education Network (AVEN)]&lt;/ref&gt; This linear scale is a simplification of the much more nuanced nature of sexual orientation and sexual identity; many sexologists believe it to be oversimplified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/sexual-orientation-gender-4329.htm Planned Parent Hood: Sexual Orientation &amp; Gender, LGBTQ ...

Classifying sexual desires or people on the basis of sexual orientation is a modern Western concept. Doubts have been raised about the validity of this concept in [[Human male sexuality|non-Western and indigenous societies]], as well as in the pre-modern West.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

== Sexual orientation distinguished from sexual identity and behavior ==

{{See also|Sexual identity|Sexual behaviour}}
{{See also|Situational sexual behavior}}

Most definitions of sexual orientation include a psychological component, such as the direction of an individual's erotic desire, and/or a behavioral component, which focuses on the sex of the individual's sexual partner/s. Some people prefer simply to follow an individual's self-definition or [[Identity (social science)|identity]].

The [[American Psychological Association]] states that "[s]exual orientation is an enduring emotional, romantic, sexual, or affectional attraction toward others. It is easily distinguished from other components of sexuality including biological sex, gender identity (the psychological sense of being male or female), and the social gender role (adherence to cultural norms for feminine and masculine behavior).  Sexual orientation exists along a continuum that ranges from exclusive heterosexuality to exclusive homosexuality and includes various forms of bisexuality. Bisexual persons can experience sexual, emotional, and affectional attraction to both their own sex and the opposite sex. Persons with a homosexual orientation are sometimes referred to as gay (both men and women) or as lesbian (women only).  Sexual orientation is different from sexual behavior because it refers to feelings and self-concept. Individuals may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual orientation identity|Sexual identity]] and [[sexual behavior]] are closely related to sexual orientation, but they are distinguished, with identity referring to an individual's conception of themselves, behavior referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual, and orientation referring to "fantasies, attachments and longings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reiter L |title=Sexual orientation, sexual identity, and the question of choice |journal=Clinical Social Work Journal |volume=17 |pages=138–50 |year=1989}}[http://www.springerlink.com/content/g248324552457105/]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviors.&lt;ref name="apahelp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |title=Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality |periodical=[[American Psychological Association|APA]]HelpCenter.org |accessdate=2007-09-07 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have a homosexual sexual orientation that does not align with their sexual identity are sometimes referred to as '[[closeted]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imfromdriftwood.com/2010/04/07/im-from-new-york-ny-5/]&lt;/ref&gt; The term may, however, reflect a certain cultural context and particular stage of transition in societies which are gradually dealing with integrating sexual minorities. In studies related to sexual orientation, when dealing with the degree to which a person's [[sexual attraction]]s, behaviors and identity match, scientists usually use the terms ''concordance'' or ''discordance''.&lt;ref name="Concordance/discordance in SO"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a woman who is attracted to other women, but calls herself heterosexual and only has sexual relations with men, can be said to experience discordance between her sexual orientation (homosexual or lesbian) and her sexual identity and behaviors (heterosexual).

''Sexual identity'' may also be used to describe a person's perception of his or her own ''sex'', rather than sexual orientation.

The term ''sexual preference'' has a similar meaning to ''sexual orientation'', but it may be interpreted as endorsing the notion that sexual orientation is, in whole or part, a matter of choice.

=== Sexualities included ===

Sexual orientation traditionally was defined as including [[heterosexuality]], [[bisexuality]], and [[homosexual orientation|homosexuality]]. [[Asexuality]] is now considered a sexual orientation by some researchers and has been defined as the absence of a traditional sexual orientation; an asexual has little or no sexual attraction to males or females.&lt;ref&gt;Bogaert, Anthony F. (2004). [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2372/is_3_41/ai_n6274004 ''Asexuality: Prevalence and Associated Factors In a National Probability Sample'']. ''Journal of Sex Research'' '''41''' (3): 281. Retrieved on 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender, transgender, cisgender, and conformance ===

The earliest writers on sexual orientation usually understood it to be intrinsically linked to the subject's own sex. For example, it was thought that a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minton HL |title=Femininity in men and masculinity in women: American psychiatry and psychology portray homosexuality in the 1930s |journal=[[Journal of Homosexuality]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–21 |year=1986}}&lt;br&gt;Terry, J. (1999). ''An American obsession: Science, medicine, and homosexuality in modern society.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century, such as [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]], [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]], [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], [[Havelock Ellis]], [[Carl Jung]], and [[Sigmund Freud]], as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves. However, this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time, and, through the second half of the twentieth century, [[gender identity]] came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation. [[Transgender]] and [[cisgender]] people may be attracted to men, women, or both, although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations (see [[sexual orientation of transwomen]]). An individual homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine, feminine, or [[Androgyny|androgynous]], and in addition, many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the "gender-conforming heterosexual" and the "gender-nonconforming homosexual" as negative [[stereotype]]s. However, studies by [[J. Michael Bailey]] and KJ Zucker have found that a majority of gay men and lesbians report being gender-nonconforming during their childhood years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[J. Michael Bailey|Bailey JM]], Zucker KJ |title=Childhood sex-typed behavior and sexual orientation: a conceptual analysis and quantitative review |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=43 |year=1995 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.1.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of transgender people today identify with the sexual orientation that corresponds with their gender; meaning that a [[transwoman]] who is solely attracted to women would often identify as a lesbian. Female-attracted [[Trans man|transmen]] often consider themselves straight men, yet some participate in the lesbian community.

For these reasons, the terms [[gynephilia and androphilia]] are occasionally (but increasingly) used when referring to the sexual orientation of [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] people (and, occasionally, cisgender people), because rather than focusing on the sex of the subject, they only describe that of the object of their attraction. The third common term that describes sexual orientation, [[bisexuality]], makes no claim about the subject's sex or gender identity. (See also [[pansexuality]].)

Sexual orientation sees greater intricacy when non-binary understandings of both sex (male, female, or [[intersex]]) and gender (man, woman, [[transgender]], [[third gender]], or [[Gender variance|gender variant]]) are considered. Sociologist [[Paula Rodriguez Rust]] (2000) argues for a more multifaceted definition of sexual orientation:

{{quotation|...Most alternative models of sexuality... define sexual orientation in terms of dichotomous biological sex or gender... Most theorists would not eliminate the reference to sex or gender, but instead advocate incorporating more complex nonbinary concepts of sex or gender, more complex relationships between sex, gender, and sexuality, and/or additional nongendered dimensions into models of sexuality.|&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez Rust, Paula C.

=== Relationships outside of orientation ===

Gay and lesbian people can have sexual relationships with someone of the opposite sex for a variety of reasons including the desire for family with children and concerns of discrimination and religious [[ostracism]].&lt;ref name="Brokeback"&gt;{{cite news

=== Born bisexual, then monosexualizing ===

{{Main|Innate bisexuality}}

[[Innate bisexuality]], or predisposition to bisexuality, is an idea introduced by [[Sigmund Freud]], based on work by his associate [[Wilhelm Fliess]]. According to this theory, all humans are born bisexual but through psychological development, which includes both external and internal factors, become monosexual while the bisexuality remains in a latent state.

=== Efforts to change sexuality ===

{{Main|Sexual orientation change efforts}}

No major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation. These include the American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, American Counseling Association, National Association of Social Workers in the USA,&lt;ref name="Calif-amici" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2009-11-17-doma-aff-herek.pdf Expert affidavit of Gregory M. Herek, Ph.D.]&lt;/ref&gt; the Royal College of Psychiatrists,&lt;ref name="royal2009" /&gt; and the Australian Psychological Society.&lt;ref name="aps"&gt;[http://www.psychology.org.au/publications/tip_sheets/orientation/ Australian Psychological Society: Sexual orientation and homosexuality].&lt;/ref&gt; There is no sound scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed.&lt;ref name="royal2009"&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/press/pressreleasearchives/2009/statement.aspx Statement from the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Gay and Lesbian Mental Health Special Interest Group].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apaexgay"&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/policy/ex-gay.pdf Statement of the American Psychological Association].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the American Psychological Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed journal literature on sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE) and concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Efforts to change sexual orientation are unlikely to be successful and involve some risk of harm, contrary to the claims of SOCE practitioners and advocates. Even though the research and clinical literature demonstrate that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality, regardless of sexual orientation identity, the task force concluded that the population that undergoes SOCE tends to have strongly conservative religious views that lead them to seek to change their sexual orientation. Thus, the appropriate application of affirmative therapeutic interventions for those who seek SOCE involves therapist acceptance, support, and understanding of clients and the facilitation of clients' active coping, social support, and identity exploration and development, without imposing a specific sexual orientation identity outcome.&lt;ref name="APATaskForce-Therapeutic"&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The American Psychological Association and the Royal College of Psychiatrists expressed concerns that the positions espoused by [[National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality|NARTH]] are not supported by the science and create an environment in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish.&lt;ref name="royal2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apaexgay"/&gt;

== Measuring sexual orientation ==

Varying definitions and strong [[sexual norm|social norms about sexuality]] can make sexual orientation difficult to quantify.

=== Scales for assessments ===

From at least the late nineteenth century in Europe, there was speculation that the range of human sexual response looked more like a continuum than two or three discrete categories. Berlin sexologist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] published a scheme in 1896 that measured the strength of an individual's sexual desire on two independent 10-point scales, A (homosexual) and B (heterosexual).&lt;ref&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1896. ''Sappho und Socrates, Wie erklärt sich die Liebe der Männer &amp; und Frauen zu Personen des eigenen Geschlechts?'' (Sappho and Socrates, How Can One Explain the Love of Men and Women for Individuals of Their Own Sex?).&lt;/ref&gt; A heterosexual individual may be A0, B5; a homosexual individual may be A5, B0; an asexual would be A0, B0; and someone with an intense attraction to both sexes would be A9, B9.

Fifty years later, American sexologist [[Alfred Kinsey]] wrote in ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' (1948):

{{quotation|Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats. It is a fundamental of taxonomy that nature rarely deals with discrete categories... The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects.
While emphasizing the continuity of the gradations between exclusively heterosexual and exclusively homosexual histories, it has seemed desirable to develop some sort of classification which could be based on the relative amounts of heterosexual and homosexual experience or response in each history... An individual may be assigned a position on this scale, for each period in his life.... A seven-point scale comes nearer to showing the many gradations that actually exist.|&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Kinsey, W.B. Pomeroy, C.E. Martin, ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,'' pp. 639, 656. (Philadelphia, PA: W.B. Saunders, 1948). ISBN 0-253-33412-8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Kinsey scale]] measures sexual orientation from 0 (exclusively heterosexual) to 6 (exclusively homosexual), with an additional category, X, for those with no sexual attraction to either women or men. Unlike Hirschfeld's scale, the Kinsey scale is one-dimensional. [[Simon LeVay]] wrote, "it suggests (although Kinsey did not actually believe this) that every person has the same fixed endowment of sexual energy, which he or she then divides up between same-sex and opposite-sex attraction in a ratio indicative of his or her own sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon LeVay|LeVay, Simon]], 1996.

Research has identified several biological factors which may be related to the development of sexual orientation, including [[gene]]s, [[Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation|prenatal hormones]], and [[brain]] structure. No single controlling cause has been identified, and research is continuing in this area.&lt;ref name="twin-adol"&gt;This work was published in the ''American Journal of Sociology'' (Bearman, P. S. &amp; Bruckner, H. (2002) Opposite-sex twins and adolescent same-sex attraction. American Journal of Sociology 107, 1179–1205.) and is available only to subscribers. However, a final draft of the paper is available [http://www.iserp.columbia.edu/research/working_papers/downloads/2001_04.pdf here] – there are no significant differences on the points cited between the final draft and the published version.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing view is that sexual orientation is biological in nature, determined by a complex interplay of genetic factors and the early uterine environment. Sexual orientation is therefore not a choice. That is, individuals do not choose to be homosexual or heterosexual. There is no substantive evidence to support the suggestion that early childhood experiences, parenting, sexual abuse, or other adverse life events influence sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="pediatrics2004"&gt;Pediatrics: [http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;113/6/1827 Sexual Orientation and Adolescents], [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Clinical Report.

Scientific studies have found a number of statistical [[Biology and sexual orientation#Biological_differences_in_gay_men_and_lesbians|biological differences between gay people and heterosexuals]], which may result from the same underlying cause as sexual orientation itself.

==== Genetic factors ====

[[Gene]]s may be related to the development of sexual orientation. At one time, [[twin studies|studies of twins]] appeared to point to a major genetic component, but problems in [[experimental design]] of the available studies have made their interpretation difficult, and one recent study appears to exclude genes as a major factor.&lt;ref name="twin-adol"/&gt;

==== Hormones ====

{{Main|Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation}}

The hormonal theory of sexuality holds that, just as exposure to certain [[Biology and sexual orientation|hormones]] plays a role in fetal sex differentiation, such exposure also influences the sexual orientation that emerges later in the adult.

Fetal hormones may be seen as either the primary influence upon adult sexual orientation or as a co-factor interacting with genes and/or environmental and social conditions.&lt;ref name="BornGay-passim"&gt;Wilson, G., &amp; Q. Rahman, ''Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Human Sex Orientation'', ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 endocrinology study by Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab&lt;ref name="shatb"/&gt; says that intrauterine exposure to hormones is largely determinative. Sketching the argument briefly here, it says that sexual organs are differentiated and then the brain is sexually differentiated "under the influence, mainly, of sex hormones such as testosterone, estrogen and progesterone on the developing brain cells and under the presence of different genes as well . . . . The changes brought about in this [p. 24:] stage are permanent. . . . [S]exual differentiation of the brain is not caused by hormones alone, even though they are very important for gender identity and sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F., ''Sexual Hormones and the Brain'', ''op. cit.'', pp. 23–24 (reference omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; ". . . . These fetal and neonatal peaks of testosterone, together with the functional steroid receptor activity, are thought to fix the development of structures and circuits in the brain for the rest of a boy's life (producing 'programming' or 'organizing' effects). Later, the rising hormonal levels that occur during puberty 'activate' circuits and behavioral patterns that were built during development, in a masculinized and de-feminized direction for male brains or in a feminized and de-masculinized direction for female brains."&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F., ''Sexual Hormones and the Brain'', ''op. cit.'', p. 24 (single quotation marks so in original).&lt;/ref&gt; Because organ differentiation and brain differentiation occur at different times, in "rare" cases transsexualism can result (transsexualism resulting from having organs of one gender and feelings of the other).&lt;ref name="Garcia-Falgueras-Swaab-SexualHormonesBrain-p24"&gt;Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F., ''Sexual Hormones and the Brain'', ''op. cit.'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; "The brain structure differences that result from the interaction between hormones, genes and developing brain cells are thought to be the basis of sex differences in a wide spectrum of behaviors, such as . . . sexual orientation (heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality) . . . . Factors that interfere with the interactions between hormones and the developing brain systems during development in the womb may permanently influence later behavior."&lt;ref name="Garcia-Falgueras-Swaab-SexualHormonesBrain-p24" /&gt; "In humans, the main mechanism responsible of [''sic''] sexual identity and orientation involves a direct effect of testosterone on the developing brain."&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F., ''Sexual Hormones and the Brain'', ''op. cit.'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on some transsexualism cases, the authors say, "[f]rom these examples it appears that the direct action of testosterone on the developing brain in boys and the lack of such action on the developing brain in girls are crucial factors in the development of male and female gender identity and sexual orientation . . . ."&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F., ''Sexual Hormones and the Brain'', ''op. cit.'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; "There are no indications that postnatal social factors could be responsible for the occurrence of transsexuality."&lt;ref name="Garcia-Falgueras-Swaab-SexualHormonesBrain-p28"&gt;Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F., ''Sexual Hormones and the Brain'', ''op. cit.'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; "With regard to sexual orientation, the most likely outcome of childhood gender identity disorder is homosexuality or bisexuality."&lt;ref name="Garcia-Falgueras-Swaab-SexualHormonesBrain-p28" /&gt; "The apparent impossibility of getting someone to change their sexual orientation . . . is a major argument against the importance of the social environment in the emergence of homosexuality, as well as against the idea that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice."&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F., ''Sexual Hormones and the Brain'', ''op. cit.'', p. 30 (reference omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; "The presence of a genetic component of over 50% in the development of sexual orientation is apparent from family and twin studies."&lt;ref name="Garcia-Falgueras-Swaab-SexualHormonesBrain-p30"&gt;Garcia-Falgueras, Alicia, &amp; Swaab, Dick F., ''Sexual Hormones and the Brain'', ''op. cit.'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; "Women with gay sons appeared to have an extreme skewing of X-inactivation [referring to the "X-chromosome"] . . . ."&lt;ref name="Garcia-Falgueras-Swaab-SexualHormonesBrain-p30" /&gt; "[S]ome two million pregnant women . . . were prescribed diethylstilbestrol (DES)[,] . . . . an estrogen-like substance[,] . . .

The chance of such an immune response to male factors would increase with every pregnancy resulting in the birth of a son."&lt;ref name="Garcia-Falgueras-Swaab-SexualHormonesBrain-p31" /&gt; "Prenatal exposure to nicotine, amphetamine, or thyroid-gland hormones increases the chances of giving birth to lesbian daughters."&lt;ref name="Garcia-Falgueras-Swaab-SexualHormonesBrain-p31" /&gt; Stress in pregnancy makes birth of a gay son likelier.&lt;ref name="Garcia-Falgueras-Swaab-SexualHormonesBrain-p31" /&gt; "Although it has often been postulated that postnatal development is also important for the direction of sexual orientation, there is no solid proof for this."&lt;ref name="Garcia-Falgueras-Swaab-SexualHormonesBrain-p31" /&gt;

=== Sexual arousal ===

Studying human [[sexual arousal]] has proved a fruitful way of understanding how men and women differ as genders and in terms of sexual orientation. A clinical measurement may use [[penile plethysmograph|penile]] or [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]]y, where genital engorgement with blood is measured in response to exposure to different erotic material.&lt;ref name="BornGay-p21" /&gt;

Some researchers who study sexual orientation argue that the concept may not apply similarly to men and women. A study of [[sexual arousal]] patterns&lt;ref name="Arousal and orientation"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; found that women, when viewing erotic films which show female-female, male-male and male-female sexual activity (oral sex or penetration), have patterns of arousal which do not match their declared sexual orientations as well as men's. That is, heterosexual and lesbian women's sexual arousal to erotic films do not differ significantly by the genders of the participants (male or female) or by the type of sexual activity (heterosexual or homosexual). On the contrary, men's sexual arousal patterns tend to be more in line with their stated orientations, with heterosexual men showing more penis arousal to female-female sexual activity and less arousal to female-male and male-male sexual stimuli, and homosexual men being more aroused by films depicting male-male intercourse and less aroused by other stimuli.

&lt;/ref&gt; that men and women have different patterns of arousal, independent of their sexual orientations. The study found that women's genitals become aroused to both human and nonhuman stimuli from movies showing humans of both genders having sex (heterosexual and homosexual) and from videos showing non-human [[primates]] (bonobos) having sex. Men did not show any sexual arousal to non-human visual stimuli, their arousal patterns being in line with their specific sexual interest (women for heterosexual men and men for homosexual men).

These studies suggest that men and women are different in terms of sexual arousal patterns and that this is also reflected in how their genitals react to sexual stimuli of both genders or even to non-human stimuli. It must be stated that sexual orientation has many dimensions (attractions, [[sexual behaviour|behavior]], [[sexual identity|identity]]), of which sexual arousal is the only product of sexual attractions which can be measured at present with some degree of physical precision. Thus, the fact that women are aroused by seeing non-human primates having sex does not mean that women's sexual orientation includes this type of sexual interest. Some researchers argue that women's sexual orientation depends less on their patterns of sexual arousal than men's and that other components of sexual orientation (like emotional attachment) must be taken into account when describing women's sexual orientations. In contrast, men's sexual orientations tend to be primarily focused on the physical component of attractions and, thus, their sexual feelings are more exclusively oriented according to [[sex]].

More recently, scientists have started to focus on measuring changes in brain activity related to sexual arousal, by using [[Neuroimaging|brain-scanning techniques]]. Given that sexual feelings are the product of perceptions and/or [[sexual fantasies|fantasies]] which are processed in the brain, measuring brain regions' activity should further show how people of different sexual orientations differ in this respect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

&lt;/ref&gt; that both hetero- and homosexual men react positively to seeing their preferred sex, using the same brain regions. The only significant group difference between these orientations was found in the [[amygdala]], a brain region known to be involved in regulating [[fear]].&lt;ref&gt;LeDoux JE, ''The Emotional Brain'' (N.Y.: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these findings have contributed to understanding how sexual arousal can differentiate between genders and sexual orientations, it is still a matter of debate whether these results reflect differences which are the result of social learning or genetic and/or biological factors. Further studies are needed to clarify how much of people's reactions to sexual stimuli of their preferred gender are due to learned or innate factors.

Sexual orientation probably is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences. In recent decades, biologically based theories have been favored by experts.

== Demographics of sexual orientation ==

{{Main|Demographics of sexual orientation}}

The multiple aspects of sexual orientation and the boundary-drawing problems already described create methodological challenges for the study of the demographics of sexual orientation. Determining the frequency of various sexual orientations in real-world populations is difficult and controversial.

Most modern scientific surveys find that the majority of people report a mostly heterosexual orientation. However, the relative percentage of the population that reports a homosexual orientation varies with differing methodologies and selection criteria. Most of these statistical findings are in the range of 2.8 to 9% of males, and 1 to 5% of females for the United States&lt;ref&gt;James Alm, M. V. Lee Badgett, Leslie A. Whittington, ''Wedding Bell Blues: The Income Tax Consequences of Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage'', p. 24 (1998) [http://www.colorado.edu/Economics/CEA/papers98/wp98-33.pdf PDF link].&lt;/ref&gt; – this figure can be as high as 12% for some large cities and as low as 1% percent for rural areas.

Estimates for the percentage of the population that are bisexual vary widely, at least in part due to differing definitions of bisexuality. Some studies only consider a person bisexual if they are nearly equally attracted to both sexes, and others consider a person bisexual if they are ''at all'' attracted to the same sex (for otherwise mostly heterosexual persons) or to the opposite sex (for otherwise mostly homosexual persons). A small percentage of people are not sexually attracted to anyone ([[asexuality]]).

=== Kinsey data ===

In the oft-cited and oft-criticized [[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]] (1948) and [[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]] (1953), by [[Alfred C. Kinsey]] et al., people were asked to rate themselves on a [[Kinsey scale|scale]] from completely heterosexual to completely homosexual. Kinsey reported that when the individuals' behavior as well as their identity are analyzed, most people appeared to be at least somewhat bisexual — i.e., most people have some attraction to either sex, although usually one sex is preferred. According to Kinsey, only a minority (5–10%) can be considered fully heterosexual or homosexual. Conversely, only an even smaller minority can be considered fully bisexual (with an equal attraction to both sexes). Kinsey's methods have been criticized as flawed, particularly with regard to the randomness of his sample population, which included a large number of prison inmates. Nevertheless, [[Paul Gebhard]], subsequent director of the [[Kinsey Institute for Sex Research]], reexamined the data in the [[Kinsey Reports]] and concluded that accounting for major statistical objections barely affected the results.

== Other explanations ==
=== Social constructionism and Western societies===

{{See also|Queer theory|Human male sexuality}}

Two researchers argued that, due to a lack of research on change over time (as of 1995), there is a limitation on current conceptualizations of sexual orientation. They did not abandon the concept of sexual orientation, but concluded that "given such significant measurement problems, one could conclude there is serious doubt whether sexual orientation is a valid concept at all".&lt;ref name="Def-Measure-SO"&gt;Gonsoriek, John. C.; Weinrich, J. D., ''Definition and Measurement of Sexual Orientation'', in ''Suicide and Life Threatening Behavior'', vol. 25, 1995, pp. 40–51, http://doi.apa.org/getuid.cfm?uid=1996-16078-001 (abstract &lt;http://psycnet.apa.org/?fa=main.doiLanding&amp;fuseaction=showUIDAbstract&amp;uid=1996-16078-001&gt;, as accessed Mar. 17, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Because sexual orientation is complex and multi-dimensional, some academics and researchers, especially in [[Queer studies]], have argued that it is a historical and [[Social constructionism|social construction]]. In 1976, philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]] argued that [[homosexuality]] as an identity did not exist in the eighteenth century; that people instead spoke of "sodomy", which referred to sexual acts. Sodomy was a crime that was often ignored but sometimes punished severely (see [[sodomy law]]). He wrote, "'Sexuality' is an invention of the modern state, the industrial revolution, and capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dMAtGvry_IMC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=china+heterosexuality+love+western&amp;source=web&amp;ots=PKv2BfyPpd&amp;sig=s43w6PzlNOgefEsjpHViwrxkM6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result ''Chinese Femininities, Chinese Masculinities: A Reader''], by Susan Brownell &amp; Jeffrey N. Wasserstrom (Univ. of Calif. Press, 2002 (ISBN 0520221168, 9780520221161)). Quote: "The problem with Sexuality

Some scholars have argued that maleness and femaleness were not closely linked to sexuality in China. [[&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Michel&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Foucault]]'s "The History of Sexuality" (which dealt primarily with Western civilization and western Europe) began to influence some China scholars in the 1980s. Foucault's insight was to demonstrate that sexuality has a history; it is not fixed psychobiological drive that is the same for all humans according to their sex, but rather it is a cultural construct inseparable from gender constructs. After unmooring sexuality from biology, he anchored it in history, arguing that this thing we now call sexuality came into existencee in the eighteenth-century West and did not exist previously in this form. "Sexuality" is an invention of the modern state, the industrial revolution, and capitalism. Taking this insight as a starting point, scholars have slowly been compiling the history of sexuality in china. The works by Tani Barlow, discussed above, were also foundational in this trend. Barlow observes that, in the West, heterosexuality is the primary site for the production of gender: a woman truly becomes a woman only in relation to a man's heterosexual desire. By contrast, in China before the 1920s the "jia" (linage unit, family) was the priamary site for the production of gender: marriage and sexuality were to serve the lineage by producing the next generation of lineage members; personal love and pleasure were secondary to this goal. Barlow argues that this has two theoretical implications: (1) it is not possible to write a chinese history of heterosexuality, sexuality as an institution, and sexual identities in the European metaphysical sense, and (2) it is not appropriate to ground discussions of Chinese gender processes in the sexed body so central in "Western" gender processes. Here she echoes Furth's argument that, before the earlyu twentiethh century, sex-identity grounded on anatomical difference did not hold a central place in Chinese constructions of gender. And she ehoes the point illustrated in detail in Sommer's chapter on male homosexuality in the Qing legal code: a man could engage in homosexual behaviour without calling into question his manhood so long as his behaviour did not threaten the patriarchal Confucian family structure."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual orientation is a concept that evolved in the industrialized West and there is a controversy as to the universality of its application in other societies or cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sFHX6uu19ZEC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=sexual+orientation+is+a+western+concept&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lj2ODgARED&amp;sig=6AUpbyJbsvbyqUxbjKmnXfdZX3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result ''The Psychology of Sexual Orientation, Behaviour, and identity''], by Louis Diamant &amp; Richard D.

Ross &amp; Ann K. Brooks. Quote from Page 9: Chou (2000) notes in his analysis of the lack of applicability of western concepts of sexual identity in China, just because a person has a particular taste for a specific food doesn't mean that we label them in terms of the food that they prefer. A similar approach to sexual appetite as not conferring identity may be operating in this sample. McIntosh (1968) has previously noted that people who do not identify with the classic western, white gay/lesbian role may not necessarily identify their behavior as homosexual;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-westernized concepts of male sexuality]] differ essentially from the way sexuality is seen and classified under the Western system of sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/1/3/4/8/p113482_index.html ''Transnational Transgender: Reading Sexual Diversity in Cross-Cultural Contexts Through Film and Video''] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;by?&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Ryan, Joelle Ruby (American Studies Association). Quote: Many of the projects which have historically investigated sex/gender variance in non-Western contexts have been ethnographies and anthropological studies. Due to strong and lingering problems with ethnocentrism, many of these research studies have attempted to transpose a Western understanding of sex, gender and sexuality onto cultures in Asia, Latin America and Africa. Terms such as "homosexual," "transvestite," and "transsexual" all arose out of Western concepts of identity based on science, sexology and medicine and often bear little resemblance to sex/gender/sexuality paradigms in the varied cultures of the developing world.&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of the notion of sexual orientation as defined in the West, as a biological phenomenon rather than a social construction specific to a region and period, has also been questioned within the industrialized Western society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psa.ac.uk/2007/pps/Waites.pdf ''Sexual Orientation, Human Rights and Global Politics''], &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;by?&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Matthew Waits (Matthew Waits of Dept. Sociology, Anthropology &amp; Applied Social Sciences, Univ. of Glasgow, United Kingdom, &lt;http://www.gla.ac.uk/departments/sociology/staff/waites.html&gt;). Quote from the Abstract: The paper problematises utilisation of the concept of 'sexual orientation' in moves to revise human rights conventions and discourses in the light of social constructionist and queer theory addressing sexuality, which has convincingly suggested that 'sexual orientation' is a culturally specific concept, misrepresenting many diverse forms of sexuality apparent in comparative sociological and anthropological research conducted worldwide. I will argue in particular that 'orientation' is a concept incompatible with bisexuality when interpreted within the context of dominant dualistic assumptions about sex, gender and desire in western culture (suggested by Judith Butler's concept of the 'heterosexual matrix'). I will discuss the implications of the this for interpreting contemporary struggles among competing social movements, NGO and governmental actors involved in contesting the relationship of sexuality to human rights as defined by the United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sexualorientation.info/thesis/Resisting%20Orientation%20-%20C1.pdf] McIntosh argues that the labelling process should be the focus of inquiry and that homosexuality should be seen as a social role rather than a condition. Role is more useful than condition, she argues, because roles (of heterosexual and homosexual) can be dichotomised in a way that behaviour cannot. She draws upon cross-cultural data to demonstrate that in many societies 'there may be much homosexual behaviour, but there are no "homosexuals"' (p71).&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexuality and homosexuality are terms often used in European and American cultures to encompass a person's entire social identity, which includes self and personality. In Western cultures, some people speak meaningfully of gay, lesbian, and bisexual identities and communities. In other cultures, homosexuality and heterosexual labels do not emphasize an entire social identity or indicate community affiliation based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Green &amp; Michael J. Stiers, ''Multiculturalism and Group Therapy in the United States: A Social Constructionist Perspective'' (Springer Netherlands, 2002), pp. 233–246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians and researchers argue that the emotional and affectional activities associated with sexual-orientation terms such as gay and heterosexual change significantly over time and across cultural boundaries. For example, in many English-speaking nations it is assumed that same-sex kissing, particularly between men, is a sign of homosexuality, whereas various types of same-sex kissing are common expressions of [[friendship]] in other nations. Also, many modern and historic cultures have formal ceremonies expressing long-term commitment between same-sex friends, even though homosexuality itself is taboo within the culture.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Brain, ''Friends and Lovers'' (Granada Publishing Ltd. 1976), chs. 3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anthropology, history, and sexology ===

Some scholars of [[anthropology]], [[history]], and [[sexology]] have argued that social categories such as heterosexual and homosexual are not universal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Different societies may consider other criteria to be more significant than sex, including the [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|respective ages of the partners]], whether partners assume active or passive sexual roles, and their social status.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Perception of sexual orientation and other people's reactions ==

One person may presume knowledge of another person's sexual orientation based upon perceived characteristics such as appearance, clothing, tone of voice, and accompaniment by and behavior with other people. Perceived sexual orientation may affect how a person is treated. For instance, in the United States, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] reported that 15.6% of [[hate crime]]s reported to police in 2004 were "because of a sexual-orientation bias."&lt;ref name="FBI crime"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Crime in the United States 2004: Hate Crime |url=http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/hate_crime/index.html |periodical=[[FBI]] |accessdate=2007-05-04 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003]], as explained by Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1342 ACAS (About Us)], as accessed Apr. 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; "workers or job applicants must not be treated less favourably because of their sexual orientation, their perceived sexual orientation or because they associate with someone of a particular sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acas.org.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=105&amp;p=0 Sexual orientation and the workplace: Putting the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 into practice]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics and theology ==

Two researchers, raising (1995) 'serious doubt whether sexual orientation is a valid concept at all,' warned against increasing politicization of this area.&lt;ref name="Def-Measure-SO" /&gt;

Professor Michael King stated, "The conclusion reached by scientists who have investigated the origins and stability of sexual orientation is that it is a human characteristic that is formed early in life, and is resistant to change. Scientific evidence on the origins of homosexuality is considered relevant to theological and social debate because it undermines suggestions that sexual orientation is a choice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=60752 Church Times: How much is known about the origins of homosexuality?]&lt;/ref&gt;
