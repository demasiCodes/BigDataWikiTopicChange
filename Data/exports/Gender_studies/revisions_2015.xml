'''Gender studies''' is a [[Field of study|field]] for [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study devoted to [[gender identity]] and gendered [[Representation (politics)|representation]] as central categories of analysis. This field includes [[women's studies]] (concerning [[women]], [[feminism]], gender, and politics), [[men's studies]] and [[LGBT studies]].&lt;ref name="whitman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies |title=Gender Studies |publisher=Whitman College |accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, gender studies is offered together with study of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. These disciplines study [[gender]] and sexuality in the fields of literature, language, [[geography]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[cinema studies|cinema]], [[media studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gender And Media: Representing, Producing, Consuming |last1=Krijnen |first1=Tonny |last2=van Bauwel |first2=Sofie |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-415-69540-4 |location=New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; human development, law, and medicine.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gendersexuality.uchicago.edu/about/ | title=About - Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS) | publisher=[[The University of Chicago]] | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also analyzes how [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[Location (geography)|location]], [[Class (social)|class]], [[nationality]], and [[disability]] intersect with the categories of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Race, Ethnicity, Gender &amp; Class"&gt;Healey, J. F. (2003).

Regarding gender, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] said: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one".&lt;ref name="de Beauvoir"&gt;de Beauvoir, S. (1949, 1989). "The Second Sex".&lt;/ref&gt; This view proposes that in gender studies, the term "gender" should be used to refer to the [[social constructionism|social and cultural constructions]] of masculinities and femininities and not to the state of being male or female in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Stephanie Garrett"&gt;Garrett, S. (1992). "Gender", p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view is not held by all gender theorists. Beauvoir's is a view that many sociologists support (see [[Sociology of gender]]), though there are many other contributors to the field of gender studies with different backgrounds and opposing views, such as psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan#Lacan and his discontents|Jacques Lacan]] and feminists such as [[Judith Butler]].

Gender is pertinent to many disciplines, such as [[literary theory]], drama studies, [[film theory]], [[performativity|performance theory]], contemporary [[art history]], anthropology, sociology, [[sociolinguistics]] and [[psychology]]. However, these disciplines sometimes differ in their approaches to how and why gender is studied. For instance in anthropology, sociology and psychology, gender is often studied as a practice, whereas in cultural studies representations of gender are more often examined.  In politics, gender can be viewed as a foundational discourse that political actors employ in order to position themselves on a variety of issues.&lt;ref&gt;Salime, Zakia. Between Feminism and Islam: Human Rights and Sharia Law in Morocco. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gender studies is also a discipline in itself, incorporating methods and approaches from a wide range of disciplines.&lt;ref name=companion&gt;{{cite book |last1=Essed |first1=Philomena |authorlink1=Philomena Essed |last2=Goldberg |first2=David Theo |authorlink2=David Theo Goldberg |last3=Kobayashi |first3=Audrey |authorlink3=Audrey Kobayashi |title=A Companion to Gender Studies |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZPgYDTa9P84C&amp;dq=genders+studies |accessdate=7 November 2011 |isbn=978-1-4051-8808-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each field came to regard "gender" as a practice, sometimes referred to as something that is [[Performative utterance|performative]].&lt;ref name = "performativity of gender"/&gt; [[Feminist theory]] of psychoanalysis, articulated mainly by [[Julia Kristeva]]&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie Smith, ''Julia Kristeva: Speaking the Unspeakable'' (Pluto Press, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; (the "semiotic" and "abjection") and [[Bracha Ettinger]]&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, "Inscriptions in the Feminine" and "Introduction" to "The With-In-Visible Screen", in: ''Inside the Visible'' edited by Catherine de Zegher. MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; (the feminine-prematernal-maternal matrixial Eros of borderlinking and com-passion,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bracha L.

Gender can also be broken into three categories, gender identity, gender expression, and biological sex, as Sam Killermann explains in his Ted X Talk at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRcPXtqdKjE|title=Understanding the Complexities of Gender: Sam Killermann at TEDxUofIChicago|date=3 May 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three categories are another way of breaking down gender into the different social, biological, and cultural constructions. These constructions focus on how femininity and masculinity are fluid entities and how their meaning is able to fluctuate depending on the various constraints surrounding them.

==Influences of gender studies==

===Gender studies and psychoanalytic theory===

A number of theorists have influenced the field of gender studies significantly, specifically in terms of psychoanalytic theory. Among these are [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], and [[Mark Blechner]].

Gender studied under the lens of each of these theorists looks somewhat different. In a Freudian system, women are 'mutilated and must learn to accept their lack of a penis' (in Freud's terms a "deformity").&lt;ref&gt;Karen Horney (1922). "On the Genesis of the Castration Complex in Women" ''Psychoanalysis and Women''. Ed. J.B. Miller. New York: Bruner/Mazel, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan, however, organizes femininity and masculinity according to different unconscious structures. Both male and female subjects participate in the "phallic" organization, and the feminine side of sexuation is "supplementary" and not opposite or complementary.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, J. (1973). ''Encore''. Paris: Seuil, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of sexuation (sexual situation), which posits the development of gender-roles and role-play in childhood, is useful in countering the idea that gender identity is innate or biologically determined. In other words, the sexuation of an individual has as much, if not more, to do with their development of a gender identity as being genetically sexed male or female.&lt;ref name="Lacan &amp; Post-feminism"&gt;Wright, E. (2003). "Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters)"&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influences include [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Mark Blechner]]. Kristeva has significantly developed the field of [[semiotics]]. She contends that patriarchal cultures, like individuals, have to exclude the maternal and the feminine so that they can come into being.&lt;ref name="Kristeva Abject"&gt;Kristeva, J. (1982). "Powers of Horror"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Blechner]] expanded psychoanalytic views of sex and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Blechner, M. J. (2009) 'Sex Changes: Transformations in Society and Psychoanalysis.' New York and London: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued that there is a "gender fetish" in western society, in which the gender of sexual partners is given enormously disproportionate attention over other factors involved in sexual attraction, such as age and social class.&lt;ref&gt;Blechner, M. J. (1995) The shaping of psychoanalytic theory and practice by cultural and personal biases about sexuality. In T. Domenici and R. Lesser, (eds.) 'Disorienting Sexuality.' New York: Routledge, pp. 265–288.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bracha Ettinger]] transformed subjectivity in contemporary psychoanalysis since the early 1990s with the Matrixial&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "Matrix and Metramorphosis." In: ''Differences''. Vol. 4, nº 3: 176–208, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; feminine-maternal and prematernal Eros&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; of borderlinking (bordureliance), borderspacing (bordurespacement) and co-emergence. The matrixial feminine difference defines a particular gaze&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, ''The Matrixial Borderspace''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2006 (articles from 1994–1999). ISBN 0-8166-3587-0&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a source for trans-subjectivity and transjectivity&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "Matrixial Trans-subjectivity" in: ''Problematizing Global Knowledge''. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, Volume 23, Numbers 2–3, 2006. ISSN 0263-2764&lt;/ref&gt; in both males and females. Ettinger rethinks the human subject as informed by the archaic connectivity to the maternal and proposes the idea of a Demeter-Persephone Complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|mdkbYsjlMA8|public lecture at EGS (2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures can have very different norms of maleness and [[masculinity]]. Blechner identifies the terror, in Western males, of penetration. Yet in many societies, being gay is defined only by being a male who lets himself be penetrated. Males who penetrate other males are considered masculine and not gay and are not the targets of prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Blechner, M. J. (1998) Maleness and masculinity. 'Contemporary Psychoanalysis,' 34:597–613.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cultures, however, receptive [[fellatio]] is the norm for early adolescence and seen as a requirement for developing normal manliness.&lt;ref&gt;Herdt, G. (1981) 'Guardians of the Flute.' New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Feminist psychoanalytic theory====
Feminist theorists such as [[Juliet Mitchell]], [[Nancy Chodorow]], [[Jessica Benjamin]], [[Jane Gallop]], [[Bracha Ettinger]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Griselda Pollock]],&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luce Irigaray]] and Jane Flax have developed a Feminist psychoanalysis and argued that psychoanalytic theory is vital to the feminist project and must, like other theoretical traditions, be criticized by women as well as transformed to free it from vestiges of sexism (i.e. being [[censored]]). [[Shulamith Firestone]], in "The Dialectic of Sex" calls Freudianism the misguided feminism and discusses how Freudianism is ''almost'' completely accurate, with the exception of one crucial detail: everywhere that Freud writes "penis", the word should be replaced with "power".

Critics like [[Elizabeth Grosz]] accuse [[Jacques Lacan]] of maintaining a sexist tradition in psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name ="Grosz"&gt;Grosz, E. (1990).  "Jacques Lacan: A Feminist Introduction", London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Judith Butler]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Jane Gallop]] have used Lacanian work, though in a critical way, to develop gender theory.&lt;ref name="Gender Trouble"&gt;Butler, J. (1999). "Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ettinger"&gt;Ettinger, B. (Collected Essays from 1994–1999). "The Matrixial Borderspace", [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallop"&gt;Gallop, J. (1993). "The Daughter's Seduction: Feminism and Psychoanalysi", Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

According J.B Marchand, "The gender studies and queer theory are rather reluctant, hostile to see the psychoanalytic approach. ".&lt;ref&gt;in Le Sexuel, ses différences et ses genres. direction par Guillemine Chaudoye, Dominique Cupa et Hélène Parat, EDK Editions, Paris, 2011, chapter about Judith Butler&lt;/ref&gt;

For Jean-Claude Guillebaud, the gender-studies (and activists of sexual minorities) "besieged" and consider psychoanalysis and psychoanalysts as "the new priests, the last defenders of the genital normality, morality, moralism or even obscurantism."&lt;ref&gt;La psychanalyse peut-elle guérir ? Jean-Claude Guillebaud, Armand Abécassis, Alain Houziaux, Éditions de l'Atelier, Paris, 2005, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judith Butler]]'s worries about the outlook psychoanalytic under which sexual difference is "undeniable" and pathologizing any effort to suggest that it is not so paramount and unambiguous ...".&lt;ref&gt;Butler Judith and al., « Pour ne pas en finir avec le « genre »... Table ronde », Sociétés &amp; Représentations 2/ 2007 (n° 24), p. 285-306. DOI : 10.3917/sr.024.0285&lt;/ref&gt; According to Daniel Beaune and Caterina Rea, the gender-studies "often criticized psychoanalysis to perpetuate a family and social model of patriarchal, based on a rigid and timeless version of the parental order".&lt;ref&gt;"Psychanalyse sans Œdipe: Antigone, genre et subversion." Daniel Beaune and Caterina Rea, l'Harmattan, Paris, 2010, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary theory===
Psychoanalytically oriented French feminism focused on visual and literary theory all along. [[Virginia Woolf]]'s legacy as well as "[[Adrienne Rich]]'s call for women's revisions of literary texts, and history as well, has galvanized a generation of feminist authors to reply with texts of their own".&lt;ref&gt;Mica Howe &amp; Sarah A. Aguier (eds.). ''He said, She Says''. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]] and other feminists have articulated Myth and Poetry&lt;ref name="Vanda Zajko 2006"&gt;Vanda Zajko &amp; Miriam Leonard (eds.). ''Laughing with Medusa''. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and literature,&lt;ref name="Vanda Zajko 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humm, Maggie, ''Modernist Women and Visual Cultures''. Rutgers University Press, 2003. ISBN 0-8135-3266-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nina Cornietz, ''Dangerous Women, Deadly Words''. Stanford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; from the point of view of gender.

===Post-modern influence===
The emergence of [[post-modernism]] theories affected gender studies,&lt;ref name="Lacan &amp; Post-feminism"/&gt; causing a movement in [[Gender identity|identity theories]] away from the concept of fixed or [[essentialism|essentialist]] gender identity, to [[Postmodernity#Distinctions in philosophy and critical theory|post-modern]]&lt;ref&gt;Grebowicz, M. (2007). ''Gender After Lyotard''. NY: SUNY Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; fluid&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, Ayelet (ed.), ''PostGender''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; or multiple identities.&lt;ref&gt;Benhabib, S.  (1995). "Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange" and Butler, J. (1995) "Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange".&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of post-structuralism, and its literary theory aspect post-modernism, on gender studies was most prominent in its challenging of grand narratives. Post-structuralism paved the way for the emergence of [[queer theory]] in gender studies, which necessitated the field expanding its purview to sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genderandsexuality.as.nyu.edu/page/home|title=Gender and Sexuality Studies - New York University|work=nyu.edu|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the expansion to include sexuality studies, under the influence of post-modernism gender studies has also turned its lens toward [[hegemonic masculinity|masculinity studies]], due to the work of sociologists and theorists such as, [[R.W. Connell]], [[Michael Kimmel]], and E. Anthony Rotundo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/American-Manhood-Transformations-Masculinity-Revolution/dp/0465001696|title=American Manhood: Transformations In Masculinity From The Revolution To The Modern Era: E. Anthony Rotundo: 9780465001699: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeser,''Masculinities in Theory'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes and expansions have led to some contentions within the field, such as the one between second wave feminists and queer theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amygoodloe.com/papers/lesbian-feminism-and-queer-theory-another-battle-of-the-sexes/|title=Lesbian-Feminism and Queer Theory: Another "Battle of the Sexes"?|work=amygoodloe.com|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line drawn between these two camps lies in the problem as feminists see it of queer theorists arguing that everything is fragmented and there are not only no grand narratives but also no trends or categories. Feminists argue that this erases the categories of gender altogether but does nothing to antagonize the power dynamics reified by gender. In other words, the fact that gender is [[social construction|socially constructed]] does not undo the fact that there are strata of oppression between genders.

==The development of gender theory==

===History of gender studies===

The history of gender studies looks at the different perspectives of gender. This discipline examines the ways in which historical, cultural, and social events shape the role of gender in different societies. The field of gender studies, while focusing on the differences between men and women, also looks at sexual differences and less binary definitions of gender categorization.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis," American Historical Review 91, No. 5 (December 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the revolution of the universal suffrage of the twentieth century and the women's liberation movement of the [[1960]] and [[1970s]] promoted a revision from the feminists to "actively interrogate" the usual and accepted versions of history as it was known at the time. It was the goal of many feminist scholars to question original assumptions regarding women’s and men’s attributes, to actually measure them, and to report observed differences between women and men.&lt;ref name="Chafetz, Janet Saltzman 1999"&gt;Chafetz, Janet Saltzman. Handbook of the Sociology of Gender. New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, these programs were essentially feminist, designed to recognize contributions made by women as well as by men. Soon, men began to look at masculinity the same way that women were looking at femininity, and developed an area of study called "men’s studies." &lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"&gt;Douglas, Fedwa. Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender. Detroit: Macmillan Reference, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1980s and 1990s that scholars recognized a need for study in the field of sexuality. This was due to the increasing interest in lesbian and gay rights, and scholars found that most individuals will associate sexuality and gender together, rather than as separate entities.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liddington|first=Jill|title=HISTORY, FEMINISM AND GENDER STUDIES|url=http://www.jliddington.org.uk/cig1.html|publisher=University of Leeds Centre for Interdisciplinary Gender Studies: Working Paper 1 Feminist Scholarship: within/across/between/beyond the disciplines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of drivers' propensity to use traffic information system showed that income and car ownership play an important role in travel behavior for men, while education and occupation were identified significant in the women's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40890-015-0002-5#page-1 |title=Investigating Women’s and Men’s Propensity to Use Traffic Information in a Developing Country |author=Fatemeh Baratian-Ghorghi|author2= Huaguo Zhou |year=2015 |work=Transportation in Developing Economies |accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 at [[Kabul University]] the first master’s degree course in gender and women’s studies in Afghanistan began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FaithWorld |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2015/10/26/kabul-university-unlikely-host-for-first-afghan-womens-studies-programme/ |title=Kabul University unlikely host for first Afghan women’s studies programme |publisher=Blogs.reuters.com |date=2015-10-26 |accessdate=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's studies===

Women's studies is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[women]], [[feminism]], [[gender identity|gender]], and [[politics]]. It often includes [[feminist theory]], [[women's history]] (e.g. a history of [[women's suffrage]]) and [[social history]], [[women's fiction]], [[women's health]], feminist psychoanalysis and the [[feminist]] and gender studies-influenced practice of most of the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]].

===Gender in East Asia===
{{See also|Women in Asia}}

Certain issues associated with gender in [[Eastern Asia]] and the [[Pacific Region]] are more complex and depend on location and context. For example, in [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], a heavy importance of what defines a woman comes from the workforce. In these countries, "gender related challenges tend to be related to economic empowerment, employment, and workplace issues, for example related to informal sector workers, feminization of migration flows, work place conditions, and long term social security."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The World Bank. "Gender in East Asia and Pacific." Social Development. The World Bank, 2013. Web. Mar. 2015. &lt;http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20327365~menuPK:502969~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502940,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, in countries who are less economically stable, such as [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Timor Leste]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and some provinces in more remote locations, "women tend to bear the cost of social and domestic conflicts and natural disasters."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

One issue that remains consistent throughout all provinces in different stages of development is women having a weak voice when it comes to decision-making. One of the reasons for this is the "growing trend to decentralization [which] has moved decision-making down to levels at which women’s voice is often weakest and where even the women’s civil society movement, which has been a powerful advocate at national level, struggles to organize and be heard."&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. "Gender in East Asia and Pacific." Social Development. The World Bank, 2013. Web. Mar. 2015. &lt;http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20327365~menuPK:502969~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502940,00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

East Asia Pacific’s approach to help mainstream these issues of gender relies on a three-pillar method [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/EXTEAPREGTOPSOCDEV/0,,contentMDK:20327365~menuPK:502969~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:502940,00.html#EAP_approach]. Pillar one is partnering with middle-income countries and emerging middle-income countries to sustain and share gains in growth and prosperity. Pillar two supports the developmental underpinnings for [[peace]], renewed growth and poverty reduction in the poorest and most fragile areas. The final pillar provides a stage for knowledge management, exchange and dissemination on gender responsive development within the region to begin. These programs have already been established, and successful in, [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[China]], as well as the [[Philippines]], and efforts are starting to be made in [[Laos]], [[Papua New Guinea]], and [[Timor Leste]] as well. These pillars speak to the importance of showcasing gender studies.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Judith Butler===
{{Main|Judith Butler}}

The concept of gender performativity is at the core of philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler's work, notably in ''[[Gender Trouble]]''. In Butler’s terms the performance of gender, sex, and sexuality is about power in society.&lt;ref name="performativity of gender"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butler, J. (1999). "Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity", 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  She locates the [[Social constructivism|construction]] of the "gendered, sexed, desiring subject" in "regulative discourses".
A part of Butler's argument concerns the role of sex in the construction of "natural" or coherent gender and sexuality. In her account, gender and heterosexuality are constructed as natural because the opposition of the male and female sexes is perceived as natural in the social imaginary.&lt;ref name="performativity of gender"&gt;Butler, J. (1999). "Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity", 163–71, 177–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==
Historian and theorist Bryan Palmer argues that gender studies' current reliance on [[post-structuralism]] – with its reification of discourse and avoidance of the structures of oppression and struggles of resistance – obscures the origins, meanings, and consequences of historical events and processes, and he seeks to counter current trends in gender studies with an argument for the necessity to analyze lived experiences and the structures of subordination and power.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Palmer, "Descent into Discourse: The Reification of Language and the Writing of Social History", Trent University (Peterborough, Canada)&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge propose in the book 'Professing Feminism: Education and Indoctrination in Women's Studies' that the attempt to make Women's Studies serve a political agenda has led to problematic results such as dubious scholarship and pedagogical practices that resemble indoctrination more than education.

[[Rosi Braidotti]] (1994) has criticized gender studies as: "the take-over of the feminist agenda by studies on masculinity, which results in transferring funding from feminist faculty positions to other kinds of positions. There have been cases...of positions advertised as 'gender studies' being given away to the 'bright boys'. Some of the competitive take-over has to do with gay studies. Of special significance in this discussion is the role of the mainstream publisher Routledge who, in our opinion, is responsible for promoting gender as a way of deradicalizing the feminist agenda, re-marketing masculinity and gay male identity instead."&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith (1994). "Feminism in Any Other Name", differences 6:2-3: 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Calvin Thomas countered that, "as Joseph Allen Boone points out, 'many of the men in the academy who are feminism's most supportive 'allies' ''are'' gay,'" and that it is "disingenuous" to ignore the ways in which mainstream publishers such as Routledge have promoted feminist theorists.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Calvin, ed., "Introduction: Identification, Appropriation, Proliferation", Straight with a Twist: Queer Theory and the Subject of Heterosexuality. University of Illinois Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of gender studies==
The field of gender studies explores the ways that femininity and masculinity affect an individual’s thought process. This is relevant in a variety of realms, such as social organizations and institutions, interpersonal relationships, and understandings of identity and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"/&gt; Gender studies is a discipline created originally by activists,&lt;ref name="Chafetz, Janet Saltzman 1999"/&gt; and those who study it today see it as their mission to identify, analyze, and correct social inequities both locally and globally.&lt;ref name="Douglas, Fedwa 2007"/&gt;

Gender Studies explores power as it relates to gender and other forms of identity, including sexuality, race, class, religion, and nationality. Gender Studies encompasses interdisciplinary fields, which include exploration of the histories and experiences of diverse women and men as well as studies of sexualities, masculinities, femininities, and gender systems in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women and Gender Studies|website=Cal State Fullerton|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also analyzes how gender plays out in politics, intimate life, culture, the workplace, athletics, technology, health, science, and in the very production of knowledge itself. College courses emphasize critical thinking and analysis along with social justice activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dornsife|first1=Dana|title=USC Dornsife|website=USC University of Southern California|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These courses teach interdisciplinary methods, relate debates in the field to key intellectual and social movements, explore intersections of feminist studies, masculinity studies, and queer studies, and assist students with professional development.  Gender Studies emphasize the relationships between gender and society historically and cross-culturally, and the changes now occurring in the roles of women and men, the participation of women in the major institutions of society, and women themselves. Gender is then understood as not a freestanding category, but rather one that takes shape through its intersection with other relations of power, including sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, nationality, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bigler|first1=Audrey|title=Gender Studies|website=Claremont McKenna College}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers historical, contemporary, and transnational analyses of how gender and sexual formations arise in different contexts such as colonialism, nationalism, and globalization. [[Globalization]] describes the ways that gender operates in different national and cultural contexts. Through this understanding, many graduates get advanced degrees in a profession such as law or business. Graduates report working in a range of areas including communications and media, arts and education, business, politics and government, the law, health, and non-profit sector. In addition to its focus on the history and achievements of women, gender scholarship has inspired research and curricula that address men’s lives, masculinity, and the lives of people who identify as [[Gay]], [[Lesbian]], [[Bisexuality|Bisexual]] or [[Transgender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chatterjee |first1=Piva |title=Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies |website=Scripts: The Womens College, Claremont |accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
