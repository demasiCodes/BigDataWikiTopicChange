'''Cyberbullying''' is the use of the Internet and [[telecommunication|related technologies]] to harm other people, in a deliberate, repeated, and hostile manner.&lt;ref name=Cyberbullying.org&gt;[http://www.cyberbullying.org Cyberbullying.org] – includes the first formal definition of cyberbullying by [[Bill Belsey]]. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As it has become more common in society, particularly among young people, legislation and awareness campaigns have arisen to combat it.

==Definition==
The term "cyberbullying" is attributed to anti-bullying activist [[Bill Belsey]].&lt;ref name=Cyberbullying.org/&gt;

===Legal definition===
Cyberbullying is defined in legal glossaries as 
* actions that use information and communication technologies to support deliberate, repeated, and hostile behavior by an individual or group, that is intended to harm another or others.
* use of communication technologies for the intention of harming another person
* use of internet service and mobile technologies such as web pages and discussion groups as well as instant messaging or [[SMS]] text messaging  with the intention of harming another person.

Examples of what constitutes cyberbullying include communications that seek to intimidate, control, manipulate, put down, falsely discredit, or humiliate the recipient. The actions are deliberate, repeated, and hostile behavior intended to harm another. Cyberbullying has been defined by [[The National Crime Prevention Council]]: “When the Internet, cell phones or other devices are used to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/cyber-bullying/ Cyberbullying - Law and Legal Definitions] US Legal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legaldefinitions.co/cyber-bullying.html Cyber-bullying Definition] Legal Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

A cyberbully may be a person whom the target knows or an online stranger. A cyberbully may be anonymous and may solicit involvement of other people online who do not even know the target. This is known as a 'digital pile-on.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberslammed|url=http://www.cyberslammed.com/where-to-start.html|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyberbullying vs. cyberstalking===
{{see|Cyberstalking}}
The practice of cyberbullying is not limited to children and, while the behavior is identified by the same definition when practiced by adults, the distinction in age groups sometimes refers to the abuse as [[cyberstalking]] or [[cyberharassment]] when perpetrated by adults toward adults.  Common tactics used by cyberstalkers are performed in public forums, social media or online information sites and are intended to threaten a victim's earnings, employment, reputation, or safety. Behaviors may include encouraging others to harass the victim and trying to affect a victim's online participation. Many cyberstalkers try to damage the reputation of their victim and turn other people against them.

Cyberstalking may include false accusations, monitoring, making threats, identity theft, damage to data or equipment, the solicitation of minors for sex, or gathering information in order to harass. A repeated pattern of such actions and [[harassment]] against a target by an adult constitutes cyberstalking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyberbullyingreport.com/bullies/tag/celebrity-stalker.aspx#&amp;&amp;Page=1 Celebrity stalking reports] Anti-Bullying and Internet Safety Services&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberstalking often features linked patterns of online and offline behavior. There are consequences of law in offline stalking and online stalking, and cyber-stalkers can be put in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/01/ucf-cyber-stalkers-sentence-not-harsh-enough-victim-says/ |title=UCF Cyber Stalker’s Sentence Not Harsh Enough, Victim Says|publisher=ABC News|date=January 23, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberstalking is a form of cyberbullying.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===Methods used===
Manuals to educate the public, teachers and parents summarize, "Cyberbullying is being cruel to others by sending or posting harmful material using a cell phone or the internet." Research, legislation and education in the field are ongoing. Basic definitions and guidelines to help recognize and cope with what is regarded as abuse of electronic communications have been identified. 
* Cyberbullying involves repeated behavior with intent to harm and repeated nature
* Cyberbullying is perpetrated through [[Harassment]], [[Cyberstalking]], Denigration (sending or posting cruel rumors and falsehoods to damage reputation and friendships), [[Impersonation]], Exclusion (intentionally and cruelly excluding someone from an online group)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csriu.org/cyberbully/docs/cbcteducator.pdf ''An Educators Guide to Cyberbullying''] Brown Senate.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can be as simple as continuing to send e-mail or text harassing someone who has said they want no further contact with the sender.  It may also include public actions such as repeated [[threat]]s, sexual remarks, pejorative labels (i.e., [[hate speech]]) or defamatory false accusations), ganging up on a victim by making the person the subject of ridicule in online forums, hacking into or vandalizing sites about a person, and posting false statements as fact aimed a discrediting or humiliating a targeted person.  Cyberbullying could be limited to posting rumors about a person on the internet with the intention of bringing about hatred in others' minds or convincing others to dislike or participate in online denigration of a target. It may go to the extent of personally identifying victims of crime and publishing materials severely defaming or humiliating them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/cyber-bullying/ Cyberbullying - Law and Legal Definitions] US Legal&lt;/ref&gt;  

Cyberbullies may disclose victims' personal data (e.g. real name, home address, or workplace/schools) at websites or forums or may use [[impersonation]], creating fake accounts, comments or sites posing as their target for the purpose of publishing material in their name that defames, discredits or ridicules them. 

Some cyberbullies may also send threatening and harassing emails, instant messages or texts to the victims. Others post rumors or gossip and instigate others to dislike and gang up on the target. 

===Growing awareness===
The term "cyberbullying" was first coined and defined by Canadian educator and anti-bullying activist [[Bill Belsey]], as "the use of information and communication technologies to support deliberate, repeated, and hostile behavior by an individual or group, that is intended to harm others."&lt;ref name=Cyberbullying.org/&gt;

Cyberbullying has subsequently been defined as "when the Internet, cell phones or other devices are used to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpc.org/cyberbullying National Crime Prevention Council]. Ncpc.org. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers use similar language to describe the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;''Bullying Beyond the Schoolyard: Preventing and Responding to Cyberbullying'', by J.W. Patchin and S. Hinuja; Sage Publications, (Corwin Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=patchin&gt;Patchin, J. W. &amp; Hinduja, S. (2006). [http://yvj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/4/2/148 Bullies move beyond the schoolyard: A preliminary look at cyberbullying] Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice, 4(2), 148–169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law enforcement: cyberbullying, cyberstalking and electronic harassment== 
A majority of states have laws that explicitly include electronic forms of communication within stalking or harassment laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx  Cyberstalking, cyberharassment and cyberbullying] NCSL National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.61.260 Cyberstalking] Washington State Legislature&lt;/ref&gt;

Most law enforcement agencies have cyber-crime units and often Internet stalking is treated with more seriousness than reports of physical stalking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifescript.com/soul/self/growth/10_signs_that_you_are_being_stalked.aspx?gclid=CIGJoa-f3rACFSdjTAod6kVuzQ&amp;trans=1&amp;du=1&amp;ef_id=ywxP4iUQwsEAAFaY%3a20120621020615%3as How To Recognize And Stop Stalking Behavior], by Stephanie Tallman Smith; Lifescript, November 09, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Help and resources can be searched by State or area.
  
===Schools===
The safety of schools is increasingly becoming a focus of state legislative action. There was an increase in cyberbullying enacted legislation between 2006-2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx Cyberbullying Enacted Legislation: 2006-2010] Legislation by State, NCSL&lt;/ref&gt; Initiatives and curriclulum requirements also exist in the UK (the Ofsted eSafety guidance) and Australia (Overarching Learning Outcome 13).
In 2012, a group of teens in New Haven, Connecticut developed an app to help fight bullying. Called "Back Off Bully" (BOB), the web app is an anonymous resource for computer, smart phone or iPad. When someone witnesses or is the victim of bullying, they can immediately report the incident. The app asks questions about time, location and how the bullying is happening. As well as providing positive action and empowerment over an incident, the reported information helps by going to a data base where administrators study it. Common threads are spotted so others can intervene and break the bully's pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/south/12007792580056/ct-teens-develop-bullying-app-to-protect-peers/ CT teens develop bullying app to protect peers] 7 News; June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; BOB, the brainchild of fourteen teens in a  design class, is being considered as standard operating procedure at schools across the state.

===Protection for victims of any age===
There are laws that only address online harassment of children or focus on child predators as well as laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims, or victims of any age. Currently, there are 45 cyberstalking (and related) laws on the books.  

While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age 18 and under, Working to Halt Online Abuse is a help resource containing a list of current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haltabuse.org/resources/laws/index.shtml  Current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws] WHOA&lt;/ref&gt; It also lists those states that do not have laws yet and related laws from other countries. The Global Cyber Law Database (GCLD) aims to become the most comprehensive and authoritative source of cyber laws for all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberlawdb.com/main/ The Global Cyber Law Database] GCLD&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
===Children and adolescents===
Kids report being mean to each other online beginning as young as 2nd grade. According to research, boys initiate mean online activity earlier than girls do. However, by middle school, girls are more likely to engage in cyberbullying than boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/cms/story.php?id=2078 Cyberbullying defies traditional stereotype: Girls are more likely than boys to engage in this new trend, research suggests] September 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the bully is male or female, his or her purpose is to intentionally embarrass others, harass, intimidate, or make threats online to one another. This bullying occurs via email, text messaging, posts to blogs, and web sites.

The National Crime Prevention Association lists tactics often used by teen cyberbullies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpc.org/cyberbullying Cyberbullying among Teens] The National Crime Prevention Association&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pretend they are other people online to trick others
* Spread lies and rumors about victims
* Trick people into revealing personal information
* Send or forward mean text messages
* Post pictures of victims without their consent

Studies in the psychosocial effects of cyberspace have begun to monitor the impacts cyberbullying may have on the victims, and the consequences it may lead to. Consequences of cyberbullying are multi-faceted, and affect online and offline behavior.  Research on adolescents reported that changes in the victims' behavior as a result of cyberbullying could be positive. Victims "created a cognitive pattern of bullies, which consequently helped them to recognize aggressive people."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2011121901&amp;article=4 Cyberbullying in Adolescent Victims: Perception and Coping] Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace abstract reports critical impacts in almost all of the respondents’, taking the form of lower self-esteem, loneliness, disillusionment, and distrust of people. The more extreme impacts were self-harm. Children have killed each other and committed suicide after having been involved in a cyberbullying incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stopcyberbullying.org/what_is_cyberbullying_exactly.html Stop Cyberbullying]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most current research in the field defines cyberbullying as "an aggressive, intentional act or behaviour that is carried out by a group or an individual repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself" (Smith &amp; Slonje, 2007, p. 249). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2011121901&amp;article=4 Cyberbullying in Adolescent Victims: Perception and Coping] Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace&lt;/ref&gt; Though the use of sexual remarks and threats are sometimes present in cyberbullying, it is not the same as sexual harassment, typically occurs among peers, and does not necessarily involve [[sexual predators]].

===Adults===
Stalking online has criminal consequences just as physical stalking. A target's understanding of why cyberstalking is happening is helpful to remedy and take protective action to restore remedy. Cyberstalking is an extension of physical stalking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/1.html Cyberstalking - Introduction] Crime Library, Criminal Minds and Methods&lt;/ref&gt; Among factors that motivate stalkers are: [[envy]], pathological obsession (professional or sexual), unemployment or failure with own job or life; intention to intimidate and cause others to feel inferior; the stalker is [[delusional]] and believes he/she "knows" the target; the stalker wants to instill fear in a person to justify his/her status; belief they can get away with it (anonymity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/3.html Cyber-Stalking: Obsessional Pursuit and the Digital Criminal], by Wayne Petherick - Stalking Typologies and Pathologies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://quitstalkingme.com/2011/07/28/ten-reasons-why-someone-is-stalking-you-online/ Ten Reasons Why Someone is Stalking You Online] Quit Stalking Me - Cyberstalking&lt;/ref&gt; UK National Workplace Bullying Advice Line theorizes that bullies harass victims in order to make up for inadequacies in their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcib.ch/topic/bullying.pdf UK National Workplace Bullying Advice Line] Bullying&lt;/ref&gt; 

The US federal cyberstalking law is designed to prosecute people for using electronic means to repeatedly harass or threaten someone online. There are resources dedicated to assisting adult victims deal with cyberbullies legally and effectively. One of the steps recommended is to record everything and contact police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiredsafety.org/subjects/cyberbullying.php Cyberbullying] Stalking and Harassment&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.yahoo.com/what-cyberbullies-adults-11081994.html What to Do About Cyberbullies: For Adults], by Rena Sherwood; YAHOO Contributor network&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
===Australia===
The nation-wide Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Survey (Cross et al., 2009)&lt;ref name="ACBPS"&gt;[http://www.deewr.gov.au/Schooling/NationalSafeSchools/Pages/research.aspx Cross, D., Shaw, T., Hearn, L., Epstein, M., Monks, H., Lester, L., &amp; Thomas, L. 2009. Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Study (ACBPS). Child Health Promotion Research Centre, Edith Cowan University, Perth]. Deewr.gov.au. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; assessed cyber-bullying experiences among 7,418 students. Rates of cyber-bullying increased with age, with 4.9% of students in Year 4 reporting cyberbullying compared to 7.9% in year nine. Cross et al., (2009) reported that rates of bullying and harassing others were lower, but also increased with age. Only 1.2% of Year 4 students reported cyber-bullying others compared to 5.6% of Year 9 students.

===Canada===
Similarly, a Canadian study found:
* 23% of middle-schoolers surveyed had been bullied by e-mail
* 35% in chat rooms
* 41% by text messages on their cell phones
* Fully 41% did not know the identity of the perpetrators.

===European Union===
Reporting on the results from a meta analysis from European Union countries, Hasebrink et al. (2009)&lt;ref name="Hasebrink"&gt;Hasebrink, U., Livingstone, S., Haddon, L. and Ólafsson, K.(2009) Comparing children’s online opportunities and risks across Europe: Cross-national comparisons for EU Kids Online. LSE, London: EU Kids Online (Deliverable D3.2, 2nd edition), ISBN 978-0-85328-406-2 [http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/EUKidsOnline/Reports/D3.2,secondedition.pdf lse.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; estimated (via median results) that approximately 18% of European young people had been "bullied/harassed/stalked" via the internet and mobile phones. Cyber-harassment rates for young people across the EU member states ranged from 10% to 52%.

===Finland===
In addition to the current research, Sourander et al. (2010) conducted a population-based cross-sectional study that took place in Finland. The authors of this study took the self-reports of 2215 Finish adolescents between the ages of 13 to 16 years old about cyberbullying and cybervictimization during the past 6 months. It was found that, amongst the total sample, 4.8% were cybervictims only, 7.4% were cyberbullies only, and 5.4% were cyberbully-victims. Cybervictim-only status was associated with a variety of factors, including emotional and peer problems, sleeping difficulties, and feeling unsafe in school. Cyberbully-only status was associated with factors such as hyperactivity and low prosocial behavior, as well as conduct problems. Cyberbully-victim status was associated with all of the risk factors that were associated with both cybervictim-only status and cyberbully-only status. The authors of this study were able to conclude that cyberbullying as well as cybervictimization is associated not only with psychiatric issues, but psychosomatic issues. Many adolescents in the study reported headaches or difficulty sleeping. The authors believe that their results indicate a greater need for new ideas on how to prevent cyberbullying and what to do when it occurs. It is clearly a world-wide problem that needs to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sourander, A., Klomek, A.B., Ikonen, M., Lindroos, J., Luntamo, T., Koskeiainen, M., …

===United States===
====2000====
A survey by the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the [[University of New Hampshire]] in 2000 found that 6% of the young people in the survey had experienced some form of harassment including threats and negative rumours and 2% had suffered distressing harassment.&lt;ref name=ccrc&gt;Finkelhor, D., Mitchell, K.J., &amp; Wolak, J.

====2004====
In September 2006, [[ABC News]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com ABCnews.co.com]. Abcnews.go.com. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; reported on a survey prepared by [[I-Safe.Org]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://isafe.org Isafe.org]. Isafe.org. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This 2004 survey of 1,500 students between grades 4–8 reported:
* 42% of kids have been bullied while online. One in four have had it happen more than once.
* 35% of kids have been threatened online. Nearly one in five had had it happen more than once.
* 21% of kids have received mean or threatening e-mails or other messages.
* 58% of kids admit someone has said mean or hurtful things to them online. More than four out of ten say it has happened more than once.
* 58% have not told their parents or an adult about something mean or hurtful that happened to them online.

====2005====
The Youth Internet Safety Survey-2, conducted by the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the [[University of New Hampshire]] in 2005, found that 9% of the young people in the survey had experienced some form of harassment.&lt;ref name=ccrc&gt;Wolak, J., Mitchell, K.J., &amp; Finkelhor, D. (2006). Online Victimization of Youth: Five Years Later. Alexandria, VA: National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.&lt;/ref&gt; The survey was a nationally representative telephone survey of 1,500 youth 10–17 years old. One third reported feeling distressed by the incident, with distress being more likely for younger respondents and those who were the victims of aggressive harassment (including being telephoned, sent gifts, or visited at home by the harasser).&lt;ref name=ybarra&gt;Ybarra, M.L., Mitchell, K.J., Wolak, J., &amp; Finkelhor, D. Examining characteristics and associated distress related to Internet harassment: findings from the Second Youth Internet Safety Survey. Pediatrics. 2006 Oct;118(4):e1169-77&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to youth not harassed online, victims are more likely to have social problems. On the other hand, youth who harass others are more likely to have problems with rule breaking and aggression.&lt;ref name=ybarra2&gt;Ybarra, M.L. &amp; Mitchell, K.J. Prevalence and frequency of Internet harassment instigation: implications for adolescent health. J Adolesc Health. 2007 Aug;41(2):189-95&lt;/ref&gt; Significant overlap is seen&amp;nbsp;— youth who are harassed are significantly more likely to also harass others.

Hinduja and Patchin completed a study in the summer of 2005 of approximately 1,500 Internet-using adolescents and found that over one-third of youth reported being victimized online, and over 16% of respondents admitted to cyber-bullying others. While most of the instances of cyber-bullying involved relatively minor behavior (41% were disrespected, 19% were called names), over 12% were physically threatened and about 5% were scared for their safety. Notably, fewer than 15% of victims told an adult about the incident.&lt;ref name="patchin1"/&gt;

Additional research by Hinduja and Patchin in 2007&lt;ref name=patchin2&gt;Hinduja, S. &amp; Patchin, J. W. (2007). [http://www.haworthpress.com/store/ArticleAbstract.asp?ID=101357 Offline Consequences of Online Victimization: School Violence and Delinquency.] Journal of School Violence, 6(3), 89–112.&lt;/ref&gt; found that youth who report being victims of cyber-bullying also experience stress or strain that is related to offline problem behaviors such as running away from home, cheating on a school test, skipping school, or using alcohol or marijuana. The authors acknowledge that both of these studies provide only preliminary information about the nature and consequences of online bullying, due to the methodological challenges associated with an online survey.

According to a 2005 survey by the [[Action for Children|National Children's Home]] charity and [[Tesco Mobile]]&lt;ref name=survey&gt;National Children's Home. (2005).[http://www.nch.org.uk/uploads/documents/Mobile_bullying_%20report.pdf Putting U in the picture. Mobile Bullying Survey 2005.](pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; of 770 youth between the ages of 11 and 19, 20% of respondents revealed that they had been bullied via electronic means. Almost three-quarters (73%) stated that they knew the bully, while 26% stated that the offender was a stranger. 10% of responders indicated that another person has taken a picture and/or video of them via a [[camera phone|cellular phone camera]], consequently making them feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, or threatened. Many youths are not comfortable telling an authority figure about their cyber-bullying [[victimization]] for fear their access to technology will be taken from them; while 24% and 14% told a parent or teacher respectively, 28% did not tell anyone while 41% told a friend.&lt;ref name=survey/&gt;

====2006====
A 2006 survey by Harris Interactive&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/technology/software-services-applications-internet-social/11579506-1.html Beating the cyberbullies; Targets of taunting need help turning the tables on tormentors], All Business, Cynthia G. Wagner, Sept 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; reported:
* 43% of U.S. teens having experienced some form of cyber-bullying in the past year.

====2007====
In 2007, Debbie Heimowitz, a [[Stanford University]] master's student, created [[Adina's Deck]], a film based on Stanford accredited research. She worked in focus groups for ten weeks in three schools to learn about the problem of cyber-bullying in Northern California. The findings determined that over 60% of students had been cyber-bullied and were victims of cyber-bullying. The film is now being used in classrooms nationwide as it was designed around learning goals pertaining to problems that students had understanding the topic. The middle school of [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]] is reportedly using the film as a solution to the crisis in their town.

====2008====
In the summer of 2008, researchers Sameer Hinduja ([[Florida Atlantic University]]) and Justin Patchin ([[University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire]]) published a book on cyber-bullying that summarized the current state of cyber-bullying research. (''Bullying Beyond the Schoolyard: Preventing and Responding to Cyberbullying'').&lt;ref name=patchin3&gt;{{cite book | last= Hinduja | first = S. | coauthors = Patchin, J. W. | title = Bullying beyond the schoolyard: Preventing and responding to cyberbullying | publisher=Corwin Press | year = 2009| location = Thousand Oaks, CA | isbn = 1412966892}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their research documents that cyber-bullying instances have been increasing over the last several years. They also report findings from the most recent study of cyber-bullying among middle-school students. Using a random sample of approximately 2000 middle-school students from a large school district in the southern United States, about 10% of respondents had been cyber-bullied in the previous 30 days while over 17% reported being cyber-bullied at least once in their lifetime.&lt;ref name="patchin3"/&gt; While these rates are slightly lower than some of the findings from their previous research, Hinduja and Patchin point out that the earlier studies were predominantly conducted among older adolescents and Internet samples. That is, older youth use the Internet more frequently and are more likely to experience cyber-bullying than younger children.&lt;ref name="patchin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=patchin1&gt;Hinduja, S. &amp; Patchin, J.

====2011====
[[File:Youth and Electronic aggression.gif|thumb|Distribution of cyberbullying venues used by young people in the US, according to the [[Centers for Disease Control]]]]
The National Crime Prevention Council reported in 2011 that cyber-bullying is a problem that affects almost half of all American teens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpc.org/cyberbullying NCPC.org]. NCPC.org. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to traditional bullying==
Certain characteristics inherent in online technologies increase the likelihood that they will be exploited for deviant purposes.&lt;ref name="patchin"/&gt; Unlike physical bullying, electronic bullies can remain virtually anonymous using temporary email accounts, pseudonyms in chat rooms, instant messaging programs, cell-phone text messaging, and other Internet venues to mask their identity; this perhaps frees them from normative and social constraints on their behavior.

Additionally, electronic forums often lack supervision. While chat hosts regularly observe the dialog in some chat rooms in an effort to police conversations and evict offensive individuals, personal messages sent between users (such as electronic mail or text messages) are viewable only by the sender and the recipient, thereby outside the regulatory reach of such authorities. In addition, when teenagers know more about computers and cellular phones than their parents or guardians, they are therefore able to operate the technologies without concern that a parent will discover their experience with bullying (whether as a victim or offender).

Another factor is the inseparability of a cellular phone from its owner, making that person a perpetual target for victimization. Users often need to keep their phone turned on for legitimate purposes, which provides the opportunity for those with malicious intentions to engage in persistent unwelcome behavior such as harassing telephone calls or threatening and insulting statements via the cellular phone’s text messaging capabilities. Cyberbullying thus penetrates the walls of a home, traditionally a place where victims could seek refuge from other forms of bullying. Compounding this infiltration into the home life of the cyberbully victim is the unique way in which the internet can "create simultaneous sensations of exposure (the whole world is watching) and alienation (no one understands)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puar|first=Jasbir|title=Ecologies of Sex, Sensation, and Slow Death|url=http://www.socialtextjournal.org/periscope/2010/11/ecologies-of-sex-sensation-and-slow-death.php|work=Periscope|publisher=Social Text|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For youth who experience shame or self-hatred, this effect is dangerous because it can lead to extreme self isolation.

Moreover, bullies can gang up on their victims on electronic pages more efficiently than they do in traditional bullying, since there is no limit to the number of people who can join in, following a bullying statement.&lt;ref name="konsiderit"&gt;[http://konsiderit.blogspot.com/2011/02/bullies-versus-victims-war-with-words.html Bullies versus Victims: War with Words]. Konsiderit.blogspot.com (February 5, 2011). Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

One possible advantage for victims of cyberbullying over traditional bullying is that they may sometimes be able to avoid it simply by avoiding the site/chat room in question. Email addresses and phone numbers can be changed; in addition, most e-mail accounts now offer services that will automatically filter out messages from certain senders before they even reach the inbox, and phones offer similar caller ID functions.

However, this does not protect against all forms of cyberbullying; publishing of defamatory material about a person on the internet is extremely difficult to prevent and once it is posted, millions of people can potentially download it before it is removed. Some perpetrators may post victims' photos, or victims' edited photos like defaming captions or pasting victims' faces on nude bodies. Examples of famous forums for disclosing personal data or photos to "punish" the "enemies" include the [[Hong Kong Golden Forum]], [[Live Journal]], and more recently [[JuicyCampus]]. Despite policies that describe cyberbullying as a violation of the terms of service, many social networking Web sites have been used to that end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=4X0TWRLMFJITYQSNDLRSKHSCJUNN2JVN?articleID=200001167&amp;cid=tab_art_sec#community Cyberbullying Common, More So At Facebook And MySpace] by Thomas Claburn, Information week; June 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation against cyberbullying==
{{Main|Cyberstalking legislation}}

===United States===
Legislation geared at penalizing cyberbullying has been introduced in a number of U.S. states including New York, Missouri, Rhode Island and Maryland. At least seven states passed laws against digital harassment in 2007. Dardenne Prairie of Springfield, Missouri, passed a city ordinance making online harassment a misdemeanor. The city of St. Charles, Missouri has passed a similar ordinance. Missouri is among other states where lawmakers are pursuing state legislation, with a task forces expected to have “cyberbullying” laws drafted and implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantagraph.com/articles/2007/12/20/news/doc476b40995b5d1039247289.txt Bill targets adults who cyberbully] Pantagraph, by Kevin Mcdermott, December 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In June, 2008, Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) and Rep. Kenny Hulshof (R-Mo.) proposed a federal law that would criminalize acts of cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9962375-7.html A rallying cry against cyberbullying]. CNET News, by Stefanie Olsen, June 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawmakers are seeking to address cyberbullying with new legislation because there's currently no specific law on the books that deals with it. A fairly new federal cyberstalking law might address such acts, according to [[Parry Aftab]], but no one has been prosecuted under it yet. The proposed federal law would make it illegal to use electronic means to "coerce, intimidate, harass or cause other substantial emotional distress."

In August 2008, the California state legislature passed one of the first laws in the country to deal directly with cyberbullying. The legislation, [http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_0051-0100/ab_86_cfa_20080115_125502_asm_comm.html Assembly Bill 86 2008], gives school administrators the authority to discipline students for bullying others offline or online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/teachers/learning.now/2008/08/ca_legislation_criminalizes_ca.html PBS Teachers]. Pbs.org. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This law took effect, January 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/31/AR2008123103067.html|title=States Passing Laws to Combat Cyber-Bullying&amp;nbsp;— washingtonpost.com|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 2, 2009|last=Surdin|first=Ashley | date=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent ruling first seen in the UK determined that it is possible for an [[Internet Service Provider]] (ISP) to be liable for the content of sites which it hosts, setting a precedent that any ISP should treat a notice of complaint seriously and investigate it immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-5624 International IT and e-commerce legal info].

==Harmful effects==
Research had demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization.&lt;ref name="patchin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=patchin3&gt;Hinduja, S. &amp; Patchin, J. W. (2009). ''Bullying beyond the schoolyard: Preventing and responding to cyberbullying''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin2"/&gt; For example, victims have lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and a variety of emotional responses, retaliating, being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed.&lt;ref name="patchin3"/&gt;

One of the most damaging effects is that a victim begins to avoid friends and activities, often the very intention of the cyber-bully.

Cyberbullying campaigns are sometimes so damaging that victims have committed suicide. There are at least four examples in the United States where cyber-bullying has been linked to the suicide of a teenager.&lt;ref name="patchin3"/&gt; The [[suicide of Megan Meier]] is a recent example that led to the conviction of the adult perpetrator of the attacks.

===Intimidation, emotional damage, suicide===
According to the Cyberbullying Research Center, "there have been several high‐profile cases involving teenagers taking their own lives in part because of being harassed and mistreated over the Internet, a phenomenon we have termed cyberbullicide – suicide indirectly or directly influenced by experiences with online aggression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hinduja|first=Sameer|coauthors=Justin W. Patchin|title=Cyberbullying Research Summary|journal=Archives of Suicide Research|year=2009|url=http://www.cyberbullying.us|accessdate=04/25/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reluctance youth have in telling an authority figure about instances of cyberbullying has led to fatal outcomes. At least three children between the ages of 12 and 13 have committed suicide due to depression brought on by cyberbullying, according to reports by USA Today and the Baltimore Examiner. These would include the [[suicide of Ryan Halligan]] and the [[suicide of Megan Meier]], the latter of which resulted in [[United States v. Lori Drew]].

===Lost revenue, threatened earnings, defamation===
Studies are being conducted by large companies to gauge loss of revenue through malicious false postings. Cyberstalkers seek to damage their victim's earnings, employment, reputation, or safety. A 2008 High Court ruling determined that, generally speaking, [[defamation|slander]] is when a defamatory statement has been made orally without justification. Libelous statements are those that are recorded with some degree of permanence. This would include statements made by email or on online bulletin boards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/page-5624 Defamation on the internet]. Out-law.com. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adults and the workplace==
Cyberbullying is not limited to personal attacks or children. Cyberharassment, referred to as cyberstalking when involving adults, takes place in the workplace or on company web sites, blogs or product reviews.

A survey of 1,072 workers by the Dignity and Work Partnership found that one in five had been bullied at work by e-mail and research has revealed 1 in 10 UK employees believes cyberbullying is a problem in their workplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2007/07/26/41707/one+in+10+workers+experiences+cyber-bullying+in+the+workplace.html One in 10 workers experiences cyberbullying in the workplace] July 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can occur in product reviews along with other consumer-generated data are being more closely monitored and flagged for content that is deemed malicious and biased as these sites have become tools to cyberbully by way of malicious requests for deletion of articles, [[vandalism]], abuse of administrative positions, and ganging up on products to post "false" reviews and vote products down.

Cyberstalkers use posts, forums, journals and other online means to present a victim in a false and unflattering light. The question of liability for harassment and character assassination is particularly salient to legislative protection since the original authors of the offending material are, more often than not, not only anonymous, but untraceable. Nevertheless, abuse should be consistently brought to company staffers' attention.

===Recognition of adult and workplace cyberbullying tactics===
Common tactics used by cyberstalkers is to vandalize a search engine or encyclopedia, to threaten a victim's earnings, employment, reputation, or safety. Various companies provide cases of cyber-stalking (involving adults) follow the pattern of repeated actions against a target. While motives vary, whether romantic, a business conflict of interest, or personal dislike, the target is commonly someone whose life the stalker sees or senses elements lacking in his or her own life. Web-based products or services leveraged against cyberstalkers in the harassment or defamation of their victims.

The source of the defamation seems to come from four types of online information purveyors: Weblogs, industry forums or boards, and commercial Web sites. Studies reveal that while some motives are personal dislike, there is often direct economic motivation by the cyberstalker, including conflict of interest, and investigations reveal the responsible party is an affiliate or supplier of a competitor, or the competitor itself.

==Awareness campaigns==
===Spain===
There are multiple non-profit organizations that fight cyberbullying and cyberstalking. They advise victims, provide awareness campaigns, and report offenses to the police. These NGOs include the ''Protégeles'', ''PantallasAmigas'', ''[[Foundation Alia2]]'', the non-profit initiative ''Actúa Contra el Ciberacoso'', the National Communications Technology Institute (INTECO), the Agency of Internet quality, the ''Agencia Española de Protección de Datos'', the ''Oficina de Seguridad del Internauta'', the Spanish Internet users' Association, the Internauts' Association, and the Spanish Association of Mothers and Parents Internauts. The Government of [[Castile and León]] has also created a ''Plan de Prevención del Ciberacoso y Promoción de la Navegación Segura en Centro Escolares'', and the Government of the [[Canary Islands]] has created a portal on the phenomenon called ''Viveinternet''.

===United Kingdom===
Cyberbullying was the subject of a forum at the [[British House of Commons]] chaired by [[Tim Loughton]] and [[Louise Burfitt-Dons]] of [[Act Against Bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservativewomen.org.uk/article.asp?art_id=63&amp;forum=1 Conservative Women's Organisation :: News Article].

===United States===
In March 2007, the Advertising Council in the United States, in partnership with the National Crime Prevention Council, U.S. Department of Justice, and Crime Prevention Coalition of America, joined to announce the launch of a new [[public service advertising]] campaign designed to educate preteens and teens about how they can play a role in ending cyber-bullying.

A Pew Internet and American Life survey found that 33% of teens were subject to some sort of cyber-bullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberlawonline.com/cyberlawg/privacy/33-percent-of-teens-victims-of-cyberbullying.html Cyberlawonline.com]. Cyberlawonline.com. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

January 20, 2008 – the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s 2008 edition of ''[[Boy Scout Handbook|The Boy Scout Handbook]]'' addresses how to deal with online bullying. A new [[Ranks in the Boy Scouts of America#First Class|First Class]] rank requirements adds: "Describe the three things you should avoid doing related to use of the Internet.

January 31, 2008 – [[KTTV]] Fox 11 News based in Los Angeles put out a report about organized cyber-bullying on sites like [[Stickam]] by people who call themselves "[[Anonymous (group)|/b/rothas]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxla.com/myfox/pages/ContentDetail?contentId=5647826|publisher=Fox Television Stations, Inc.|title=FOX 11 Investigates: Cyber Bullies|accessdate=February 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site had put out report on July 26, 2007, about a subject that partly featured cyberbullying titled "hackers on steroids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxla.com/myfox/pages/ContentDetail?contentId=3894628|publisher=Fox Television Stations, Inc.|title=FOX 11 Investigates: 'Anonymous'|accessdate=August 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

June 2, 2008 – Parents, teens, teachers, and Internet executives came together at Wired Safety's International Stop Cyberbullying Conference, a two-day gathering in White Plains, New York and New York City. Executives from Facebook, [[Verizon]], MySpace, [[Microsoft]], and many others talked with hundreds about how to better protect themselves, personal reputations, kids and businesses online from harassment. Sponsors of the conference included [[McAfee]], [[AOL]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Girl Scouts of the USA]], WiredTrust, Children’s Safety Research and Innovation Centre, KidZui.com and others. This conference was being delivered in conjunction and with the support of Pace University. Topics addressed included cyberbullying and the law, with discussions about laws governing cyberbullying and how to distinguish between rudeness and criminal harassment. Additional forums addressed parents’ legal responsibilities, the need for more laws, how to handle violent postings of videos be handled, as well as the differentiation between free speech and hate speech. Cyberharassment vs. cyberbullying was a forefront topic, where age makes a difference and abusive internet behavior by adults with repeated clear intent to harm, ridicule or damage a person or business was classified as [[stalking]] harassment vs. bullying by teens and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiredsafety.org/conference/progams.html Stop Cyberbullying&amp;nbsp;— An International Conference to Address Cyberbullying, Solutions and Industry Best Practices] Wired Safety, Pace University Program, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community support==
A number organizations are in coalition to provide awareness, protection and recourse for the escalating problem. Some aim to inform and provide measures to avoid as well as effectively terminate cyber-bullying and cyber-harassment. Anti-bullying charity [[Act Against Bullying]] launched the CyberKind campaign in August 2009 to promote positive internet usage.

In 2007, YouTube introduced the first Anti-Bullying Channel for youth, (BeatBullying) engaging the assistance of celebrities to tackle the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7098978.stm YouTube tackles bullying online] BBC News, November 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, a 17 year old girl named Alexis Skye Pilkington was found dead in her room by her parents. Her parents claimed that after repeated cyber-bullying she was driven to suicide. Shortly after her death, attacks resumed. Members of an online website forum, referred to as "eBaums World", "Baums", and "EB", began [[Troll (Internet)|trolling]] teens' memorial pages on the social networking site Facebook. Comments included expressions of pleasure over the death, with pictures of what seemed to be a banana as their profile pictures. Family and friends of the deceased teen responded by creating Facebook groups denouncing cyber-bullying and trolling, with logos of bananas behind a red circle with a diagonal line through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salazar|first=Cristian|title=Alexis Pilkington Facebook Horror: Cyber Bullies Harass Teen Even After Suicide|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/alexis-pilkington-faceboo_n_512482.html|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=05/24/10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
