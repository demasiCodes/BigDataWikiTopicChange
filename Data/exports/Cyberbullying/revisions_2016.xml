There is much variability to the definitions of '''cyberbullying''', but according to P.Smith, Journal of child psychology and psychiatry {{citationneeded|date=November 2016}} cyberbullying can be defined as ‘an aggressive, intentional act carried out by a group or individual, using electronic forms of contact, repeatedly over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself’.

With the increased use of communication technology, cyberbullying has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cyberbullying: its nature and impact in secondary school pupils|journal=The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01846.x|volume=49|issue=4|pages=376–385|year=2008|last1=Smith|first1=Peter K.|last2=Mahdavi|first2=Jess|last3=Carvalho|first3=Manuel|last4=Fisher|first4=Sonja|last5=Russell|first5=Shanette|last6=Tippett|first6=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness has also risen, due in part to high-profile cases like the [[suicide of Tyler Clementi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legal Debate Swirls Over Charges in a Student's Suicide|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/nyregion/02suicide.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal definition ===
Cyberbullying is defined in legal glossaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Cyber-Bullying|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/cyber-bullying/|website=USLegal.com|publisher=US Legal, Inc.|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as
* actions that use information and communication technologies to support deliberate, repeated, and hostile behavior by an individual or group, that is intended to harm another or others.
* use of communication technologies for the intention of harming another person
* use of Internet service and mobile technologies such as web pages and discussion groups as well as instant messaging or [[SMS]] text messaging with the intention of harming another person.

Examples of what constitutes cyberbullying include communications that seek to [[intimidate]], control, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]], put down, [[False accusation|falsely discredit]], or [[humiliate]] the recipient.  The actions are deliberate, repeated, and hostile behavior intended to harm another.  Cyberbullying has been defined by the [[National Crime Prevention Council]]: "When the Internet, cell phones or other devices are used to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person."&lt;ref name="definitions.uslegal.com"&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/cyber-bullying/ Cyberbullying – Law and Legal Definitions] US Legal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legaldefinitions.co/cyber-bullying.html Cyber-bullying Definition] Legal Definitions&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers use similar language to describe the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=patchin&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patchin | first1 = J.

Patchin and S. Hinuja; Sage Publications, (Corwin Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A cyberbully may or may not know their target.  A cyberbully may be anonymous and may solicit involvement of other people online who do not know the target. This is known as a "digital pile-on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberslammed|url=http://www.cyberslammed.com/where-to-start.html|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyberstalking ===
{{further information|Cyberstalking}}
The practice of cyberbullying is not limited to children and, while the behavior is identified by the same definition when practiced by adults, the distinction in age groups sometimes refers to the abuse as [[cyberstalking]] or [[cyberharassment]] when perpetrated by adults toward adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DU law student charged with cyber stalking|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/DU-law-student-charged-with-cyber-stalking/articleshow/8917937.cms?|newspaper=THE TIMES OF INDIA|date=Jun 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common tactics used by cyberstalkers are performed in public forums, social media or online information sites and are intended to threaten a victim's earnings, employment, reputation, or safety. Behaviors may include encouraging others to harass the victim and trying to affect a victim's online participation. Many cyberstalkers try to damage the reputation of their victim and turn other people against them.

Cyberstalking may include [[false accusations]], monitoring, making threats, identity theft, damage to data or equipment, the solicitation of minors for sex, or gathering information in order to harass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stalking and Cyber Stalking |url=http://www.uh.edu/wrc/StalkingandCyber-Stalking.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903084201/http://www.uh.edu/wrc/StalkingandCyber-Stalking.html |archivedate=September 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A repeated pattern of such actions and [[harassment]] against a target by an adult constitutes cyberstalking. Cyberstalking often features linked patterns of online and offline behavior. There are consequences of law in offline stalking and online stalking, and cyberstalkers can be put in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/01/ucf-cyber-stalkers-sentence-not-harsh-enough-victim-says/ |title=UCF Cyber Stalker’s Sentence Not Harsh Enough, Victim Says|publisher=ABC News|date=January 23, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberstalking is a form of cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = State Cyberstalking and cyber Harrassment rules|url = |date = January 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIFFERENT FORMS OF CYBER BULLYING|url=http://www.headspace.org.au/media/41514/ed%202.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412093243/http://www.headspace.org.au/media/41514/ed%202.pdf |archivedate=April 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trolling ===
[[Internet troll|Trolls]] and cyberbullies do not always have the same goals. Some Internet trolls do engage in cyberbullying (including harassment, defamation, or spreading of information which would otherwise be concealed), but other trolls may be engaged in comparatively harmless mischief. There is disagreement over what the precise definition of Internet trolling is. On the other hand, cyberbullying exclusively involves actions intended to harass. Early (1990s) definitions of 'trolling' primarily consisted of low-level disruption of discussions, for instance by posting meaningless questions for their own amusement, without any regard over whether the targets are hurt. Current (2010s) definitions of trolling are more broad, and include those who cyberbully, with the explicit desire to demean and hurt their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/what-an-academic-who-wrote-her-dissertation-on-trolls-thinks-of-violentacrez/263631/|title = What an Academic Who Wrote Her Dissertation on Trolls Thinks of Violentacrez|date = October 15, 2012|accessdate = |website = The Atlantic|publisher = |last = Phillips|first = Whitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What is Cyberbullying|url = http://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it/index.html|website = www.stopbullying.gov|date = 2012-03-07|accessdate = 2015-11-25|language = en-us|last = ASPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional bullying ===
Certain characteristics inherent in online technologies increase the likelihood that they will be exploited for deviant purposes.&lt;ref name="patchin" /&gt; Unlike physical [[bullying]], electronic bullies can remain virtually anonymous using temporary email accounts, pseudonyms in chat rooms, instant messaging programs, cell-phone text messaging, and other Internet venues to mask their identity; this perhaps frees them from normative and social constraints on their behavior. Professor Mona O‘ Moore describes cyber bullying as an extension of traditional bullying with technology providing the perpetrator with another way to abuse their target.  (Oireachtas, 2013, p. 17)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/Report-on-Social-Media-July-2013-Website.pdf|title=TITHE AN OIREACHTAS AN COMHCHOISTE UM IOMPAR AGUS CUMARSÁID Tuarascáil Faoi aghaidh a thabhairt ar fhás na Meán Sóisialta agus faoi dhul i ngleic le Cibearbhulaíocht HOUSES OF THE OIREACHTAS JOINT COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS report Addressin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, Tokunaga (2009) makes the argument, that students who would not normally engage in bullying, feel more secure bullying on-line due to easy accessibility. (Oireachtas, 2013, p. 16)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/media/Report-on-Social-Media-July-2013-Website.pdf|title=TITHE AN OIREACHTAS AN COMHCHOISTE UM IOMPAR AGUS CUMARSÁID Tuarascáil Faoi aghaidh a thabhairt ar fhás na Meán Sóisialta agus faoi dhul i ngleic le Cibearbhulaíocht HOUSES OF THE OIREACHTAS JOINT COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS report Addressin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, electronic forums often lack supervision. While chat hosts regularly observe the dialog in some chat rooms in an effort to police conversations and evict offensive individuals, personal messages sent between users (such as electronic mail or text messages) are viewable only by the sender and the recipient, thereby falling outside the regulatory reach of such authorities. In addition, when teenagers know more about computers and cellular phones than their parents or guardians, they are therefore able to operate the technologies without concern that a parent will discover their experience with bullying (whether as a victim or offender).

Another factor is the inseparability of a cellular phone from its owner, making that person a perpetual target for [[victimization]]. Users often need to keep their phone turned on for legitimate purposes, which provides the opportunity for those with malicious intentions to engage in persistent unwelcome behavior such as harassing telephone calls or threatening and insulting statements via the cellular phone’s text messaging capabilities. Cyberbullying thus penetrates the walls of a home, traditionally a place where victims could seek refuge from other forms of bullying. Compounding this infiltration into the home life of the cyberbully victim is the unique way in which the internet can "create simultaneous sensations of exposure (the whole world is watching) and alienation (no one understands)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puar|first=Jasbir|title=Ecologies of Sex, Sensation, and Slow Death|url=http://socialtextjournal.org/periscope_article/ecologies_of_sex_sensation_and_slow_death/|work=Periscope|publisher=Social Text|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For youth who experience shame or self-hatred, this effect is dangerous because it can lead to extreme self-isolation.

One possible advantage for victims of cyberbullying over traditional bullying is that they may sometimes be able to avoid it simply by avoiding the site/chat room in question. Email addresses and phone numbers can be changed; in addition, most email accounts now offer services that will automatically filter out messages from certain senders before they even reach the inbox, and phones offer similar caller ID functions.

However, this does not protect against all forms of cyberbullying. Publishing of defamatory material about a person on the internet is extremely difficult to prevent and once it is posted, many people or archiving services can potentially download and copy it, at which point it is almost impossible to remove from the Internet. Some perpetrators may post victims' photos, or victims' edited photos featuring defaming captions or pasting victims' faces on nude bodies. Examples of famous forums for disclosing personal data or photos to "punish" the "enemies" include the [[Hong Kong Golden Forum]], [[Livejournal]], and more recently [[JuicyCampus]]. Despite policies that describe cyberbullying as a violation of the terms of service, many social networking Web sites have been used to that end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=4X0TWRLMFJITYQSNDLRSKHSCJUNN2JVN?articleID=200001167&amp;cid=tab_art_sec#community Cyberbullying Common, More So At Facebook And MySpace] by Thomas Claburn, Information week; June 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying is sometimes used by the targets of bullying to retaliate against their bullies, since factors such as anonymity, absence of the bully's supporting friends, and irrelevancy of physical strength in the online environment, make it safer to counterattack the bully by that means. Nancy E. Willard notes in ''Cyberbullying and Cyberthreats'', "Unfortunately, students who retaliate against bullies online can be mistakenly perceived as the source of the problem. This can be especially true under circumstances where the original victimization left no tangible evidence, but the cyberbullying did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cyberbullying and Cyberthreats|author=Willard, Nancy E.|publisher=Research Press|edition=2nd|date=18 January 2007|isbn=0-87822-537-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Danah Boyd writes, "those who subscribe to Olweus’ definition view bullying as a practice in which someone of differential physical or social power subjects another person to repeated psychological, physical, or social aggression."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, D. (2014). Bullying is social media amplifying meanness and cruelty? In It's Complicated the social lives of networked teens (p. 131). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Olweus’ definition is accepted, there are others who believe that the media does not categorize events appropriately. For example, "news media has taken to describing serious criminal acts of aggression by teens as bullying rather than using terms like stalking, harassment, or abuse. Ironically, teens often use the term bullying to refer to the kinds of incidents that Olweus described while adults and news media use this term far more loosely."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, D. (2014). Bullying is social media amplifying meanness and cruelty? In It's Complicated the social lives of networked teens (p. 132). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuals to educate the public, teachers and parents summarize, "Cyberbullying is being cruel to others by sending or posting harmful material using a cell phone or the internet." Research, legislation and education in the field are ongoing. Basic definitions and guidelines to help recognize and cope with what is regarded as abuse of electronic communications have been identified.
* Cyberbullying involves repeated behavior with intent to harm.
* Cyberbullying is perpetrated through [[harassment]], [[cyberstalking]], denigration (sending or posting cruel rumors and falsehoods to damage reputation and friendships), [[impersonation]], and exclusion (intentionally and cruelly excluding someone from an online group)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110410181159/http://csriu.org/cyberbully/docs/cbcteducator.pdf ''An Educator's Guide to Cyberbullying''] Brown Senate.gov, archived from [http://www.csriu.org/cyberbully/docs/cbcteducator.pdf the original] on 10 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can be as simple as continuing to send emails or text messages harassing someone who has said they want no further contact with the sender.  It may also include public actions such as repeated [[threat]]s, sexual remarks, pejorative labels (i.e., [[hate speech]]) or defamatory false accusations, ganging up on a victim by making the person the subject of ridicule in online forums, hacking into or vandalizing sites about a person, and posting false statements as fact aimed a discrediting or humiliating a targeted person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defining a Cyberbully|url=http://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=121847|publisher=The National Science Foundation|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyberbullying could be limited to posting rumors about a person on the internet with the intention of bringing about hatred in others' minds or convincing others to dislike or participate in online denigration of a target. It may go to the extent of personally identifying victims of crime and publishing materials severely defaming or humiliating them.&lt;ref name="definitions.uslegal.com" /&gt;

Cyberbullies may disclose victims' personal data (e.g. real name, home address, or workplace/schools) at websites or forums or may use [[impersonation]], creating fake accounts, comments or sites posing as their target for the purpose of publishing material in their name that defames, discredits or ridicules them. This can leave the cyberbully anonymous which can make it difficult for the offender to be caught or punished for their behavior, although not all cyberbullies maintain their anonymity. Text or instant messages and emails between friends can also constitute cyberbullying if what is said or displayed is hurtful to the participants.

[[File:Email final.jpg|thumb|Cyberbullying by [[email]] from a fictional friend@[[hotmail.com]]]]
The recent use of mobile applications and rise of smartphones have yielded to a more accessible form of cyberbullying. It is expected that cyberbullying via these platforms will be associated with bullying via mobile phones to a greater extent than exclusively through other more stationary internet platforms. In addition, the combination of cameras and Internet access and the instant availability of these modern smartphone technologies yield themselves to specific types of cyberbullying not found in other platforms. It is likely that those cyberbullied via mobile devices will experience a wider range of cyberbullying types than those exclusively bullied elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Görzig|first=Anke|author2=Lara A. Frumkin|title=Cyberbullying experiences on-the-go: When social media can become distressing|journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace|year=2013|url=http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2013022801&amp;article=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most cases are considered to be cyberbullying, some teens argue that most events are simply drama. For example, Danah Boyd writes, "teens regularly used that word [drama] to describe various forms of interpersonal conflict that ranged from insignificant joking around to serious jealousy-driven relational aggression. Whereas adults might have labeled many of these practices as bullying, teens saw them as drama."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, D. (2014). Bullying is social media amplifying meanness and cruelty? In It's Complicated the social lives of networked teens (p. 137). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Drama among teens has existed for years but now that it is easier to share information through social media, it seems that simple drama gets out of control.

=== In social media ===
Cyberbullying can take place on social media sites such as Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter. "By 2008, 93% of young people between the ages of 12 and 17 were online. In fact, youth spend more time with media than any single other activity besides sleeping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/millennials/teen-internet-use-graphic/ |title=Teen and Young Adult Internet Use |work=Pew Internet Project |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many risks attached to social media sites, and cyberbullying is one of the larger risks. One million children were harassed, threatened or subjected to other forms of cyberbullying on Facebook during the past year, while 90 percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed online cruelty say they have ignored mean behavior on social media, and 35 percent have done this frequently. 95 percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed cruel behavior on social networking sites say they have seen others ignoring the mean behavior, and 55 percent witness this frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internetsafety101.org/cyberbullyingstatistics.htm |title=Cyberbullying Statistics |work=Internet Safety 101 |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 Pew Research study, eight out of 10 teens who use social media share more information about themselves than they have in the past. This includes location, images, and contact information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The most recent case of cyber-bullying and illegal activity on Facebook involved a memorial page for the young boys who lost their lives to suicide due to anti-gay bullying. The page quickly turned into a virtual grave desecration and platform condoning gay teen suicide and the murdering of homosexuals. Photos were posted of executed homosexuals, desecrated photos of the boys who died and supposed snuff photos of gays who have been murdered. Along with this were thousands of comments encouraging murder sprees against gays, encouragement of gay teen suicide, death threats etc. In addition, the page continually exhibited pornography to minors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kalli Amorphous |title=Demand For Facebook's Response To Cyber-Bullying On Their Pages |work=Change.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to protect children, it’s important that personal information such as age, birthday, school/church, phone number, etc. be kept confidential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highya.com/articles-guides/stranger-danger-protecting-your-children-from-cyber-bullying-sexting-and-social-media |title=Stranger Danger: Protecting Your Children from Cyber Bullying, Sexting, &amp; Social Media |accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can also take place through the use of websites belonging to certain groups to effectively request the targeting of another individual or group. An example of this is the [[#Bullying of climate scientists and activists|bullying of climate scientists and activists]].&lt;ref name=scientificamerican-climate /&gt;&lt;ref name=timemag-climate /&gt;&lt;ref name=latrobe-climate /&gt;

=== In gaming ===
{{See also|Gamergate controversy}}

Of those who reported having experienced online harassment in a Pew Research poll, 16% said the most recent incident occurred in an online game.&lt;ref name="pewFiveFacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/30/5-facts-about-online-harassment/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=5 facts about online harassment}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study from National Sun Yat-sen University observed that children who enjoyed violent video games were significantly more likely to both experience and perpetrate cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paths to Bullying in Online Gaming: The Effects of Gender, Preference for Playing Violent Games, Hostility, and Aggressive Behavior on Bullying|doi=10.2190/ec.47.3.a|publisher=National Sun Yat-sen University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaming was a more common venue for men to experience harassment, whereas women's' harassment tended to occur via social media.&lt;ref name="washpoPewGamergate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/10/23/gamergate-and-how-internet-users-think-about-gaming-and-harassment/|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|work=The Washington Post|title=Gamergate and how Internet users think about gaming and harassment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most respondents considered gaming culture to be equally welcoming to both genders, though 44% thought it favored men.&lt;ref name="nprPewLeastWelcoming"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/10/22/357826882/pew-gaming-is-least-welcoming-online-space-for-women|last=Hu|first=Elise|publisher=NPR|work=All Tech Considered|title=Pew: Gaming Is Least Welcoming Online Space For Women}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keza MacDonald writes in [[The Guardian]] that [[sexism in gaming|sexism exists in gaming culture]], but is not mainstream within it.&lt;ref name="guardianReallySexist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/mar/06/are-gamers-really-sexist|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=MacDonald|first=Keza|title=Are gamers really sexist?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual harassment in gaming generally involves slurs directed towards women, sex role stereotyping, and overaggressive language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gender Stereotypes, Aggression, and Computer Games: An Online Survey of Women|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=7|issue=6|page=714|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/cpb.2004.7.714|publisher=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|doi=10.1089/cpb.2004.7.714|year=2004|last1=Norris|first1=Kamala O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] made reference to harassment of women gamers during remarks in honor of Women's History Month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/16/remarks-president-reception-honor-womens-history-month|title=Remarks by the President at Reception in Honor of Women's History Month|date=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In search engines ===
[[Information cascade]]s happen when users start passing on information they assume to be true, but cannot know to be true, based on information on what other users are doing. Information cascades can be accelerated by search engines' ranking technologies and their [[personalized search|tendency to return results relevant to a user's previous interests]]. This type of information spreading is hard to stop. Information cascades over social media and the Internet may also be harmless, and may contain truthful information.&lt;ref name=citron-hatecrimes /&gt;

Bullies use [[Google bomb]]s (a term applicable to any search engine){{citation needed|date=June 2016}} to increase the eminence of favored posts sorted by the most popular searches, done by linking to those posts from as many other web pages as possible. Examples include the [[Campaign for "santorum" neologism|Santorum campaign]] organized by the [[LGBT]] lobby. Google bombs can manipulate the Internet's search engines regardless of how authentic the pages are, but there is a way to counteract this type of manipulation as well.&lt;ref name=citron-hatecrimes&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hate Crimes in Cyberspace|last = Citron|first = Danielle|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2014 |location = Cambridge, Mass., USA &amp; London, UK|url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wmiABAAAQBAJ |isbn=978-0-674-36829-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law enforcement ==
A majority of states have laws that explicitly include electronic forms of communication within stalking or harassment laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gregorie|first1=Trudy|title=Cyberstalking: dangers on the information superhighway|url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/docs/src/cyberstalking---dangers-on-the-information-superhighway.pdf?sfvrsn=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx|title=Cyberstalking, cyberharassment and cyberbullying|website=NCSL National Conference of State Legislatures|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906024827/http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/cyberstalking-and-cyberharassment-laws.aspx|archive-date=September 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.61.260 Cyberstalking] Washington State Legislature&lt;/ref&gt;

Most law enforcement agencies have cyber-crime units and often Internet stalking is treated with more seriousness than reports of physical stalking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Back Off, Bully!|url = |last = Bailey|first = Melissa|date = May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Cyberstalking?|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/people/engl/blackmon/101cresources/cyberstalking.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227054307/http://www.cla.purdue.edu/people/engl/blackmon/101cresources/cyberstalking.htm|archivedate=2014-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Help and resources can be searched by state or area.

=== Schools ===
The safety of schools is increasingly becoming a focus of state legislative action. There was an increase in cyberbullying enacted legislation between 2006–2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/educ/cyberbullying.aspx Cyberbullying Enacted Legislation: 2006–2010] Legislation by State, NCSL&lt;/ref&gt; Initiatives and curriclulum requirements also exist in the UK (the Ofsted eSafety guidance) and Australia (Overarching Learning Outcome 13).

In 2012, a group of teens in New Haven, Connecticut developed an app to help fight bullying. Called "Back Off Bully" (BOB), the web app is an anonymous resource for computer, smart phone or iPad. When someone witnesses or is the victim of bullying, they can immediately report the incident. The app asks questions about time, location and how the bullying is happening. As well as providing positive action and empowerment over an incident, the reported information helps by going to a data base where administrators study it. Common threads are spotted so others can intervene and break the bully's pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/south/12007792580056/ct-teens-develop-bullying-app-to-protect-peers/ CT teens develop bullying app to protect peers] 7 News; June 2012 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622100810/http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/south/12007792580056/ct-teens-develop-bullying-app-to-protect-peers/ |date=June 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BOB, the brainchild of fourteen teens in a design class, is being considered as standard operating procedure at schools across the state.

=== Protection ===
There are laws that only address online harassment of children or focus on child predators as well as laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims, or victims of any age. Currently, there are 45 cyberstalking (and related) laws on the books.

While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age 18 and under, Working to Halt Online Abuse is a help resource containing a list of current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haltabuse.org/resources/laws/index.shtml Current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws] WHOA&lt;/ref&gt; It also lists those states that do not have laws yet and related laws from other countries. The Global Cyber Law Database (GCLD) aims to become the most comprehensive and authoritative source of cyber laws for all countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberlawdb.com/main/ The Global Cyber Law Database] GCLD&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Age ===
Children report negative online behaviors occurring from the second grade. According to research, boys initiate negative online activity earlier than girls do. However, by middle school, girls are more likely to engage in cyberbullying than boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacDonald|first1=Gregg|title=Cyber-bullying defies traditional stereotype: Girls are more likely than boys to engage in this new trend, research suggests|work=Fairfax Times|date=September 1, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526084157/http://ww2.fairfaxtimes.com/cms/story.php?id=2078 |url=http://www.fairfaxtimes.com/cms/story.php?id=2078|archivedate=May 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the bully is male or female, his or her purpose is to intentionally embarrass others, harass, intimidate, or make threats online to one another. This bullying occurs via email, text messaging, posts to blogs, and web sites.

The 8 most common cyberbullying tactics used by teens are listed below:

# Exclusion: Teenagers intentionally exclude others from an online group.
# Cyberstalking: Teens will harass others by constantly sending emails, messages, or tagging others in posts they don’t want to be tagged in.
# Gossip: Post or send cruel messages that damage another’s reputation, relationships, or confidence.
# Outing/Trickery: Trick another teen into revealing secrets or embarrassing information which the cyberbully will then share online.
# Harassment: Post or send offensive, insulting, and mean messages repeatedly.
# Impersonation: Create fake accounts to exploit another teen’s trust. They may also hack into an account and post or send messages that are damaging to the person’s reputation or relationships.
# Cyber Threats: Threaten or imply violent behavior toward others to make them feel uncomfortable.
# Flaming: Fights online that involve hateful or offensive messages that may be posted to various websites, forums, or blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawhide.org/blog/wellness/teen-cyberbullying-and-social-media-use-on-the-rise/ |title=Teen Cyberbullying and Social Media Use on the Rise |publisher=Rawhide |date=2015-10-26 |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in the psychosocial effects of cyberspace have begun to monitor the impacts cyberbullying may have on the victims, and the consequences it may lead to. Consequences of cyberbullying are multi-faceted, and affect online and offline behavior.  Research on adolescents reported that changes in the victims' behavior as a result of cyberbullying could be positive. Victims "created a cognitive pattern of bullies, which consequently helped them to recognize aggressive people."&lt;ref name="cyberpsychology.eu"&gt;[http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2011121901&amp;article=4 Cyberbullying in Adolescent Victims: Perception and Coping] Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace abstract reports critical impacts in almost all of the respondents’, taking the form of lower self-esteem, loneliness, disillusionment, and distrust of people. The more extreme impacts were self-harm. Children have killed each other and committed suicide after having been involved in a cyberbullying incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopcyberbullying.org/what_is_cyberbullying_exactly.html |title=Stop Cyberbullying |publisher=Stop Cyberbullying |date=2005-06-27 |accessdate=2013-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most current research in the field defines cyberbullying as "an aggressive, intentional act or behaviour that is carried out by a group or an individual repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself" (Smith &amp; Slonje, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;249).&lt;ref name="cyberpsychology.eu" /&gt; Though the use of sexual remarks and threats are sometimes present in cyberbullying, it is not the same as sexual harassment, typically occurs among peers, and does not necessarily involve [[sexual predators]].

Some cases of digital [[self-harm]] have been reported, where an individual engages in cyberbullying against themselves, or purposefully and knowingly exposes themselves to cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|title=Cyberbullying on social networks spawning form of self-harm|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/06/cyberbullying-social-networks-self-harm|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Englander|first=Elizabeth|title=Digital Self-Harm: Frequency, Type, Motivations, and Outcomes|journal=MARC Research Reports|date=June 2012|volume=5|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/marc_reports/5|publisher=Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center, Bridgewater State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adults ===
Stalking online has criminal consequences just as physical stalking. A target's understanding of why cyberstalking is happening is helpful to remedy and take protective action to restore remedy. Cyberstalking is an extension of physical stalking.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.education.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/australian_covert_bullying_prevalence_study_chapter_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Among factors that motivate stalkers are: [[envy]], pathological obsession (professional or sexual), unemployment or failure with own job or life; intention to intimidate and cause others to feel inferior; the stalker is [[delusional]] and believes he/she "knows" the target; the stalker wants to instill fear in a person to justify his/her status; belief they can get away with it (anonymity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213225600/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/psychology/cyberstalking/3.htmlCyber-Stalking:|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|date=December 13, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK National Workplace Bullying Advice Line theorizes that bullies harass victims in order to make up for inadequacies in their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;Hasebrink, U., Livingstone, S., Haddon, L., &amp; Ólafsson, K.

The US federal cyberstalking law is designed to prosecute people for using electronic means to repeatedly harass or threaten someone online. There are resources dedicated to assisting adult victims deal with cyberbullies legally and effectively. One of the steps recommended is to record everything and contact police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiredsafety.org/subjects/cyberbullying.php Cyberbullying] Stalking and Harassment&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.yahoo.com/what-cyberbullies-adults-11081994.html What to Do About Cyberbullies: For Adults], by Rena Sherwood; YAHOO Contributor network&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

=== Australia ===
The nationwide Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Survey (Cross et al., 2009)&lt;ref name="ACBPS"&gt;[http://www.deewr.gov.au/Schooling/NationalSafeSchools/Pages/research.aspx Cross, D., Shaw, T., Hearn, L., Epstein, M., Monks, H., Lester, L., &amp; Thomas, L. 2009. Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Study (ACBPS). Child Health Promotion Research Centre, Edith Cowan University, Perth]. Deewr.gov.au. Retrieved on July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; assessed cyber-bullying experiences among 7,418 students. Rates of cyber-bullying increased with age, with 4.9% of students in Year 4 reporting cyberbullying compared to 7.9% in year nine. Cross et al., (2009) reported that rates of bullying and harassing others were lower, but also increased with age. Only 1.2% of Year 4 students reported cyber-bullying others compared to 5.6% of Year 9 students.

=== China ===
A study investigated&lt;ref&gt;Fung, Annis L. C. "The Phenomenon Of Cyberbullying: Its Aetiology And Intervention." ''Journal Of Youth Studies (10297847)'' 13.2 (2010): 31-42. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 28 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; cyberbullying in Hong Kong chose 48 people out of 7654 students from elementary school to high school who were classify as potential aggressors that related to cyberbullying. 31 out of 48 students declared they barely participate in cyber-attack. In is more general among high school students (28 out of 36 students) to participate in social media platform. These students took a survey about cyberbullying: 58% admitted they changed nickname for others, 56.3% for humiliation, 54.2% make fun of someone, 54.2% for spread out rumors. The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups had interviewed 1820 teenagers, 17.5% indicated the experience of cyberbully. For example: insult, coarse abuse, publishes personal private pictures with candid camera, and spread out in social media without permission.

=== European Union ===
Across Europe the average 6% of the children (9–16 years old) have been bullied and only 3% of them confessed to be a bully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/research/EUKidsOnline/EU%20Kids%20II%20(2009-11)/EUKidsOnlineIIReports/D5%20Patterns%20of%20risk.pdf|title = Patterns of risk and safety online.

However, in an earlier publication of Hasenbrink et al. (2009), reporting on the results from a meta analysis from European Union countries, the authors estimated (via median results) that approximately 18% of European young people had been "bullied/harassed/stalked" via the internet and mobile phones.&lt;ref name="Hasebrink"&gt;Hasebrink, U., Livingstone, S., Haddon, L. and Ólafsson, K.(2009) Comparing children’s online opportunities and risks across Europe: Cross-national comparisons for EU Kids Online.

The decreasing numbers can caused by developing increasingly specific methods, dividing the tasks into different variables.

=== Finland ===
In addition to the current research, Sourander et al. (2010) conducted a population-based cross-sectional study that took place in Finland. The authors of this study took the self-reports of 2215 Finish adolescents between the ages of 13 to 16 years old about cyberbullying and cybervictimization during the past 6 months. It was found that, amongst the total sample, 4.8% were cybervictims only, 7.4% were cyberbullies only, and 5.4% were cyberbully-victims. Cybervictim-only status was associated with a variety of factors, including emotional and peer problems, sleeping difficulties, and feeling unsafe in school. Cyberbully-only status was associated with factors such as hyperactivity and low prosocial behavior, as well as conduct problems. Cyberbully-victim status was associated with all of the risk factors that were associated with both cybervictim-only status and cyberbully-only status. The authors of this study were able to conclude that cyberbullying as well as cybervictimization is associated not only with psychiatric issues, but psychosomatic issues. Many adolescents in the study reported headaches or difficulty sleeping. The authors believe that their results indicate a greater need for new ideas on how to prevent cyberbullying and what to do when it occurs. It is clearly a world-wide problem that needs to be taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sourander, A. |author2=Klomek, A.B. |author3=Ikonen, M. |author4=Lindroos, J. |author5=Luntamo, T. |author6=Koskeiainen, M. |author7=Helenius, H. |title=Psychosocial risk factors associated with cyberbullying among adolescents: A population-based study|year=2010|work=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=67|issue=7 |number=7|pages=720–728|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/67/7/720|doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
According to recent research, in Japan, 17 percent (compared with a 25-country average of 37 percent) of youth between the ages of 8 and 17 have been victim to online bullying activities. The number shows that online bullying is a serious concern in Japan. Teenagers who spend more than 10 hours a week on Internet are more likely to become the target of online bullying. Only 28 percent of the survey participants understood what cyberbullying is. However, they do notice the severity of the issue since 63 percent of the surveyed worry about being targeted as victims of cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;Cross-Tab Marketing Services &amp; Telecommunications Research Group for Microsoft Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advance of Internet technology, everyone can access the internet. Since teenagers find themselves congregating socially on the internet via social media, they become easy targets for cyberbullying. Forms of social media where cyberbullying occurs include but are not limited to email, text, chat rooms, mobile phones, mobile phone cameras and social websites (Facebook, Twitter).  The ways a cyberbully potentially attacks a target include sending threatening email, online posting of targets' private contact information, sending numerous anonymous emails to the target to harass them, or talking about the target in chat rooms or text. Some cyberbullies even set up websites or blogs to post the target’s images, publicize their personal information, gossip about the target, express why they hate the target, request people to agree with the bully’s view, and sending links to the target to make sure they are watching the activity.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Marilyn A. (2005). Cyber bullying: An old problem in a new guise?&lt;/ref&gt;

Much cyberbullying is an act of relational aggression, which involves alienating the victim from his or her peers through gossip or ostracism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sugimori Shinkichi |year=2012 |url=http://www.nippon.com/en/currents/d00054/|title=Anatomy of Japanese Bullying|work=nippon.com|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of attack can be easily launched via texting or other online activities.
Here is an example of a 19-year-old teenager sharing his real experience of cyberbullying. When he was in high school, his classmates posted his photo online, insulted him constantly, and asked him to die. Because of the constant harassment, he did attempt suicide twice. Even when he quit school, the attacks did not stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Cyber-bullying-bedevils-Japan/2007/11/12/1194766557213.html|title=Cyber bullying bedevils Japan|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying can cause serious psychological impact to the victims. They often feel anxious, nervous, tired, and depressed. Other examples of negative psychological trauma include losing confidence as a result being socially isolated from their schoolmates or friends. Mental psychological problems can also show up in the form of headaches, skin problems, abdominal pain, sleep problems, bed-wetting, and crying. It may also lead victims to commit suicide to end bullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psusd.us/CyberBullying-StudentAwareness Cyber Bullying: Student Awareness] Palm Springs Unified School District Retrieved 5 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors acknowledge that both of these studies provide only preliminary information about the nature and consequences of online bullying, due to the methodological challenges associated with an online survey.

Almost three-quarters (73%) stated that they knew the bully, while 26% stated that the offender was a stranger. 10% of responders indicated that another person has taken a picture and/or video of them via a [[camera phone|cellular phone camera]], consequently making them feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, or threatened. Many youths are not comfortable telling an authority figure about their cyber-bullying [[victimization]] for fear their access to technology will be taken from them; while 24% and 14% told a parent or teacher respectively, 28% did not tell anyone while 41% told a friend.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;

In 2007, Debbie Heimowitz, a [[Stanford University]] master's student, created [[Adina's Deck]], a film based on Stanford accredited research. She worked in focus groups for ten weeks in three schools to learn about the problem of cyber-bullying in Northern California. The findings determined that over 60% of students had been cyber-bullied and were victims of cyber-bullying. The film is now being used in classrooms nationwide as it was designed around learning goals pertaining to problems that students had understanding the topic. The middle school of [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]] is reportedly using the film as a solution to the crisis in their town.

They also report findings from the most recent study of cyber-bullying among middle-school students. Using a random sample of approximately 2000 middle-school students from a large school district in the southern United States, about 10% of respondents had been cyber-bullied in the previous 30 days while over 17% reported being cyber-bullied at least once in their lifetime.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; While these rates are slightly lower than some of the findings from their previous research, Hinduja and Patchin point out that the earlier studies were predominantly conducted among older adolescents and Internet samples.

In 2014, Mehari, Farrell, and Le published a study that focused on the literature on cyberbullying among adolescents. They found that researchers have generally assumed that cyberbullying is distinct from aggression perpetrated in person. They suggest that the media through which aggression is perpetrated may be best conceptualized as a new dimension on which aggression can be classified, rather than cyberbullying as a distinct counterpart to existing forms of aggression and that future research on cyberbullying should be considered within the context of theoretical and empirical knowledge of aggression in adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/psyc_pubs/15/|title = Cyberbullying among adolescents: Measures in search of a construct|last = Mehari|first = Krista|date = 2014|journal = Psychology of Violence|doi = 10.1037/a0037521|pmid = |access-date = March 24, 2015|last2 = Farrell|first2 = Albert|last3 = Le|first3 = Anh-Thuy|volume=4|issue = 4|pages=399–415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Howlett-Brandon's doctoral dissertation analyzed the National Crime Victimization Survey: Student Crime Supplement, 2009, to focus on the cyberbullying victimization of Black students and White students in specific conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/3470/|title = CYBERBULLYING: AN EXAMINATION OF GENDER, RACE, ETHNICITY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS FROM THE NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY: STUDENT CRIME SUPPLEMENT, 2009|date = 2014|accessdate = March 30, 2015|website = VCU Theses and Dissertations, VCU Scholars Compass|publisher = Virginia Commonwealth University|last = Howlett-Brandon|first = Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ireland ===
The journal article titled “Exploring traditional and cyberbullying among Irish adolescent” studies the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) pilot survey was carried out by 8 post-primary schools across Ireland in which 318 students aged 15–18 years old completed. 59% of these students were boys and 41% were girls. The participation in this survey was completely voluntary for the student and content had to be obtained from the parents as well as students and also the school itself. This survey was also anonymous and confidential. It took one class or 40 minutes to complete by the students. This survey asked questions on traditional forms of bullying as well as cyber bullying, risk behaviours and self-reported health and life satisfaction. One question in this survey was “How often have you been bullied at school in the past couple of months in the ways listed below?” Students answered “Someone sent mean instant messages, wall postings, emails and text messages, or created a Web site that made fun of me; Someone took unflattering or inappropriate pictures of me without permission and posted them online; Someone tricked me into sharing personal information in an email or text message and forwarded that”. 66% of these students said that they have never been bullied. 14% reported that they were victims of the traditional forms of bullying. 10% reported that they were victims of cyber bullying and the remaining 10% said that they were victims of both traditional forms of bullying as well as cyber bullying. It was mostly boys that said they were victims of just traditional forms of bullying, but it was reported that it was mostly girls that were victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyber bullying. 20% of the students in this survey said that they have been cyber bullied showing that cyber bullying is on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=360 Link|journal=International Journal of Public Health|volume=60|issue=2|pages=199|url=http://fh6xn3yd3x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Exploring+traditional+and+cyberbullying+among+Irish+adolescents&amp;rft.jtitle=International+Journal+of+Public+Health&amp;rft.au=Callaghan,+Mary&amp;rft.au=Kelly,+Colette&amp;rft.au=Molcho,+Michal&amp;rft.date=2014&amp;rft.issn=1661-8556&amp;rft.eissn=1420-911X&amp;rft.volume=60&amp;rft.issue=2&amp;rft.spage=199&amp;rft.epage=206&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007/s00038-014-0638-7&amp;rft.externalDBID=n/a&amp;rft.externalDocID=601082949&amp;paramdict=en-US|doi=10.1007/s00038-014-0638-7&amp;rft.externaldbid=n/a&amp;rft.externaldocid=601082949&amp;paramdict=en-us|year=2014|last1=Callaghan|first1=Mary|last2=Kelly|first2=Colette|last3=Molcho|first3=Michal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrow D.I.T claims that twenty-three percent of 9-16 year olds in Ireland have been bullied on-line or of-line, compared to nineteen percent in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=cserrep|title=Cyberbullying among 9-16 year olds in Ireland|last=O'Neill|first=Brian|last2=Dinh|first2=Thuy|date=2016|website=|publisher=Dublin Institute of Technology|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, on-line bullying in Ireland at 4% according to Arrow D.I.T is lower than the European average which stands at 6%, and half that of the UK where 8% reported being cyberbullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=cserrep|title=Cyberbullying among 9-16 year olds in Ireland|last=O'Neill|first=Brian|last2=Dinh|first2=Thuy|date=2016|website=|publisher=Dublin Institute of Technology|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, traditional forms of bullying in Ireland is higher than their European counterparts, but lower when it comes to cyberbullying.

Legislation geared at penalizing cyberbullying has been introduced in a number of U.S. states including New York, Missouri, Rhode Island and Maryland.

CNET News, by Stefanie Olsen, June 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawmakers are seeking to address cyberbullying with new legislation because there's currently no specific law on the books that deals with it. A fairly new federal cyberstalking law might address such acts, according to [[Parry Aftab]], but no one has been prosecuted under it yet. The proposed federal law would make it illegal to use electronic means to "coerce, intimidate, harass or cause other substantial emotional distress."

In August 2008, the California state legislature passed one of the first laws in the country to deal directly with cyberbullying. The legislation, Assembly Bill 86 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbusd.us/vnews/display.v/ART/4cd41cda558da%3C|title=Fort Bragg USD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives school administrators the authority to discipline students for bullying others offline or online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerdigitaled.com/edtech/Education-Legislation-Cyber-Bullying.html |title=Education Legislation: Cyber-Bullying |publisher=Centerdigitaled.com |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law took effect, January 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/31/AR2008123103067.html|title=States Passing Laws to Combat Cyber-Bullying&amp;nbsp;— washingtonpost.com|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 2, 2009|last=Surdin|first=Ashley | date=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A law in New York's Albany County that criminalized cyberbullying was recently struck down as unconstitutional by the [[New York Court of Appeals]] in [[People v.

=== European Union ===

Since the 1990s, the United Kingdom and other European countries have been working to solve workplace bullying since there is no legislation regulating cyberbullying. The pervasive nature of technology has made the act of bullying online much easier.&lt;ref name=european-perspective&gt;{{cite web|title=Bullying, Harassment and Stress in the Workplace —A European Perspective|url=http://www.internationallaborlaw.com/files/2013/01/Bullying-Harassment-and-Stress-in-the-workplace-A-European-Perspective.pdf|website=Bullying, Harassment and Stress in the Workplace —A European Perspective|publisher=  Proskauer|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 24-hour internet connection gives  bullies a never ending opportunity to find and bully victims. Employers in the European Union  have more legal responsibility to their employees than other countries. Since employers do not the ability to fire or hire an employee at will like in the United States, employers in Europe are held to a high standard in how their employees are treated. The Framework Agreement on Harassment and Violence at Work is a law that prevents bullying occurring in the workplace and holds employers accountable for providing fair working conditionsr.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; Lawyers pursuing cyberbullying cases use The Ordinance on Victimization at Work law, since they are not any laws specifically condemning cyberbullying.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt;

In 1993, Sweden was the first European Union country to have a law against cyberbullying. The Ordinance on Victimization at Work protected victims from "recurrent reprehensible or distinctly negative actions which are directed which are directed against individual employees in an offensive manner and can result in those employees being placed outside the workplace community".&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; In 2002, France passed the Social Modernization Law, which added consequences to the French Labor Code for cyberbullying such as holding employers accountable for their involvement in harassment. The legislation states, "the employer can be held accountable if it is deemed by court of law that the conduct defile the employee emotionally or physical health in any manner".&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; The United Kingdom does not have anti-bullying legislation. However, it does have the Protection From Harassment Act, an anti-stalking law.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; The United Kingdom courts have used this legislation in bullying cases. In 2007, the European Union developed the Framework Agreement on Harassment and Violence at Work.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; The law defines the responsibilities of an employer such as protecting his or her employees from bullies in a work environment and the psychological pain a victim faces from bullies during business hours.

[[File:Take A Stand Against Cyberbullying.png|thumb|This image portrays the support and awareness that many anti-cyberbullying campaigns have in some countries around the world.]]
The United States and other countries have more extensive legislation on cyberbullying than the European Union. The amount of cyberbullying incidents on social media are widespread and have increased drastically.&lt;ref name=european-perspective /&gt; However, the process of getting a claim against a bully is not an easy one because of the victim's need to provide sufficient evidence to prove the existence of bullying.

As of mid-2015, countries in the European Union like the United Kingdom are in the process of creating law specially related to cyberbullying. Since the process takes time, the government is supporting schools programs to promote internet safety with the help of teachers and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statutory guidance – Keeping children safe in education|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will allow government to take the time it needs to create the cyberbullying laws while helping students safeguarding themselves from cyberbullying as much as they can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New guidelines to help industry promote internet safety|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-guidelines-to-help-industry-promote-internet-safety|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education &amp; Tim Loughton|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on preventative legislation ===
Researchers suggest that programs be put in place for prevention of cyberbullying. These programs would be incorporated into school curricula and would include online safety and instruction on how to use the Internet properly.&lt;ref name= von&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Von Marees | first1 = N. | last2 = Petermann | first2 = F. | year = 2012 | title = Cyberbullying: An increasing challenge for schools | url = | journal = School Psychology International | volume = 33 | issue = 5| page = 476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This could teach the victim proper methods of potentially avoiding the cyberbully, such as blocking messages or increasing the security on their computer.&lt;ref name= von /&gt;

Within this suggested school prevention model, even in a perfect world, not one crime can be stopped fully. That is why it is suggested that within this prevention method, effective coping strategies should be introduced and adopted. As with any crime, people learn to cope with what has happened, and the same goes for cyberbullying. People can adopt coping strategies to combat future cyberbullying events. An example of a coping strategy would be a social support group composed of various victims of cyberbullying.&lt;ref name= von /&gt; That could come together and share experiences, with a formal speaker leading the discussion. Something like a support group can allow students to share their stories, and allows that feeling of them being alone to be removed.

Teachers should be involved in all prevention educational models, as they are essentially the "police" of the classroom. Most cyberbullying often goes unreported as the victim feels nothing can be done to help in their current situation.&lt;ref name= von /&gt; However, if given the proper tools with preventative measures and more power in the classroom, teachers can be of assistance to the problem of cyber-bullying. If the parent, teacher, and victim can work together, a possible solution or remedy can be found.&lt;ref name= von /&gt;

There have been many legislative attempts to facilitate the control of bullying and cyberbullying. The problem is due to the fact that some existing legislation is incorrectly thought to be tied to bullying and cyberbullying (terms such as libel and slander). The problem is they do not directly apply to it nor define it as its own criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, S. M. (2010). Cybercrime in Canadian criminal law. (pp. 105–122). Toronto, ON: Carswell.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-cyberbullying advocates even expressed concern about the broad scope of applicability of some of the bills attempted to be passed.&lt;ref name= walt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walther | first1 = B | year = 2012 | title = Cyberbullying: Holding grownups liable for negligent entrustment | url = | journal = Houston Law Review | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 531–562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, attempts were made to pass legislation against cyberbullying. Few states attempted to pass broad sanctions in an effort to prohibit cyberbullying. Problem include how to define cyberbullying and cyberstalking, and if charges are pressed, whether it violates the bully's freedom of speech.&lt;ref name= walt /&gt; B. Walther has said that "Illinois is the only state to criminalize 'electronic communication(s) sent for the purpose of harassing another person' when the activity takes place outside a public school setting." Again this came under fire for infringement on freedom of speech.&lt;ref name= walt /&gt;

== Harmful effects ==
Research had demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization.&lt;ref name="patchin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; For example, victims have lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and a variety of emotional responses, retaliating, being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; People have reported that Cyberbullying can be more harmful than traditional bullying because there is no escaping it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demetrioskritikos.com/cyber-bullying/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813032718/http://demetrioskritikos.com/cyber-bullying/ |archivedate=August 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most damaging effects is that a victim begins to avoid friends and activities, often the very intention of the cyberbully.

Cyberbullying campaigns are sometimes so damaging that victims have committed suicide. There are at least four examples in the United States where cyberbullying has been linked to the suicide of a teenager.&lt;ref name="patchin3" /&gt; The [[suicide of Megan Meier]] is a recent example that led to the conviction of the adult perpetrator of the attacks. Another example of harmful effects is the death of Holly Grogan who ended her life by jumping of a 30 foot bridge near Gloucester in the UK . It was reported that a number of her schoolmates has posted a number of hateful messages on her Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=High school teachers' perceptions of cyberbullying prevention and intervention strategies|journal=Psychology in the Schools|volume=49|issue=4|pages=352|doi=10.1002/pits.21603|year=2012|last1=Stauffer|first1=Sterling|last2=Heath|first2=Melissa Allen|last3=Coyne|first3=Sarah Marie|last4=Ferrin|first4=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lucie Russell, director of campaigns, policy and participation at youth mental health charity Young Minds, young people who suffer from [[mental disorder]] are vulnerable to cyberbullying as they are sometimes unable to shrug it off:&lt;blockquote&gt;When someone says nasty things healthy people can filter that out, they're able to put a block between that and their self-esteem. But mentally unwell people don't have the strength and the self-esteem to do that, to separate it, and so it gets compiled with everything else. To them, it becomes the absolute truth – there's no filter, there's no block. That person will take that on, take it as fact.&lt;ref name="Guardian8813"&gt;{{cite news|title = Cyberbullying websites should be boycotted, says Cameron: Prime minister calls for website operators to 'step up to the plate', following death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith|url = |accessdate = 8 August 2013|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 8 August 2013|author = Alexandra Topping|author2 = Ellen Coyne and agencies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Social media has allowed bullies to disconnect from the impact they may be having on others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlyleobserver.com/article/20120427/CARLYLE0101/304279977/-1/carlyle/cyber-bullying-and-popular-culture|title=Cyber-bullying and popular culture|author=Kelly Running|work=Carlyle Observer|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intimidation, emotional damage, suicide ===
According to the Cyberbullying Research Center, "there have been several high‐profile cases involving teenagers taking their own lives in part because of being harassed and mistreated over the Internet, a phenomenon we have termed cyberbullicide – suicide indirectly or directly influenced by experiences with online aggression."

Cyberbullying is an intense form of psychological abuse, whose victims are more than twice as likely to suffer from mental disorders compared to traditional bullying.&lt;ref name="cyberthreat"&gt;{{cite journal | magazine=[[Ideas and Discoveries (magazine)|Ideas and Discoveries]] |title=Cyberthreat: How to protect yourself from online bullying | publisher=Ideas and Discoveries | year=2011 | page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reluctance youth have in telling an authority figure about instances of cyberbullying has led to fatal outcomes. At least three children between the ages of 12 and 13 have committed suicide due to depression brought on by cyberbullying, according to reports by USA Today and the Baltimore Examiner. These would include the [[suicide of Ryan Halligan]] and the [[suicide of Megan Meier]], the latter of which resulted in [[United States v. Lori Drew]].

More recently, teenage suicides tied to cyberbullying have become more prevalent. The latest victim of cyberbullying through the use of mobile applications was Rebecca Ann Sedwick, who committed suicide after being terrorized through mobile applications such as [[Ask.fm]], [[Kik Messenger]] and [[Voxer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alvarez|first=Lizette|title=Girl's Suicide Points to Rise in Apps Used by Cyberbullies|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/us/suicide-of-girl-after-bullying-raises-worries-on-web-sites.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On youth and teenagers ===
The effects of cyberbullying vary. But, research illustrates that cyber bullying adversely affects youth to a higher degree than adolescents and adults. Youth are more likely to suffer since they are still growing mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying"&gt;{{cite web|title=Effects of Bullying|url=http://www.stopbullying.gov/at-risk/effects/|website=StopBullying.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer N. Caudle, a certified family physician, describes the effects as "Kids that are bullied are likely to experience anxiety, depression, loneliness, unhappiness and poor sleep".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber-Bullying and its Effect on our Youth|url=http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-your-health/health-conditions-library/general-health/Pages/cyber-bullying.aspx|website=American Osteopathic Association|publisher=American Osteopathic Association|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Against Cyberbullying.png|thumb|This image shows different aspects of cyberbullying that can take place on the internet which puts more emotional strain on the younger children and teenage who experience cyberbullying.]]

Most of the time cyberbullying goes unnoticed; the younger generation hides their bullying from anyone that can help to prevent the bullying from occurring and from getting worse. Between 20% and 40% of adolescents are victims of cyberbullying worldwide.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deniz|first1=Metin|title=A Study on Primary School Students’ Being Cyber Bullies and Victims According to Gender, Grade, and Socioeconomic Status|journal=Croatian Journal of Education|date=7 July 2015|volume=17|issue=3|pages=659–680|doi=10.15516/cje.v17i3.835}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youth slowly change their behaviors and actions so they become more withdrawn and quiet than they are used to, but no one notices since the change is subtle.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The youth become more anxious and timid in all types of environments and settings. According to A Study on Primary School Students’ Being Cyber Bullies and Victims According to Gender, Grade, and Socioeconomic Status, cyberbullying victims "have psychological problems, such as lack of self-confidence, distress, disappointment, fear of school, lack of academic achievement, loneliness, anxiety, depression, and suicide. Cyberbullying will "become a serious problem in the future with an increase in the Internet and mobile phone usage among young people".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

If preventive actions are not taken against cyberbullying, younger children in addition to teenagers will feel more lonely and depressed along with having a significant change in their eating and sleeping patterns as well as loss of interest in their normal activities. These changes will affect their growth and development into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Younger children and teenagers are 76.2% less likely to display suicidal behaviors and thoughts, but are still at risk depending on other factors such as mental health status, home care, relationships with others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The risk of suicide increases 35% to 45% when victims do not have any support from anyone in their life and cyberbullying amplifies the situation more.&lt;ref name="Effects of Bullying" /&gt;

== Awareness ==

=== Campaigns ===

==== International ====
The Cybersmile Foundation is a cyberbullying charity committed to tackling all forms of [[online bullying]], abuse, and hate campaigns. The charity was founded in 2010 in response to the increasing number of cyberbullying related incidents of [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[eating disorders]], social isolation, [[self-harm]] and [[suicides]] devastating lives around the world. Cybersmile provides support to victims and their friends and families through [[social media]] interaction, email and helpline support. They also run an annual event, [[Stop Cyberbullying Day]], to draw attention to the issue.

==== Spain ====
There are multiple non-profit organizations that fight cyberbullying and cyberstalking. They advise victims, provide awareness campaigns, and report offenses to the police. These NGOs include the ''Protégeles'', ''PantallasAmigas'', ''[[Foundation Alia2]]'', the non-profit initiative ''Actúa Contra el Ciberacoso'', the National Communications Technology Institute (INTECO), the Agency of Internet quality, the ''Agencia Española de Protección de Datos'', the ''Oficina de Seguridad del Internauta'', the Spanish Internet users' Association, the Internauts' Association, and the Spanish Association of Mothers and Parents Internauts.

==== United States ====
In March 2007, the Advertising Council in the United States, in partnership with the National Crime Prevention Council, U.S. Department of Justice, and Crime Prevention Coalition of America, joined to announce the launch of a new [[public service advertising]] campaign designed to educate preteens and teens about how they can play a role in ending cyber-bullying.

A Pew Internet and American Life survey found that 33% of teens were subject to some sort of cyber-bullying.

January 20, 2008 – the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s 2008 edition of ''[[Boy Scout Handbook|The Boy Scout Handbook]]'' addresses how to deal with online bullying. A new [[Ranks in the Boy Scouts of America#First Class|First Class]] rank requirements adds: "Describe the three things you should avoid doing related to use of the Internet. Describe a cyberbully and how you should respond to one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

January 31, 2008 – [[KTTV]] Fox 11 News based in Los Angeles put out a report about organized cyber-bullying on sites like [[Stickam]] by people who call themselves "[[Anonymous (group)|/b/rothas]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai09cWlyPrQ|publisher = Fox 11|title = Leelila Strogov – Fox 11 LA – Cyber Bullies|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site had put out report on July 26, 2007, about a subject that partly featured cyberbullying titled "hackers on steroids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNO6G4ApJQY|publisher = Fox Television Stations, Inc.|title = FOX 11 Investigates: 'Anonymous'|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

June 2, 2008 – Parents, teens, teachers, and Internet executives came together at Wired Safety's International Stop Cyberbullying Conference, a two-day gathering in White Plains, New York and New York City. Executives from Facebook, [[Verizon]], MySpace, [[Microsoft]], and many others talked with hundreds about how to better protect themselves, personal reputations, children and businesses online from harassment. Sponsors of the conference included [[McAfee]], [[AOL]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Girl Scouts of the USA]], WiredTrust, Children’s Safety Research and Innovation Centre, KidZui.com and others. This conference was being delivered in conjunction and with the support of Pace University. Topics addressed included cyberbullying and the law, with discussions about laws governing cyberbullying and how to distinguish between rudeness and criminal harassment. Additional forums addressed parents’ legal responsibilities, the need for more laws, how to handle violent postings of videos be handled, as well as the differentiation between free speech and hate speech. Cyberharassment vs. cyberbullying was a forefront topic, where age makes a difference and abusive internet behavior by adults with repeated clear intent to harm, ridicule or damage a person or business was classified as [[stalking]] harassment vs. bullying by teens and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Skylar |url=http://www.dailytitan.com/2009/10/cal-state-fullerton-student-causes-crash/comment-page-46/ |title=2 dead after head-on collision with CSUF student |publisher=Dailytitan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

August 2012 – A new organized movement to make revenge porn illegal began in August 2012.  It is known as [[End Revenge Porn]].&lt;ref name="endrevengeporn.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endrevengeporn.org/|title=End Revenge Porn|work=End Revenge Porn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently revenge porn is only illegal in two states, but the demand for its criminalization is on the rise as digital technology has increased in the past few generations.  The organization seeks to provide support for victims, educate the public, and gain activist support to bring new legislation before the United States Government.&lt;ref name="endrevengeporn.org" /&gt;

In 2006, PACER.org created a week long event that was held once a year in October. Today, the campaign is a monthlong event and is now known as the National Bullying Prevention Awareness Month.&lt;ref&gt;Hertzog, J.
(2015, October 5). October is National Bullying Prevention Awareness
Month. Retrieved November 3, 2015, from http://www.stopbullying.gov/blog/2015/10/05/october-national-bullying-prevention-awareness-month&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Canada ====
Originated in Canada, [[Anti-Bullying Day|Anti-Bullying day]] is a day of celebration for those who choose to participate wearing a symbol of colours (Pink, Blue or Purple) as a stance against bullying.  A B.C. teacher founded the Stop A Bully movement, which uses pink wristbands to represent the wearer's stance to stop bullying.

Pink Shirt Day was inspired by David Shepherd and Travis Price. Their high school friends organized a protest in sympathy for a Grade 9 boy who was bullied for wearing a pink shirt. Their stance from wearing pink has been a huge inspiration in the Great Vancouver Mainland.
"We know that victims of bullying, witnesses of bullying and bullies themselves all experience the very real and long term negative impacts of bullying regardless of its forms – physical, verbal, written, or on-line (cyberbullying)".

The ERASE (Expect Respect and A Safe Education) is an initiative started by the province of British Columbia to foster safe schools and prevent bullying. It builds on already-effective programs set up by the provincial government to ensure consistent policies and practices regarding the prevention of bullying.

=== Community support ===
A number organizations are in coalition to provide awareness, protection and recourse for the escalating problem. Some aim to inform and provide measures to avoid as well as effectively terminate cyberbullying and cyberharassment. Anti-bullying charity [[Act Against Bullying]] launched the CyberKind campaign in August 2009 to promote positive internet usage.

In 2007, YouTube introduced the first Anti-Bullying Channel for youth, (BeatBullying) engaging the assistance of celebrities to tackle the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7098978.stm YouTube tackles bullying online] BBC News, November 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, a 17-year-old girl named Alexis Skye Pilkington was found dead in her room by her parents. Her parents claimed that after repeated cyberbullying, she was driven to suicide. Shortly after her death, attacks resumed. Members of [[eBaums World]] began to [[Troll (Internet)|troll]] teens' memorial pages on [[Facebook]], with the comments including expressions of pleasure over the death, with pictures of what seemed to be a banana as their profile pictures. Family and friends of the deceased teen responded by creating Facebook groups denouncing cyberbullying and trolling, with logos of bananas behind a red circle with a diagonal line through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salazar|first=Cristian|title=Alexis Pilkington Facebook Horror: Cyber Bullies Harass Teen Even After Suicide|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/alexis-pilkington-faceboo_n_512482.html|accessdate=22 October 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response and partnership to the 2011 film ''[[Bully (2011 film)|Bully]]'', a grassroots effort to stop cyberbullying called The Bully Project was created. Their goal is "sparked a national movement to stop bullying that is transforming children's lives and changing a culture of bullying into one of empathy and action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebullyproject.com/|title=The BULLY Project|work=The BULLY Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable cases ==

=== Teens in the United States ===
13-year-old Zoe Johnson from Wyoming, Michigan committed suicide in July 2015. Johnson had been a victim of cyberbullying for years and suffered from mild depression. It is believed that a message posted on her Facebook the day before her suicide may have been the turning point that pushed her towards suicide. After her death, people continued to post messages on her Facebook with one person posting the message "good ur gone".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fox17online.com/2015/07/21/mom-cyber-bullying-killed-my-daughter/ Sidorowicz, J.

14-year-old Carla Jamerson from Las Vegas, Nevada committed suicide in 2015. She was a victim of cyberbullying for years. Jamerson went to both the city and school police, but did not receive any help. After not receiving any help, she hanged herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mother says cyber bullying drove 14-year-old daughter to suicide|date=March 6, 2015|accessdate=

=== Bullying of climate scientists and activists ===

As of 2011 and 2012, climate scientists and climate activists were being confronted with abusive emails from all over the world. These emails were sometimes sent in response to public statements that merely reported findings related to the widely accepted [[anthropogenic climate change]] and its consequences. Such emails were sent in response to suggestions posted on climate denial websites, which are effectively requests to engage in cyberbullying. Climate scientists and climate activists were also confronted with libelous Internet reports that aimed to silence them or destroy their reputations.&lt;ref name=scientificamerican-climate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-cyber-bullying|title=Cyber Bullying Intensifies as Climate Data Questioned|author1=Douglas Fischer |author2=The Daily Climate |work=scientificamerican.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timemag-climate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.time.com/2012/04/10/when-grownups-bully-climate-scientists/|title=Dominique Browning: When Grownups Bully Climate Scientists – TIME.com|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=latrobe-climate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/news/articles/2011/opinion/bullying-climate-change-scientists|title=Bullying climate change scientists|work=latrobe.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
In 2013, two Swedish teenage girls were convicted by the Swedish court in Gothenburg for writing derogatory, explicit remarks next to the pictures of 38 youngsters, mostly girls, via an anonymous [[Instagram]] account. They were found guilty and sentenced to youth care and youth service as well as rioting at two schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://growingsocialmedia.com/cyber-bullying-social-media-cause-effect/|title=Cyber Bullying on Social Media: Cause &amp; Effect|author=Jonas Helsen |publisher=Growing Social Media|date=31 March 2015| access-date=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
