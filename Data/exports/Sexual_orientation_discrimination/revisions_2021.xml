'''Sexual orientation discrimination''' (also known as '''sexualism''') is discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[sexual behaviour]].

== Sexual bias ==
Sexual orientation discrimination often comes up in the context of employment actions.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, John, "[https://eeolawblog.com/2017/08/28/sexual-orientation-discrimination-the-current-state-of-the-law/ Sexual Orientation Discrimination in the Current State of the Law (2017)]" {{Dead link|date=January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually refers to a predisposition towards [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] people, which is biased against [[lesbian]], [[gay]], and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] people, among others. This is specifically referred to as [[heterosexism]]. It can, however, also be ''against'' heterosexual people. A related term is ''sexual prejudice'', a negative attitude towards someone because of their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Matlin, Margaret W., Ph.D., "The Psychology of Women", (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This bias is also the same as [[homophobia]], as it is discrimination towards or against certain sexual orientations.

An earlier definition of this term is: Sexual orientation discrimination is a belief or argument that one sexual orientation or sexual behaviour is inherently superior to some or all others. Usually it comes in the form of [[heterosexuality]] being considered the only [[nature|natural]], [[normality (behavior)|normal]], or [[moral]] mode of sexual behavior, and is also used to refer to the effects of that instinct. The word ''heterosexism'' has also been proposed to mean essentially the same thing as this form of sexual orientation discrimination.&lt;!--In The Dictionary of Psychology [1] ''heterosexism'' is defined as 
"An argument that male-female sexuality is the only correct, natural, proper, or moral mode of sexual activity. [Also proposed as] ''heterosexualism''. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corsini, Raymond J., ''The Dictionary of Psychology'' (2001), {{ISBN|1-58391-328-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word has been suggested as an alternative to [[homophobia]],&lt;ref&gt;Herek, Gregory M., Ph.D., "Beyond 'Homophobia': Thinking About Sexual Prejudice and Stigma in the Twenty-First Century."   Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy (April, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; in part because it uses a parallel structure to [[sexism]] or [[racism]]. The intent of the concept of heterosexism is the examination of the cultural bias against non-heterosexuals rather than individual bias, which is the focus of homophobia, as well as the adverse effects of normative heterosexuality on heterosexual identifying people.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, S. (2006) Gender, sexuality and heterosexuality: the complexity (and limits) of heteronormativity. Feminist Theory, 7 ( 1). pp. 105-121. ISSN 1464-7001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexuality or sexual nature ==
The term [[Pansexuality|pansexualism]], seen especially in the field of early-20th-century [[psychoanalysis]]&lt;!-- (Freud and "pan-sexualism")--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw, ''[[Sex and Repression in Savage Society]]'' (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; was based on the usage of the term "sexualism" to refer to humanity's sexual nature. The terms [[homosexualism]] and [[bisexualism]] were also based on this usage, and were commonly used before the general adoption of the terms [[homosexuality]] and [[bisexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Kodaigaku - 'Bi-sexualism in Buddhist Literature', by Kodaigaku Kyōkai (Japan)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'For Sex Education, See Librarian: A Guide to Issues and Resources,' by Martha Cornog, Timothy Perper (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
