'''Sexual orientation discrimination''' (also known as '''sexualism''') is discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[sexual behaviour]].

== Sexual bias ==
Sexual orientation discrimination often comes up in the context of employment actions.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, John, "[https://eeolawblog.com/2017/08/28/sexual-orientation-discrimination-the-current-state-of-the-law/ Sexual Orientation Discrimination in the Current State of the Law (2017)]" {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715152052/https://eeolawblog.com/2017/08/28/sexual-orientation-discrimination-the-current-state-of-the-law/ |date=2018-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually refers to a predisposition towards [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] people, which is biased against [[lesbian]], [[gay]], and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] people, among others. This is specifically referred to as [[heterosexism]]. A related term is ''sexual prejudice'', a negative attitude towards someone because of their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Matlin, Margaret W., Ph.D., "The Psychology of Women", (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This bias is also the same as [[homophobia]], as it is discrimination towards or against certain sexual orientations.

An earlier definition of this term is: Sexual orientation discrimination is a belief or argument that one sexual orientation or sexual behaviour is inherently superior to some or all others. Usually it comes in the form of [[heterosexuality]] being considered the only [[nature|natural]], [[normality (behavior)|normal]], or [[moral]] mode of sexual behavior, and is also used to refer to the effects of that instinct. The word ''heterosexism'' has also been proposed to mean essentially the same thing as this form of sexual orientation discrimination.&lt;!--In The Dictionary of Psychology [1] ''heterosexism'' is defined as 
"An argument that male-female sexuality is the only correct, natural, proper, or moral mode of sexual activity. [Also proposed as] ''heterosexualism''. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corsini, Raymond J., ''The Dictionary of Psychology'' (2001), {{ISBN|1-58391-328-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word has been suggested as an alternative to [[homophobia]],&lt;ref&gt;Herek, Gregory M., Ph.D., "Beyond 'Homophobia': Thinking About Sexual Prejudice and Stigma in the Twenty-First Century."   Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy (April, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; in part because it uses a parallel structure to [[sexism]] or [[racism]]. The intent of the concept of heterosexism is the examination of the cultural bias against non-heterosexuals rather than individual bias, which is the focus of homophobia, as well as the adverse effects of normative heterosexuality on heterosexual identifying people.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, S. (2006) Gender, sexuality and heterosexuality: the complexity (and limits) of heteronormativity. Feminist Theory, 7 ( 1). pp. 105-121. ISSN 1464-7001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of discrimination ==
=== Employment actions ===
Employment actions (or ultimate employment actions), refer to hiring, firing, demotions, promotions, and compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rusie |first1=Michael |title=The Meaning of Adverse Employment Actions in the Context of Title VII Retaliation Claims |journal=Washington University Journal of Law and Policy |date=January 2002 |volume=9 |issue=1 |page=385 |url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1439&amp;context=law_journal_law_policy |access-date=6 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse employment actions, however, include termination, demotions, suspension, and changes to conditions, responsibilities and pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bachman |first1=Eric |title=What Counts as an "Adverse Employment Action" in Discrimination and Retaliation Cases? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericbachman/2021/11/15/what-counts-as-an-adverse-employment-action-in-discrimination-and-retaliation-cases/?sh=2b3f37c7c0cf |work=Forbes |access-date=6 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex. In [[Bostock v. Clayton County]] [[590]] [[U.S.]] ___ 2020, the Supreme Court found that adverse employment actions made due to an employee's sexual orientation or gender identity violates [[Title VII]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wolf |first1=Richard |title=Supreme Court grants federal job protections to gay, lesbian, transgender workers |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/15/supreme-court-denies-job-protection-lgbt-workers/4456749002/ |website=USA Today |publisher=USA Today |access-date=7 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service provision === 
Sexual orientation discrimination also occurs at the time of service provision from a business or government agency to an individual or group. Such services may include dining at a restaurant, visiting a partner at the hospital, receiving healthcare, or acquiring a marriage license.

== Sexuality or sexual nature ==
The term [[pansexualism]], seen especially in the field of early-20th-century [[psychoanalysis]]&lt;!-- (Freud and "pan-sexualism")--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw, ''[[Sex and Repression in Savage Society]]'' (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; was based on the usage of the term "sexualism" to refer to humanity's sexual nature. The terms "homosexualism" and "bisexualism" were also based on this usage, and were commonly used before the general adoption of the terms [[homosexuality]] and [[bisexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Kodaigaku - 'Bi-sexualism in Buddhist Literature', by Kodaigaku Kyōkai (Japan)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'For Sex Education, See Librarian: A Guide to Issues and Resources,' by Martha Cornog, Timothy Perper (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key court decisions ==
=== Latta v. Otter ===
[[Latta v. Otter]], 771 F.3d 456 (9th Cir. 2014) is a court case that resulted from a federal lawsuit filed by four couples from Boise, Idaho, where [[same-sex marriage]] remained illegal until the couples' victory in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Latta v. Otter |url=https://www.nclrights.org/our-work/cases/latta-v-otter/ |website=National Center for Lesbian Rights |access-date=10 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to ''Latta v. Otter'', only 16 [[U.S. states]] had legalized same-sex marriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Same-Sex Marriage, State by State |url=https://www.pewforum.org/2015/06/26/same-sex-marriage-state-by-state/ |website=Pew Research Center |date=26 June 2015 |access-date=10 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Idaho refused to recognize same-sex marriages performed in such states. On September 8, 2014, the Ninth Circuit ruled that Idaho's ban on same-sex marriage was a violation of the [[U.S. Constitution]]'s guarantee of equal protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Latta v. Otter |url=https://www.nclrights.org/our-work/cases/latta-v-otter/ |website=National Center for Lesbian Rights |access-date=10 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obergefell v. Hodges ===
[[Obergefell v. Hodges]], 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015) is the landmark [[civil rights]] case that resulted in federal legalization of [[same-sex marriage]] in the United States. In July 2013, James Obergefell and John Arthur James, filed a lawsuit in the state of [[Ohio]] because of its refusal to recognize same-sex marriages on [[death certificate]]s. In September 2013, the lawsuit was amended to include a second gay couple and a [[funeral director]] who feared prosecution for falsifying death certificates if he were to note same-sex spouses on gay clients' documents.

=== Hively v. Ivy Tech Community, College of Indiana ===
[[Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College]], __ F.3d __, 2017 WL 1230393 (7th Cir. Apr. 4, 2017) ruled in an 8-3 decision by the [[Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals]] that [[sex discrimination]] includes [[homophobia]], and therefore violates federal [[civil rights law]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College |url=https://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/in_hively-v-ivy-tech |website=Lambda Legal |access-date=24 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time professor and open [[lesbian]] Kimberley Hively applied multiple times for full-time employment, but she was not approved, and her contract was not renewed. She claimed that this was due to her sexuality, and filed with the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]. The Seventh Circuit Court ruled in her favor. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College |url=https://harvardlawreview.org/2018/03/hively-v-ivy-tech-community-college/ |website=Harvard Law Review |access-date=25 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bostock v. Clayton County ===
Prior to the [[Bostock v. Clayton County]] case, the language of [[Title VII]] in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] left the phrase 'on the basis of sex' up for interpretation. The [[U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) has recognized members of the LGBTQ community as a protected class under [[Title VII]] since 2013, but even in 2020, only 21 states had extended employment discrimination protections to members the LGBTQ community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bynum |first1=Russ |last2=Kastanis |first2=Angeliki |title=AP analysis: Most states lack laws protecting LGBT workers |url=https://apnews.com/article/tn-state-wire-nc-state-wire-us-news-ap-top-news-sc-state-wire-8b5086b09b9042bf808d82108b7d925c |website=Associate Press News |date=20 April 2021 |publisher=Associated Press |access-date=7 January 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Bostock'' ruling found that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity would, in fact, be considered discrimination on the basis of sex.
