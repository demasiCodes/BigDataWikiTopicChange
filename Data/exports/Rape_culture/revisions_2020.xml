The notion of rape culture was developed by [[second-wave feminist]]s, primarily in the United States, beginning in the 1970s. Critics of the concept dispute its existence or extent, arguing that the concept is too narrow or that, although there are cultures where rape is pervasive, the idea of rape culture can imply that the rapist is not at fault but rather the society that enables rape.

Many movements have addressed rape culture, such as [[SlutWalk]] and [[Me Too movement|Me Too]]. These movements have helped share people's stories through hashtags that are embodied and connected to rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Danielle M.|date=2018-04-03|title=Embodied Interventions: Feminist Communication Pedagogy and Rape Culture|journal=Women's Studies in Communication|volume=41|issue=2|pages=108–112|doi=10.1080/07491409.2018.1463769|s2cid=149595407|issn=0749-1409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and usage==
The term "rape culture" was first coined in the 1970s in the United States by [[second-wave feminist]]s and applied to contemporary American culture as a whole.&lt;ref name="Smith2004 174"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Merril D.|title=Encyclopedia of Rape|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediarape00smit|url-access=limited|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-32687-5|edition=1st|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediarape00smit/page/n202 174]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, second-wave feminists had begun to engage in [[consciousness-raising]] efforts designed to educate the public about the prevalence of rape. Previously, according to Canadian psychology professor [[Psychology's Feminist Voices|Alexandra Rutherford]], most Americans assumed that rape, incest, and wife-beating were rare.&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape'' quoted in {{cite journal |title=Sexual Violence Against Women: Putting Rape Research in Context |author=Rutherford, Alexandra |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |doi=10.1177/0361684311404307 |date=June 2011 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=342–347 |s2cid=145146774 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of rape culture posited that rape was common and normal in American culture, and that it was an extreme manifestation of pervasive societal misogyny and sexism. Rape was redefined as a violent crime rather than a sex crime and its motive redefined from desire for sexual pleasure to male domination, intimidation and a sense of control over gender norms.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller&gt;Brownmiller, Susan.

==Overview==
{{too few opinions|reason= lack of male victim standpoints|date=January 2019}}
Feminists and gender activists{{Which|date=December 2019}} conceptualize rape culture as a cultural environment that encourages gender violence, as well as perpetuating "rape myths", ranging from treating rape as merely "rough sex" to blaming the victim for inviting rape. 

[[Michael Parenti]] believes that rape culture manifests through the acceptance of rapes as an everyday occurrence, and even a male prerogative. It can be exacerbated by police apathy in handling rape cases, as well as [[victim blaming]], reluctance by authorities to go against [[patriarchial]] cultural norms, as well as fears of [[stigmatization]] suffered by rape victims and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Parenti|first= Michael|authorlink= Michael Parenti |title= The Cultural Struggle|pages=71–79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIhkVEPmyTgC&amp;q=rape%20culture&amp;pg=PA71 |accessdate=13 June 2013|year=2005|publisher= Seven Stories Press|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 9781583227046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists{{who|date=October 2018}} posit that rape culture links non-consensual sex to the cultural fabric of a society, where patriarchial worldviews, laced with [[misogyny]] and gender inequality, are passed from generation to generation, leading to widespread social and institutional acceptance of rape.

One explanation for the commonality of these myths is that only certain "bad" or "misbehaved" women are raped. This creates a category of women separated from the general population which encourages an "otherness" and reduces the idea that anyone is vulnerable to being raped.&lt;ref name=Lonsway1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lonsway | first1 = Kimberly A. | last2 = Fitzgerald | first2 = Louise F. | year = 1994 | title = Rape Myths: In Review | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 133–64 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1994.tb00448.x| s2cid = 144252325 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Herman1989&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herman|first1=Dianne F.|editor1-last=Freeman|editor1-first=Jo|title=Women: a feminist perspective|date=1989|publisher=Mayfield Pub. Co.|location=Mountain View, Calif.|isbn=9780874848014|edition=4th|chapter=The Rape Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common rape myth is that no event is random. This promotes the idea that the women who are raped were not raped for no reason, but that they deserved it. If women believe that they were the cause of the rape, they may not go to authorities.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Society also uses the stereotype of men being aggressive as an excuse for their actions. This justifies and normalizes rape. Society creates these myths, scaring women before they are even raped. Another reason for the acceptance of rape culture is the [[Just-world hypothesis|"just-world" hypothesis]] which claims that what happens to an individual in life is inherently tied to their actions and thus seen as justly deserved. People who believe in this theory would also be more likely to believe women who are raped deserve it in some way. Finally, rape can be attributed to ways women were treated historically, as a factor used to oppress and create control over women.&lt;ref name=Lonsway1994/&gt;

Brownmiller, in ''Against Our Will'', discusses three ideas that helped bring awareness to some clearly defined rape myths of the early to mid 20th century. First, any woman can be a rape victim regardless of age, size, shape, ethnicity, or status. Second, any man can be a rapist, not just "evil" or "mentally ill" men as thought in previous decades. Finally, rape can occur in many different forms besides the stereotype of a violent, forceful rape done by a stranger.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chasteen2001/&gt;

The idea any women could be raped was a new proposition that called attention to the notion of victim blaming. Now that rape could affect anyone, there would not be a proper way for men and women to avoid it. Some rape myths that were widely accepted on the basis of what kind of women would be raped were ideas that the victim was always "young, careless [and] beautiful" or they are "loose" women who "invite rape" by provoking men."&lt;ref name=Gordon1991&gt;Gordon, Margaret T., and Stephanie Riger.

Rape culture can manifest when third parties separate the sexual violence of select individuals and cast them off as deviant perverts rather than acknowledging that anyone can be capable of rape. In the 1960s, rapists were often seen as mentally ill or deviants in society, and this view persisted among some people into the 1990s.{{explain|reason=And now what is the view?|date=January 2019}}&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;

Rape cases in which both parties previously knew one another has been coined as "[[acquaintance rape]]", a term first coined by Robin Warshaw in 1988, and subsequently used by prominent academics such as Mary P. Koss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warshaw|first1=Robin|title=I Never Called It Rape|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGJHAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780060551261|date=1988-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris O'Sullivan asserts that acts of [[sexism]] are commonly employed to validate and [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalize]] normative [[misogyny|misogynistic]] practices. For instance, sexist jokes may be told to foster disrespect for women and an accompanying disregard for their well-being, or a rape victim might be blamed for being raped because of how she dressed or acted. O'Sullivan examines rape culture and fraternities, identifying the socialization and social roles that contribute to sexual aggression, and looks at "frat life" and brotherhood ideals of competition and camaraderie. In these groups, sex is viewed by young men as a tool of gaining acceptance and bonding with fellow "brothers", as they engage in contests over sex with women.&lt;ref&gt;Chris O'Sullivan, ''Transforming a Rape Culture,'' edited by Emilie Buchwald, Pamela R. Fletcher &amp; Martha Roth, {{ISBN|0-915943-06-9}}, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; In O'Sullivan's article, sexualized violence towards women is regarded as part of a continuum in a society that regards women's bodies as sexually available by default.&lt;ref&gt;Chris O'Sullivan, "Fraternities and the Rape Culture", in ''Transforming a Rape Culture'', edited by Emilie Buchwald, Pamela R. Fletcher &amp; Martha Roth, {{ISBN|0-915943-06-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To some, the root cause of rape culture is the "domination and objectification of women".&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=127046 |title=Sexual Face of Violence: Rapists on Rape (abstract) |author=Vogelman, L. |publisher=Raven Press Ltd (book); National Criminal Justice Reference Service (abstract) |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, academic theory holds that rape culture does not necessarily have a single cause, and causes may be localized based on other social aspects of culture.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Rape culture is a fluid and always-changing entity that is socially produced and socially legitimated, so throughout time and place its definitions will change. Reasoning about rape and rape culture is also influenced by gender and heterosexuality norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=anderson|first1=irina|last2=doherty|first2=kathy|title= Accounting for Rape|publisher= Routledge|year=2008|page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herman"&gt;Herman, Dianne F.

Since the late 20th century, researchers and activists have repeatedly returned to the issue of rape culture on university campuses, especially in the United States, Canada, and the U.K. Often, victims are dissuaded from reporting sexual assaults because of universities' and colleges' ambivalent reactions to rape reports and desire to suppress bad news. Victims may not want to risk stigmatization and scrutiny in their lives, especially in campus society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Irina|last2=Doherty|first2=Kathy|title= Accounting for Rape|publisher= Routledge|year=2008|page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{non sequitur|date=January 2019}} Victim-hood is a social creation, and is associated with stigma. Definitions of what counts as "rape" and who is treated as a "genuine victim" are constructed in discourse and practices that reflect the social, political, and cultural conditions of society. For instance, rape victims may not be considered as such if it appears they did not struggle or put up a fight.

Rape culture is closely related to [[slut-shaming]] and [[victim blaming]], in which rape victims are considered at fault for being raped. Scholars argue that this connection is made due to a culture that shames all female sexuality that is not for the purpose of reproduction in a hetero-normative married household.&lt;ref name=herman /&gt; That some victims do not report rapes to the police due to fear of not being believed is often cited as a symptom of a rape culture.&lt;ref name=herman /&gt;&lt;ref name=real&gt;{{cite news |title=Rape culture is real |url=http://cupwire.ca/articles/47672 |author=Ketterling, Jean |newspaper=The Xaverian Weekly |publisher=Canadian University Press |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6% of women who did not report rape said it was because of fear of not being believed by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Backman |first1=Ronet  |year=1988 |title=The factors related to rape reporting behavior and arrest: new evidence from the National Crime Victimization Survey |journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior |volume=25 |issue=1 |page=8 |doi= 10.1177/0093854898025001002|s2cid=145645968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victim blaming is part of a phenomenon known as 'Rape Myth Acceptance,' a term coined by researcher Martha Burt in the 1980s. It is defined as prejudicial, stereotyped or false beliefs about rape, rape victims, and rapists which can range from trivializing rape, [[denial]] of widespread rape, labeling an accuser as a liar, stating that most rape accusations are false, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by some forms of sexual violence, or accepting that the victim "deserved it" because she was defined as a slut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wcsap.org/sites/www.wcsap.org/files/uploads/documents/RapeMyths2007.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111120222031/http://wcsap.org/sites/www.wcsap.org/files/uploads/documents/RapeMyths2007.pdf|url-status = dead|archive-date = 20 November 2011|title = RAPE MYTHS|date = May 2001|accessdate = |website = www.wcsap.org|last = Anderson|first = Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause of victim blaming has been the vague understanding of what constitutes rape in the scenario of a victim wanting to have sex with the perpetrator. If a victim wants to have sex but refuses to consent to sex and the perpetrator continues, the situation would be considered rape; however, it becomes easier for others to blame the victim for the situation because he or she did "want to have sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Sexuality: Interdisciplinary Readings|last1=Moore|first1=Newlyn B.|last2=Davidson Sr.|first2=J.

Feminists frequently link rape culture to the widespread distribution of [[pornography]], which is seen as an expression of a culture that objectifies women, reducing the female body to a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willis|first=Ellen|title=Feminism, Moralism, and Pornography|journal=New York Law School Law Review|volume=38|pages=351|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/nyls38&amp;div=26&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=8 May 2012|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of rapists often feature fusion of several pornographic motifs.&lt;ref name="Odem"/&gt;

[[Prison rape]] is a topic about which jokes are abundant. Linda McFarlane, director of Just Detention International, states "Humor is part of the cultural attitude that (prison) is the one place where rape is okay."&lt;ref name=Clark2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/141594/why_does_popular_culture_treat_prison_rape_as_a_joke|title=Why Does Popular Culture Treat Prison Rape As a Joke?|author=Anna Clark|date=16 August 2009|website=Alternet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexualization ===
[[Sexualization]] and [[sexual objectification]] are practices that contribute to the normalization of hyper-sexualized perceptions of women, which is a theme in rape culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Suarez|first1=Eliana|last2=Gadalla|first2=Tahany M.|date=11 January 2010|title=Stop Blaming the Victim: A Meta-Analysis on Rape Myths|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume=25|issue=11|pages=2010–2035|doi=10.1177/0886260509354503|pmid=20065313|s2cid=30657255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hald|first1=Gert Martin|last2=Malamuth|first2=Neil M.|last3=Yuen|first3=Carlin|date=1 January 2010|title=Pornography and attitudes supporting violence against women: revisiting the relationship in nonexperimental studies|journal=Aggressive Behavior|volume=36|issue=1|pages=14–20|doi=10.1002/ab.20328|pmid=19862768|issn=1098-2337}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyper-sexualized or [[Pornography|pornographic]] media is often attributed with perpetuating aggressive behaviors and attitudes supporting violence against women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Media depictions of violent sexual activity are also noted to increase behavioral aggression.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=Mike|last2=D'alessio|first2=Dave|last3=Brezgel|first3=Keri|date=1 December 1995|title=A Meta-Analysis Summarizing the Effects of Pornography II Aggression After Exposure|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=22|issue=2|pages=258–283|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1995.tb00368.x|issn=1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexualizing imagery surfaces and reinforces misogynistic beliefs in some instances.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This media can come in forms of movies, music, advertising, video games and more.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asking For It: The Alarming Rise of Rape Culture-and What We Can Do About It|last=Harding|first=Kate|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-7382-1702-4|location=Boston, MA|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victim blaming and slut shaming===
''[[Victim blaming]]'' is the phenomenon in which a victim of a crime is partially or entirely attributed as responsible for the transgressions committed against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchwald|first=Emilie|title=Boxelder bug variations : a meditation on an idea in language and music|year=1985|publisher=Milkweed Editions|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=978-0915943067|url=https://archive.org/details/boxelderbugvaria00holm_0}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a victim of a crime (in this case rape or sexual assault), is asked questions by the police, in an emergency room, or in a court room, that suggest that the victim was doing something, acting a certain way, or wearing clothes that may have provoked the perpetrator, therefore making the transgressions against the victim their own fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Cole | first1 = Jennifer | last2 =Logan | first2 = T.K. | title = Negotiating the challenges of multidisciplinary responses to sexual assault victims: sexual assault nurse examiner and victim advocacy programs |journal=Research in Nursing and Health | date = February 2008 | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 76–85 |doi=10.1002/nur.20234| pmid = 18163392 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fehler-Cabral|first1=Giannina | last2 =Campbell | first2 = Rebecca | last3 = Patterson | first3= Debra | title = Adult sexual assault survivors' experiences with sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) | journal = [[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]]| date = December 2011 |volume=26|issue=18 | doi = 10.1177/0886260511403761 |pmid=21602203 | pages=3618–3639|s2cid=23676002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Slut shaming]]'' is a variant on victim blaming, to do with the shaming of sexual behavior.

Rape culture has been described as detrimental to both women and men. Some writers and speakers, such as [[Jackson Katz]], [[Michael Kimmel]], and [[Don McPherson]], have said that it is intrinsically linked to [[gender role]]s that limit male self-expression and cause psychological harm to men.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Katz, "Tough Guise" videorecording, Media Education Foundation, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Iris Marion Young]], victims in rape cultures live in fear of random acts of oppressive sexual violence that are intended to damage or humiliate the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Heldke |first1= Lisa |last2= O'Connor |first2= Peg|title= Oppression, Privilege, &amp; Resistance|year=2004|publisher= McGraw Hill|location= Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others link rape culture to modernisation and industrialisation, arguing that pre-industrial societies tend to be "rape free" cultures, since the lower status of women in these societies give them some immunity from sexual violence. In industrial rape cultures, women emerge from their homebound roles and become visible in the workplace and other areas traditionally dominated by men, increasing male insecurities that result in their using rape to suppress women.&lt;ref name="Odem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odem|first1=Mary E.|last2=Clay-Warner|first2=Jody|title=Confronting Rape and Sexual Assault|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYj_woVgA3EC&amp;pg=PA111|year=1998|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7|page=111}}

Others also link rape culture to environmental insecurities, where men objectify women as part of their struggle to control their immediate environment. It is also linked to gender segregation, and the belief that rape proves masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryle|first=Robyn|title=Questioning Gender: A Sociological Exploration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DK8086_VaGQC&amp;pg=482|year=2011|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=978-1-4129-6594-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other manifestations of rape culture include [[denial]] of widespread rape,&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/172024/americas-rape-problem-we-refuse-admit-there-one |title=America's Rape Problem: We Refuse to Admit That There Is One |journal=The Nation |last= Valenti |first= Jessica  |date=4 January 2013  |accessdate=4 February 2013}}

One concern is that the rape culture in the United States can influence juror decision-making in sexual assault trials.

=== Effects on women ===
According to Ann Burnett, the concept of rape culture explains how society perceives and behaves towards rape victims and rape perpetrators.&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burnett|first1=Ann|last2=Mattern|first2=Jody L.|last3=Herakova|first3=Liliana L.|last4=Kahl|first4=David H.|last5=Tobola|first5=Cloy|last6=Bornsen|first6=Susan E.|title=Communicating/Muting Date Rape: A Co-Cultural Theoretical Analysis of Communication Factors Related to Rape Culture on a College Campus|journal=Journal of Applied Communication Research|date=November 2009|volume=37|issue=4|pages=465–485|doi=10.1080/00909880903233150|s2cid=145286808}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a number of rape myths that are held are "no means yes", women can resist rape if they really wanted to, women who are raped are promiscuous therefore "asking to be raped" and many women falsely report rape to protect their own reputations or because they are angry at the "perpetrator" and want to create a type of backlash.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chasteen2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lonsway1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; A theory for why rape myths are so common in society is because they are perpetuated by norms already present in society. Researchers claim that communication and language is created by the dominant patriarchy. In positions of power, men control how women are portrayed in the media, women's censorship of body and voice, etc. which forces women to submit to the gender stereotypes formed by the dominant culture. The dominance of the male language in society creates the concept of a "slutty woman" and forces women to begin to monitor their behavior in fear of how they will be perceived within the rape culture.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

One effect rape culture has on women is their lack of understanding or a feeling of ambiguity surrounding the idea of consent and rape. Burnett's study followed college women's experiences of rape revealing that many students could not define what the term rape really meant, did not believe consent had to be verbal and felt sexual consent was always vague and hard to pinpoint.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Along with this were people believing women who had "allegedly been raped" were "asking for it" because of how they were dressed or their flirtatious behavior.&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whatley1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Women in the study also assumed that men expected sex in exchange for drinks or dinner bought earlier for the woman.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Because of their lack of awareness of what rape was and because of how they were acting/what they were wearing, women believed they had in some way provoked the rape to happen.&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Whatley1993/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Some women also did not report the rape if it did not fit the stereotypical version of rape, physical injury and force committed by a stranger. When raped by someone the individual knew, women felt less inclined to label the assault as rape.&lt;ref name=Brownmiller/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chasteen2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, Dean G., Heidi S. Resnick, Benjamin E. Saunders, and Connie L. Best. "Chapter 10 Rape, Other Violence Against Women, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder." ''Adversity, Stress, and Psychotherapy''. Ed. Bruce P. Dohrenwend. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They could not, therefore, report the incident or rape because they were either confused about what had happened or believed it to be their own fault.&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

After a rape has already occurred or after the victim acknowledged that she has been raped, women still did not report the incident because they felt it would ultimately hurt or punish them. Some reasons that women did not report their rape is because they did not want to bring attention to themselves, psychologically, they did not want to have to remember what had happened to them, and they did not want people to find out and gain a negative reputation.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Because of the existing rape myths mentioned above, women knew that reporting rape could potentially make them out to be a "slut" or "easy" and garnish a reputation that would affect how others perceived them.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bell1994&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = Susan T. | last2 = Kuriloff | first2 = Peter J. | last3 = Lottes | first3 = Ilsa | year = 1994 | title = Understanding attributions of blame in stranger rape and date rape situations: An examination of gender, race, identification, and students social perceptions of rape victims | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 19| pages = 1719–1734 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1994.tb01571.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many women noted that they felt that they could not even admit the rape to friends and family they trusted most because they were so afraid of the repercussions.&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt; Women felt that they would not be supported, would have their validity questioned or be blamed for the incidents that happened. As a result, rape can lessen women's trust in others and make them feel isolated.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

Another effect rape culture has on young women is a victim's self-reflection. After a rape, women reported feeling dirty, thought of themselves as slutty, and believed that they had "used or damaged goods." Women felt ashamed of themselves for what had happened and felt that they no longer fit the ideal "pure and virginal" stereotype that men want.&lt;ref name=Bell1994/&gt; Women's belief that they were somehow rotten and their feelings that no one would want to be with them after the rape created feelings of depression and anxiety amongst victims.&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt;

If women do choose to discuss their rape with others, many still remain under scrutiny unless it is proven that they are telling the truth.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gordon1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Men belonging to the college study reported that they felt the rape was validated if the woman had taken the accusation to court and then won. Only then was the rape taken seriously by men. Men were also more likely to victim blame than women for the rape, especially if the case was not reported. Women who chose not to tell or chose to tell only people who were close to her were often deemed liars or exaggerators when others found out about the rape.&lt;ref name=Whatley1993/&gt; Because no legal action was attempted, onlookers often believed that the rape was "not a big deal" or "must not have happened."&lt;ref name=Herman1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burnett2009/&gt; Without some kind of validation from a person in authority, rape, according to college students in the study, was believed to not be as prominent or affect as many women as was the reality.

Although there is a wide range of research on the consequences of sexual violence on victims, there is little information on the economic effect, especially for economically vulnerable victims such as Black and Latina women.&lt;ref name=Loya2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loya|first1=Rebecca M.|title=The Role of Sexual Violence in Creating and Maintaining Economic Insecurity Among Asset-Poor Women of Color|journal=Violence Against Women|date=2014|volume=20|issue=11|pages=1299–1320|doi=10.1177/1077801214552912|pmid=25288596|s2cid=44525662|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/247da5e5442efeb5682d466b0427c31c8fd844ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; These consequences of sexual violence disproportionately harm these specific demographics, because they make up a large portion of the group afflicted by income-poverty and asset poverty. Simply being from one of these poverty backgrounds increases the risk of sexual violence and discourages victims from reporting a rape crime as there is less confidence in the police services and there is a higher crime rate in areas of poverty.&lt;ref name=Loya2014/&gt;

=== Effects on men ===
{{main|Toxic masculinity}}

"[[Toxic masculinity]]"—a concept posited by some feminist scholars—is a number of negative traits and expectations burdening men in society.

Society has such strict notions regarding males and how they are supposed to act.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Struckman-Johnson|first1=Cindy|last2=Struckman-Johnson|first2=David|date=1992-08-01|title=Acceptance of male rape myths among college men and women|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=27|issue=3|pages=85–100|doi=10.1007/BF00290011|s2cid=145504806|issn=1573-2762}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when males are the victims of sexual assault people don’t normally believe it and that it cannot happen to males as normally they are the perpetrators that engage in the rape.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Men are portrayed as strong, tolerant and emotionally resilient to these kinds of actions.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Many of the men that are victims of rape are often blamed and told that they allowed it to happen because they did not fight hard enough.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; This concept of how men are supposed to act has created such strict notions of how men are supposed to present themselves.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; When men come forward and report the assault, they are often met with dismissal, and rejection by authority figures and medical practitioners.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Often men have trouble when it comes to vulnerability and when men come forward with their assault, authority figures will often treat them little respect as their masculinity has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Struckman-Johnson|first1=Cindy|last2=Struckman-Johnson|first2=David|date=August 1992|title=Acceptance of male rape myths among college men and women|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=27|issue=3–4|pages=85–100|doi=10.1007/BF00290011|s2cid=145504806|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a male has experienced a sexual assault, there have been many reported incidences of negative effects such as suicidal thoughts, depressive episodes, sexual dysfunctions, feelings of self-worthlessness, extreme anxiety and guilt which end up putting a strain on their future relationships.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; This shows that females and males have similar reactions when observing the trauma that is associated with rape victims.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Sexual assault that happens upon men from other men has only been recognized as existing in prisons, however, there has been a steady incline of male rape taken place among incarcerated men.&lt;ref name="Mitchell 369–373"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Damon|last2=Hirschman|first2=Richard|last3=Hall|first3=Gordon C.

== Prevalence ==
While research about rape culture has been mostly conducted in Westernized countries, particularly the United States,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} there are a number of other countries that have been described as "rape supportive" societies. These places have similarities to Western countries in terms of beliefs and gender stereotyping, but there are some significant differences that explain the high rate of rape and sexual assault in these less developed parts of the world.

=== In India ===
{{main|Rape in India}}
India has a rape culture rooted in both its traditional Indian culture as well as its British colonial legacy, which blames victims of rape, is sympathetic to perpetrators, and which treats women who have been raped as "damaged goods" who then suffer further afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patil|first1=Vrushali|last2=Purkayastha|first2=Bandana|title=The transnational assemblage of Indian rape culture|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=41|issue=11|date=19 May 2017|pages=1952–1970|doi=10.1080/01419870.2017.1322707|s2cid=149291524}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are laws on the books to protect victims of rape, these laws are often not enforced, especially when the perpetrator is from a more powerful caste or is wealthier than the person who was raped, there is often a failure to properly gather evidence from rape victims and to care for them afterwards, and there is little legal assistance for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Everyone Blames Me": Barriers to Justice and Support Services for Sexual Assault Survivors in India|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/11/08/everyone-blames-me/barriers-justice-and-support-services-sexual-assault-survivors|work=Human Rights Watch|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krishnan|first1=Kavita|title=Rape Culture and Sexism in Globalising India |journal=Sur - International Journal on Human Rights|date=3 December 2015|volume=12|issue=22|pages=255–259|url=http://sur.conectas.org/en/rape-culture-and-sexism-in-globalising-india/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main types of rape that are prevalent in Indian Society which are political rapes and honor ([[Izzat (honour)|izzat]]) rapes. Beyond the typical type of assault for dominance and control, comes rape with the intention of revenge. Because women are not seen as individuals but rather as objects or possessions, rape is sometimes a political move to seek revenge against an enemy. Fights and feuds are settled by raping the rival's mother, wife, daughter or sister. Honor rapes are used as a tactic to take away sometime of value belonging to the woman. Because women are seen as objects for men to possess, taking away her honor through rape diminishes her worth. The societal attitude of linking a woman’s celibacy with family honor compels her to safeguard the family’s honor in India. However, in the case of rape, instead of endeavoring to transform male-dominated, socially constructed, biased attitudes, people expect women to change by demanding that they dress properly or restrict their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharma|first1=Smita|title=India's rape crisis is worsening, and there still isn't a national registry for sex offenders|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2017/03/10/india-rape-crisis-sex-offender-registry-561757.html|work=Newsweek|date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dhillon|first1=Amrit|title=Men blame women in western clothes: India's rape culture is thriving|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/lets-forget-what-we-said-five-years-ago-india-still-lives-with-a-rape-culture-20171207-h00ygg.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically in India, journalistic coverage of rape and sexual abuse has been limited and typically prejudiced against the victim. Women victims who reported rape were seen as people who do not believe in preserving the honor of their family. The victim often fights a lonely battle against her tormentor where justice is not delivered timely. The increase in media coverage of the 2012 Delhi gang rape case helped to draw attention to the prevalence of sexual brutality towards women in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fadnis|first=Deepa|date=2018-09-10|title=Uncovering Rape Culture: Patriarchal values guide Indian media's rape-related reporting|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=19|issue=12|pages=1750–1766|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2017.1301781|s2cid=151649892|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  In Pakistan ===
Violence against women is seen as a private matter not believed to be "appropriate for intervention or policy changes". This is due to Pakistan's [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society and gender roles that expect men to be violent and women to be fragile. Cultural norms also embrace violence and discrimination towards women, emphasizing that women would not be able to live alone without men. Normalization of violence against women continues to be reflected in the rates of rapes in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Ali2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ali|first1=PA|last2=Gavino|first2=MI|date=April 2008|title=Violence against women in Pakistan: a framework for analysis|url=http://jpma.org.pk/PdfDownload/1372.pdf|journal=JPMA. The Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association|volume=58|issue=4|pages=198–203|pmid=18655430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape is not often reported in Pakistan due to the inequality between the two genders.&lt;ref name="Ali2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=|first1=|title=Hermeneutics and honor: negotiating female "public" space in Pakistani society|date=1999|publisher=Harvard Univ.

They think of themselves as "beghairat" , a person without honor or someone who has lost self-respect, because of what has happened to them and they do not want to be stigmatized or humiliated by society. Women often feel discouraged from talking or reporting about their rape because of these reasons.&lt;ref name="Ali2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afsaruddin1999" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/world/asia/18mukhtar.html|title=Pakistani Woman Who Shattered Stigma of Rape got Married|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable case occurred in 2002. 30-year-old [[Mukhtaran Bibi]] ([[Mukhtār Mā'ī]]) was gang raped on the orders of the [[Union councils of Pakistan|village council]] as an "honor rape" after allegations that her 12-year-old brother had had sexual relations with a woman from a higher caste. In reality, he was kidnapped and sodomized by three men. Mukhar Maiai's 12-year-old brother, Abdul Shakoor (or Shakur), was abducted by three men from the Mastoi tribe, he was taken to a sugar field where he was gang raped and sodomized repeatedly. When the boy refused to stay silent about the incident, he was kept imprisoned in the home of Abdul Khaliq, a Mastoi man. When police came to investigate, Shakoor was instead accused of having an affair with Khaliq's sister, Salma Naseen, who was in her late 20s at the time. Shakoor was then arrested on charges of adultery but later released. In later trials, Shakoor's rapists were convicted of [[sodomy]] and sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment. The Mastoi tribal council (jirga) convened separately regarding Shakoor's alleged affair with Naseen. They concluded that Shakoor should marry Naseen while Mai (a Gujar tribeswoman) be married to a Mastoi man. Villagers rejected this conclusion due to the belief that adultery must be punished with adultery. Mai was called to the council to apologize to the Mastoi tribe for her brother's actions. When she arrived, she was dragged to a nearby hut where she was gang raped in retaliation by 4 Mastoi men while an additional 10 people watched. Following the rape, she was paraded nude through the village   . Although custom would expect her to commit suicide after being raped, Mukhtaran spoke up, and pursued the case, which was picked up by both domestic and international media. On 1 September 2002, an [[Anti Terrorism Court of Pakistan|anti-terrorism court]] sentenced 6 men (including the 4 rapists) to death for rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2006/05/177202-pakistani-rape-survivor-turned-education-crusader-honored-un|title=Pakistani rape survivor turned education crusader honored at UN|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In South Africa ===
In a study conducted by [[Rachel Jewkes]], Yandina Sikweyiya, Robert Morrell and Kristin Dunkle, men from the three districts in the [[Eastern Cape]] and [[KwaZulu-Natal]] provinces of South Africa were surveyed about rape. The prevalence among the men was high; about 1 in 4 men had raped another person, mostly young women.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2011&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jewkes | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Sikweyiya | first2 = Yandisa | last3 = Morrell | first3 = Robert | last4 = Dunkle | first4 = Kristin | year = 2011 | title = Gender Inequitable Masculinity and Sexual Entitlement in Rape Perpetration South Africa: Findings of a Cross-Sectional Study | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0029590 | pmid = 22216324 | pmc = 3247272 | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = e29590 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...629590J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men said they had committed rape for a number of different reasons. Many raped women and young girls for "fun" or out of boredom. Gang rapes were also quite common amongst the men, about 1 in 5 men had participated in one, which reflected the society's belief that it was common and "what boys do". Drinking and peer pressure were also common reasons for raping. A majority claimed they had raped because they were punishing the women, either acquaintances or girlfriends, for having made them angry. Sub-areas and communities saw rape as a legitimate punishment for women and reasonable under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jewkes|first1=Rachel|last2=Sikweyiya|first2=Yandisa|last3=Morrell|first3=Robert|last4=Dunkle|first4=Kristin|title=Why, when and how men rape: Understanding rape perpetration in South Africa|journal=South African Crime Quarterly|date=8 March 2016|issue=34|doi=10.17159/2413-3108/2010/v0i34a874|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some men also had sex with very young women or virgins in order to "cleanse themselves of diseases".&lt;ref name=Leclerc2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leclerc-Madlala | first1 = Suzanne | year = 2002 | title = On the Virgin Cleansing Myth: Gendered Bodies, AIDS and Ethnomedicine | url = | journal = African Journal of AIDS Research | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 87–95 | doi=10.2989/16085906.2002.9626548| pmid = 25871812 | s2cid = 20940212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Young women were often targeted because they were virgins and because the men believed they were easy to overpower and would not report it. Men were not afraid of repercussions.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;

Researchers have attempted to explain the high rate of rape in South Africa and have connected it to the traditional and cultural norms embedded within the society. Certain norms like the belief of rape myths, the inequality between men and women, and the need to express their dominance made the rape appear justified to the assailants. Many began raping when they were young teenagers for entertainment, reflecting the notion that rape is a pastime for young men and boys.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;

Rape and sexual violence are also prevalent in South Africa because of confusion about what is to be regarded as rape. Certain acts of sexual coercion may not be legally distinguishable. While the criminal offense of rape is condemned by the society, many rapes or sexual assaults might not be recognized as such and thus are not thought to be unacceptable behavior.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;

Activist Pumla Dineo Gqola says that events like the rape trial of then Vice President and now President of South Africa, [[Jacob Zuma]] are not surprising and are a reflection of ideas of masculinity and femininity in contemporary South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gqola|first=Pumla Dineo|date=2007-04-01|title=How the 'cult of femininity' and violent masculinities support endemic gender based violence in contemporary South Africa|journal=African Identities|volume=5|issue=1|pages=111–124|doi=10.1080/14725840701253894|s2cid=144623875|issn=1472-5843}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The high rate of rape in South Africa, combined with the inability of the criminal justice system and the healthcare system to contain the crisis, have been compared to a 'gender civil war'.{{by whom|date=June 2017}} The majority of women in South Africa are raped by people they know.

On 17 April 2016, a list of the names of 11 men and titled 'Reference List' was posted anonymously on [[Facebook]]. The post gave no descriptions or made any allegations. However, within a matter of time, students were able to connect what these students had in common which were rape allegations.

====National protest====
On 14 February 2012 the One Billion Rising campaign was launched globally. Its aims were to raise awareness of violence against women, to inspire action for justice and to promote gender equality. The ‘billion’ in the campaign’s title refers to the UN statistic that one in three women will be raped or beaten in their lifetime: approximately one billion women and girls. Many African countries were involved in the campaign, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Gambia, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. Often cited as one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman, South Africa’s statistics for rape and gender-based violence galvanized thousands of South Africans to rise in support of the campaign at a range of events and through various media since the campaign’s inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.7722/j.ctt1814gk2.7|title=Performativities as Activism: Addressing Gender-Based Violence &amp; Rape Culture in South Africa &amp; Beyond.|journal=African Theatre 14: Contemporary Women|pages=17–29|last1=Matchett|first1=Sara|last2=Cloete|first2=Nicola|year=2015|chapter=Addressing gender-based violence &amp; rape culture in South Africa &amp; beyond|isbn=9781847011312|publisher=Boydell and Brewer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 August 2016, four women staged a silent protest at the [[Electoral Commission of South Africa|IEC]] results announcement ceremony. The protesters said that they could not be silent given the rape and gender-based violence in South Africa. Even though President [[Jacob Zuma]] was acquitted of the charges, the young protesters says that an acquittal does not mean the president is innocent due to the failure of the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2016-08-06-four-women-the-president-and-the-protest-that-shoock-the-election-results-ceremony|title=Four women, the president and the protest that shook the election results ceremony|first=Ra'eesa|last=Pather}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural values====
Cultural values stemming from traditional practices still influence South African rape culture. [[Ukuthwala]], also known as "wife abduction", is a traditional marriage practice in which a man kidnaps a young woman with the intent of convincing the girl and her family to agree to the marriage. There are examples of this happening in Hindu societies of India as well. Another belief, kusasa fumbi or [[sexual cleansing]], is the idea that having sex cleans the body, specifically from illnesses. A more specific type cleaning would be virgin cleansing, which is the belief that having sex with a virgin will eliminate deadly diseases such [[HIV/AIDS]]. Kusasa fumbi is a reflection of the indigenous medical views of the country.&lt;ref name=Jewkes2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leclerc2002/&gt;

===Societies in which rape is almost non-existent ===

There are societies in which rape is almost non-existent, such as the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Spivak, Andrew Lawrence (2007).

The culture is also [[matrilineal]], so inheritance and proprietorship pass from mother to daughter.

== Criticisms ==
Some writers, academics and groups have disputed the existence or prevalence of rape culture or described the concept as harmful. Others believe that rape culture exists, but disagree with certain interpretations or analyses of it.

The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] (RAINN), an anti-sexual violence organization, in a report detailing recommendations to the White House on combating rape on college campuses, identified problems with an overemphasis on the concept of rape culture as a means of preventing rape and as a cause for rape, saying, "In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming 'rape culture' for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainn.org/news-room/rainn-urges-white-house-task-force-to-overhaul-colleges-treatment-of-rape|title=RAINN Urges White House Task Force to Overhaul Colleges' Treatment of Rape|date=6 March 2014|website=RAINN.org|publisher=[[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network|RAINN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the report, RAINN cites a study by David Lisak, which estimated that 3% of college men were responsible for 90% of campus rapes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault United States Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women|url=https://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf|website=rainn.org|accessdate=2 February 2016|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is stipulated that RAINN does not have reliable numbers for female perpetrators.  RAINN argues that rape is the product of individuals who have decided to disregard the overwhelming cultural message that rape is wrong. The report argues that the trend towards focusing on cultural factors that supposedly condone rape "has the paradoxical effect of making it harder to stop sexual violence, since it removes the focus from the individual at fault, and seemingly mitigates personal responsibility for his or her own actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf|title=WH Task Force Recommendations|date=28 February 2014|website=RAINN.org|publisher=RAINN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Camille Paglia]]&lt;ref&gt;Teitel, Emma (2013). "[http://www.macleans.ca/authors/emma-teitel/camille-paglia-on-rob-ford-rihanna-and-rape-culture/ Camille Paglia on Rob Ford, Rihanna and rape culture]", Macleans, 16 November 2013; URL accessed 16 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; has described concerns about rape culture as "ridiculous" and "[[neuroticism|neurotic]]", an artifact of [[bourgeois]] [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] ideologies that people are essentially good and that all social problems can be remedied with education. This rape culture concept is much to the detriment of young college-educated women she says. Paglia argues that said individuals are ill-prepared to anticipate or cope with the small minority of deeply [[evil]] people in the world, who simply don't care about following laws or obeying social convention. Moreover, Paglia says, feminist proponents of rape culture tend to completely ignore male victims of sexual assault.

Caroline Kitchens, in a 2014 article in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' titled "It's Time to End 'Rape Culture' Hysteria" suggested that "Though rape is certainly a serious problem, there's no evidence that it's considered a cultural norm. ...On college campuses, obsession with eliminating 'rape culture' has led to censorship and hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;Kitchens, C. (2014). [http://time.com/30545/its-time-to-end-rape-culture-hysteria/ It's Time to End 'Rape Culture' Hysteria]. Time Magazine, 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Joyce E. Williams, "the major criticism of rape culture and the feminist theory from which it emanates is the monolithic implication that ultimately all women are victimized by all men".&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Joyce E.|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|url=https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope00ritz|url-access=limited|date=31 December 2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405183529|page=[https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope00ritz/page/n542 493]|editor=George Ritzer |editor2=J. Michael Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has disputed the existence of rape culture, arguing that the common "one in four women will be raped in her lifetime" claim is based on a flawed study, but frequently cited because it leads to campus anti-rape groups receiving public funding. Sommers has also examined and criticized many other rape studies for their methodology, and states, "There are many researchers who study rape victimization, but their relatively low figures generate no headlines."&lt;ref name="leaderu"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sommers |first=Christina Hoff |url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |title=Researching the "Rape Culture" of America |accessdate=4 March 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6D5GgDDEZ?url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |archive-date=21 December 2012 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sommers and others&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Neil p356"&gt;Gilbert, Neil. Realities and mythologies of rape. Society, Jan–Feb 1998 v35 n2 p356(7)&lt;/ref&gt; have specifically questioned Mary Koss's oft-cited 1984 study that claimed 1 in 4 college women have been victims of rape, charging it overstated rape of women and downplayed the incidence of men being the victims of unwanted sex. According to Sommers, as many as 73% of the subjects of Koss's study disagreed with her characterization that they had been raped,&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hoff Sommers, ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1994, 22. {{ISBN|0-671-79424-8}} (hb), {{ISBN|0-684-80156-6}} (pb), {{LCC|HQ1154.S613|1994}}, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; while others have pointed out that Koss's study focused on the victimization of women, downplaying the significance of sexual victimization of men,&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Neil p356"/&gt; even though its own data indicated one in seven college men had been victims of unwanted sex.&lt;ref name=robin&gt;Robin Warshaw, ''[[I Never Called It Rape]]'', Harper &amp; Row, 1988 ([http://www.union.edu/offices/dean/sart/campus/ cited here])&lt;/ref&gt; Sommers points out that Koss had deliberately narrowed the definition of unwanted sexual encounters for men to instances where men were penetrated.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hoff Sommers, ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1994, 22. {{ISBN|0-671-79424-8}} (hb), {{ISBN|0-684-80156-6}} (pb), {{LCC|HQ1154.S613|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers, such as [[bell hooks]], have criticized the rape culture paradigm on the grounds that it is too narrowly focused; in 1984, she wrote that it ignores rape's place in an overarching "culture of violence".&lt;ref&gt;[[bell hooks]], ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', quoted in ''Feminism is for Everybody'' by bell hooks, {{ISBN|0-89608-628-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she contributed a chapter to a book on rape culture, focusing on rape culture in the context of patriarchy in black culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |chapter=Seduced By Violence No More |title=Transforming a Rape Culture |editor1-last=Buchwald |editor1-first=Emilie |editor2-last=Fletcher |editor2-first=Pamela |editor3-last=Roth |editor3-first=Martha |publisher=Milkweed Editions |year=1993 |isbn=978-0915943067 |page=[https://archive.org/details/boxelderbugvaria00holm_0/page/391 391] |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/boxelderbugvaria00holm_0 |url=https://archive.org/details/boxelderbugvaria00holm_0/page/391 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Kay]], a Canadian journalist, has been critical of feminist Mary Koss's discussion of rape culture, describing the notion that "rape represents an extreme behavior but one that is on a continuum with normal male behavior within the culture" as "remarkably [[Misandry|misandric]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barbara Kay|year=2014|title='Rape culture' fanatics don't know what a culture is|website=National Post|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/03/08/barbara-kay-rape-culture-fanatics-dont-know-what-a-culture-is/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140309204907/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/03/08/barbara-kay-rape-culture-fanatics-dont-know-what-a-culture-is/|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jadaliyya]], an academic initiative by the Arab Studies Institute, published another critique of the concept of rape culture, stating that [[orientalists]] had appropriated the term to promote [[racist]] [[Stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in the United States|stereotypes of Arab and Muslim men]], as well as [[stereotypes of South Asians]] in western media and academia. The critique draws connections between media reports [[demonizing]] [[Middle Eastern]] and [[South Asia]]n men as "racially prone to rape" and similar tactics employed by the [[British Raj|British]] as part of a [[racist]] [[Indophobic]] [[propaganda]] campaign during the [[1857 rebellion]] casting resistance fighters as rapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/9371/orientalist-feminism-rears-its-head-in-india|title= Orientalist Feminism Rears its Head in India|last1= Gupta|first1= Amith|date=2 January 2013|website= Academic|publisher= Arab Studies Institute|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN conducted its 'Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific' in 2008 in six countries across Asia. Its conclusions, published in 2013, seemed to indicate a substantial number of men in Asian countries admit to committing some form of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unwomen-asiapacific.org/docs/WhyDoSomeMenUseViolenceAgainstWomen_P4P_Report.pdf|title=Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study's general conclusion about high levels of rape have been recognized as reliable; however, questions about its accuracy perpetuate the debate about how societies perceive rape and social norms. A closer look at the study's methodology reveals questions about cultural definitions of rape, the study's sample size, survey design, and linguistic accuracy, all of which highlights ongoing challenges in trying to quantify the prevalence of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24713110|title=How many men in Asia admit to rape?|date=1 November 2013|website= Article|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SlutWalk ==
[[File:Toronto-Slutwalk.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The first SlutWalk in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], 3 April 2011]]
[[SlutWalk]] is a feminist organization that formed in response to a public statement made 
by [[Toronto]] police officer Michael Sanguinetti on 24 January 2011.&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/|title=SlutWalk Toronto|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While addressing the issue of [[campus rape]] at a [[York University]] safety forum, Sanguinetti said that "women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized".&lt;ref name="thestar1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/940665--cop-apologizes-for-sluts-remark-at-law-school |title=Cop apologizes for 'sluts' remark at law school |work=Toronto Star |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |location=Toronto |first=Curtis |last=Rush}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it also happened in India created by a group of college students to help address the violence enacted upon women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Borah|first1=Rituparna|last2=Nandi|first2=Subhalakshmi|date=2012-09-01|title=Reclaiming the Feminist Politics of 'SlutWalk'|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|volume=14|issue=3|pages=415–421|doi=10.1080/14616742.2012.699776|s2cid=143816507|issn=1461-6742}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SlutWalk happening in India shows that it is intended for women everywhere and that it should not only focus on urban women.

The SlutWalk movement are credited with popularizing the term via mass media reports about the protesters in the English-speaking Western media.&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2088234-1,00.html |title=Will SlutWalks Change the Meaning of the Word Slut? |author=Gibson, Megan |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rallies aim to raise awareness of rape culture—which they define as a culture in which "sexual violence is both made to be invisible and inevitable"—and to end [[slut-shaming]] and victim blaming.&lt;ref name="TL"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2011/09/23/slutwalk-joburg-takes-to-the-streets |title=Slutwalk Joburg takes to the streets |newspaper=Times LIVE |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slutwalknyc.com/FAQ |title=FAQ |publisher=Slutwalk NYC |accessdate=18 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007174743/http://slutwalknyc.com/FAQ |archive-date=7 October 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; One primary goal of this organization is to deconstruct the stigma that often comes with being a victim of rape or sexual assault. Ringrose and Renold said that "the stigma relates to the way women dress and behave, but in fact male sexual aggression is the problem".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ringrose|first1=Jessica|last2=Renold|first2=Emma|date=1 May 2012|title=Slut-shaming, girl power and 'sexualisation': thinking through the politics of the international SlutWalks with teen girls|journal=Gender and Education|volume=24|issue=3|pages=333–343|doi=10.1080/09540253.2011.645023|s2cid=145322355|issn=0954-0253|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1511524/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A SlutWalk that took place in London promoted several different kinds of attire including lingerie, nipple, tassels, and T-shirts with slogans to demonstrate what women wear is not a form of consent for sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The SlutWalk of Philadelphia was rebranded as The March to End Rape Culture. The idea behind the name change is so the walk can be more inclusive and promotes more diversity in its participants, volunteers, and sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.generocity.org/march-to-end-rape-culture-broadens-message-with-name-change/ |title=March to end rape culture |publisher=generocity |accessdate=6 November 2014|date=2014-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original SlutWalk took place in the city of [[Toronto, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto" /&gt; [[Amber Rose]] is also a figure in the United States where she holds her annual Amber Rose SlutWalk in Los Angeles, California while also raising awareness for empowerment and the Amber Rose Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amberroseslutwalk.com|title=Amber Rose SlutWalk|last=|first=|date=|website=Amber Rose SlutWalk|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slutwalk in Latin America|SlutWalks]]&amp;nbsp;have taken place in some conservative Catholic countries such as Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala. According to&amp;nbsp;"Sex and the Barrio"&amp;nbsp;writers Edgerton and Sotirova, SlutWalk protests began in South America taking on the name&amp;nbsp;"[[Marcha de las Putas]]".&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2011/sex-and-the-barrio|title=Sex and the Barrio: A Clash of Faith in Latin America {{!}} World Policy Institute|website=www.worldpolicy.org|accessdate=13 April 2017|date=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are protesting the idea that women dressed in revealing clothing are asking to get raped. They held the walk in the South American capitol of Buenos Aires on 28 September 1990, a day that was named the Day for the Decriminalization of Abortion in Latin America.&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"/&gt; Due to the overwhelming Catholic influence, some SlutWalks have taken on an anti-Catholic tone in response to sermons, such as the one in [[Costa Rica]], where a leading clergyman preached that "Women should dress modestly to avoid being 'objectified'", adding that the purpose of sex is "fertilization".&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"/&gt; The march even reached the Cathedral of San Jose just as mass was concluding.&lt;ref name="worldpolicy.org"/&gt;

== Media Coverage ==
Rape culture is so prevalent within western society that it is often broadcast on social media. Media and sexual violence among individuals have been linked through social media coverage which re-enforces the notions of rape culture.&lt;ref name="Armstrong 92–115"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Cory L.|last2=Mahone|first2=Jessica|date=2017-01-02|title="It's On Us."

Images that allude sexual content often demonstrate how they wish to be seen by others.&lt;ref name="Armstrong 92–115"/&gt; This suggests that how people portray themselves online could reflect how they are treated and thus blaming the victim for inviting rape to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Cory L.|last2=Mahone|first2=Jessica|date=2017-01-02|title="It's On Us."
