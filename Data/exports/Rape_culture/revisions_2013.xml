'''Rape culture''' is a concept that links [[rape]] and [[sexual violence]] to the culture of a society,&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Joyce E.|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405183529|page=493|editor=George Ritzer, J.

Bollinger|month=October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of behaviors commonly associated with rape culture include [[victim blaming]], [[sexual objectification]], and trivializing rape.  Rape culture has been used to model behavior within social groups, including [[prison rape|prison systems]] and conflict areas where [[war rape]] is used as psychological warfare. Entire countries have also been alleged to be rape cultures.&lt;ref name=leaderu/&gt;&lt;ref name=rozee&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raperesistance.org/research/rape_culture.html |title=Resisting a Rape Culture |author=Rozee, Patricia |publisher=Rape Resistance |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steffes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hpr1.com/feature/article/the_rape_culture/ |title=The American Rape Culture |author=Steffes, Micah |date=January 2008 |publisher=High Plains Reader |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maitse1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maitse|first1=Teboho|title=Political change, rape, and pornography in postapartheid South Africa|journal=Gender &amp; Development|volume=6|issue=3|year=1998|pages=55–59|issn=1355-2074|doi=10.1080/741922834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prof Upendra Baxi India = Rape Culture"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baxi|first=Upendra|title=THE SECOND GUJARAT CATASTROPHE|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|year=2002|month=August|volume=37|issue=34|pages=3519–3531|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4412519|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the concept of rape culture is used in [[feminist]] academia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lomax|first=Tamura|title=Occupy Rape Culture|url=http://thefeministwire.com/2011/11/occupy-rape-culture/|publisher=the feminist wire|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is disagreement over what defines a rape culture and to what degree a given society meets the criteria to be considered a rape culture.&lt;ref name="leaderu" /&gt;

Rape culture has been observed to correlate with other social factors and behaviors. Research identifies correlation between rape myths, victim blaming and trivialization of rape with increased incidence of racism, homophobia, ageism, classism, religious intolerance and other forms of discrimination.&lt;ref name=AOSVOD001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aosved|first=Allison C.|coauthors=Long, Patricia J.|title=Co-occurrence of Rape Myth Acceptance, Sexism, Racism, Homophobia, Ageism, Classism, and Religious Intolerance|journal=Sex Roles|date=28 November 2006|volume=55|issue=7–8|pages=481–492|doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suarez|first=E.|coauthors=Gadalla, T.

==Origins and usage==
During the early 1970s, feminists began to engage in [[consciousness-raising]] efforts to educate the public about the reality of rape. Until then, rape was rarely discussed or acknowledged: "Until the 1970s, most Americans assumed that rape, incest, and wife-beating rarely happened."&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape'' quoted in {{cite journal |title=Sexual Violence Against Women: Putting Rape Research in Context |author=Rutherford, Alexandra |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |doi=10.1177/0361684311404307 |date=June 2011 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=342–347 |accessdate=15 June 2012 |url=http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/35/2/342.extract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of rape culture was one result of these efforts.

According to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Rape]]'':
:"''The term 'rape culture' originated in the 1970s during the [[second wave feminist movement]] and is often used by feminists to describe contemporary American culture as a whole.''"&lt;ref name=Smith2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Merril D.|title=Encyclopedia of Rape|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0-313-32687-8|edition=1st|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept appeared in multiple forms of media during the mid-1970s.

In 1974, the term was used in ''[[Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women]]''{{Context-inline|date=April 2013}}, edited by [[Noreen Connell]] and Cassandra Wilson&lt;!-- careful before wikilinking - currently leads to a singer --&gt; for the [[New York Radical Feminists]].&lt;ref name="FeministsConnell1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=New York Radical Feminists|author2=Noreen Connell|author3=Cassandra Wilson|title=Rape: the first sourcebook for women|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=04yuT9qECsfB0QWW_ZikCQ&amp;id=ej1BAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Rape+Culture%22|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=31 October 1974|publisher=New American Library|isbn=9780452250864|page=105|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first books to include first-person accounts of rape, which were one reason for rape entering the public view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/11/letters/letters.html |title=Letters to the Editor: Speaking Out |newspaper=New York Times |date=11 October 1998 |author=[[Helen Benedict]] |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, the group stated that "our ultimate goal is to eliminate rape and that goal cannot be achieved without a revolutionary transformation of our society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faar-aegis.org/NovDec_74/review_NovDec74.html |title=Book Review: Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women (New York Radical Feminists) |author=Freada Klein |work=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter |date=November/December 1974 |publisher=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Joyce E.

In a 1992 paper, in the ''[[Journal of Social Issues]]'', entitled "A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change", Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio suggested that the term originated as "rape-supportive culture"&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio, "A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change", ''Journal of Social Issues'', vol. 48, n. 1, 1992; published in Di Karen J.

===Slutwalk===
Slut Walk is a feminist organization that formed in response to a public statement made 
by a Toronto police officer, in regards to a rape case, on January 24, 2011.&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/|title=SlutWalk Toronto|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SlutWalk]] and [[Besharmi Morcha]] movements are credited with popularizing the term via certain mass media reports about the protesters in the English-speaking Western media.&lt;ref name=time1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2088234-1,00.html |title=Will SlutWalks Change the Meaning of the Word Slut? |author=Gibson, Megan |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rallies aim to raise awareness of rape culture—which they define as a culture where "sexual violence is both made to be invisible and inevitable"—and to end [[slut-shaming]] and victim blaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slutwalknyc.com/FAQ |title=FAQ |publisher=Slutwalk NYC |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities that have hosted SlutWalks include but are not limited to: (In the U.S.) Seattle, Boston, Chicago, Spokane, Austin, and Philadelphia. The original SlutWalk first took place in the city of Toronto, Canada.&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto"/&gt;

==Theory and manifestations==
According to Chris O'Sullivan, acts of [[sexism]] are commonly employed to validate and [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalize]] normative [[misogyny|misogynistic]] practices. For instance, sexist jokes may be told to foster disrespect for women and an accompanying disregard for their well-being. An example would be a female rape victim being blamed for her being raped because of how she dressed or acted.  In O'Sullivan's article, sexualized violence towards women is regarded as a continuum of a society that regards women's bodies as sexually available by default.&lt;ref&gt;Chris O'Sullivan, "Fraternities and the Rape Culture", in ''Transforming a Rape Culture'', edited by Emilie Buchwald, Pamela R. Fletcher &amp; Martha Roth, ISBN 0-915943-06-9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some, the root cause of rape culture is the "domination and objectivication [sic] of women".&lt;ref name=SA &gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=127046 |title=Sexual Face of Violence: Rapists on Rape (abstract) |author=Vogelman, L. |publisher=Raven Press Ltd (book); National Criminal Justice Reference Service (abstract) |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, academic theory holds that rape culture does not necessarily have a single cause, and causes may be localized based on other social aspects of culture.&lt;ref name=herman &gt;Herman, Dianne F.

Retrieved 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in South Africa the overriding "war culture" which emphasized masculinity and violence led to a culture in which [[war rape|rape was normalized]]&lt;ref name=TL /&gt;&lt;ref name=SA /&gt; A University of California Davis public document alleged that the enforcement of the following of social rules by women and the conditioning of gender roles were major causes.&lt;ref name=UCDavis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.k-state.edu/womenscenter/Emotional%20and%20physical%20abuse/Defining%20a%20Rape%20Culture.pdf |title=Defining a Rape Culture |publisher=University of California Davis |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have also advanced the notion that, in a rape culture women are conditioned to assume responsibility for male sexuality, and gender roles are socially constructed and enforced on women through fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ritzer|first1=George|last2=Ryan|first2=J.

Feminists frequently link rape culture to the widespread distribution of [[pornography]], which is seen as an expression of a rape culture that objectifies women, reducing the female body to a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willis|first=Ellen|title=Feminism, Moralism, and Pornography|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/nyls38&amp;div=26&amp;id=&amp;page=|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fusion of several pornographic motifs are seen in the accounts of rapists.&lt;ref name="Odem"/&gt; Although much of its early use as a theory to explain the occurrence of rape and [[domestic violence]] was focused on the rape of women, rape culture has been described as detrimental to men as well as women. Some writers and speakers, such as [[Jackson Katz]], [[Michael Kimmel]], and [[Don McPherson]], have said that it is intrinsically linked to [[gender role]]s that limit male self-expression and cause psychological harm to men.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Katz, "Tough Guise" videorecording, Media Education Foundation, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Michael Parenti]], rape culture manifests through the acceptance of rapes as an everyday occurrence, and even a male prerogative. It can be exacerbated by police apathy in handling rape cases, as well as [[victim blaming]], reluctance by the authorities to go against [[patriarchial]] cultural norms, as well as fears of [[stigmatization]] from rape victims and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Parenti|first= Michael|authorlink= Michael Parenti |title= The Cultural Struggle|pages=71–79|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QIhkVEPmyTgC&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;vq=rape%20culture&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 June 2013|year=2005|publisher= Seven Stories Press|location= [[New York]]|isbn= 9781583227046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists posit that rape culture links nonconsensual sex to the cultural fabric of a society, where patriarchial world views, laced with misogyny and gender inequality, are passed from generation to generation, leading to widespread social and institutional acceptance of rape. Feminists and sexual activists conceptualize rape cultures that encourage gender violence, as well as perpetuate "rape myths", ranging from treating rape as merely "rough sex" to blaming the victim for inviting rape. Such "rape myths" are social messages that command women to assume pre-defined gender roles concerning sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicoletti|first1=John|last2=Spencer-Thomas|first2=Sally|last3=Bollinger|first3=Christopher|title=Violence Goes to College: The Authoritative Guide to Prevention and Intervention|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=T_ClourcxRwC&amp;pg=PA134|year=2009|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=978-0-398-07910-9|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is reflected in spousal rape. Rape culture perpetuates particular rape myths that are then codified into law. Emergence of the concepts like ′intimate partner rape′&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandbacktogether.com/intimate-partner-rape-resources/ |title=Intimate Partner Rape Resources |publisher=Band Back Together |date= |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ′[[marital rape]]′ is one consequence of these rape myths. In addition, rape culture can manifest when third parties separate the violence from the general reputation and character of the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/louise-pennington/roman-polanksi-perpetuating-rape-culture_b_2585867.html |title=Perpetuating Rape Culture: Polanski and the Privileges of 'Fame' |last= Pennington|first= Louise|date=2 February 2013 |work= [[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Iris Marion Young]], victims in rape cultures live in fear of random acts of oppressive sexual violence that are intended to damage or humiliate the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Heldke |first1= Lisa |last2= O'Connor |first2= Peg|title= Oppression, Privilege, &amp; Resistance|year=2004|publisher= McGraw Hill|location= Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others link rape culture with modernisation and industrialisation, arguing that pre-industrial societies tend to be "rape free" cultures, since the lower status of women in these societies give them some immunity from sexual violence. In industrial rape cultures, women emerge from their homebound roles and make their presence felt in the workplace and other areas traditionally dominated by men, increasing male insecurities that lead to them using rape as a countering method.&lt;ref name="Odem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odem|first1=Mary E.|last2=Clay-Warner|first2=Jody|title=Confronting Rape and Sexual Assault|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VYj_woVgA3EC&amp;pg=PA111|year=1998|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7|page=111}}

The frequency of rape jokes on the internet has been cited as an example of the belittling of rape that characterizes rape culture.&lt;ref name=kacmarek&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julia-kacmarek/rape-culture-is_b_3368577.html|title= Rape Culture Is: Know It When You See It 
|last1= Kacmarek|first1= Julia|date=1 June 2013|publisher= Huffington Post|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison is a common place about which rape jokes are abundant. Linda McFarlane, director of [[Just Detention International]], states "Humor is part of the cultural attitude that (prison) is the one place where rape is okay."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;http://www.alternet.org/story/141594/why_does_popular_culture_treat_prison_rape_as_a_joke&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victim blaming and slut shaming==
Victim blaming is the phenomenon in which a victim of a crime or an accident is partially or entirely attributed or responsible for the transgressions committed against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchwald|first=Emilie|title=Boxelder bug variations : a meditation on an idea in language and music|year=1985|publisher=Milkweed Editions|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=0915943069}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this could take place when a victim of a crime, (in this case rape or sexual assault), is asked questions by the police, in an emergency room, or in a court room, that suggests that the victim was doing something, acting a certain way, or wearing clothes that may have provoked the perpetrator, therefore making the transgressions against the victim their own fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cole|first=J|coauthors=Logan, TK|title=Negotiating the challenges of multidisciplinary responses to sexual assault victims: sexual assault nurse examiner and victim advocacy programs.|journal=Research in Nursing and Health|date=NaN undefined NaN|year=2008|month=Feb.|volume=31|issue=1|pages=76–85|doi=10.1002/nur.20234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fehler-Cabral|first=G|coauthors=Campbell, R|title=Adult sexual assault survivors' experiences with sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs)|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|year=2011|volume=26|issue=18|doi=10.1177/0886260511403761}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of victim blaming committed by the authorities. However, this could also occur among a victim’s peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reddington|first=ed. by Frances P.|title=Sexual assault : the victims, the perpetrators, and the criminal justice system|year=2005|publisher=Carolina Academic Press|location=Durham, N.C.|isbn=9780890893340|coauthors=Kreisel, Betsy Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanday|first=Peggy Reeves|title=Fraternity gang rape : sex, brotherhood, and privilege on campus|year=2007|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814740385|edition=2nd ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while there is not a lot of general discussion of rape facilitated in the home, schools, or government agencies, what information or conversation there is often time perpetuates rape culture due to the focus of the emphasis on techniques of “how not to be raped,” vs “how not to rape.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=RH|coauthors=R Milteer|title=Drug-facilitated sexual assault ('date rape')|journal=Southern Medical Journal|year=2000|month=June|pages=558–561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Basile 2002 201–207"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basile|first=KC|coauthors=Lang, KS|title=Report from the CDC: Evaluability assessment of the rape prevention and education program: summary of findings and recommendations|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=NaN undefined NaN|year=2002|month=April|volume=14|issue=3|pages=201–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is problematic due to the stigma created and transgressed against the already victimized individuals rather than stigmatizing the aggressive actions of rape and the rapists.&lt;ref name="Basile 2002 201–207"/&gt; It is also commonly viewed that prisoners in prison deserve to be raped and is a reasonable form of punishment for the crimes they committed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Sexual assault advocacy and treatment ==
Nurses, doctors and other hospital staff are expected to treat rape victims with respect, compassion and empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Nurses Association|url=http://www.ena.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/Position%20Statements/SexualAssaultRapeVictims.pdf|publisher=ENA|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals that work closely with victims during the aftermath play an influential role in their lives, as they are often the first people the victim sees after the traumatic event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Receiving Medical Attention|url=http://www.rainn.org/get-information/aftermath-of-sexual-assault/receiving-medical-attention|publisher=Rainn|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospital staff that portray understanding and helpful behavior may leave the victim with their dignity, a sense of control, and a positive outlook on their future in spite of recent events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effectiveness of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) Programs|url=http://www.vawnet.org/applied-research-papers/print-document.php?doc_id=417|publisher=National Resource Center on Domestic Violence|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape advocates play an immeasurable role in the recovery of rape victims. A rape advocate is an individual who works directly with victims of sexual assault. Some rape advocates are employed, while a large number are volunteers. They are generally trained through local social service agencies and programs that focus on sexual assault and domestic violence recovery. Rape advocates are individuals who advocate on the behalf of the victims during the hospital procedures, and inform the victim of their rights and the local resources available to them. Advocates can also answer calls for help from local sexual assault crisis phone lines. Within the social service agency, there are often advocates who specialize in various fields such as counseling, legal assistance, group therapy and activism. A victim of rape may come in contact with various advocates during their recovery and the legal process. At times, the advocate who meets the victim at the hospital or who answers their call for help (via a sexual assault crisis line) is not the one who will stick with them during the entire process, although it is possible to request this at some agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Assault &amp; Family Trauma (SAFeT) Response Center|url=http://www.lcsnw.org/spokane/safet.html|publisher=Lutheran Community Services Northwest|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has disputed the existence of rape culture, arguing that the common "one in four women will be raped in her lifetime" is based on a flawed study, but frequently cited because it leads to campus anti-rape groups receiving public funding. Sommers has also examined and criticized many other rape studies for their methodology, and states, "There are many researchers who study rape victimization, but their relatively low figures generate no headlines."&lt;ref name="leaderu"&gt;Sommers, Dr. Christina Hoff. [http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html Researching the "Rape Culture" of America]. Retrieved 4 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joyce E. Williams, "the major criticism of rape culture and the feminist theory from which it emanates is the monolithic implication that ultimately all women are victimized by all men."&lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;

Other writers, such as [[bell hooks]], have criticized the rape culture paradigm on the grounds that it ignores rape's place in an overarching "culture of violence".&lt;ref&gt;[[bell hooks]], ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', quoted in ''Feminism is for Everybody'' by bell hooks, ISBN 0-89608-628-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jadaliyya]], an academic initiative by the Arab Studies Institute, published another critique of the concept of rape culture, criticizing the appropriation of the term by [[orientalists]] to promote [[racist]] [[Stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in the United States|stereotypes of Arab and Muslim men]], as well as [[stereotypes of South Asians]] in western media and academia. The critique draws connections between media reports [[demonizing]] [[Middle Eastern]] and [[South Asia]]n men as "racially prone to rape" and similar tactics employed by the [[British Raj|British]] as part of a [[racist]] [[Indophobic]] [[propaganda]] campaign during the [[1857 rebellion]] casting resistance fighters as rapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/9371/orientalist-feminism-rears-its-head-in-india|title= Orientalist Feminism Rears its Head in India|last1= Gupta|first1= Amith|date=2 January 2013|work= Academic|publisher= Arab Studies Institute|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN conducted its ‘[http://unwomen-asiapacific.org/docs/WhyDoSomeMenUseViolenceAgainstWomen_P4P_Report.pdf Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific]’ in 2008 in six countries across Asia. Its conclusions, published in 2013, seemed to indicate a substantial number of men in Asian countries admit to committing some form of rape. The study’s general conclusion about high levels of rape have been recognized as reliable; however, questions about its accuracy perpetuate the debate about how societies perceive rape and social norms. A closer look at the study’s methodology reveals questions about cultural definitions of rape, the study’s sample size, survey design, and linguistic accuracy, all of which highlights ongoing challenges in trying to quantify the prevalence of rape. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24713110|title=How many men in Asia admit to rape?|date=1 November 2013|work= Article|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
