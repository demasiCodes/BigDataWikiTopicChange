'''Rape culture''' is a setting in which [[rape]] is pervasive and [[Normalization (sociology)|normalized]] due to societal attitudes about [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Sexualization of Childhood|last = Olfman|first = Sharna|publisher = ABC-CLIO|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flintoft&gt;{{cite book|last=Flintoft|first=Rebecca|title=Violence Goes to College: The Authoritative Guide to Prevention and Intervention|date=October 2001|publisher=Charles C Thomas|isbn=978-0398071912|page=134|editor=John Nicoletti |editor2=Sally Spencer-Thomas |editor3=Christopher M. Bollinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is disagreement over what defines rape culture and as to whether any societies currently meet the criteria for a rape culture.

Behaviors commonly associated with rape culture include [[victim blaming]], [[sexual objectification]], trivializing rape, [[denial]] of widespread rape, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by some forms of sexual violence, or some combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Attenborough |first=Frederick |year=2014 |title=Rape is rape (except when it's not): the media, recontextualisation and violence against women |journal=Journal of Language Aggression and Conflict |volume=2 |issue=2 |doi=10.1075/jlac.2.2.01att |pages=183–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of rape culture has been used to describe and explain behavior within social groups, including [[prison rape]], and in conflict areas where [[war rape]] is used as [[psychological warfare]].

== Historical background ==
Historically, women have been considered [[second-class citizen]]s who were not thought to deserve the same rights as their male counterparts. Rather, women were seen as property belonging to men from the moment they were born. Up until marriage, they were considered property of their father until eventually were "sold" to their husbands. A rape done to a woman was not seen as an attack on the victim but a personal attack on her father or husband and she was considered "irreparably damaged."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Lonsway, Kimberly A., and Louise F. Fitzgerald. "Rape Myths: In Review." ''Psychology of Women Quarterly'' 18.2 (1994): 133-64. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 19th century, American women were criticized if they "stray[ed] out of a [dependent] position...fought off [an] attacker...[or] behaved in too self reliant a manner..." in which case "the term rape no longer applied...".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Arnold, Marybeth. "Chapter 3 Life of a Citizen in the Hands of a Woman." ''Passion and Power: Sexuality in History''. Ed. Kathy Lee. Peiss, Christina Simmons, and Robert A. Padgug. Philadelphia: Temple UP, 1989. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to [[rape myth]]s and [[double standard]]s applied to women today, description of rape in the 1800s depicted women who needed to behave or else face the inevitable consequences.

In the 1930s rape was considered a [[sex crime]] that was always committed by men and always done to women. From 1935-1965, a shift from labeling rapists as criminals to believing them to be mentally ill "sexual psychopaths" began making its way into popular opinion. Men caught for committing rape were no longer sentenced to prison but admitted to mental health hospitals where they would be given medication for their illness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Maschke, Karen J. ''The Legal Response to Violence against Women''. New York: Garland Pub., 1997. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Because only "insane" men were the ones committing acts of rape, no one considered the everyday person to be capable of such violence.

Transitions in women's roles in society were also shifting, causing alarm and blame towards rape victims. Because women were becoming more involved in the public (i.e. searching for jobs rather than being a housewife) many people believed that these women were "loose" and looking for trouble. Giving up the [[gender role]]s of mother and wife was seen as defiant against traditional values while immersing themselves within society created the excuse that women would "not [be] entitled to protection under the traditional guidelines for male-female relationships."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As rape was more commonly studied, research in different fields hypothesized why rape was such a common phenomenon. According to [[Susan Brownmiller]], evolutionary biologists claimed that this was how men had evolved over time which perpetuated the stereotype and excuse "men will be men." From a biological desire, [[neo-Darwinist]]s theorized rape was used as a mechanism to spread genes quickly and efficiently. By having multiple partners in a short amount of time, the desire for sex was engulfed by the need to strategically reproduce but with little to no risk of parental involvement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Brownmiller, Susan. ''Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape''. Ballantine, 1975. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and usage==
The term "rape culture" was first coined in the 1970s in the United States by [[second-wave feminist]]s, and was applied to contemporary American culture as a whole.&lt;ref name="Smith2004 174"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Merril D.|title=Encyclopedia of Rape|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0-313-32687-8|edition=1st|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, second-wave feminists had begun to engage in [[consciousness-raising]] efforts designed to educate the public about the prevalence of rape. Previously, according to Canadian psychology professor [[Psychology's Feminist Voices|Alexandra Rutherford]], most Americans assumed that rape, incest, and wife-beating rarely happened.&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape'' quoted in {{cite journal |title=Sexual Violence Against Women: Putting Rape Research in Context |author=Rutherford, Alexandra |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |doi=10.1177/0361684311404307 |date=June 2011 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=342–347 |accessdate=15 June 2012 |url=http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/35/2/342.extract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of rape culture posited that rape was common and normal in American culture, and that it was one extreme manifestation of pervasive societal misogyny and sexism. Rape was defined as a crime of violence rather than a crime of sex as it had been before and the focus of rape shifted from desire for sexual pleasure to one of male domination, intimidation and a sense of control over gender norms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Chasteen, Amy L. "CONSTRUCTING RAPE: FEMINISM, CHANGE, AND WOMEN'S EVERYDAY UNDERSTANDINGS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT." ''Sociological Spectrum''. Vol. 2. N.p.: Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 1982. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Rape also started to be reexamined through the eyes of the victims rather than the perpetrators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first published use of the term appears to have been in 1974 in ''[[Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women]]'', edited by [[Noreen Connell]] and Cassandra Wilson&lt;!-- careful before wikilinking - currently leads to a singer --&gt; for the [[New York Radical Feminists]].&lt;ref name="FeministsConnell1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=New York Radical Feminists|author2=Noreen Connell|author3=Cassandra Wilson|title=Rape: the first sourcebook for women|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=04yuT9qECsfB0QWW_ZikCQ&amp;id=ej1BAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Rape+Culture%22|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=31 October 1974|publisher=New American Library|isbn=9780452250864|page=105|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book, the group stated that "our ultimate goal is to eliminate rape and that goal cannot be achieved without a revolutionary transformation of our society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faar-aegis.org/NovDec_74/review_NovDec74.html |title=Book Review: Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women (New York Radical Feminists) |author=Freada Klein |work=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter |date=November–December 1974 |publisher=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book, along with [[Susan Brownmiller]]'s 1975 ''[[Against Our Will|Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape]]'', was among the earliest to include first-person accounts of rape.

In a 1992 ''[[Journal of Social Issues]]'' paper entitled "A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change," Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio suggested that the term originated as "rape-supportive culture" in Brownmiller's ''Against Our Will.''&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio, "A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change", ''Journal of Social Issues'', vol. 48, n. 1, 1992; published in Di Karen J. Maschke, "The legal response to violence against women",  Routledge 1997, ISBN 978-0-8153-2519-2.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s, the phrase began to be used more widely in multiple forms of media.

==Overview==
[[Michael Parenti]] believes that rape culture manifests through the acceptance of rapes as an everyday occurrence, and even a male prerogative. It can be exacerbated by police apathy in handling rape cases, as well as [[victim blaming]], reluctance by authorities to go against [[patriarchial]] cultural norms, as well as fears of [[stigmatization]] suffered by rape victims and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Parenti|first= Michael|authorlink= Michael Parenti |title= The Cultural Struggle|pages=71–79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIhkVEPmyTgC&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;vq=rape%20culture&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 June 2013|year=2005|publisher= Seven Stories Press|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 9781583227046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists posit that rape culture links non-consensual sex to the cultural fabric of a society, where patriarchial worldviews, laced with misogyny and gender inequality, are passed from generation to generation, leading to widespread social and institutional acceptance of rape.

Rape culture perpetuates particular rape myths that are codified into law. Feminists and gender activists conceptualize rape cultures that encourage gender violence, as well as perpetuate "rape myths", ranging from treating rape as merely "rough sex", to blaming the victim for inviting rape. Such "rape myths" are social messages that command women to assume predefined gender roles concerning sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicoletti|first1=John|last2=Spencer-Thomas|first2=Sally|last3=Bollinger|first3=Christopher|title=Violence Goes to College: The Authoritative Guide to Prevention and Intervention|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_ClourcxRwC&amp;pg=PA134|year=2009|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=978-0-398-07910-9|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 meta-analysis found that overall men perceived rape victims more negatively than women did and this sex difference was moderated by the acceptance of rape myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Rape Myth Consistency and Gender Differences in Perceiving Rape Victims: A Meta-Analysis|journal = Violence Against Women|date = 2015-10-06|issn = 1552-8448|pmid = 26446194|doi = 10.1177/1077801215607359|first = Jericho M.|last = Hockett|first2 = Sara J.|last2 = Smith|first3 = Cathleen D.|last3 = Klausing|first4 = Donald A.|last4 = Saucier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation for the commonality of these myths is that only certain "bad" or "misbehaved" women are raped. This creates a category of women separated from the general population which encourages an "otherness" and reduces the idea that anyone is vulnerable to being raped.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Herman, Dianne F. "Chapter 10 The Rape Culture." ''Women: A Feminist Perspective''. Ed. Jody Freeman. 4th ed. N.p.: n.p., 1989. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the acceptance of rape culture is the [[Just-world hypothesis|"just-world" hypothesis]] which claims that what happens to an individual in life is inherently tied to his or her actions and thus seen as justly deserved. People who believe in this theory would also be more likely to believe women who are raped deserved it in some way. Finally, rape can be attributed to ways women were treated historically, as a factor used to oppress and create control over women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Brownmiller, in ''Against Our Will'', discusses three important ideas that helped bring awareness and attention to some clearly defined rape myths of the early to mid 20th century. First, any woman can be a rape victim regardless of age, size, shape, ethnicity, or status. Second, any man can be a rapist, not just "evil" or "mentally ill" men as thought in previous decades. Finally is that rape can occur in many different forms besides the classic case of a violent, forceful rape done by a stranger.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The idea any women could be raped was a new proposition that called attention to the notion of victim blaming. Now that rape could affect anyone, there would not be a proper way for men and women to avoid it. Some rape myths that were widely accepted on the basis of what kind of women would be raped were ideas that the victim was always "young, careless [and] beautiful" or they are "loose" women who "invite rape" by provoking men."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Gordon, Margaret T., and Stephanie Riger. ''The Female Fear: The Social Cost of Rape''. Urbana: U of Illinois, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Whatley, M. A., and R. E. Riggio. "Gender Differences in Attributions of Blame for Male Rape Victims." ''Journal of Interpersonal Violence'' 8.4 (1993): 502-11. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brownmiller's idea about victim blaming was supposed to expose rape myths thus eradicating victim-blaming, blaming the victim in rape circumstances is still a common practice.

Rape culture can manifest when third parties separate the sexual violence of select individuals and cast them off as deviant perverts rather than acknowledging that anyone can be capable of rape. As believed in the 1960's and still sometimes today, rapists were seen as mentally ill or deviants in society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Highly influential scholars and feminists, such as [[J. Ann Tickner]], have stressed the importance of understanding that because individuals are a part of broader society, they cannot be explained apart from society. By focusing only on deviant individuals who commit sexual violence, researchers and observers can overlook or forget that society influences and reinforces the mindset of such individuals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

As related to Brownmiller's final point about different forms of rape, a common non-believed "rape myth" was the idea of spousal rape or partner rape. Rape myths had suppressed the incidence of such events now known as "intimate partner rape"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandbacktogether.com/intimate-partner-rape-resources/ |title=Intimate Partner Rape Resources |publisher=Band Back Together |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[marital rape]]"; at one time, the view was that women could never claim to be raped by a spouse. Rape cases in which both parties previously knew one another has been coined "[[acquaintance rape]]", a term first coined by Robin Warshaw in 1988, and subsequently used by prominent academics such as Mary P. Koss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Warshaw|first1=Robin|title=I Never Called It Rape|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/I_never_called_it_rape.html?id=gGJHAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, rape culture can manifest when third parties separate the sexual violence of select individuals and cast them off as deviant perverts. Highly influential scholars and feminists, such as J. Ann Tickner, have stressed the importance of understanding that because individuals are a part of broader society, they cannot be explained apart from society. By focusing only on deviant individuals who commit sexual violence, researchers and observers can overlook or forget that society influences and reinforces the mindset of such individuals.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tickner|first=J.Ann|title=A Feminist Voyage Through international Relations|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/a-feminist-voyage-through-international-relations-9780199951260?cc=ca&amp;lang=en&amp;pg|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris O'Sullivan teaches that acts of [[sexism]] are commonly employed to validate and [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalize]] normative [[misogyny|misogynistic]] practices. For instance, sexist jokes may be told to foster disrespect for women and an accompanying disregard for their well-being, or a rape victim might be blamed for being raped because of how she dressed or acted.  O'Sullivan examines rape culture and fraternities, identifying the socialization and social roles that contribute to sexual aggression, and looks at "frat life" and brotherhood ideals of competition and camaraderie. In these groups, sex is viewed by young men as a tool of gaining acceptance and bonding with fellow "brothers", as they engage in contests over sex with women.&lt;ref&gt;Chris O'Sullivan, ''Transforming a Rape Culture,'' edited by Emilie Buchwald, Pamela R. Fletcher &amp; Martha Roth, ISBN 0-915943-06-9, page 26&lt;/ref&gt; In O'Sullivan's article, sexualized violence towards women is regarded as part of a continuum in a society that regards women's bodies as sexually available by default.&lt;ref&gt;Chris O'Sullivan, "Fraternities and the Rape Culture", in ''Transforming a Rape Culture'', edited by Emilie Buchwald, Pamela R. Fletcher &amp; Martha Roth, ISBN 0-915943-06-9&lt;/ref&gt;

To some, the root cause of rape culture is the "domination and objectification of women".&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=127046 |title=Sexual Face of Violence: Rapists on Rape (abstract) |author=Vogelman, L. |publisher=Raven Press Ltd (book); National Criminal Justice Reference Service (abstract) |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, academic theory holds that rape culture does not necessarily have a single cause, and causes may be localized based on other social aspects of culture. Rape culture is a fluid and always-changing entity that is socially produced and socially legitimated, so throughout time and place its definitions will change. Reasoning about rape and rape culture is also influenced by gender and heterosexuality norms, and therefore is also changing through time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=anderson|first1=irina|last2=doherty|first2=kathy|title= Accounting for Rape.|publisher= Routledge|year=2008|page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herman"&gt;Herman, Dianne F.

Since the late 20th century, researchers and activists have repeatedly returned to the issue of rape culture on university campuses, especially in the United States, Canada, and the U.K. Rape culture is easier to pinpoint and identify on campuses, as opposed to studying general society, because they are public institutions where many young people live, work, and study. In a study of [[date rape]], gender-based miscommunications were held to be a major factor supporting a [[campus rape]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1993-21940-001 |title=Date and acquaintance rape among a sample of college students (abstract) |author1=Mills, Crystal S.  |author2=Granoff, Barbara J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Social Work |volume=37 |issue=6 |date=November 1992 |pages=504–509 |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general unwillingness of police and district attorneys to prosecute rapes when force was not involved, or when the victim had some sort of relationship with the aggressor, is also cited as encouraging date rape and campus rape.&lt;ref name=herman /&gt; Often, victims are dissuaded from reporting sexual assaults because of university and college ambivalent reactions to rape reports and desire to suppress bad news. Victims may not want to risk stigmatization and scrutiny in their lives, especially in campus society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Irina|last2=Doherty|first2=Kathy|title= Accounting for Rape.|publisher= Routledge|year=2008|page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Victim-hood is a social creation, and is associated with stigma. Definitions of what counts as "rape" and who is treated as a "genuine victim" are constructed in discourse and practices that reflect the social, political, and cultural conditions of society. For instance, rape victims may not be considered as such if it appears they did not struggle or put up a fight. Their emotional responses are observed and reported during investigations to aid in deciding if the victim is lying or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Irina|last2=Doherty|first2=Kathy|title= Accounting for Rape.|publisher= Routledge|year=2008|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, college administration officials have sometimes questioned accounts of victims, further complicating documentation and policing of student assaults, despite such preventive legislation as the [[Clery Act]], which requires colleges to report on crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/campus_inq/Feds-launch-investigation-into-Swarthmores-handling-of-sex-assaults.html|title=Feds launch investigation into Swarthmore's handling of sex assaults|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/article_d684d872-1e7e-11e3-978b-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Annual campus crime report may not tell true story of student crime|work=[[Daily Nebraskan]]|date=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape culture is closely related to [[slut-shaming]] and [[victim blaming]], in which rape victims are considered at fault for being raped. Scholars argue that this connection is made due to a culture that shames all female sexuality that is not for the purpose of reproduction in a hetero-normative married household.&lt;ref name=herman /&gt; That some victims do not report rapes to the police due to fear of not being believed is often cited as a symptom of a rape culture.&lt;ref name=herman /&gt;&lt;ref name=real&gt;{{cite news |title=Rape culture is real |url=http://cupwire.ca/articles/47672 |author=Ketterling, Jean |newspaper=The Xaverian Weekly |publisher=Canadian University Press |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6% of women who did not report rape said it was because of fear of not being believed by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Backman |first1=Ronet  |last2= |first2= |year=1988 |title=The factors related to rape reporting behavior and arrest: new evidence from the National Crime Victimization Survey |journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior |volume=25 |issue=1 |page=8 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/25/1/8.abstract |accessdate=13 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victim blaming is part of a phenomenon known as 'Rape Myth Acceptance,' a term coined by researcher Martha Burt in the 1980s. It is defined as prejudicial, stereotyped or false beliefs about rape, rape victims, and rapists which can range from trivializing rape, [[denial]] of widespread rape, labeling an accuser as a liar, stating that most rape accusations are false, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by some forms of sexual violence, or accepting that the victim "deserved it" because she was defined as a slut.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wcsap.org/sites/www.wcsap.org/files/uploads/documents/RapeMyths2007.pdf|title = RAPE MYTHS|date = May 2001|accessdate = |website = www.wcsap.org|publisher = |last = Anderson|first = Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause of victim blaming has been the vague understanding of what constitutes as rape in the scenario of a victim wanting to have sex with the perpetrator. If a victim wants to have sex but refuses to consent to sex and the perpetrator continues, the situation would be considered rape; however, it becomes easier for others to blame the victim for the situation because he or she did "want to have sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking of Sexuality: Interdisciplinary Readings|last=Moore|first=Newlyn B.|last2=Davidson, Sr.|first2=J.

Pornography has been commonly targeted as a contributor to rape culture because of adding to larger patterns of oppression. Feminists frequently link rape culture to the widespread distribution of [[pornography]], which is seen as an expression of a culture that objectifies women, reducing the female body to a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willis|first=Ellen|title=Feminism, Moralism, and Pornography|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/nyls38&amp;div=26&amp;id=&amp;page=|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of rapists often feature fusion of several pornographic motifs.&lt;ref name="Odem"/&gt;

Rape culture can be perpetuated via language used in everyday conversations, as well as through overt violence. The frequency of rape jokes on the internet has been cited as an example of the belittling of rape that characterizes rape culture.&lt;ref name="kacmarek"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julia-kacmarek/rape-culture-is_b_3368577.html|title= Rape Culture Is: Know It When You See It

In September 2015, a study done by the [[American Association of Universities]], consisting a response size of 80,000 students, found that 26 percent of women reported forced sexual contact on college campuses while 7 percent reported full penetrative rape. 7 percent of men reported forced sexual contact on college campuses while 2 percent reported full penetrative rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.aau.edu/uploadedFiles/AAU_Publications/AAU_Reports/Sexual_Assault_Campus_Survey/Report%20on%20the%20AAU%20Campus%20Climate%20Survey%20on%20Sexual%20Assault%20and%20Sexual%20Misconduct.pdf|title = Report on the AAU Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct|date = September 21, 2015|accessdate = |website =www.aau.edu|publisher = |last = Westat|first = David Cantor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study found that 9% and 15% of 483 women asked at a single university reported experiencing either attempted or completed forcible or incapacitated rape, respectively, during their first year of college.

== Effects ==
Rape culture has been described as detrimental to both women and men. Some writers and speakers, such as [[Jackson Katz]], [[Michael Kimmel]], and [[Don McPherson]], have said that it is intrinsically linked to [[gender role]]s that limit male self-expression and cause psychological harm to men.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Katz, "Tough Guise" videorecording, Media Education Foundation, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientist [[Iris Marion Young]], victims in rape cultures live in fear of random acts of oppressive sexual violence that are intended to damage or humiliate the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Heldke |first1= Lisa |last2= O'Connor |first2= Peg|title= Oppression, Privilege, &amp; Resistance|year=2004|publisher= McGraw Hill|location= Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others link rape culture to modernisation and industrialisation, arguing that pre-industrial societies tend to be "rape free" cultures, since the lower status of women in these societies give them some immunity from sexual violence. In industrial rape cultures, women emerge from their homebound roles and become visible in the workplace and other areas traditionally dominated by men, increasing male insecurities that result in their using rape to suppress women.&lt;ref name="Odem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odem|first1=Mary E.|last2=Clay-Warner|first2=Jody|title=Confronting Rape and Sexual Assault|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYj_woVgA3EC&amp;pg=PA111|year=1998|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7|page=111}}

One concern is that the rape culture in the United States can influence juror decision-making in sexual assault trials. The result is that men who have committed sexual assault crimes may receive little to no punishment, which serves to strengthen the rape culture in the American judicial system and American society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hildebrand|first1=Meagen|last2=Najdowski|first2=Cynthia|title=The Potential Impact of Rape Culture on Juror Decision Making: Implications For Wrongful Acquittals in Sexual Assault Trials|journal=Albany Law Review|date=2015|volume=78|issue=3|pages=1059–1086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on women ===
According to Ann Burnett, the concept of rape culture explains how society perceives and behaves towards rape victims and rape perpetrators.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Burnett, Ann. ''Communicating/Muting Date Rape: A Co-Cultural Theoretical Analysis of Communication Factors Related to Rape Culture on College Campus''. ''Journal of Applied Communication Research''. 4th ed. Vol. 37. N.p.: Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2009. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a number of rape myths that are held are "no means yes", women can resist rape if they really wanted to, women who are raped are promiscuous therefore "asking to be raped" and many women falsely report rape to protect their own reputations or because they are angry at the "perpetrator" and want to create a type of backlash.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A theory for why rape myths are so common in society is because they are perpetuated by norms already present in society. Researchers claim that communication and language is created by the dominant patriarchy. In positions of power, men control how women are portrayed in the media, women's censorship of body and voice, etc. which forces women to submit to the gender stereotypes formed by the dominant culture. The dominance of the male language in society creates the concept of a "slutty woman" and forces women to begin to monitor their behavior in fear of how they will be perceived within the rape culture.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

One effect rape culture has on women is their lack of understanding or a feeling of ambiguity surrounding the idea of consent and rape. Burnett's study followed college women's experiences of rape revealing that many students could not define what the term rape really meant, did not believe consent had to be verbal and felt sexual consent was always vague and hard to pinpoint.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Along with this was people viewing women who had "allegedly been raped" were "asking for it" because of how they were dressed or their flirtatious behavior.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Women in the study also assumed that men expected sex in exchange for drinks or dinner bought earlier for the woman.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Because of their lack of awareness of what rape was and because of how they were acting/what they were wearing, women believed they had in some way provoked the rape to happen.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some women also did not report the rape if it did not fit the stereotypical version of rape, physically injury and force committed by a stranger. When raped by someone the individual knew, women felt less inclined to label the assault as rape.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kilpatrick, Dean G., Heidi S. Resnick, Benjamin E. Saunders, and Connie L. Best. "Chapter 10 Rape, Other Violence Against Women, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder." ''Adversity, Stress, and Psychotherapy''. Ed. Bruce P. Dohrenwend. Oxford: Oxford UP, 1998. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They could not, therefore, report the incident or rape because they were either confused about what had happened or believed it to be their own fault.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

After a rape has already occurred or after the victim acknowledged that she has been raped, women still did not report the incident because they felt it would ultimately hurt or punish them. Some reasons that women did not report their rape is because they did not want to bring attention to themselves, psychologically, they did not want to have to remember what had happened to them, and they did not want people to find out and gain a negative reputation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Because of the existing rape myths mentioned above, women knew that reporting rape could potentially make them out to be a "slut" or "easy" and garnish a reputation that would affect how others perceived them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Bell, Susan T., Peter J. Kuriloff, and Ilsa Lottes. "Understanding attributions of blame in stranger rape and date rape situations: An examination of gender, race, identification, and students social perceptions of rape victims." ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'' 24.19 (1994): 1719-1734.&lt;/ref&gt; Many women noted that they felt that they could not even admit the rape to friends and family they trusted most because they were so afraid of the repercussions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Women felt that they would not be supported, would have their validity questioned or be blamed for the incidents that happened. As a result, rape can lessen women's trust in others make them feel isolated.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Another effect rape culture has on young women is a victim's self reflection. After a rape, women reported feeling dirty, thought of themselves as slutty, and believed that they had "used or damaged goods." Women felt ashamed of themselves for what had happened and felt that they no longer fit the ideal "pure and virginal" stereotype that men want.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Women's belief that they were somehow rotten and their feelings that no one would want to be with them after the rape created feelings of depression and anxiety amongst victims.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

If women do choose to share their rape with others, many still remain under scrutiny unless it is proven that they are telling the truth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Men belonging to the college study reported that they felt the rape was validated if the woman had taken the accusation to court and then won. Only then was the rape taken seriously by men. Men were also more likely to victim blame than women for the rape, especially if the case was not reported. Women who chose not to tell or chose to tell only people who were close to her were often deemed liars or exaggerators when others found out about the rape.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Because no legal action was attempted, onlookers often believed that the rape was "not a big deal" or "must not have happened."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Without some kind of validation from a person in authority, rape, according to college students in the study, was believed to not be as prominent or affect as many women as was the reality.

=== Effects on men ===
The term used to define what men undergo in a rape culture is "toxic masculinity". This is a gender stereotype burdening the men in society, depicting men as sexually driven, violent beings.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Daniel. "The Gender Rap." ''The New Republic'' ProQuest Business 202.16 (1990): n. pag. Web. 15 Apr. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A consequence of toxic masculinity is that most male rape victims would not come forward to the police or in a survey, out of feelings of shame. The male gender stereotype suggests that men should be tough enough to avoid rape, if raped by a man, or sexually driven enough to enjoy it, if raped by a woman. Men were less likely to report rape because they felt reporting it would undermine their masculinity. This was related to characteristics of submissiveness and weakness attributed to rape victims, opposite of gender stereotypes pertaining to men which focus on dominance and aggressiveness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Pino, Nathan W., and Robert F. Meier. "Gender Differences in Rape Reporting." ''Sex Roles''40.11/12 (1999): 979-90. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Davies, Michelle, and Samantha Mccartney. "Effects of Gender and Sexuality on Judgements of Victim Blame and Rape Myth Acceptance in a Depicted Male Rape." ''Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology'' 13.5 (2003): 391-98. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Like female victims, male victims also fear the stigmatization associated with rape. When they do report, they are often met with disbelief, dismissiveness or blame from police and other services.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Struckman-Johnson, Cindy. "Acceptance of Male Rape Myths Among College Men." ''Sex Roles: A Journal of Research''. Ed. David Struckman-Johnson. 3rd ed. Vol. 27. N.p.: Plenum Corporation, 1992. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, men are less likely than women to reveal the nature of the assault having been sexual or fail to mention any genital contact. They are also more likely to deny and hide how the attack affected them emotionally.&lt;ref&gt;"Male Rape Victims: Noninstitutionalized Assault." ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 137.2 (1980): 221-23. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Male rape victims, in proportion to female victims, are more likely to be blamed for the incident because they are thought to be more capable of fighting back or getting away from their attacker.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Victims are also more likely to blame themselves for these same reasons.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A study done by Michelle Davies and Samantha McCartney discusses why men are often blamed or stigmatized for their rape. They found that heterosexual men were more likely to blame the victim, show less empathy for the victim, deny or diminish the seriousness of the attack, and were more likely to belief rape myths than heterosexual women and homosexual men.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; One reason for this is the societal pressure placed on men to be strong, tough, and assertive rather than passive, gentle and "feminine" as mentioned earlier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Another cause for negative reaction toward male rape victims is linked to homophobia. Davies and McCartney and previous research has found a correlation between male victim blame and homophobia, since male rape involving a male rapist is (nonconsensual) sex between two men. The study also revealed that heterosexual men were more likely to be against the victim if the victim was perceived to be homosexual rather than heterosexual.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Homosexual men, similar to heterosexual women, were made to feel like they had "asked for it" based on their behavior.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Men are more likely to believe myths about rape, dismiss the situation, or become assailants themselves because of the emphasis of what it means to be masculine in society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Dianne Herman found that date rape was most likely to occur when a man had requested or initiated the date, the man paid for the date, the man drove, when drinking took place and when the couple found themselves alone. Because of the effort put into the date, men often felt entitled to some payment in the form of sexual gratification. When this did not happen, men felt it was more acceptable to rape. Herman claims that the American dating system emphasizes men as possessors of females, who can be seen as sexual objects ready to be "paid for."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

To dismantle rape culture would require the undoing of more than just the normalization and tolerance of sexual assault and rape. It would require addressing gender stereotypes in a patriarchal (male-dominated) society and relieving both genders from their pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Frye, Marilyn. "The Necessity of Differences: Constructing a Positive Category of Women." ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'' 21.4 (1996): 991. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In a patriarchal society, men are expected to be dominant: strong, violent, sexual, and controlling. Women are expected to be submissive: weak, passive, decorative, and controllable. Men are socialized to believe they need to prove their masculinity by taking this control and dominating women. This is not only enforced by expectations of men to be dominant but also society's discouragement of men showing any emotions, vulnerability, or sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; [[Emma Watson]], the UN Goodwill Ambassador for Women, said at the launch of ''[[HeForShe]]'' that enabling women to take control and be strong will allow men to relieve themselves of that responsibility, imposed on them by the toxic masculinity in a rape culture.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Emma. "He For She Launch." United Nations Headquarters, New York. 12 Apr. 2015. Speech.&lt;/ref&gt;

This expectation is often traced back to cultural values of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plenary 2 – Redefining Gender Violence – Transcripts from Converge!

Jason Katz explores this concept in the widely acclaimed documentary ''"Tough Guise 2."''&lt;ref&gt;Earp, Jeremy. ''Tough Guise 2: Violence, Manhood, and American Culture.'' A Media Education Foundation Production, 2013. Film.
&lt;/ref&gt; It analyzes the factors contributing to and the effects of gender violence. Part of American culture teaches boys that in order to be men, they must conform to this "box of masculinity," which perpetuates [[mantra]]s such as: be tough, don't be emotional, don't be disrespected, be sexually aggressive, or take a hit. If a boy steps out of this box, especially in the tender years of puberty, he is shamed by peers as soft or weak, which teaches him that being feminine is wrong.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Filmmaker Thomas Keith explained his thoughts on this with the his film ''[[The Bro Code: How Contemporary Culture Creates Sexist Men]]''. Keith focuses on the sexual objectification of women that has occurred in America for decades. He states the American male culture teaches boys and men to dehumanize and disrespect women. Keith addresses several different forms of contemporary media, mainly focusing on movies and music videos that show womanizing as positive and acceptable behavior, pornography that glamorizes the brutalization of women, comedians who make jokes about rape and other forms of sexual assault, and a plethora of men's magazines, books, TV shows that portray their own archaic view of American masculinity and manhood. Keith posits that men's level of violence towards women has reached epidemic levels, and the media coverage and advertising suggest that it is not only normal, but it's cool, for boys and men to control and humiliate women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keith|title=Bro Code: How Contemporary Culture Creates Sexist Men|website=Kanopy|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victim blaming and slut shaming==
''[[Victim blaming]]'' is the phenomenon in which a victim of a crime is partially or entirely attributed as responsible for the transgressions committed against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchwald|first=Emilie|title=Boxelder bug variations : a meditation on an idea in language and music|year=1985|publisher=Milkweed Editions|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=0915943069}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a victim of a crime (in this case rape or sexual assault), is asked questions by the police, in an emergency room, or in a court room, that suggest that the victim was doing something, acting a certain way, or wearing clothes that may have provoked the perpetrator, therefore making the transgressions against the victim her or his own fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Cole | first1 = Jennifer | last2 =Logan | first2 = T.K. | title = Negotiating the challenges of multidisciplinary responses to sexual assault victims: sexual assault nurse examiner and victim advocacy programs |journal=Research in Nursing and Health | date = February 2008 | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 76–85 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nur.20234 |doi=10.1002/nur.20234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fehler-Cabral|first1=Giannina | last2 =Campbell | first2 = Rebecca | last3 = Patterson | first3= Debra | title = Adult sexual assault survivors' experiences with sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) | journal = [[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]]| date = December 2011 |volume=26|issue=18 | doi = 10.1177/0886260511403761 | publisher = [[Sage Publishing|Sage]] | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0886260511403761 | pages=3618–3639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victim blaming may also occur among a victim's peers, and college students have reported being ostracized if they report a rape against them, particularly if the alleged perpetrator is a popular figure or noted athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 =Reddington |first1 =Frances P.

''[[Slut shaming]]'' is a variant on victim blaming, to do with the shaming of sexual behaviour. It describes the way people are made to feel guilty or inferior for certain sexual behaviors or desires that deviate from traditional or orthodox gender expectations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} A study of college women from sociologists at the University of Michigan and the University of California found that slut-shaming had more to do with a woman's social class than it did with their activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Taylor |first1 = Marisa | url= http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/29/slut-shaming-study.html | title= Slut-shaming has little to do with sex, study finds | website = america.aljazeera.com | publisher = [[Al Jazeera America]] | date=29 May 2014 | accessdate= 6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SlutWalk]] movement aims to challenge victim blaming, slut shaming and rape culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wavaw.ca/slutwalk-vancouver-a-march-to-end-rape-culture/ | title=SlutWalk Vancouver: A march to end rape culture | website = wavaw.ca | publisher = Women Against Violence Against Women | date = 29 May 2013| accessdate= 23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SlutWalk ==
[[File:Toronto-Slutwalk.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The first SlutWalk in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], April 3, 2011]]
[[SlutWalk]] is a feminist organization that formed in response to a public statement made 
by Toronto police officer Michael Sanguinetti on January 24, 2011.&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/|title=SlutWalk Toronto|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While addressing the issue of [[campus rape]] at a [[York University]] safety forum, Sanguinetti said that "women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized."&lt;ref name="thestar1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/article/940665--cop-apologizes-for-sluts-remark-at-law-school |title=Cop apologizes for 'sluts' remark at law school |work=Toronto Star |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |location=Toronto |first=Curtis |last=Rush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SlutWalk and [[Besharmi Morcha]] movements are credited with popularizing the term via mass media reports about the protesters in the English-speaking Western media.&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2088234-1,00.html |title=Will SlutWalks Change the Meaning of the Word Slut? |author=Gibson, Megan |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rallies aim to raise awareness of rape culture—which they define as a culture in which "sexual violence is both made to be invisible and inevitable"—and to end [[slut-shaming]] and victim blaming.&lt;ref name="TL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slutwalknyc.com/FAQ |title=FAQ |publisher=Slutwalk NYC |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One primary goal of this organization is to deconstruct the stigma that often comes with being a victim of rape or sexual-assault. Cities that have hosted SlutWalks in the United States include Seattle, Boston, Chicago, Spokane, Austin, and Philadelphia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} The SlutWalk of Philadelphia was rebranded as The March to End Rape Culture. The idea behind the name change is so the walk can be more inclusive and promotes more diversity in its participants, volunteers, and sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.generocity.org/march-to-end-rape-culture-broadens-message-with-name-change/ |title=March to end rape culture |publisher=generocity |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original SlutWalk took place in the city of Toronto, Ontario.&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto" /&gt;

== Around the world ==
While research about rape culture has been mostly conducted in Westernized countries, particularly the United States, there are a number of other countries that are considered to be, by the rest of the world, "rape supportive" societies. These places have similarities to Western countries in terms of beliefs and gender stereotyping, but there are some significant differences that explain the high rate of rape and sexual assault in these less developed parts of the world.

=== In South Africa ===
In a study conducted by [[Rachel Jewkes]], Yandina Sikweyiya, Robert Morrell and Kristin Dunkle, men from the three districts in the [[Eastern Cape]] and [[KwaZulu-Natal]] provinces of South Africa were surveyed about rape. The prevalence among the men was high; about 1 in 4 men had raped another person, mostly young women.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Jewkes, Rachel, Yandisa Sikweyiya, Robert Morrell, and Kristin Dunkle. "Gender Inequitable Masculinity and Sexual Entitlement in Rape Perpetration South Africa: Findings of a Cross-Sectional Study." ''PLoS ONE'' 6.12 (2011): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Men said they had committed rape for a number of different reasons. Many raped women and young girls for "fun" or out of boredom. Gang rapes were also quite common amongst the men, about 1 in 5 men had participated in one, which reflected the society's belief that it was common and "what boys do." Drinking and peer pressure were also common reasons for raping. A majority claimed they had raped because they were punishing the women, either acquaintances or girlfriends, for having made them angry. Sub-areas and communities saw rape as a legitimate punishment for women and reasonable under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Jewkes, Rachel, Yandisa Sikweyiya, Robert Morrell, and Kristin Dunkle. "Why, When and How Men Rape: Understanding Rape Perpetration in South Africa." ''South African Crime Quarterly SA Crime Q.'' 34 (2016): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Some men also had sex with very young women or virgins in order to "cleanse themselves of diseases."&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;Leclerc-Madlala, Suzanne. "On the Virgin Cleansing Myth: Gendered Bodies, AIDS and Ethnomedicine." ''African Journal of AIDS Research'' 1.2 (2002): 87-95. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Young women were often targeted because they were virgins and because the men believed they were easy to overpower and would not report it. Men were not afraid of repercussions.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Researchers have attempted to explain the high rate of rape in South Africa and have connected it to the traditional and cultural norms embedded within the society. Certain norms like the belief of rape myths, the inequality between men and women, and the need to express their dominance made the rape appear justified to the assailants. Many began raping when they were young teenagers for entertainment, reflecting the notion that rape is a pastime for young men and boys.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Rape and sexual violence are also prevalent in South Africa because of confusion about what is to be regarded as rape. Certain acts of sexual coercion may not be legally distinguishable. While the criminal offense of rape is condemned by the society, many rapes or sexual assaults might not be recognized as such and thus are not thought to be unacceptable behavior.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Cultural values stemming from traditional practices still influence South African rape culture. [[Ukuthwala]], also known as wife abduction, is a traditional marriage practice in which a man kidnaps a young woman with intent of convincing the girl and her family to agree to marriage. Another belief, kusasa fumbi or [[sexual cleansing]], is the idea that having sex cleans the body, specifically for illnesses. A more specific type cleaning would be virgin cleansing, which is the belief that having sex with a virgin will eliminate deadly diseases such HIV. Kusasa fumbi is a reflection of the indigenous medical views of the country.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== In Pakistan ===
Pakistan is another underdeveloped country in which rape is prominent throughout the country. Violence against women is typical and the norm, especially marital abuse, as it is seen as a private matter not believed to be "appropriate for intervention or policy changes." Due to cultural beliefs, [[spousal abuse]] and especially rape is rarely considered a crime. This is due to Pakistan's [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society and gender roles that expect men to be violent and dominant and women to be fragile and weak. Religious norms familiar to Pakistan also embrace violence and discrimination toward women, emphasizing that women would not be able to live without men. Normalization of violence and rape against women continues to be reflected in high rates of rape in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Ali, Parveen Azam, and Maria Irma Bustamante Gavino. "Violence against women in Pakistan: a framework for Analysis." ''JOURNAL-PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION'' 58.4 (2008): 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main types of rape that are prevalent are political rapes and honor ([[Izzat (honour)|izzat]]) rapes. Beyond the typical type of assault for dominance and control, comes rape with the intention of revenge. Because women are not seen as individuals but rather as objects or possessions, rape is sometimes a political move to seek revenge against an enemy. Fights and feuds are settled by raping the rival's mother, wife, daughter or sister. According to [[Khaled Ahmed]], a noted Pakistani journalist, "...women are gang raped, then paraded naked in the streets to show to the society that terminal revenge has been taken."&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Afsaruddin, Asma, and Anan Ameri. ''Hermeneutics and honor: negotiating female" public" space in Islamic/ate societies''. Vol. 32. Harvard CMES, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Honor rapes are used as a tactic to take away sometime of value belonging to the woman. Because women are seen as objects for men to possess, taking away her honor through rape diminishes her worth.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Rape is rarely reported in Pakistan due to the inequality between the two genders.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Women do not speak out about rape because they want to uphold their family's honor. Similar to the honor rapes where value is taken from someone's wife, rapes can dishonor entire families. Women whose rapes are found out fear being ostracized or abandoned and disowned by their families. Victims of rape that are discovered might lose their families, their husbands and their homes. They think of themselves as bayghairate, a person without honor or someone who has lost self-respect, because of what has happened and do not want to be stigmatized or humiliated by their society. Women are highly discouraged from talking or reporting about their rape because of these reasons.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

One ambiguity that perpetuates the negative stereotype and reaction toward women rape victims is the blurred understanding between rape and [[adultery]]. When a married woman is raped by another man, if she reports it, the women herself has the high possibility of being charged with the crime of adultery and sent to jail.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Because women are thought to be submissive and obedient to their husbands, the Pakistani culture emphasizes the need and expectation for a wife to be faithful to her husband in all circumstances.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Fear of being charged and punished for their own rape makes women keep quiet about their assaults. Women who do decide to report also face the possibility that they were raped by a government official or other law enforcement officer, thus diminishing the chance of the punishment for the perpetrator and increasing the chance of punishment for the victim.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==

The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] (RAINN), one of North America's leading anti-sexual violence organizations, in a report detailing recommendations to the White House on combating rape on college campuses, identifies problems with an overemphasis on the concept of rape culture as a means of preventing rape and as a cause for rape, saying, "In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming 'rape culture' for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainn.org/news-room/rainn-urges-white-house-task-force-to-overhaul-colleges-treatment-of-rape|title=RAINN Urges White House Task Force to Overhaul Colleges' Treatment of Rape|date=March 6, 2014|work=RAINN.org|publisher=RAINN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in college, 90% of rapes are committed by 3–7% of the male population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House Task Force to  Protect Students from Sexual Assault Unit ed States Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women|url=https://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf|website=rainn.org|accessdate=2 February 2016|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is stipulated that RAINN does not have reliable numbers for female perpetrators. RAINN argues that rape is the product of individuals who have decided to disregard the overwhelming cultural message that rape is wrong. The report argues that the trend towards focusing on cultural factors that supposedly condone rape "has the paradoxical effect of making it harder to stop sexual violence, since it removes the focus from the individual at fault, and seemingly mitigates personal responsibility for his or her own actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf|title=WH Task Force Recommendations|date=February 28, 2014|work=RAINN.org|publisher=RAINN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 interview, professor [[Camille Paglia]]&lt;ref&gt;Teitel, Emma (2013). "[http://www.macleans.ca/authors/emma-teitel/camille-paglia-on-rob-ford-rihanna-and-rape-culture/ Camille Paglia on Rob Ford, Rihanna and rape culture]", Macleans, Nov 16, 2013; URL accessed 16 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt; described concerns about rape culture as "ridiculous" and "[[neuroticism|neurotic]]", an artifact of [[bourgeois]] [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] ideologies that people are essentially good and that all social problems can be remedied by re-education. This rape culture concept is much to the detriment of young college-educated women, Paglia argues, because they are ill-prepared to anticipate or cope with the small minority of deeply [[evil]] people in the world who simply don't care about following laws or obeying social convention. Moreover, Paglia says, feminist proponents of rape culture tend to completely ignore male victims of sexual assault.

Caroline Kitchens, in a 2014 article in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' titled "It's Time to End 'Rape Culture' Hysteria" suggested that "Though rape is certainly a serious problem, there's no evidence that it's considered a cultural norm. ...On college campuses, obsession with eliminating 'rape culture' has led to censorship and hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;Kitchens, C. (2014). [http://time.com/30545/its-time-to-end-rape-culture-hysteria/ It's Time to End 'Rape Culture' Hysteria]. Time Magazine, March 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Heather MacDonald suggested that "In a delicious historical irony, the baby boomers who dismantled the university's intellectual architecture in favor of unbridled sex and protest have now bureaucratized both."&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, H. (2008).  [http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_campus_rape.html The Campus Rape Myth].  City Journal, Winter 2008, 18 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joyce E. Williams, "the major criticism of rape culture and the feminist theory from which it emanates is the monolithic implication that ultimately all women are victimized by all men."&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Joyce E.|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|date=31 December 2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405183529|page=493|editor=George Ritzer |editor2=J. Michael Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has disputed the existence of rape culture, arguing that the common "one in four women will be raped in her lifetime" claim is based on a flawed study, but frequently cited because it leads to campus anti-rape groups receiving public funding. Sommers has also examined and criticized many other rape studies for their methodology, and states, "There are many researchers who study rape victimization, but their relatively low figures generate no headlines."&lt;ref name="leaderu"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sommers |first=Christina Hoff |url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |title=Researching the "Rape Culture" of America |accessdate=4 March 2010 |archiveurl=http://webcitation.org/6D5GgDDEZ |archivedate=2012-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sommers and others&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Neil p356"&gt;Gilbert, Neil. Realities and mythologies of rape. Society, Jan–Feb 1998 v35 n2 p356(7)&lt;/ref&gt; have specifically questioned Mary Koss's oft-cited 1984 study that claimed 1 in 4 college women have been victims of rape, charging it overstated rape of women and downplayed the incidence of men being the victims of unwanted sex. According to Sommers, as many as 73% of the subjects of Koss's study disagreed with her characterization that they had been raped,&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hoff Sommers, ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1994, 22. ISBN 0-671-79424-8 (hb), ISBN 0-684-80156-6 (pb), {{LCC|HQ1154.S613|1994}}, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; while others have pointed out that Koss's study focused on the victimization of women, downplaying the significance of sexual victimization of men,&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Neil p356"/&gt; even though its own data indicated one in seven college men had been victims of unwanted sex.&lt;ref name=robin&gt;Robin Warshaw, ''[[I Never Called It Rape]]'', Harper &amp; Row, 1988 ([http://www.union.edu/offices/dean/sart/campus/ cited here])&lt;/ref&gt; Sommers points out that Koss had deliberately narrowed the definition of unwanted sexual encounters for men to instances where men were penetrated.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hoff Sommers, ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1994, 22. ISBN 0-671-79424-8 (hb), ISBN 0-684-80156-6 (pb), {{LCC|HQ1154.S613|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers, such as [[bell hooks]], have criticized the rape culture paradigm on the grounds that it is too narrowly focused; in 1984, she wrote that it ignores rape's place in an overarching "culture of violence".&lt;ref&gt;[[bell hooks]], ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', quoted in ''Feminism is for Everybody'' by bell hooks, ISBN 0-89608-628-3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she contributed a chapter to a book on rape culture, focusing on rape culture in the context of patriarchy in black culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=hooks |first=bell |chapter=Seduced By Violence No More |title=Transforming a Rape Culture | editor1-last  =Buchwald | editor1-first =Emilie | editor2-last  =Fletcher | editor2-first =Pamela | editor3-last  =Roth | editor3-first =Martha |publisher=Milkweed Editions |year=1993 |isbn=0915943069 |page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Kay]], a Canadian journalist, has been critical of feminist Mary Koss's discussion of rape culture, describing the notion that "rape represents an extreme behavior but one that is on a continuum with normal male behavior within the culture" as "remarkably [[Misandry|misandric]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barbara Kay|year=2014|title='Rape culture' fanatics don't know what a culture is|work=National Post|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/03/08/barbara-kay-rape-culture-fanatics-dont-know-what-a-culture-is/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jadaliyya]], an academic initiative by the Arab Studies Institute, published another critique of the concept of rape culture, stating that [[orientalists]] had appropriated the term to promote [[racist]] [[Stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in the United States|stereotypes of Arab and Muslim men]], as well as [[stereotypes of South Asians]] in western media and academia. The critique draws connections between media reports [[demonizing]] [[Middle Eastern]] and [[South Asia]]n men as "racially prone to rape" and similar tactics employed by the [[British Raj|British]] as part of a [[racist]] [[Indophobic]] [[propaganda]] campaign during the [[1857 rebellion]] casting resistance fighters as rapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/9371/orientalist-feminism-rears-its-head-in-india|title= Orientalist Feminism Rears its Head in India|last1= Gupta|first1= Amith|date=2 January 2013|work= Academic|publisher= Arab Studies Institute|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN conducted its 'Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific' in 2008 in six countries across Asia. Its conclusions, published in 2013, seemed to indicate a substantial number of men in Asian countries admit to committing some form of rape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unwomen-asiapacific.org/docs/WhyDoSomeMenUseViolenceAgainstWomen_P4P_Report.pdf Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific]&lt;/ref&gt; The study's general conclusion about high levels of rape have been recognized as reliable; however, questions about its accuracy perpetuate the debate about how societies perceive rape and social norms. A closer look at the study's methodology reveals questions about cultural definitions of rape, the study's sample size, survey design, and linguistic accuracy, all of which highlights ongoing challenges in trying to quantify the prevalence of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24713110|title=How many men in Asia admit to rape?|date=1 November 2013|work= Article|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
