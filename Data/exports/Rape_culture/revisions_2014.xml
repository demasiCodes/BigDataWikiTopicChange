'''Rape culture''' is a concept that examines a culture in which [[rape]] is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about [[gender]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Sexualization of Childhood|last = Olfman|first = Sharna|publisher = ABC-CLIO|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flintoft&gt;{{cite book|last=Flintoft|first=Rebecca|title=Violence Goes to College: The Authoritative Guide to Prevention and Intervention|date=October 2001|publisher=Charles C Thomas|isbn=978-0398071912|page=134|editor=John Nicoletti, Sally Spencer-Thomas, Christopher M. Bollinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of behaviors commonly associated with rape culture include [[victim blaming]], [[sexual objectification]], trivializing rape, [[denial]] of widespread rape, or refusing to acknowledge the harm of certain forms of sexual violence that do not conform to certain stereotypes of stranger or violent rape. Rape culture has been used to model behavior within social groups, including [[prison rape]] and conflict areas where [[war rape]] is used as [[psychological warfare]]. Entire countries have also been alleged to be rape cultures.&lt;ref name=leaderu/&gt;&lt;ref name=rozee&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raperesistance.org/research/rape_culture.html |title=Resisting a Rape Culture |author=Rozee, Patricia |publisher=Rape Resistance |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Steffes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hpr1.com/feature/article/the_rape_culture/ |title=The American Rape Culture |author=Steffes, Micah |date=January 2008 |publisher=High Plains Reader |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maitse1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maitse|first1=Teboho|title=Political change, rape, and pornography in postapartheid South Africa|journal=Gender &amp; Development|volume=6|issue=3|year=1998|pages=55–59|issn=1355-2074|doi=10.1080/741922834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prof Upendra Baxi India = Rape Culture"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baxi|first=Upendra|title=THE SECOND GUJARAT CATASTROPHE|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=August 2002|volume=37|issue=34|pages=3519–3531|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4412519|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the concept of rape culture is used in [[Feminism|feminist]] academia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lomax|first=Tamura|title=Occupy Rape Culture|url=http://thefeministwire.com/2011/11/occupy-rape-culture/|publisher=the feminist wire|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is disagreement over what defines a rape culture and to what degree a given society meets the criteria to be considered a rape culture.&lt;ref name="leaderu" /&gt;

Rape culture has been observed to correlate with other social factors and behaviors. Research identifies correlation between rape myths, victim blaming and trivialization of rape with increased incidence of [[racism]], [[homophobia]], [[ageism]], [[Class discrimination|classism]], [[religious intolerance]], and other forms of [[discrimination]].&lt;ref name=AOSVOD001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aosved|first=Allison C.|author2=Long, Patricia J. |title=Co-occurrence of Rape Myth Acceptance, Sexism, Racism, Homophobia, Ageism, Classism, and Religious Intolerance|journal=Sex Roles|date=28 November 2006|volume=55|issue=7–8|pages=481–492|doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9101-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suarez|first=E.|author2=Gadalla, T.

==Origins and usage==
The term rape culture was first used in the 1970s by [[Second-wave feminist|second wave feminists]], and was applied to contemporary American culture as a whole.&lt;ref name="Smith2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Merril D.|title=Encyclopedia of Rape|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0-313-32687-8|edition=1st|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, second-wave feminists had begun to engage in consciousness-raising efforts designed to educate the public about the prevalence of rape. Previously, according to Canadian [[psychology]] [[Professor X|professor]] [[Alexandra Rutherford]], most Americans assumed that rape, incest, and wife-beating rarely happened.&lt;ref&gt;Review of ''Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape'' quoted in {{cite journal |title=Sexual Violence Against Women: Putting Rape Research in Context |author=Rutherford, Alexandra |journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly |doi=10.1177/0361684311404307 |date=June 2011 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=342–347 |accessdate=15 June 2012 |url=http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/35/2/342.extract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of rape culture posited that rape was common and normal in American culture, and that it is simply one extreme manifestation of pervasive societal misogyny and sexism.

The first published use of the term appears to have been in 1974 in ''[[Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women]]'', edited by [[Noreen Connell]] and Cassandra Wilson&lt;!-- careful before wikilinking - currently leads to a singer --&gt; for the [[New York Radical Feminists]].&lt;ref name="FeministsConnell1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=New York Radical Feminists|author2=Noreen Connell|author3=Cassandra Wilson|title=Rape: the first sourcebook for women|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=04yuT9qECsfB0QWW_ZikCQ&amp;id=ej1BAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Rape+Culture%22|accessdate=14 May 2012|date=31 October 1974|publisher=New American Library|isbn=9780452250864|page=105|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book, along with [[Susan Brownmiller]]'s 1975 ''[[Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape]]'', was among the earliest to include first-person accounts of rape, and aimed to make the case that rape was much more common than previously believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/10/11/letters/letters.html |title=Letters to the Editor: Speaking Out |newspaper=New York Times |date=11 October 1998 |author=[[Helen Benedict]] |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, the group stated that "our ultimate goal is to eliminate rape and that goal cannot be achieved without a revolutionary transformation of our society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faar-aegis.org/NovDec_74/review_NovDec74.html |title=Book Review: Rape: The First Sourcebook for Women (New York Radical Feminists) |author=Freada Klein |work=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter |date=November–December 1974 |publisher=Feminist Alliance Against Rape Newsletter |accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1992 ''[[Journal of Social Issues]]'' paper entitled "A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change", Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio suggested that the term originated as "rape-supportive culture"&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Donat and John D'Emilio, "A Feminist Redefinition of Rape and Sexual Assault: Historical Foundations and Change", ''Journal of Social Issues'', vol. 48, n. 1, 1992; published in Di Karen J.

By the mid-1970s, the phrase began to appear in multiple forms of media.

==Overview==
According to [[Michael Parenti]], rape culture manifests through the acceptance of rapes as an everyday occurrence, and even a male prerogative. It can be exacerbated by police apathy in handling rape cases, as well as [[victim blaming]], reluctance by the authorities to go against [[patriarchial]] cultural norms, as well as fears of [[stigmatization]] from rape victims and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Parenti|first= Michael|authorlink= Michael Parenti |title= The Cultural Struggle|pages=71–79|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QIhkVEPmyTgC&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;vq=rape%20culture&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 June 2013|year=2005|publisher= Seven Stories Press|location= [[New York]]|isbn= 9781583227046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists posit that rape culture links nonconsensual sex to the cultural fabric of a society, where patriarchial world views, laced with misogyny and gender inequality, are passed from generation to generation, leading to widespread social and institutional acceptance of rape.

Feminists and sexual activists conceptualize rape cultures that encourage gender violence, as well as perpetuate "rape myths", ranging from treating rape as merely "rough sex" to blaming the victim for inviting rape. Such "rape myths" are social messages that command women to assume predefined gender roles concerning sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicoletti|first1=John|last2=Spencer-Thomas|first2=Sally|last3=Bollinger|first3=Christopher|title=Violence Goes to College: The Authoritative Guide to Prevention and Intervention|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=T_ClourcxRwC&amp;pg=PA134|year=2009|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=978-0-398-07910-9|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is reflected in spousal rape. Rape culture perpetuates particular rape myths that are then codified into law. Emergence of the concepts like ′intimate partner rape′&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandbacktogether.com/intimate-partner-rape-resources/ |title=Intimate Partner Rape Resources |publisher=Band Back Together |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ′[[marital rape]]′ is one consequence of these rape myths. In addition, rape culture can manifest when third parties separate the violence from the general reputation and character of the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/louise-pennington/roman-polanksi-perpetuating-rape-culture_b_2585867.html |title=Perpetuating Rape Culture: Polanski and the Privileges of 'Fame' |last= Pennington|first= Louise|date=2 February 2013 |work= [[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chris O'Sullivan, acts of [[sexism]] are commonly employed to validate and [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalize]] normative [[misogyny|misogynistic]] practices. For instance, sexist jokes may be told to foster disrespect for women and an accompanying disregard for their well-being, or a rape victim might be blamed for being raped because of how she dressed or acted.  In O'Sullivan's article, sexualized violence towards women is regarded as a continuum of a society that regards women's bodies as sexually available by default.&lt;ref&gt;Chris O'Sullivan, "Fraternities and the Rape Culture", in ''Transforming a Rape Culture'', edited by Emilie Buchwald, Pamela R. Fletcher &amp; Martha Roth, ISBN 0-915943-06-9&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some, the root cause of rape culture is the "domination and objectivication [sic] of women".&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=127046 |title=Sexual Face of Violence: Rapists on Rape (abstract) |author=Vogelman, L. |publisher=Raven Press Ltd (book); National Criminal Justice Reference Service (abstract) |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, academic theory holds that rape culture does not necessarily have a single cause, and causes may be localized based on other social aspects of culture.&lt;ref name="herman"&gt;Herman, Dianne F. "[http://homepage.smc.edu/delpiccolo_guido/Soc1/soc1readings/rape%20culture_final.pdf The Rape Culture]". Printed in ''Women: A Feminist Perspective'' (ed. Jo Freeman). Mcgraw Hill, 1994. Retrieved 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in South Africa the overriding "war culture" which emphasized masculinity and violence led to a culture in which [[war rape|rape was normalized]].&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TL"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2011/09/23/slutwalk-joburg-takes-to-the-streets |title=Slutwalk Joburg takes to the streets |newspaper=Times LIVE |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[University of California, Davis|University of California Davis]] public document alleged that the enforcement of the following of social rules by women and the conditioning of gender roles were major causes.&lt;ref name="UCDavis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.k-state.edu/womenscenter/Emotional%20and%20physical%20abuse/Defining%20a%20Rape%20Culture.pdf |title=Defining a Rape Culture |publisher=University of California Davis |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others say in a rape culture women are conditioned to assume responsibility for male sexuality, and gender roles are socially constructed and enforced on women through fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ritzer|first1=George|last2=Ryan|first2=J. Michael|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4wU64f_JYC&amp;pg=PA493|date=3 December 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9264-7|page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of [[date rape]], gender-based miscommunications were held to be a major factor supporting a [[campus rape]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1993-21940-001 |title=Date and acquaintance rape among a sample of college students (abstract) |author=Mills, Crystal S. and Granoff, Barbara J. |journal=Social Work |volume=37 |issue=6 |date=November 1992 |pages=504–509 |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general unwillingness of police and district attorneys to prosecute rapes where force was not involved or where the victim had some sort of relationship with the aggressor is also cited as a motivation for date rape and campus rape.&lt;ref name=herman /&gt; In addition, there have been reported incidents of colleges questioning accounts of alleged victims, further complicating documentation and policing of student assaults, despite such preventative legislation as the [[Clery Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/campus_inq/Feds-launch-investigation-into-Swarthmores-handling-of-sex-assaults.html|title=Feds launch investigation into Swarthmore's handling of sex assaults|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynebraskan.com/news/article_d684d872-1e7e-11e3-978b-001a4bcf6878.html|title=Annual campus crime report may not tell true story of student crime|work=[[Daily Nebraskan]]|date=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape culture is also closely related to [[slut-shaming]] and [[victim blaming]], where rape victims are considered at fault for being raped, and it is argued that this connection is due to the presence of a culture that shames all female sexuality.&lt;ref name=herman /&gt; That some rapes are not reported to the police due to fear that they would not be believed is often cited as a symptom of a rape culture,&lt;ref name=herman /&gt;&lt;ref name=real&gt;{{cite news |title=Rape culture is real |url=http://cupwire.ca/articles/47672 |author=Ketterling, Jean |newspaper=The Xaverian Weekly |publisher=Canadian University Press |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they thought the police would not believe them is cited as a reason by 6% of women who did not report rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Backman |first1=Ronet  |last2= |first2= |year=1988 |title=The factors related to rape reporting behavior and arrest: new evidence from the National Crime Victimization Survey |journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior |volume=25 |issue=1 |page=8 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/25/1/8.abstract |accessdate=13 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography has also been commonly targeted as a contributor to rape culture because it is said to contribute to larger patterns of oppression.  Feminists frequently link rape culture to the widespread distribution of [[pornography]], which is seen as an expression of a culture that objectifies women, reducing the female body to a commodity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willis|first=Ellen|title=Feminism, Moralism, and Pornography|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/nyls38&amp;div=26&amp;id=&amp;page=|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fusion of several pornographic motifs are seen in the accounts of rapists.&lt;ref name="Odem"/&gt;

Rape culture can be perpetuated via language used in everyday conversations. The frequency of rape jokes on the internet has been cited as an example of the belittling of rape that characterizes rape culture.&lt;ref name="kacmarek"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julia-kacmarek/rape-culture-is_b_3368577.html|title= Rape Culture Is: Know It When You See It 
|last1= Kacmarek|first1= Julia|date=1 June 2013|publisher= Huffington Post|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prison rape]] is a topic about which jokes are abundant. Linda McFarlane, director of [[Just Detention International]], states "Humor is part of the cultural attitude that (prison) is the one place where rape is okay."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;http://www.alternet.org/story/141594/why_does_popular_culture_treat_prison_rape_as_a_joke&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Rape culture has been described as detrimental to men as well as women. Some writers and speakers, such as [[Jackson Katz]], [[Michael Kimmel]], and [[Don McPherson]], have said that it is intrinsically linked to [[gender role]]s that limit male self-expression and cause psychological harm to men.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Katz, "Tough Guise" videorecording, Media Education Foundation, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientist [[Iris Marion Young]], victims in rape cultures live in fear of random acts of oppressive sexual violence that are intended to damage or humiliate the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Heldke |first1= Lisa |last2= O'Connor |first2= Peg|title= Oppression, Privilege, &amp; Resistance|year=2004|publisher= McGraw Hill|location= Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others link rape culture with modernisation and industrialisation, arguing that pre-industrial societies tend to be "rape free" cultures, since the lower status of women in these societies give them some immunity from sexual violence. In industrial rape cultures, women emerge from their homebound roles and make their presence felt in the workplace and other areas traditionally dominated by men, increasing male insecurities that lead to them using rape as a countering method.&lt;ref name="Odem"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odem|first1=Mary E.|last2=Clay-Warner|first2=Jody|title=Confronting Rape and Sexual Assault|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VYj_woVgA3EC&amp;pg=PA111|year=1998|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8420-2599-7|page=111}}

==Victim blaming and slut shaming==

''For more details on this topic, see [[Victim blaming]] and [[Slut-shaming]].''

'''Victim blaming''' is the phenomenon in which a victim of a crime or an accident is partially or entirely attributed or responsible for the transgressions committed against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchwald|first=Emilie|title=Boxelder bug variations : a meditation on an idea in language and music|year=1985|publisher=Milkweed Editions|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=0915943069}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this could take place when a victim of a crime, (in this case rape or sexual assault), is asked questions by the police, in an emergency room, or in a court room, that suggests that the victim was doing something, acting a certain way, or wearing clothes that may have provoked the perpetrator, therefore making the transgressions against the victim their own fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cole|first=J|author2=Logan, TK |title=Negotiating the challenges of multidisciplinary responses to sexual assault victims: sexual assault nurse examiner and victim advocacy programs.|journal=Research in Nursing and Health|date=Feb 2008|volume=31|issue=1|pages=76–85|doi=10.1002/nur.20234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fehler-Cabral|first=G|author2=Campbell, R |title=Adult sexual assault survivors' experiences with sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs)|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|year=2011|volume=26|issue=18|doi=10.1177/0886260511403761}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of victim blaming committed by the authorities. However, this could also occur among a victim’s peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reddington|first=ed. by Frances P.|title=Sexual assault : the victims, the perpetrators, and the criminal justice system|year=2005|publisher=Carolina Academic Press|location=Durham, N.C.|isbn=9780890893340|author2=Kreisel, Betsy Wright }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanday|first=Peggy Reeves|title=Fraternity gang rape : sex, brotherhood, and privilege on campus|year=2007|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814740385|edition=2nd ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while there is not a lot of general discussion of rape facilitated in the home, schools, or government agencies, what information or conversation there is often time perpetuates rape culture due to the focus of the emphasis on techniques of “how not to be raped,” vs “how not to rape.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=RH|author2=R Milteer |title=Drug-facilitated sexual assault ('date rape')|journal=Southern Medical Journal|date=June 2000|pages=558–561}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Basile 2002 201–207"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basile|first=KC|author2=Lang, KS |title=Report from the CDC: Evaluability assessment of the rape prevention and education program: summary of findings and recommendations|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=April 2002|volume=14|issue=3|pages=201–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is problematic due to the stigma created and transgressed against the already victimized individuals rather than stigmatizing the aggressive actions of rape and the rapists.&lt;ref name="Basile 2002 201–207"/&gt; It is also commonly viewed that prisoners in prison deserve to be raped and is a reasonable form of punishment for the crimes they committed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

'''Slut shaming''' is a variant on victim blaming, to do with the shaming of sexual behaviour. It describes the way people are made to feel guilty or inferior for certain sexual behaviors or desires that deviate from traditional or orthodox gender expectations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The [[SlutWalk]] movement aims to challenge victim blaming, slut shaming and rape culture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Sexual assault advocacy and treatment ==
Nurses, doctors and hospital staff are often trained to deal with the emotional well-being of rape victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Nurses Association|url=http://www.ena.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/Position%20Statements/SexualAssaultRapeVictims.pdf|publisher=ENA|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals that work closely with victims during the aftermath are often the first people the victim sees after the traumatic event and can play an important role in their recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Receiving Medical Attention|url=http://www.rainn.org/get-information/aftermath-of-sexual-assault/receiving-medical-attention|publisher=Rainn|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hospital staff that portray understanding and helpful behavior may leave the victim a sense of control and a positive outlook on their future in spite of their experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effectiveness of Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) Programs|url=http://www.vawnet.org/applied-research-papers/print-document.php?doc_id=417|publisher=National Resource Center on Domestic Violence|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape advocates often play a role in the recovery of rape victims. A rape advocate is an individual, employed or volunteer, who works directly with victims of sexual assault, advocating on their behalf during the hospital procedures and informing them of their rights and the local resources available to them. Rape advocates are often trained through local social service agencies and sexual assault recovery programs.  Advocates can also answer calls for help from local sexual assault crisis phone lines. Within the social service agency, there are often advocates who specialize in various fields such as counseling, legal assistance, group therapy and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Assault &amp; Family Trauma (SAFeT) Response Center|url=http://www.lcsnw.org/spokane/safet.html|publisher=Lutheran Community Services Northwest|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SlutWalk ==
[[SlutWalk]] is a feminist organization that formed in response to a public statement made 
by Toronto police officer Michael Sanguinetti on January 24, 2011.&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/|title=SlutWalk Toronto|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While addressing the issue of [[campus rape]] at a [[York University]] safety forum, Sanguinetti said that "women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized."&lt;ref name="thestar1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/article/940665--cop-apologizes-for-sluts-remark-at-law-school |title=Cop apologizes for ‘sluts' remark at law school |work=Toronto Star |date=February 18, 2011 |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |location=Toronto |first=Curtis |last=Rush}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SlutWalk and [[Besharmi Morcha]] movements are credited with popularizing the term via mass media reports about the protesters in the English-speaking Western media.&lt;ref name="time1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2088234-1,00.html |title=Will SlutWalks Change the Meaning of the Word Slut? |author=Gibson, Megan |publisher=TIME Magazine |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rallies aim to raise awareness of rape culture—which they define as a culture in which "sexual violence is both made to be invisible and inevitable"—and to end [[slut-shaming]] and victim blaming.&lt;ref name="TL" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slutwalknyc.com/FAQ |title=FAQ |publisher=Slutwalk NYC |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One primary goal of this organization is to deconstruct the stigma that often comes with being a victim of rape or sexual-assault. Cities that have hosted SlutWalks include but are not limited to: (In the U.S.) Seattle, Boston, Chicago, Spokane, Austin, and Philadelphia.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} The SlutWalk of Philadelphia was rebranded as The March to End Rape Culture. The idea behind the name change is so the walk can be more inclusive and promotes more diversity in its participants, volunteers, and sponsors. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.generocity.org/march-to-end-rape-culture-broadens-message-with-name-change/ |title=March to end rape culture |publisher=generocity |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original SlutWalk took place in the city of Toronto, Canada.&lt;ref name="Slutwalk_Toronto" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==

[[RAINN]], one of North America's leading anti-sexual violence organizations, in a report detailing recommendations to the White House on combating rape on college campuses, decries an overemphasis on the concept of rape culture as a means of preventing rape and as a cause for rape, saying, "In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming 'rape culture' for the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out the systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple fact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small percentage of the community, to commit a violent crime."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rainn.org/news-room/rainn-urges-white-house-task-force-to-overhaul-colleges-treatment-of-rape&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in college, 90% of rapes are committed by 3% of the male population, though it is stipulated that they do not have reliable numbers for female perpetrators. RAINN argues that rape is the product of individuals who have decided to disregard the overwhelming cultural message that rape is wrong. The report argues that trend towards focusing on cultural factors that supposedly condone rape "has the paradoxical effect of making it harder to stop sexual violence, since it removes the focus from the individual at fault, and seemingly mitigates personal responsibility for his or her own actions".&lt;ref&gt;http://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Caroline Kitchens, in a 2014 article in ''Time Magazine'' titled "It’s Time to End ‘Rape Culture’ Hysteria" suggested that "Though rape is certainly a serious problem, there’s no evidence that it’s considered a cultural norm. ...On college campuses, obsession with eliminating 'rape culture' has led to censorship and hysteria."&lt;ref&gt;Kitchens, C. (2014). [http://time.com/30545/its-time-to-end-rape-culture-hysteria/ It’s Time to End ‘Rape Culture’ Hysteria]. Time Magazine, March 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Heather MacDonald suggested that "In a delicious historical irony, the baby boomers who dismantled the university’s intellectual architecture in favor of unbridled sex and protest have now bureaucratized both."&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, H. (2008).  [http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_campus_rape.html The Campus Rape Myth].  City Journal, Winter 2008, 18 (1).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joyce E. Williams, "the major criticism of rape culture and the feminist theory from which it emanates is the monolithic implication that ultimately all women are victimized by all men."&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Joyce E.|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|date=31 December 2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1405183529|page=493|editor=George Ritzer, J. Michael Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has disputed the existence of rape culture, arguing that the common "one in four women will be raped in her lifetime" claim is based on a flawed study, but frequently cited because it leads to campus anti-rape groups receiving public funding. Sommers has also examined and criticized many other rape studies for their methodology, and states, "There are many researchers who study rape victimization, but their relatively low figures generate no headlines."&lt;ref name="leaderu"&gt;Sommers, Dr. Christina Hoff. [http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html Researching the "Rape Culture" of America]. Retrieved 4 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sommers and others&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Neil p356"&gt;Gilbert, Neil. Realities and mythologies of rape. Society, Jan-Feb 1998 v35 n2 p356(7)&lt;/ref&gt; have specifically questioned Mary Koss's oft-cited 1984 study that claimed 1 in 4 college women have been victims of rape, charging it overstated rape of women and downplayed the incidence of men being the victims of unwanted sex. According to Sommers, as many as 73% of the subjects of Koss's study disagreed with her characterization that they had been raped,&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hoff Sommers, ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Simon and Schuster]], 1994, 22. ISBN 0-671-79424-8 (hb), ISBN 0-684-80156-6 (pb), {{LCC|HQ1154.S613|1994}}, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; while others have pointed out that Koss's study focused on the victimization of women, downplaying the significance of sexual victimization of men,&lt;ref name="Gilbert, Neil p356"/&gt; even though its own data indicated one in seven college men had been victims of unwanted sex.&lt;ref name=robin&gt;Robin Warshaw, ''[[I Never Called It Rape]]'', Harper &amp; Row, 1988 ([http://www.union.edu/offices/dean/sart/campus/ cited here])&lt;/ref&gt; Sommers points out that Koss had deliberately narrowed the definition of unwanted sexual encounters for men to instances where men were penetrated.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Hoff Sommers, ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Simon and Schuster]], 1994, 22. ISBN 0-671-79424-8 (hb), ISBN 0-684-80156-6 (pb), {{LCC|HQ1154.S613|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers, such as [[bell hooks]], have criticized the rape culture paradigm on the grounds that it is too narrowly focused; in 1984, she wrote that it ignores rape's place in an overarching "culture of violence".&lt;ref&gt;[[bell hooks]], ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', quoted in ''Feminism is for Everybody'' by bell hooks, ISBN 0-89608-628-3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she contributed a chapter to a book on rape culture, focusing on rape culture in the context of patriarchy in black culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last=hooks |first=bell |chapter=Seduced By Violence No More |title=Transforming a Rape Culture | editor1-last  =Buchwald | editor1-first =Emilie | editor2-last  =Fletcher | editor2-first =Pamela | editor3-last  =Roth | editor3-first =Martha |publisher=Milkweed Editions |year=1993 |chapter=Editor's Preface |isbn=0915943069 |page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Kay]], a Canadian journalist, has been critical of feminist Mary Koss's discussion of rape culture, describing the notion that “rape represents an extreme behavior but one that is on a continuum with normal male behavior within the culture" as "remarkably [[misandric]]".&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Kay, (2014) ‘Rape culture’ fanatics don’t know what a culture is",  National Post,  http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2014/03/08/barbara-kay-rape-culture-fanatics-dont-know-what-a-culture-is/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jadaliyya]], an academic initiative by the Arab Studies Institute, published another critique of the concept of rape culture, criticizing the appropriation of the term by [[orientalists]] to promote [[racist]] [[Stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in the United States|stereotypes of Arab and Muslim men]], as well as [[stereotypes of South Asians]] in western media and academia. The critique draws connections between media reports [[demonizing]] [[Middle Eastern]] and [[South Asia]]n men as "racially prone to rape" and similar tactics employed by the [[British Raj|British]] as part of a [[racist]] [[Indophobic]] [[propaganda]] campaign during the [[1857 rebellion]] casting resistance fighters as rapists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/9371/orientalist-feminism-rears-its-head-in-india|title= Orientalist Feminism Rears its Head in India|last1= Gupta|first1= Amith|date=2 January 2013|work= Academic|publisher= Arab Studies Institute|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN conducted its ‘Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific’ in 2008 in six countries across Asia. Its conclusions, published in 2013, seemed to indicate a substantial number of men in Asian countries admit to committing some form of rape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unwomen-asiapacific.org/docs/WhyDoSomeMenUseViolenceAgainstWomen_P4P_Report.pdf Multi-country Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific]&lt;/ref&gt; The study’s general conclusion about high levels of rape have been recognized as reliable; however, questions about its accuracy perpetuate the debate about how societies perceive rape and social norms. A closer look at the study’s methodology reveals questions about cultural definitions of rape, the study’s sample size, survey design, and linguistic accuracy, all of which highlights ongoing challenges in trying to quantify the prevalence of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24713110|title=How many men in Asia admit to rape?|date=1 November 2013|work= Article|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
