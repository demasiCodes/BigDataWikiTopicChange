The '''Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women''' ('''CEDAW''') is an international convention adopted in [[1979]] by the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]].
Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for [[woman|women]], it came into force on 3 September 1981. The [[United States]] is the only developed nation that has not ratified the CEDAW. Several countries have ratified the Convention subject to certain declarations, reservations and objections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reservations-country.htm Declarations, Reservations and Objections to CEDAW]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Convention==
The Convention defines discrimination against women in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also establishes an agenda of action for putting an end to sex-based discrimination:


States ratifying the Convention are required to enshrine [[gender equality]] into their domestic legislation, repeal all discriminatory provisions in their laws, and enact new provisions to guard against discrimination against women. However the special protection for [[maternity]] is not regarded as the discrimination (Article 4). And all appropriate measure, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of [[prostitution]] of women (Article 6). As the right for [[education]] equal opportunity for [[scholarship]] for female students is ensured (Article 10). They must also establish tribunals and public institutions to guarantee women effective protection against discrimination, and take steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination practiced against women by individuals, organizations, and [[enterprise]]s.

==Members and ratification==
{{Main|List of parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women}}

The seven UN member states that have not ratified the convention are [[Iran]], [[Nauru]], [[Palau]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Tonga]], and the [[United States]]. These are either Islamic states (Iran, Somalia, Sudan) or small Pacific Island nations (Nauru, Palau, Tonga), or the United States. [[Niue]] and the [[Vatican City]] have also not signed it. The [[United States]] has signed, but not yet ratified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/CEDAW%20Ratification%20Table%20IV-8.en.pdf Member states]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, after much pressure from women's organizations such as the [[National Alliance of Taiwan Women's Associations]], Taiwan's [[Legislative Yuan]] ratified the stipulations of CEDAW into its own domestic policy. It is still awaiting CEDAW's approval of its ratification.&lt;ref&gt;Government Information Office, Republic of China (Taiwan). "Taiwan Aims to Sign Up Against Discrimination." September 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women==
Convention oversight is the task of the '''Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women''', which is made up of 23 experts on women's issues from different UN member states. The Committee meets twice a year to review reports on compliance with the Convention's provisions that the signatory nations are required to submit every four years.

The Committee is one of the eight [[Human rights#Other UN Treaty Bodies|UN-related human rights treaty bodies]].

The Committee's members, described as "experts of high moral standing and competence in the field covered by the Convention", are elected to serve four-year terms in staggered elections held every two years. Its officers are a chairperson, three vice-chairpersons, and a rapporteur.  Efforts are made to ensure balanced geographical representation and the inclusion of the world's different forms of civilization and legal systems.

As of January 2007, the members are:

==Optional Protocol==
The '''[[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]]''' is a side-agreement to the Convention which allows its parties to recognise the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to consider complaints from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cedawopprot-2000.html Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women], Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Optional Protocol was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 October 1999 and entered into force on 22 December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/wom1242.htm |title=Optional Protocol to Women's Convention Comes into Force |date=2000-12-21 |accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it has 79 signatories and 100 parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title= Parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women |publisher=UN OHCHR |accessdate=2009-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{POV|date=September 2010}}
The CEDAW has been controversial for statements seen by a number of states and NGOs as promoting Western-style [[radical feminism]].  Often referenced is a 2000 report which said that in [[Belarus]], "the Committee is concerned by the continuing prevalence of sex-role stereotypes and by the reintroduction of such symbols as a [[Mothers' Day]] and a Mothers' Award, which it sees as encouraging women's traditional roles."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reports/a5538.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Other controversial positions of CEDAW include supporting the decriminalization of prostitution in specific countries, criticizing Slovenia because only 30% of children are in daycare, and pressuring numerous states to decriminalize abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://fota.cdnetworks.net/pdfs/2009-02-b-80-Nations-Pressured-by-CEDAW-Comm-summ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other requests are seen by groups as a backdoor to forcing states parties to adopt an [[Equal Rights Amendment]] or comparable national legislation, which is seen as a violation of the CEDAW treaty mandate and the sovereignty of states parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwfa.org/articledisplay.asp?id=1971 Concerned Women for America - Exposing CEDAW&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Australian and (defunct) New Zealand anti-feminist groups{{Weasel-inline|date=March 2009}} voiced similar concerns in the early eighties.

More recently, the controversy concerning CEDAW has centered around the question of easy access to abortion and contraception.  According to C-FAM (the [[Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute]]), at UN meetings officials pressed the delegation from Colombia to liberalize its abortion laws and to inaugurate campaigns encouraging contraceptive use and "reproductive health awareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c-fam.org/publications/id.664/pub_detail.asp |title=UN Committee Pressures Slovakia over its Concordat with the Catholic Church}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many{{Weasel-inline|date=October 2010}} [[Islamic]] countries view the CEDAW as culturally biased towards the Western nations and have consequently placed reservations on the elements that they see as in fundamental contradiction with Islamic [[Sharia]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reservations-country.htm |title=Declarations, Reservations and Objections to CEDAW  |publisher=UN Division for the Advancement of Women |accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
