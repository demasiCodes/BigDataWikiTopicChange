Negative feelings or characterisations toward asexuality include [[dehumanisation]], the belief that asexuality is a [[mental illness]], that asexual people cannot feel love, and the refusal to accept asexuality as a genuine [[sexual orientation]].

There have been efforts to combat anti-asexual discrimination through legislation or education (such as through workshops on asexuality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://issuu.com/brunswickan/docs/full_paper_e64b2dff0192c0|title=LGBTQrazy: A is for…|website=The Brunswickan (University of New Brunswick)|volume=147|issue=7|date=17 October 2013|page=10 |quote=It’s important to talk about asexuality because it’s often an overlooked sexual identity, and '''acephobia''' – discrimination against asexual people – is experienced by many asexual people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joelle Ruby Ryan, "On Being Asexual and Transgender: Notes on Identity, Visibility, and Empowerment", in ''Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender'' (ed.

== Classification ==
===General===
Behaviours and attitudes that are considered discriminatory include the idea that asexuality is a mental illness, that asexuality is a phase or a choice, the idea that asexual people cannot feel love, and those that make asexual people feel dehumanised.&lt;ref name="GSN"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Joe Morgan |title=Here are the 11 biggest asexual myths busted |url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/here-are-11-biggest-asexual-myths-busted300315/#gs.WGdb_kM |website=Gay Star News |accessdate=27 November 2018 |location=London |date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LTP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Let's Talk About Pride!

Asexual people sometimes face discriminatory or dismissive attitudes or behaviours both within and beyond the [[LGBT]] community. In 2011, [[LGBT]] activist [[Dan Savage]] stated that asexuality was a choice, describing it as "choosing not to have sex" and deeming it unworthy of attention.&lt;ref name=AcePride/&gt;&lt;ref name=HP5/&gt; [[Ruth Westheimer]], a [[sex therapist]], also faced criticism for her view that the ability to achieve [[orgasm]] would mean that a person could not be asexual,&lt;ref name="SalonRuth"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Rachel Kramer Bussel]] |title=Dr. Ruth is wrong about asexuals: It's a legitimate sexual orientation, not a problem to be solved |url=https://www.salon.com/2015/08/25/dr_ruth_is_wrong_about_asexuals_its_a_legitimate_sexual_orientation_not_a_problem_to_be_solved/ |website=Salon.com |accessdate=23 June 2019 |date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was further criticised in 2015 for implying that asexuality was a problem in need of solving.&lt;ref name="SalonRuth"/&gt; There have been efforts to stop the exclusion of asexuals from [[LGBT pride]] events.&lt;ref name=AcePride/&gt;

Asexual people whose asexuality has been accepted only because there is no other explanation for their lack of interest in sexual activity have come to be known as "unassailable asexual[s]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mollet|first=Amanda|title="I Have a Lot of Feelings, Just None in the Genitalia Region": A Grounded Theory of Asexual College Students' Identity Journeys|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340597643|journal=Journal of College Student Development|year=2020|volume=61|issue=2|pages=189–206|doi=10.1353/csd.2020.0017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disbelieving attitudes towards asexuality can leave asexual people afraid to [[Coming out|come out]].&lt;ref name=BFN/&gt;

A 2017 LGBT survey conducted by the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] found that despite just two per cent of more than 108,000 respondents identifying as asexual, they had the joint-lowest (alongside [[pansexuality|pansexual]] people) average life satisfaction of any sexual orientation amongst [[cisgender]] respondents. The results of the survey also showed asexual people to be the least comfortable cisgender LGBT group within the United Kingdom, and 89 per cent of cisgender asexual respondents – the highest percentage of any group surveyed – were reluctant to be open with their identity for fear of negative reactions.&lt;ref name="GOVUK"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[UK Government]] |title=National LGBT Survey: Summary report |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-lgbt-survey-summary-report/national-lgbt-survey-summary-report |website=[[Gov.uk]] |accessdate=22 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social discrimination===
Asexual people may be socially discriminated against due to beliefs of [[heterosexuality]] being the [[Heteronormativity|default sexuality]], or the belief that asexual people are just [[homosexuality|gay or lesbian people]] in denial of their "real" identity.&lt;ref name=HPAWW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Nicole Wiesenthal|url=http://issuu.com/themirrormag/docs/mirror_fall2014_final_small|title=Glossary of Asexual Terms|magazine=The Mirror|volume=3|issue=3|date=Autumn 2014|page=19|quote=Closely linked to homophobia, biphobia, transphobia and '''acephobia'''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spaces designed for asexual people have also been known to internally discriminate [[age discrimination|based on age]], and to centre on whiteness.&lt;ref name=BFN/&gt; Asexuality has also been used as a tool in [[anti-blackness]] to "de-sexualise" some black people through racist stereotypes, such as in the [[mammy archetype in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owen|first=Ianna Hawkins|date=1 November 2018|title=Still, Nothing: Mammy and Black Asexual Possibility|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1057/s41305-018-0140-9|journal=Feminist Review|language=en|volume=120|issue=1|pages=70–84|doi=10.1057/s41305-018-0140-9|issn=0141-7789|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two studies found that asexual people are more dehumanised than heterosexuals, homosexuals, and bisexuals, often being compared to animals or robots due to their sexuality.&lt;ref name="PT"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Gordon Hodson |title=Prejudice Against "Group X" (Asexuals) |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/without-prejudice/201209/prejudice-against-group-x-asexuals |website=Psychology Today |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bias"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Cara C.

Having emerged more recently as an identity, asexual people often have less legal protection than [[gay]], [[lesbian]], and [[bisexual]] people,&lt;ref name="YV"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jack Gevertz |title="Parliament doesn't recognise my sexuality": Britain's first openly asexual candidate, George Norman, speaks to Vision |url=https://www.yorkvision.co.uk/news/parliament-doesnt-recognise-my-sexuality-britains-first-openly-asexual-candidate-george-norman-speaks-to-vision/28/04/2015 |website=York Vision |accessdate=10 March 2019 |date=28 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203152040/https://www.yorkvision.co.uk/news/parliament-doesnt-recognise-my-sexuality-britains-first-openly-asexual-candidate-george-norman-speaks-to-vision/28/04/2015|archivedate=3 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act]] categorises asexuals as a [[protected class]].&lt;ref name="ag.ny.gov"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act ("SONDA") |url=http://www.ag.ny.gov//bureaus/civil_rights/sonda_brochure.html |website=Office of the Attorney General |accessdate=27 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316120639/http://www.ag.ny.gov//bureaus/civil_rights/sonda_brochure.html |archivedate=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asexuals have also been known to have been subjected to [[corrective rape]].&lt;ref name="HP6"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dominique Mosbergen |title=Battling Asexual Discrimination, Sexual Violence And 'Corrective' Rape |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/asexual-discrimination_n_3380551 |website=[[Huffington Post]] |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AcePride"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Latonya Pennington |title=Asexuals Shouldn't Be Excluded From Queer Spaces, Especially Pride |url=https://www.pride.com/pride/2018/6/01/asexuals-shouldnt-be-excluded-queer-spaces-especially-pride |website=Pride |accessdate=9 April 2019 |date=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BFN/&gt; They may be pressured into engaging in sexual activity, and into going to a doctor to have their asexuality "fixed".&lt;ref name="Fixed"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Olivia Petter |title=Former asexual person reveals experiences: 'partners pushed me to go to the doctor to get 'fixed' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/asexual-person-partners-doctor-fixed-sexual-urges-attraction-lgbtq-a7966596.html |website=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=17 August 2019 |date=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 survey found that 43.5 per cent of the almost 8000 asexual people polled had encountered [[sexual violence]],&lt;ref name="BFN"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Julie Kliegman |title=When You're An Asexual Assault Survivor, It's Even Harder To Be Heard |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jmkliegman/asexuality-sexual-assault-harassment-me-too |website=[[Buzzfeed News]] |accessdate=23 April 2019 |date=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the misconception that asexual people never encounter or are involved in sexual situations and are therefore unable to be [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]].&lt;ref name=BFN/&gt;

Some, such as the sociologist Mark Carrigan, believe that discrimination against asexual people has more to do with marginalisation than the typical hatred associated with other forms of sexuality-based discrimination such as homophobia, and that much discrimination against asexual people results from a lack of understanding and awareness of asexuality.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Lucy Wallis |title=What is it like to be asexual? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16552173 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=17 January 2012|work=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RMC"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Maddie Wright |title=Asexual students on identity, experiences of intolerance |url=https://collegian.com/2017/10/asexual-students-on-identify-experiences-of-intolerance/ |website=The Rocky Mountain Collegian |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of college students{{vague|date=July 2020}} shows that some asexual people do not identify with the LGBT umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Mollet|first=Amanda|date=|title=Asexual Borderlands: Asexual Collegians' Reflections on Inclusion Under the LGBTQ Umbrella|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322436988|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=3 July 2020|website=ResearchGate|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also controversy over the inclusion of asexuality in the LGBT and [[queer]] umbrellas for a variety of reasons, including the belief that asexuals do not experience oppression akin to [[homophobia]] and [[transphobia]],&lt;ref name="HP5"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dominique Mosbergen |title=LGBT, Asexual Communities Clash Over Ace Inclusion |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lgbt-asexual_n_3385530 |website=[[Huffington Post]] |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AcePride" /&gt; and the belief that asexuality is not a sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Debbie Luxon |title=Myth-busting asexuality: Being asexual in Cambridgeshire |url=https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cambridge-news/asexual-awareness-lgbt-myth-busting-17160264 |website=Cambridgeshire Live |accessdate=31 May 2020 |date=30 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherronda J. Brown of ''Wear Your Voice'' stated that some people who oppose the inclusion of asexual people in the LGBT community have been known to argue that asexuals are not discriminated against at all, and that asexual people experience straight privilege.&lt;ref name="HetLie"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sherronda J. Brown |title="Ace And Aro People Are Just Straight" Is A Heteronormative Lie |url=https://wearyourvoicemag.com/ace-and-aro-people-are-just-straight-is-a-heteronormative-lie/ |website=Wear Your Voice |accessdate=22 May 2020 |date=11 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown criticised this view as erasing the asexual identity on the assumption that asexual people are fraudulent infiltrators of the LGBT community, and because it assumes that everyone is straight unless proven otherwise.&lt;ref name="HetLie" /&gt;

A study of 148 undergraduates at a Canadian university found evidence to suggest that negative attitudes towards asexuals were higher than that of homosexuals and bisexuals. The study also showed that participants were less likely to rent to asexuals than their heterosexual counterparts. However, they were more likely to rent to asexuals than bisexuals. In addition, the study found a positive correlation between right-wing authoritarian identification and negative attitudes towards asexuality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=MacInnis|first1=Cara C.|last2=Hodson|first2=Gordon|date=November 2012|title=Intergroup bias toward "Group X": Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368430212442419|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|language=en|volume=15|issue=6|pages=725–743|doi=10.1177/1368430212442419|s2cid=3056711|issn=1368-4302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, 101 participants (none of whom belonged to a sexual minority) were asked to complete an online survey on [[SurveyMonkey]]. To rule out unfamiliarity as the cause of negative attitudes, they included questions on [[sapiosexuals]]. The study showed that people were less familiar with sapiosexuals. However, attitudes towards asexuals were less positive than that of sapiosexuals which suggests that unfamiliarity may not play a significant role in aphobia.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In March 2018, the [[Dutch Council of State]] refused an asylum application by an Algerian national who feared being persecuted due to his asexuality, stating that asexuality does not fall under the LGBT exception to the [[safe country of origin]] concept because it is not punishable in Algeria and that asexual people are not discriminated against there. The ruling was overturned by the District Court of The Hague, who said that asexuality does fall under the exception because they considered "social discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation" to include "deviation from traditional relationships" as well as sexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Netherlands: Council of State rules that asexual applicants do not fall under the exception for LGBTI people in the application of the "safe country of origin" concept |url=https://www.asylumlawdatabase.eu/en/content/netherlands-council-state-rules-asexual-applicants-do-not-fall-under-exception-lgbti-people |website=European Database of Asylum Law |accessdate=18 September 2020 |date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, the UK's [[LGBT Foundation]] stated that, because of a lack of awareness and apprehension, asexual communities are frequently overlooked in the LGBT community.&lt;ref name="HypoAce" /&gt;

===Institutionalised discrimination===
A study{{vague|reason=A lot of this article seems to be 'a study' and 'another study', with little actual content division between headings. Some sharper organisation would be great.|date=July 2020}} found little evidence of [[institutional discrimination]] against asexuals because of their asexuality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gazzola, Stephanie B, and Melanie A. Morrison. "Asexuality: An emergent sexual orientation". ''Sexual Minority Research in the New Millennium''.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study theorised that this may be because most sexual orientation-based discrimination is religious in nature, while asexuality may be considered "morally justifiable given that a lack of sexual attraction/desires has been considered a desirable state by many religious institutions for hundreds of years."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In some jurisdictions, marriages can be voided if not legitimised by [[consummation]].&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Elizabeth F.

In early 2015, Russia passed a law banning, amongst others, people with "disorders of sexual preference" from obtaining driving licences. The Association of Russian Lawyers for Human Rights stated that it effectively banned "all transgender people, bigender, asexuals, transvestites, cross-dressers, and people who need sex reassignment" from driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Roland Oliphant |title=Vladimir Putin bans transsexuals from driving |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11334934/Vladimir-Putin-bans-transsexuals-from-driving.html |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=3 September 2019 |date=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media and services===
Asexuals are less-well represented by mainstream media and services, facilitating hostility and prejudice towards asexuals, and can lead to their rejection from both the straight and LGBT communities. Some [[online dating service]]s, including [[Bumble (app)|Bumble]], and [[Match.com]] lack the option for users to identify as asexual, which obstructs their ability to find romantic partners.&lt;ref name="ODVerge"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Julie Kliegman |title=Online dating isn't easy — especially when you're asexual |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/14/17012528/asexual-asexuality-ace-online-dating |website=[[The Verge]] |accessdate=7 April 2019 |date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asexuality is sometimes represented in media as undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Tom Grennell |title=ACES An Asexual Interview |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aces-an-asexual-interview_us_58b72f12e4b0ddf6542462db |website=[[Huffington Post]] |accessdate=17 March 2019 |date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the TV medical drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' was criticised for its portrayal of asexuality within the medical profession and encouraging scepticism on the legitimacy of asexuality. The storyline centred on the assumption that the asexuality of the episode's patients – a married asexual couple – was the result of a medical condition, with one asexual character being described as a "giant pool of algae" and the titular character betting $100 on finding a medical reason behind another's asexuality; the show was criticised by AVEN founder [[David Jay]] for its depiction of asexuality as a "problematic and pathological" medical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Tracy Clark-Flory |title="House" gets asexuality wrong |url=https://www.salon.com/2012/01/31/house_gets_asexuality_wrong/ |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=3 September 2019 |date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the decision to turn the character [[Jughead Jones|Jughead]] in ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'' (a television programme based on ''[[Archie (comic book)|Archie Comics]]'') from asexual [[straightwashing|to heterosexual]] was met with disapproval, with one branding it "asexual erasure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Julia Alexander |title=Riverdale's Jughead is no longer asexual, and that's a problem for fans |url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/1/26/14403700/jughead-riverdale-asexual |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=3 September 2019 |date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-discrimination endeavours==
In [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act]] categorises asexuals as a [[protected class]].&lt;ref name="ag.ny.gov"/&gt;

The [[Asexual Visibility and Education Network]] (AVEN), an organisation founded in 2001 by David Jay, aims to raise awareness of asexuality,&lt;ref name="DJ"&gt;{{cite web |author1=JohnThomas Didymus |title=Asexual Visibility and Education Network marks Asexuality Day |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/348920 |website=Digital Journal |accessdate=27 November 2018 |date=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; through such means as discussions in schools about asexuality and discouraging discriminatory attitudes towards the sexuality.&lt;ref name=GSN/&gt; [[Asexual Awareness Week]] is an annual event formed by Sarah Beth Brooks in 2010, also with the aim of raising asexual awareness and dispelling misconceptions.&lt;ref name="HPAWW"/&gt; There have been attempts to increase awareness of asexuality in universities.&lt;ref name="TBTS"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Erickson-Schroth |editor1-first=Laura |title=Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community |date=12 May 2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199325368 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZeAAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=acephobia&amp;pg=PA367 |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of community support groups for asexual people have been formed, such as Asexuals of the Mid-Atlantic, a meetup group for asexual people centred in [[Washington D.C.]],&lt;ref name="WashingtonBlade"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Isabel Nathan |title=Asexuals, you are not alone |url=https://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/10/19/asexuals-you-are-not-alone/ |website=Washington Blade |accessdate=4 May 2019 |date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Asexuals of the Mid-Atlantic |url=https://www.meetup.com/A-Mid-A/ |website=Meetup |accessdate=4 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose members founded The Asexual Awareness Project, an asexual advocacy organisation.&lt;ref name=WashingtonBlade/&gt;

In autumn 2014, the book ''The Invisible Orientation: An Introduction to Asexuality'', written by [[Julie Sondra Decker]], was published, with Decker stating that the aim of the book was for it to be used in [[sex education]] to increase common knowledge of sexuality.&lt;ref name="WPostAwareness"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ellen McCarthy |title=Asexuals seek to raise awareness of the 'invisible orientation' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/asexuals-seek-to-raise-awareness-of-the-invisible-orientation/2014/11/24/5dc92d3a-6b7a-11e4-b053-65cea7903f2e_story.html |website=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=4 May 2019 |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, United Kingdom [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[parliamentary candidate]] George Norman called for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to add asexuality to its existing equality legislation, and to recognise that one per cent of the UK's electorate identified as asexual.&lt;ref name="YV" /&gt;

In 2016, the Asexual Aromantic Alliance was founded at [[Iowa State University]] to encourage co-operation between the asexual and aromantic communities, with the aim of "help[ing to] eliminate acephobia."&lt;ref name=ISD&gt;{{cite web |author1=Logan Metzger |title=A look at the Asexual Aromantic Alliance and who they are |url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/asexual-aromantic-alliance-studnet-organization-community-building/article_7a1e09cc-2d92-11e9-bdf8-67d5f5be2ada.html |website=[[Iowa State Daily]] |accessdate=7 April 2019 |date=20 February 1029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Asexual Aromantic Alliance |url=https://www.stuorg.iastate.edu/site/arostronaut |website=[[Iowa State University]] |accessdate=7 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
