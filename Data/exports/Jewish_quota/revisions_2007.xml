In particular, in 19th and 20th centuries some countries had Jewish quotas for [[higher education]], a special case of '''[[Numerus clausus]]'''. These were an attempt to limit the influence of ethnic and/or religious Jews.

Jewish quotas for education could be state-wide law or adopted only in certain institutions, often unofficially.

The limitation took the form of total prohibition of Jewish students, or of limiting the number of Jewish students so that their share in the students' population would not be larger than their share in the general population. It was motivated by contemporary view of the balancing chances for education for ethnic groups.  In some establishments, the Jewish quota placed a limit on growth rather than set a fixed level of participation to be achieved.

Jews who wanted education used various ways to handle this obstacle: bribing the authorities, changing their religion, or traveling to countries without such limitations. In Hungary, for example, 5,000 Jewish youngsters (including [[Edward Teller]]) left the country after the introduction of ''Numerus Clausus''. 
One American who fell victim to the Jewish quota was late physicist and Nobel laureate [[Richard P. Feynman]], who was turned away from [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] in the 1930s and went to [[MIT]] instead.

== Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students==

*[[Imperial Russia]]: ''Numerus Clausus'' was enacted in [[1887]], stating that the share of Jewish students should be no more than 10% in cities where [[Jew]]s were [[Pale of Settlement|allowed to live]], 5% in other cities, and only 3% in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. These limitations were removed after the revolution of 1917.
*[[Hungary]]: a ''Numerus Clausus'' Act was introduced in [[1920]], as part of the rise of [[Anti-Semitism]] under the government of [[Pál Teleki]]. It was said that Jewish students would be no more than 6% of the student population (this was the share of Jews in the general population), compared to 30% before the war. Limitations were relaxed in [[1928]].See: Peter Tibor NAGY: The "numerus clausus" policy of anti-semitism or policy of higher education http://mek.oszk.hu/03700/03797/03797.htm#7
*[[Latvia]]: In [[1934]], under [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] authoritarian regime.
*[[Poland]]: see [[Numerus clausus#Numerus clausus in Poland|Numerus clausus in Poland]].
*[[Romania]] ''Numerus Clausus'' was introduced in [[1926]].
*[[United States]]: see [[Numerus clausus#Numerus clausus in the United States|Numerus clausus in the United States]].
*[[Germany]]: the Jewish quota, introduced on [[April 25]], [[1933]], permitted 1.5%  of high-school and university enrollment (5% in a single school).
*[[Canada]]: in 1920-1940s, some universities, such as [[McGill University]], had Jewish quotas.
*[[United Kingdom]]: many Direct Grant Grammar Schools and Public Schools had 'unofficial' Jewish quotas until the 1960s when they were replaced with Asian quotas which lasted into the 1970s.
*[[United States]]: Certain universities, most notably [[Harvard]], introduced policies which effectively placed a quota on the number of Jews admitted to the university. This reached its height in the 1920's and has now died out to the point that 1/6th of the [[Ivy League]] student population is Jewish.
