'''Jewish quota''' was a type of [[racial quota]] stipulating a certain set percentage that limited the number of [[Jew]]s in various establishments. In particular, in 19th and 20th centuries some countries had Jewish quotas for [[higher education]], a special case of '''''[[Numerus clausus]]'''''.

Jewish [[educational quotas]] could be statewide law or adopted only in certain institutions, often unofficially. The limitation took the form of total prohibition of Jewish students, or of limiting the number of Jewish students so that their share in the students' population would not be larger than their share in the general population.  In some establishments, the Jewish quota placed a limit on growth rather than set a fixed level of participation to be achieved.

According to historian [[David Oshinsky]], on writing about [[Jonas Salk]],  "Most of the surrounding medical schools ([[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], and [[Yale University|Yale]]) had rigid quotas in place. In 1935 Yale accepted 76 applicants from a pool of 501. About 200 of those applicants were Jewish and only five got in." He notes that Dean Milton Winternitz's instructions were remarkably precise: "Never admit more than five Jews, take only two Italian Catholics, and take no blacks at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard N. Burrow|title=A History of Yale's School of Medicine: Passing Torches to Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzYX_MduAG8C&amp;pg=PA107|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|page=107ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Oshinsky added, "[[Jonas Salk]] and hundreds like him" enrolled in [[New York University]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Oshinsky, David M. ''Polio: An American Story'', Oxford Univ. Press (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews who wanted an education used various ways to overcome this discrimination: bribing the authorities, changing their religion, or traveling to countries without such limitations. In Hungary, for example, 5,000 Jewish youngsters (including [[Edward Teller]]) left the country after the introduction of ''Numerus Clausus''.

One American who fell victim to the Jewish quota was late physicist and Nobel laureate [[Richard P. Feynman]], who was turned away from [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] in the 1930s and went to [[MIT]] instead.

==Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students==
*[[Germany]]: On 25 April 1933, the [[Nazi]] government introduced a 1.5 percent quota for new admissions of German Non-[[Aryan race|Aryans]]—i.e. essentially of German Jews—as core issue of a law claiming to generally limit the number of (Aryan and non-Aryan) students admitted to high-schools (''höhere Schulen'') and universities. In addition, high-schools and universities deemed to have more students than required for the professions for which they were training their students were required to reduce their student enrollment; doing so, they had to reach a maximum of 5 per cent of German non-Aryan students. The law was supposedly enacted to avoid overcrowding schools and universities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19330004&amp;zoom=2&amp;seite=00000225&amp;ues=0&amp;x=9&amp;y=13 Gesetz gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 225)] (original German text of the ''Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities'', introduced in 1933)
[http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno-plus?apm=0&amp;aid=dra&amp;datum=19330004&amp;seite=00000226&amp;zoom=2 Erste Verordnung zur Durchführung des Gesetzes gegen die Überfüllung deutscher Schulen und Hochschulen (RGBl 1933 I, S. 226)] (original German text of the ''First Regulation for the Implementation of the Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities'', introduced in 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; which referred to German concerns at the time that large numbers of students would decrease the quality of higher education. At the beginning of 1933, about 0.76 percent of the German population was Jewish, but more than 3.6 percent of German university students were Jewish, this number having steadily declined from over 9 percent in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/40185665 Claudia Huerkamp (1993).

KG)&lt;/ref&gt; After 30 July 1939, Jews were no longer permitted to attend German public schools at all, and the prior quota law was eliminated by a non-public regulation in January 1940.&lt;ref name="Olenhusen"&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/30196241 A.

: Apart from their strong and predominant anti-Semitic agenda, the law and its subsequent regulations were temporarily indeed used to limit general university access, i.e. including "non-Aryans" (Jews), as the name of the law implied. Starting 1934, a regulation limited the overall numbers of students admitted to German universities, and a special quota was introduced reducing women's admissions to a maximum of 10 percent. Although the limits were not entirely enforced—women's quota stayed a bit above 10 percent mainly because a smaller percentage of men than women accepted their university admissions—they made it for women approximately twice as hard to enter a university career than for men with the same qualification.&lt;ref name="Bildungsbürgerinnen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QVToe3288bEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%C3%BCberfremdung&amp;f=false Claudia Huerkamp (1996).

*[[Hungary]]: a ''Numerus Clausus'' Act was introduced in 1920, under the government of [[Pál Teleki]]. It was said that the ethnic rate of students must meet the ethnic rate of population. Limitations were relaxed in 1928. Racial criteria in admitting new students were removed and replaced by social criteria. Five categories were set up: civil servants, war veterans and army officers, small landowners and artisans, industrialists, and the merchant classes.&lt;ref&gt;See: [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_14969.html Numerus Clausus]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Imperial Russia]]: ''Numerus Clausus'' was enacted in 1887, stating that the share of Jewish students should be no more than 10 percent in cities where [[Jew]]s were [[Pale of Settlement|allowed to live]], 5 percent in other cities, and only 3 percent in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. These limitations were removed after the revolution of 1917, but a [[de facto]] discrimination of Jewish applicants remained in many institutions of higher education in the [[Soviet Union]] until [[Perestroika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Mikhail Shifman]] |title=You Failed Your Math Test, Comrade Einstein: Adventures and Misadventures of Young Mathematicians Or Test Your Skills in Almost Recreational Mathematics |publisher=World Scientific |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ho6fMF8ehogC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Edward Frenkel]] |title=The Fifth problem: math &amp; anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union |date=October 2012 |journal=The New Criterion |url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-Fifth-problem--math---anti-Semitism-in-the-Soviet-Union-7446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-more-migrants-please-especially-the-clever-ones-2368622.html |location=London |work=[[The Independent]] |date=October 11, 2011 |title=More migrants please, especially the clever ones|author=[[Dominic Lawson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Andre Geim]] |title=Biographical |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=2010 |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/geim-bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
