'''Police brutality''' is the intentional use of excessive force, usually physical, but potentially also in the form of verbal attacks and psychological intimidation, by a [[police officer]]. 

Widespread police brutality exists in many countries, even those that prosecute it.&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2007"&gt;{{cite web | title = Amnesty International Report 2007  | url = http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/Homepage | publisher = Amnesty International |year= 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070807192225/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/Homepage &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of several forms of [[police misconduct]], which include: [[false arrest]]; [[intimidation]]; [[racial profiling]]; [[political repression]]; [[surveillance abuse]]; [[sexual abuse]]; and [[police corruption]].

==History==
[[Image:ftaapolice.png|right|thumb|April 21, 2001: Police fire [[CS gas]] at protesters during the [[Quebec City Summit of the Americas]]. The Commission for Public Complaints against the RCMP later concluded the use of tear gas against demonstrators at the summit constituted "excessive and unjustified force."]]
The word "brutality" has several meanings; the sense used here (savage cruelty) was first used in 1633.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The first known use of the term "police brutality" was in the New York Times in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police officers in trouble: Charges against policeman McManus by his sergeant | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date= June 23, 1893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing a police officer's beating of a civilian.

The origin of modern policing based on the authority of the [[nation state]] is commonly traced back to developments in seventeenth and eighteenth century [[France]], with [[Police#History|modern police departments]] being established in most nations by the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Cases of police brutality appear to have been frequent then, with "the routine [[Wikt:bludgeon|bludgeoning]] of citizens by patrolmen armed with nightsticks or blackjacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = Marilynn S. | editor = Johnson | title = Street Justice: A History of Police Violence in New York City | year = 2004 | publisher = Beacon Press | isbn = 0807050237 | pages = 365}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-scale incidents of brutality were associated with labor [[Strike action|strikes]], such as the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]], the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, the [[Lawrence textile strike]] of 1912, the [[Ludlow massacre]] of 1914, the [[Steel strike of 1919]], and the [[Hanapepe massacre]] of 1924.

Portions of the population may perceive the police to be [[oppression|oppressors]]. In addition, there is a perception that victims of police brutality often belong to relatively powerless groups, such as minorities, the disabled, the young, and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;

Hubert Locke writes, &lt;blockquote&gt;"When used in print or as the battle cry in a [[black power]] rally, police brutality can by implication cover a number of practices, from calling a citizen by his or her first name to a death by a policeman's bullet. What the average citizen thinks of when he hears the term, however, is something midway between these two occurrences, something more akin to what the police profession knows as 'alley court' &amp;mdash; the wanton vicious beating of a person in custody, usually while [[handcuffs|handcuffed]], and usually taking place somewhere between the scene of the arrest and the [[station house]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|volume=44|publisher=J. Urb. L.|pages=625|date=1966-1967|title=Police Brutality and Civilian Review Boards: A Second Look|author=Locke, Hubert G.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/udetmr44&amp;section=45|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Causes==
Police officers are legally permitted to [[Use_of_force#Military_and_police|use force]], and their superiors — and the public — expect them to do so, when appropriate.  According to [[Jerome Herbert Skolnick]], in dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, some people working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; in some cases the police believe that they are above the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Skolnick | first = Jerome H. | coauthors = Fyfe, James D. | editor = Winters, Paul A. | title = Policing the Police | year = 1995 | publisher = Greenhaven Press | location = San Diego | isbn = 1-56510-262-2 | pages = 45–55 | chapter = Community-Oriented Policing Would Prevent Police Brutality }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this "bad apple paradigm" is considered by some to be an "easy way out". A broad report commissioned by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on the causes of misconduct in policing calls it "a simplistic explanation that permits the organization and senior management to blame corruption on individuals and individual faults – behavioural, psychological, background factors, and so on, rather than addressing systemic factors."&lt;ref name="RCMP Review"&gt;{{cite web | last = Loree | first = Don | title = Corruption in Policing: Causes and Consequences; A Review of the Literature | work = Research and Evaluation Community, Contract and Aboriginal Policing Services Directorate  | publisher = Royal Canadian Mounted Police | year = 2006 | url = http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/PS64-27-2006E.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report goes on to discuss the systemic factors, which include: 
* Pressures to conform to certain aspects of "police culture", such as the [[Blue Code of Silence]], which can "sustain an oppositional criminal subculture protecting the interests of police who violate the law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15614260290011309 | last = Skolnick | first = Jerome H. | title = Corruption and the Blue Code of Silence | journal = Police Practice and Research  | volume = 3 | year = 2002 | pages = 7 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "'we-they' perspective in which outsiders are viewed with suspicion or distrust"&lt;ref name="RCMP Review"/&gt;
* command and control structures with a rigid hierarchical foundation ("results indicate that the more rigid the hierarchy, the lower the scores on a measure of ethical decision-making" concludes one study reviewed in the report);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Owens | first = Katherine M. B. | coauthors = Jeffrey Pfeifer | title = Police Leadership and Ethics: Training and Police Recommendations | journal = The Canadian Journal of Police and Security Services | volume = 1 | pages = 7 | year = 2002 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* deficiencies in internal accountability mechanisms (including internal investigation processes).&lt;ref name="RCMP Review"/&gt;

Police use of force is kept in check in many jurisdictions by the issuance of a [[use of force continuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stetser | first = Merle | title = The Use of Force in Police Control of Violence: Incidents Resulting in Assaults on Officers |year= 2001 | publisher = LFB Scholarly Publishing L.L.C. | location = New York | isbn = 1-931202-08-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A use of force continuum sets levels of force considered appropriate in direct response to a subject's behavior. This power is granted by the civil government, with limits set out in [[statutory law]] as well as [[common law]].

Some members of the public may in fact perceive the use of force by police as excessive even when the force used is lawful.

==Global prevalence==
{{See also|Police brutality cases (United States)}}
*The [[Amnesty International]] 2007 report on human rights also documents widespread police misconduct in many other countries, especially countries with [[authoritarian]] regimes.&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2007"/&gt;
*In the UK, the reports into the death of New Zealand teacher and anti-racism campaigner [[Blair Peach]] in 1979 was published on the Metropolitan Police website on 27 April 2010. The conclusion was that Blair Peach was killed by a police officer, but that the other police officers in the same unit had refused to cooperate with the inquiry by lying to investigators, making it impossible to identify the actual killer.{{cn|date=January 2011}}
*In the UK, [[Ian Tomlinson]] was filmed by an American tourist apparently being hit with a baton and then pushed to the floor, as he walked home from work during the [[2009 G-20 London summit protests]]. Tomlinson then collapsed and died.  Although he was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, the officer who allegedly assaulted Tomlinson was released without charge.
* In Serbia, police brutality occurred in numerous cases during protests against [[Slobodan Milošević]], and has also been recorded during protests against governments since Milošević lost power.{{fact|date=June 2011}} The most recent case was recorded in July 2010, when five people, including two girls, were arrested, handcuffed and then beaten with clubs and otherwise mistreated for one hour. Security camera recordings of the beating were obtained by the media, causing public outrage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=06&amp;nav_category=16&amp;nav_id=443501 B92 (video)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Hronika/197194/Policija-nas-tukla--bez-razloga Blic (video)]&lt;/ref&gt; The police officials, including [[Ivica Dačić]], the Serbian minister of internal affairs, denied this sequence of events and accused the victims "to have attacked the police officers first". He also publicly stated that "police isn't here to beat up citizens", but that it is known "what one is going to get when attacking the police".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=07&amp;nav_id=443903 B92: Dačić: Police isn't here to beat up citizens]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some recent episodes of police brutality in India include the [[Rajan case]], the death of Udayakumar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/04/stories/2005100419970300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Police question forensic experts | date=4 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of Sampath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/05/17/stories/2011051755890500.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Sampath case: 4 police officers to turn approvers | date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Police violence episodes against peaceful demonstrators appeared during the [[2011 Spanish protests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/27/spanish-protesters-clash-with-police Spanish police clash with protesters over clean-up] - The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publico.es/espana/378668/los-mossos-d-esquadra-desalojan-a-palos-la-plaza-de-catalunya Los Mossos d'Esquadra desalojan a palos la Plaza de Catalunya] - Público {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=Geg_6Xoy04s|title=Indignats - Desallotjament de la Plaça Catalunya}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in August 4, 2011, Gorka Ramos, a journalist of ''Lainformacion'' was beaten by police and arrested while covering 15-M protests near the Interior Ministry in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/08/05/comunicacion/1312558334.html Los periodistas, detenidos y golpeados al cubrir las manifestaciones del 15-M] - El Mundo {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publico.es/espana/390284/doce-policias-para-detener-a-un-periodista Doce policías para detener a un periodista] - Público {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://videos.lainformacion.com/asuntos-sociales/gorka-ramos-me-tiraron-al-suelo-me-patearon-y-luego-me-detuvieron_mKeinSMbGcQSEzMAbwP8V/ Gorka Ramos: "Me tiraron al suelo, me patearon y luego me detuvieron"] - Lainformación {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/videos/espana/policia/detiene/periodista/Gorka/Ramos/elpvidnac/20110805elpepunac_1/Ves/ La policía detiene al periodista Gorka Ramos] - El País {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; A freelance photographer, Daniel Nuevo, was beaten by police while covering demonstrations against Pope's visit in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/8711224/Spanish-police-officer-slaps-girl-during-Pope-protests.html Spanish police officer slaps girl during Pope protests] - The Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publico.es/espana/392134/la-policia-golpea-a-un-fotografo-y-a-una-joven La policía golpea a un fotógrafo y a una joven] - Público {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
In the [[United Kingdom]], an independent organization known as the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] investigates reports of police misconduct. They automatically investigate any deaths caused by, or thought to be caused by, police action.

==Independent oversight==
Various community groups have criticized police brutality. These groups often stress the need for oversight by independent citizen review boards and other methods of ensuring accountability for police action. 

Umbrella organizations and justice committees (often named after a deceased individual or those victimized by police violence) usually engage in a solidarity of those affected. [[Amnesty International]] is another organization active in the issue of police brutality.

Tools used by these groups include video recordings, which are sometimes broadcast using websites such as [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = YouTube.com prompts police beating probe | url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 | publisher = [[Associated Press]] | last = Veiga | first = Alex |date= November 11, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-11-12 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
====Canada====
*[[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] - protects an individual's autonomy and legal rights and guarantees [[due process]]
*[[Section Eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] - protects against unreasonable [[searches and seizures]]
*[[Section Nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] - against arbitrary detainment and imprisonment. The provision is invoked in the criminal law context generally where a police officer who stops, detains, arrests or otherwise restrains a suspect without reasonable grounds.
*[[Section Ten of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] - specifies rights upon arrest or detention, including the rights to consult a lawyer and the right to [[habeas corpus]].
