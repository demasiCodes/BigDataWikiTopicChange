Police brutality can become a major issue especially when the police are from a different social group as the people they police.  In such a situation, the general population may view the police as oppressors, while the police may begin to view the population as criminals.

This has been the case with  [[African-American]]s in the United States, and [[Catholics]] in [[Northern Ireland]].
