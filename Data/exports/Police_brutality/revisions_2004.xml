Police brutality can become a major issue, especially when the police are from a different social group as the people they police. In such a situation, the general population may view the police as oppressors, while the police may begin to view the population as criminals. Brutality does not only apply to unreasonable physical force, but to threats and assault, as well.

Many believe this has been the case with  [[African-American]]s in the United States, and [[Catholics]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. It also applies to violent incidents against [[political dissent]], in which the police attacked protesters, such as during the [[Quebec City Summit of the Americas]].
