'''Police brutality''' is the wanton use of excessive [[force (law)|force]], usually physical, but potentially in the form of verbal attacks and psychological [[intimidation]], by a [[police officer]].

Widespread police brutality exists in many countries, even those that prosecute it.&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2007"&gt;{{cite web | title = Amnesty International Report 2007  | url = http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/Homepage | publisher = Amnesty International |year= 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070807192225/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/Homepage &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of several forms of [[police misconduct]], which include: [[false arrest]]; [[intimidation]]; [[racial profiling]]; [[political repression]]; [[surveillance abuse]]; [[sexual abuse]]; and [[police corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;Martinelli TJ.

==History==
[[Image:ftaapolice.png|right|thumb|April 21, 2001: Police fire [[tear gas]] at protesters during the [[Quebec City Summit of the Americas]]. The Commission for Public Complaints against the RCMP later concluded this constituted "excessive and unjustified force."]]
The word "brutality" has several meanings; the sense used here (savage cruelty) was first used in 1633.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The first known use of the term "police brutality" was in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 1893,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police officers in trouble: Charges against policeman McManus by his sergeant | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date= June 23, 1893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing a police officer's beating of a civilian.

The origin of modern policing based on the authority of the [[nation state]] is commonly traced back to developments in seventeenth and eighteenth century [[France]], with [[Police#History|modern police departments]] being established in most nations by the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  [[Cases of police brutality]] appear to have been frequent then, with "the routine [[Wikt:bludgeon|bludgeoning]] of citizens by patrolmen armed with nightsticks or blackjacks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = Marilynn S. | editor = Johnson | title = Street Justice: A History of Police Violence in New York City | year = 2004 | publisher = Beacon Press | isbn = 0-8070-5023-7 | pages = 365}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-scale incidents of brutality were associated with labor [[Strike action|strikes]], such as the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]], the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894, the [[Lawrence textile strike]] of 1912, the [[Ludlow massacre]] of 1914, the [[Steel strike of 1919]], and the [[Hanapepe massacre]] of 1924.

Portions of the population may perceive the police to be [[oppression|oppressors]]. In addition, there is a perception that victims of police brutality often belong to relatively powerless groups, such as minorities, the disabled, the young, and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;

Hubert Locke writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;When used in print or as the battle cry in a [[black power]] rally, police brutality can by implication cover a number of practices, from calling a citizen by his or her first name to a death by a policeman's bullet. What the average citizen thinks of when he hears the term, however, is something midway between these two occurrences, something more akin to what the police profession knows as "alley court"—the wanton vicious beating of a person in custody, usually while [[handcuffs|handcuffed]], and usually taking place somewhere between the scene of the arrest and the [[station house]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=44 |publisher=J. Urb.

[[File:Kingbeating.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshots of King lying down and being beaten by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers]]
In 1991, Los Angeles police harshly beat African American [[Rodney King]]. The police officers involved were acquitted and is widely believed to have lead up to the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], causing 53 deaths, 2,383 injuries, more than 7,000 fires, damage to 3,100 businesses, and nearly $1 billion in financial losses. After facing federal trial, the officers received 32 months prison sentence. The case was widely seen as a key factor in the reform of the Los Angeles police department.

==Examples==

===People's Republic of China===
Politically motivated riots and protest have occurred historically in China, notably with the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. Within the past decade, groups such as [[Falun Gong]] have protested party measures and been broken up by riot police. Chinese dissidents have been able to arrange effective mobilization through use of social media and informal communication like [[Twitter]] and its Chinese counterparts [[Microblogging in China|Weibo]] or microblogs.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.cnn.com/2012-04-30/asia/world_asia_china-chen-internet_1_sina-weibo-chinese-censors-chen-guangcheng?_s=PM:ASIA&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign journalists from Switzerland have reported cases of [[police harassment]]. Media suppression has increased in the wake of the [[Tunisian revolution|Jasmine Revolution]] in Tunisia. Plainclothes policemen are often deployed during demonstrations to suppress violence. Censorship is often maintained as a measure to maintain political stability in China. Web activists can be charged by the police for using false identities to surf the Internet. After arrests, homes of the arrested individual are often searched for incriminating evidence such as computers, [[hard drives]], and [[flash drives]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.rsf.org/china-police-violence-against-28-02-2011,39643.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Russian protests have gained media attention with the reelection of [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2012. Attention has been given to incidence of violence via posting videos online. President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] has initiated reforms of the police force, in an attempt to minimize the violence by firing Moscow police chief and centralizing police powers. Police divisions in Russia are often based on loyalty systems that favor bureaucratic power amongst political elites. Phone tapping and business raids are common practice in the country, and often fail to give [[due process]] to citizens. Proper investigations of police officials still remains lacking by western standards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/node/15731344&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Russia's top investigative agency investigated charges that four police officers had tortured detainees under custody. Human rights activists claim that Russian police use torture techniques to extract [[false confessions]] from detainees. Police regulations require quotas of officers for solved crimes, a practice that encourages false arrests to meet their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/29/russia-police-torture_n_1387421.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
Islamic extremists in Indonesia have been targeted by police as terrorists in the country. Police may either capture or kill dissidents. Cases of police corruption with hidden bank accounts and retaliation against journalists who attempt to uncover these cases have occurred such as in June 2012, when Indonesian magazine ''Tempo'' had journalist activists beaten by police. Separately, on August 31, 2010 police officers in Central Sulawesi province fired into a crowd of people protesting the death of a local man in police custody. Five people were killed and 34 injured. History of violence goes back to the military-backed [[Suharto]] regime (1967-1998), from which Suharto seized power during an [[Indonesian killings of 1965–1966|anti-Communist purge]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/node/17419881&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal investigations into human rights violations by the police are rare, punishments light and Indonesia has no independent national body to deal effectively with public complaints. [[Amnesty International]] has called on Indonesia to review police tactics during arrests and public order policing, to ensure that they meet international standards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/indonesia-must-end-impunity-police-violence-2012-04-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
There have been a number of high profile cases of alleged police brutality including, [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests]],&lt;ref&gt;http://rabble.ca/news/2010/07/medics-g20-protests-speak-out-against-police-brutality-0&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2012 Quebec student protests]],&lt;ref&gt;http://rabble.ca/news/2012/03/police-violence-rise-montreal&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Robert Dziekański taser incident]]. The recent public incidents  in which police judgments or actions have been called into question have raised fundamental concerns about police accountability and governance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpc-cpp.gc.ca/cnt/tpsp-tmrs/police/projet-pip-pep-eng.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
[[Turkey]] has a history of police brutality, including (particularly between 1977 and 2002) [[Torture in Turkey|the use of torture]]. Police brutality featuring excessive use of tear gas (including targeting protestors with tear gas canisters),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2013/07/aftermath-unrest-turkey&lt;/ref&gt; pepper spray and water cannon as well as physical violence against protestors has been seen, for example, in the suppression of Kurdish protests and [[International_Workers'_Day#Turkey|May Day demonstrations]]. The [[2013 protests in Turkey]] were in response to the brutal police suppression of an environmentalist sit-in protesting the removal of [[Taksim Gezi Park]].

In 2012 a number of officials received prison sentences for their role in the death in custody of political activist [[Engin Çeber]].

The European Court of Human Rights has noted the failure of the Turkish investigating authorities to carry out effective investigations into allegations of ill-treatment by law enforcement personnel during demonstrations. &lt;ref&gt;http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/Pages/search.aspx#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-122885%22]}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===

Police brutality was a major drive behind [[2011 Egyptian revolution]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21574017-police-are-rotten-ever-what-happened-reform]&lt;/ref&gt; the incident of [[Khaled Said]]'s death and other stories, yet very little has changed since. One of the "demands" around which people decided to take it to the streets in Egypt is "purging the Ministry of Interior" for its brutality and torture practices
Things went wrong after the coup regarding police reforms .Police used brutal force again against protests in streets killing hundreds of Egyptians At Rabaa square in on of the most brutal use of force against civilians in Egypt's modern history &lt;ref&gt;[http://ecesr.com/en/2013/06/26/failed-promises-and-torture-continues/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Police brutality in the United States}}

==Causes==
[[File:Ian Tomlinson remonstrates with police.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ian Tomlinson]] after being pushed to the ground by police in [[London]] (2009). He collapsed and died soon after.]]
Police officers are legally permitted to [[Use_of_force#Military_and_police|use force]], and their superiors — and the public — expect them to do so.  According to [[Jerome Herbert Skolnick]], in dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, some people working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; in some cases the police believe that they are above the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Skolnick | first = Jerome H. | coauthors = Fyfe, James D. | editor = Winters, Paul A. | title = Policing the Police | year = 1995 | publisher = Greenhaven Press | location = San Diego | isbn = 1-56510-262-2 | pages = 45–55 | chapter = Community-Oriented Policing Would Prevent Police Brutality }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this "bad apple paradigm" is considered by some to be an "easy way out". A broad report commissioned by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on the causes of misconduct in policing calls it "a simplistic explanation that permits the organization and senior management to blame corruption on individuals and individual faults – behavioural, psychological, background factors, and so on, rather than addressing systemic factors."&lt;ref name="RCMP Review"&gt;{{cite web | last = Loree | first = Don | title = Corruption in Policing: Causes and Consequences; A Review of the Literature | work = Research and Evaluation Community, Contract and Aboriginal Policing Services Directorate  | publisher = Royal Canadian Mounted Police | year = 2006 | url = http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/PS64-27-2006E.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report goes on to discuss the systemic factors, which include:
* Pressures to conform to certain aspects of "police culture", such as the [[Blue Code of Silence]], which can "sustain an oppositional criminal subculture protecting the interests of police who violate the law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15614260290011309 | last = Skolnick | first = Jerome H. | title = Corruption and the Blue Code of Silence | journal = Police Practice and Research  | volume = 3 | year = 2002 | pages = 7 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "'we-they' perspective in which outsiders are viewed with suspicion or distrust"&lt;ref name="RCMP Review"/&gt;
* Command and control structures with a rigid hierarchical foundation ("results indicate that the more rigid the hierarchy, the lower the scores on a measure of ethical decision-making" concludes one study reviewed in the report);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Owens | first = Katherine M. B. | coauthors = Jeffrey Pfeifer | title = Police Leadership and Ethics: Training and Police Recommendations | journal = The Canadian Journal of Police and Security Services | volume = 1 | pages = 7 | year = 2002 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Deficiencies in internal accountability mechanisms (including internal investigation processes).&lt;ref name="RCMP Review"/&gt;

Police use of force is kept in check in many jurisdictions by the issuance of a [[use of force continuum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stetser | first = Merle | title = The Use of Force in Police Control of Violence: Incidents Resulting in Assaults on Officers |year= 2001 | publisher = LFB Scholarly Publishing L.L.C. | location = New York | isbn = 1-931202-08-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A use of force continuum sets levels of force considered appropriate in direct response to a subject's behavior. This power is granted by the civil government, with limits set out in [[statutory law]] as well as [[common law]].

Violence used by police can be excessive despite being lawful, especially in the context of political repression.  Indeed "police brutality" is often used to refer to violence used by the police to achieve politically desirable ends and, therefore, when none should be used at all according to widely held values and cultural norms in the society (rather than to refer to excessive violence used where at least some may be considered justifiable).

*The [[Amnesty International]] 2007 report on human rights also documents widespread police misconduct in many other countries, especially countries with [[authoritarian]] regimes.&lt;ref name="Amnesty 2007"/&gt;
*In the UK, the reports into the death of New Zealand teacher and anti-racism campaigner [[Death of Blair Peach|Blair Peach]] in 1979 was published on the Metropolitan Police website on 27 April 2010. The conclusion was that Blair Peach was killed by a police officer, but that the other police officers in the same unit had refused to cooperate with the inquiry by lying to investigators, making it impossible to identify the actual killer.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}
*In the UK, [[Death of Ian Tomlinson|Ian Tomlinson]] was filmed by an American tourist apparently being hit with a baton and then pushed to the floor, as he walked home from work during the [[2009 G-20 London summit protests]]. Tomlinson then collapsed and died.  Although he was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, the officer who allegedly assaulted Tomlinson was released without charge.
* In Serbia, police brutality occurred in numerous cases during protests against [[Slobodan Milošević]], and has also been recorded during protests against governments since Milošević lost power.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} The most recent case was recorded in July 2010, when five people, including two girls, were arrested, handcuffed and then beaten with clubs and otherwise mistreated for one hour. Security camera recordings of the beating were obtained by the media, causing public outrage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=06&amp;nav_category=16&amp;nav_id=443501 B92 (video)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Hronika/197194/Policija-nas-tukla--bez-razloga Blic (video)]&lt;/ref&gt; The police officials, including [[Ivica Dačić]], the Serbian minister of internal affairs, denied this sequence of events and accused the victims "to have attacked the police officers first". He also publicly stated that "police isn't here to beat up citizens", but that it is known "what one is going to get when attacking the police".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2010&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=07&amp;nav_id=443903 B92: Dačić: Police isn't here to beat up citizens]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
In [[England and Wales]], an independent organization known as the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] investigates reports of police misconduct. They automatically investigate any deaths caused by, or thought to be caused by, police action.

A similar body operates in Scotland, known as the [[Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland]]. In Northern Ireland the [[Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland]] has a similar role to that of the IPCC and PCCS.

==Independent oversight==
Various community groups have criticized police brutality. These groups often stress the need for oversight by independent citizen review boards and other methods of ensuring accountability for police action.

Umbrella organizations and justice committees (often named after a deceased individual or those victimized by police violence) usually engage in a solidarity of those affected. [[Amnesty International]] is another organization active in the issue of police brutality.

Tools used by these groups include video recordings, which are sometimes broadcast using websites such as [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = YouTube.com prompts police beating probe | url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2645350&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 | publisher = [[Associated Press]] | last = Veiga | first = Alex |date= November 11, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-11-12 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens and communities have begun independent projects to monitor police activity in an effort to reduce violence and misconduct. These are often called "Cop Watch" programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Policing the Police: Civilian Video Monitoring of Police Activity | url = http://theglobaljournal.net/group/global-minds/article/643/ | publisher = [[The Global Journal]] | last = Krupanski | first = Marc |date= March 7, 2012 | accessdate = 2012-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper supervision by competent police supervisors and administration can reduce police misconduct.
