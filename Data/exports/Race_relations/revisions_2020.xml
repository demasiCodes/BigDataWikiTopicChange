'''Race relations''' is a [[sociological]] concept that emerged in [[Chicago]] in connection with the work of sociologist [[Robert E. Park]] and the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]].&lt;ref name="Black Deficit"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shilliam |first1=Robbie |title=How Black Deficit Entered the British Academy |url=https://robbieshilliam.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/how-black-deficit-entered-the-british-academy.pdf |website=robbieshilliam.wordpress.com |publisher=Robbie Shilliam |access-date=28 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Race relations designates a [[paradigm]] or field in sociology&lt;ref name="Steinberg2007" /&gt; and a legal concept in the [[United Kingdom]]. As a sociological field, race relations attempts to explain how [[Race (human categorization)|racial groups]] relate to each other, and in particular to give an explanation of violence connected to race.

The paradigm of race relations was critiqued by its own practitioners for its failure to predict the [[anti-racist]] struggles of the 1960s. The paradigm has also been criticized as overlooking the power differential between races, implying that the source of violence is disharmony rather than [[racism|racist]] power structures. The term "race relations" has been called a [[euphemism]] for [[white supremacy]] or racism.

In spite of the controversial or discredited status of the race relations paradigm, the term is sometimes used in a generic way to designate matters related to race. Opinion polls, such as [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] polls, use the term "race relations" to group together various responses connected to race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/312875/race-relations-nation-important-problem.aspx |title=Race Relations as the Nation's Most Important Problem |last=Newport |first=Frank |date=June 19, 2020 |website=Gallup |access-date=July 10, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blow2020" /&gt; University sociology courses are often named "[[Sociology of race and ethnic relations|Race and Ethnic Relations]]."&lt;ref name="Steinberg2007" /&gt;

==In the United States==
Robert E. Park of the [[University of Chicago]] coined the term "race relations cycle," which he believed to be a universal pattern emerging when races come into contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Race Relations Cycle |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=Cengage }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle was supposed to be driven by subjective attitudes that members of races feel toward other races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Ballis Lal |first=Barbara |title=Race Relations Cycle |encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Nationalism |date=December 30, 2015 |pages=1–3 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd |doi=10.1002/9781118663202.wberen598 |isbn=9781118663202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Park felt that race relations are hostile at first, but thaw over time.

The steps in Park's cycle were contact, competition, accommodation, and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Park did not carry out studies across ethnic groups to check that his cycle approximated reality. However, his students tested his ideas by studying communities of Chinese and Japanese origin living in the United States and found that, contrary to Park's theory, adopting white culture did not lead to acceptance by [[white Americans]]. Park did not discard his theory in spite of the failures to verify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lyman |first=Stanford M. |date=March 1, 1968 |title=The Race Relations Cycle of Robert E. Park |journal=Pacific Sociological Review |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=16–22 |doi=10.2307/1388520|jstor=1388520 |s2cid=108207136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, white residents of Chicago instigated the mass murder of black residents, an event known as the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]]. After this violent event, city authorities established the [[Chicago Commission on Race Relations]]. This was composed entirely of men, six [[African-American]]s and six [[European-American]]s.&lt;ref name="Chicago Race Riot"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Chicago Race Riot of 1919 |url=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/chicago-race-riot-of-1919 |website=History |publisher=History com |access-date=30 June 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Negro in Chicago"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Negro in Chicago; a study of race relations and a race riot |date=1922 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |url=https://archive.org/stream/negroinchicagost00chic#page/n25/mode/2up |access-date=30 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Everett Hughes (sociologist)|Everett Hughes]] published a collection of Park's articles in 1950, seven years after Park's death. The beginnings of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1950s caused interest in the study of race, and Park's work became a founding text in the emerging field named "race relations." African-American scholars had little more than token representation in this field.&lt;ref name="Steinberg2007" /&gt;

Because the field of race relations imagined steady progress, it failed to predict the radical upheavals of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Everett Hughes delivered an address at the [[American Sociological Association]] (of which he was president) titled ''Race Relations and the Sociological Imagination'' in which Hughes confessed the failure of prediction: "Why did social scientists — and sociologists in particular — not foresee the explosion of collective action of Negro Americans toward immediate full integration into American society?"&lt;ref name="Steinberg2007" /&gt;

The [[Kerner Report]], commissioned by the US government in 1967 to study the causes of 1960s race riots, said that the [[Watts riots]] of 1965 "shocked all who had been confident that race relations were improving in the North."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/8073NCJRS.pdf |publisher=National Criminal Justice Reference Service |page=20 |access-date=July 10, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report clarified that the major cause of the riots was white racism, and recommended job creation measures and [[police reform]]. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] discarded the report's recommendations.&lt;ref name=Risen09&gt;{{cite book|last=Risen|first=Clay|title=A nation on fire : America in the wake of the King assassination|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-470-17710-5|chapter=King, Johnson, and The Terrible, Glorious Thirty-First Day of March|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/nationonfireamer00rise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, some sociologists sought replace the notion of race relations by studying racial oppression. For example, the 1972 book ''Racial Oppression in America'' by [[Bob Blauner]] challenged the race relations paradigm.&lt;ref name="Steinberg2007" /&gt;

==In the United Kingdom ==

The concept of race relations became institutionally significant in the [[United Kingdom]] through the establishment of the Department of Social Anthropology under the leadership of [[Kenneth Little]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="Black Deficit" /&gt;

===Institutions===
The [[Institute of Race Relations]] was established in 1958. Its remit was to research, publish and collect resources on race relations across the world. However in 1972, the membership of the institute supported the staff in the radical transformation of the organisation: rather than being a policy-oriented academic institution  it became an anti-racist [[think tank]].&lt;ref name="irr"&gt;{{cite web |title=About |url=http://www.irr.org.uk/about/ |website=www.irr.org.uk |publisher=Institute of Race Relations |access-date=28 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Race Relations Board]] was created following the passing of the Race Relations Act 1965 as a body "to assess and resolve individual cases of discrimination."&lt;ref name="First Report"&gt;{{cite web |title=First Report of the Race Relations Board |url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/relationships/collections1/race-relations-act-1965/first-report-of-the-race-relations-board-/ |website=UK Parliament |publisher=UK Parliament |access-date=29 June 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its remit was originally restricted to places of public resort and regarding disposal of tenancies, but this was expanded with the passage of the Race Relations Act 1968.&lt;ref name="First Report"/&gt;

===Legislation in the UK===
Race Relations Acts are legislation in the [[United Kingdom]] to outlaw [[racial discrimination]]:
* [[Race Relations Act 1965]]
* [[Race Relations Act 1968]]
* [[Race Relations Act 1976]]

==Criticism==
The concept of race relations has been criticized as implying an evenly-matched relationship between races, rather than an unequal oppression. For example, [[Stephen Steinberg]] of [[City University of New York|CUNY]] says that the term "racial oppression" should be used instead:&lt;blockquote&gt;While the term "race relations" is meant to convey value neutrality, on closer examination it is riddled with value. Indeed, its rhetorical function is to obfuscate the true natue of "race relations," which is a system of racial domination and exploitation based on violence, resulting in the suppression and dehumanization of an entire people over centuries of American history.&lt;ref name="Steinberg2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steinberg |first=Stephen |author-link=Stephen Steinberg |date=2007 |title=Race Relations: a Critique |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Race_Relations/TrSOCwAAQBAJ |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804763233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Journalist [[Charles M. Blow]] observes that Americans who were polled on their "satisfaction with race relations" reported lower satisfaction after the rise of [[Black Lives Matter]], an anti-racism movement. The term "race relations," according to Blow, "suggests a relationship that swings from harmony to disharmony." Objecting to racism creates awareness of disharmony, whereas silently submitting to racial oppression creates a false impression of harmonious race relations. Because of this counterintuitive result, Blow contends that the terms "race relations," "racial tension," and "racial division" are unhelpful [[euphemism]]s for what should property be called [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref name="Blow2020"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blow |first=Charles M. |date=July 8, 2020 |title=Call a Thing a Thing |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/opinion/racism-united-states.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 9, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
