'''Race relations''' is a concept which emerged in [[Chicago]] following the [[Chicago race riot of 1919]].&lt;ref name="Black Deficit"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shilliam |first1=Robbie |title=How Black Deficit Entered the British Academy |url=https://robbieshilliam.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/how-black-deficit-entered-the-british-academy.pdf |website=robbieshilliam.wordpress.com |publisher=Robbie Shilliam |accessdate=28 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of this violence the city authorities established the [[Chicago Commission on Race Relations]]. This was composed entirely of men, six [[African-American]]s and six [[European-American]]s.&lt;ref name="Chicago Race Riot"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Chicago Race Riot of 1919 |url=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/chicago-race-riot-of-1919 |website=History |publisher=History com |accessdate=30 June 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Negro in Chicago"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Negro in Chicago; a study of race relations and a race riot |date=1922 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |url=https://archive.org/stream/negroinchicagost00chic#page/n25/mode/2up |accessdate=30 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;However it was through the establishment of the Department of Social Anthropology under the leadership of [[Kenneth Little]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], that the concept became institutionally significant in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Black Deficit"/&gt;

==Institutions==
The [[Institute of Race Relations]] was established in 1958. Its remit was to research, publish and collect resources on race relations across the world. However in 1972, the membership of the institute supported the staff in the radical transformation of the organisation: rather than being a policy-oriented academic institution  it became an anti-racist [[think tank]].&lt;ref name="irr"&gt;{{cite web |title=About |url=http://www.irr.org.uk/about/ |website=www.irr.org.uk |publisher=Institute of Race Relations |accessdate=28 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Race Relations Board]] was created following the passing of the Race Relations Act 1965 as a body "to assess and resolve individual cases of discrimination."&lt;ref name="First Report"&gt;{{cite web |title=First Report of the Race Relations Board |url=https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/relationships/collections1/race-relations-act-1965/first-report-of-the-race-relations-board-/ |website=UK Parliament |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=29 June 2019 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its remit was originally restricted to places of public resort and regarding disposal of tenancies, but this was expanded with the passage of the Race Relations Act 1968.&lt;ref name="First Report"/&gt;

==Legislation in the UK==
The [[Race Relations Act 1965]] was the first piece of legislation in the [[United Kingdom]] to outlaw [[racial discrimination]].

The [[Race Relations Act 1968]] was the second piece of such legislation.

The [[Race Relations Act 1976]]  was the third piece of such legislation.
