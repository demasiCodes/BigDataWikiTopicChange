Ruby Rich]], '''New Queer Cinema''' refers to seemingly simultaneous appearance on the independent film circuit of films dealing openly and even aggressively with [[queer|queer culture]], politics, and identity in the early nineties. However, the directors and producers associated with the term were mostly not otherwise associated and New Queer Cinema never became a movement.

Directors:
* [[Todd Haynes]]: ''[[Poison (movie)|Poison]]''
* [[Christopher Munch]]: ''[[The Hours and Times]]''
* [[Gregg Araki]]: ''[[The Living End (movie)|The Living End]]''
* [[Tom Kalin]]: ''[[Swoon]]''
* [[Derek Jarman]]: ''[[Edward II]]''

Producers:
*[[Christine Vachon]]: ''Poison'' and ''Swoon''
*[[Andrea Sperling]]: ''The Hours and Times''

However, the attitude and openess of the New Queer Cinema may be felt today in the ability of more and more films such as ''[[Boys Don't Cry (movie)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' and ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]''.
