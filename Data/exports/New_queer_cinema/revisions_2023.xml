"'''New queer cinema'''" is a term first coined by the academic [[B. Ruby Rich]] in ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Queer Cinema|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/features/new-queer-cinema-b-ruby-rich|publisher=Sight &amp; Sound|date=September 1992|access-date=January 12, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazine in 1992 to define and describe a movement in [[queer]]-themed [[independent film]]making in the early 1990s.

It is also referred to as the "queer new wave".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Kuhn|first1=Annette|title=New Queer Cinema|date=2012-12-20|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199587261.001.0001/acref-9780199587261-e-0478|work=A Dictionary of Film Studies|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199587261.001.0001|isbn=978-0-19-958726-1|access-date=2021-09-16|last2=Westwell|first2=Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term developed from use of the word ''queer'' in academic writing in the 1980s and 1990s as an inclusive way of describing gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender identity and experience, and also defining a form of sexuality that was fluid and subversive of traditional understandings of sexuality. The major film studio to discuss these issues was aptly named [[New Line Cinema]] with its [[Fine Line Features]] division. Since 1992, the phenomenon has also been described by various other academics and has been used to describe several other films released since the 1990s. Films of the new queer cinema movement typically share certain themes, such as the rejection of [[heteronormativity]] and the lives of [[LGBT]] protagonists living on the fringe of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Queer Cinema|url=http://mubi.com/lists/new-queer-cinema|publisher=Mubi.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316030642/http://mubi.com/lists/new-queer-cinema|archive-date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GLBTQ New Queer Cinema|url=http://www.glbtqarchive.com/arts/new_queer_cinema_A.pdf|publisher=Glbtq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Queer cinema ===
Susan Hayward states that queer cinema existed for decades before it was given its official label, such as, with the films of French creators [[Jean Cocteau]] ({{Lang|fr|[[Le sang d'un poète]]}} in 1934) and [[Jean Genet]] (''[[Un chant d'amour]]'' in 1950). Queer cinema is associated with [[Avant-garde film|avant-garde]] and [[underground film]]s (e.g., [[Andy Warhol]]'s 1960s films). In avant-garde film, there are lesbian filmmakers, who laid the heritage for queer cinema, notably [[Ulrike Ottinger]], [[Chantal Akerman]] and [[Pratibha Parmar]]. An important influence on the development of queer cinema was [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s 1970s and 1980s European [[art film]]s, which added a "gay and queer sensibility" to film (e.g., ''[[Querelle]]'' from 1982, based on Genet's novel).&lt;ref name="Hayward, Susan 2006. p. 329-333"&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Queer cinema" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 329-333&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Rosa von Praunheim]], who has made more than 100 films on queer topics since the late 1960s, many of them have been shown and rated internationally. Some of the director's films are considered milestones in queer cinema. Von Praunheim became an international icon of queer cinema.&lt;ref name="DeutscheWelle"&gt;{{cite web |title=Germany's most famous gay rights activist: Rosa von Praunheim |url=http://www.dw.com/en/germanys-most-famous-gay-rights-activist-filmmaker-rosa-von-praunheim-at-75/a-41514818 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence on queer cinema was the Brazilian filmmaker [[Héctor Babenco]], whose film ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (film)|Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', from 1985, depicted a man in prison, who is seduced by his cellmate.&lt;ref name="Hayward, Susan 2006. p. 329-333" /&gt; His films also examined the relationship between sexual, social, and political oppression, which would go on to become key themes of new queer cinema.&lt;ref name="Queer Images"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benshoff |first1= Harry M.| last2= Griffin|first2=Sean |date= 2006|title=Queer Images: A History of Gay and Lesbian Film in America |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, inc |isbn= 0-7425-1972-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|192}}

The identification of queer cinema probably emerged in the mid-1980s through the influence of [[queer theory]], which aims to "challenge and push further debates on gender and sexuality" as developed by [[feminist theory]] and "confuse binary essentialisms around gender and sexual identity, expose their limitations", and depict the blurring of these roles and identities.&lt;ref name="Hayward, Susan 2006. p. 329-333" /&gt; Queer cinema filmmakers sometimes made films in genres that were typically considered mainstream, then subverting conventions by depicting the "question of pleasure" and celebrating excess, or by re-adding homosexual themes or historical elements where they had been erased through [[straightwashing]] (e.g. in [[Derek Jarman]]'s 1991 historical film ''[[Edward II (film)|Edward II]]'').&lt;ref name="Hayward, Susan 2006. p. 329-333" /&gt; Queer cinema filmmakers called for a "multiplicity of voices and sexualities" and equally had a "collection of different aesthetics" in their work.&lt;ref name="Hayward, Susan 2006. p. 329-333" /&gt; The issue of "lesbian invisibility" had been raised in queer cinema, since more funding went to gay male filmmakers than lesbian directors, as is the case with the heterosexual/mainstream film industry, and as such, much of queer cinema focused on the "construction of male desire".&lt;ref name="Hayward, Susan 2006. p. 329-333" /&gt;

=== Rich's articles ===
[[File:B. Ruby Rich.jpg|thumb|upright|Film critic [[B. Ruby Rich]] coined the term "new queer cinema" in 1992.]]In her 1992 article, Rich commented on the strong gay and lesbian presence on the previous year's film festival circuit and coined the phrase "new queer cinema" to describe a growing movement of similarly themed films being made by gay and lesbian independent filmmakers, chiefly in North America and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="michelleaaron"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aaron|first=Michelle|title=New Queer Cinema: A Critical Reader|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|page=3|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGd4-qtfyzIC&amp;pg=PA3| isbn=978-0-8135-3486-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich developed her theory in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'', describing films that were radical in form and aggressive in their presentation of sexual identities, which challenged both the status quo of heterosexual definition and resisted promoting "positive" images of lesbians and [[gay men]] that had been advocated by the [[gay liberation movement]] of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rich|first=B. Ruby|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/1915/new-queer-cinemathe-director-s-cut|title=New Queer Cinema: The Director's Cut|date=2013|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8223-5411-6|language=en|doi=10.1215/9780822399698|s2cid=235148891 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the films of new queer cinema, the protagonists and narratives were predominantly [[LGBT]], but were presented invariably as outsiders and renegades from the rules of conventional society, who embraced radical and unconventional gender roles and ways of life, frequently casting themselves as outlaws or fugitives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Drawing on [[postmodernist]] and [[poststructuralist]] academic theories of the 1980s, the new queer cinema presented human identity and sexuality as socially constructed, and therefore fluid and changeable, rather than fixed. In the world of New Queer Cinema, sexuality is often a chaotic and subversive force, which is alienating to and often brutally repressed by dominant heterosexual power structures. Films in the new queer cinema movement frequently featured explicit and unapologetic depictions of same-sex sexual activity, and presented same-sex relationships that reconfigured traditional heterosexual notions of family and marriage. While not all identifying with a specific political movement, new queer cinema films were invariably radical, as they sought to challenge and subvert assumptions about identity, gender, class, family and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Namaste|first=Ki|date=July 1994|title=The Politics of Inside/Out: Queer Theory, Poststructuralism, and a Sociological Approach to Sexuality|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=12|issue=2|pages=220–231|doi=10.2307/201866|jstor=201866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lindner, Katharina.|title=Film Bodies : Queer Feminist Encounters with Gender and Sexuality in Cinema.|date=2017|publisher=I.B.

=== Generic developments ===
[[File:River Phoenix.png|thumb|150px|[[River Phoenix]]'s critically acclaimed performance as gay hustler [[Mikey Waters]] in Gus Van Sant's 1991 film ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' helped bring queer cinema to a broader audience.]]

The 1991 documentary ''[[Paris Is Burning (film)|Paris Is Burning]]'' introduced audiences to yet another subcultural realm. Director [[Jennie Livingston]] captured the realities of New York's [[ball culture|drag balls and houses]], and of the [[race and ethnicity in the United States|people of color]] who occupied these spaces. This was an arguably underground world with which many Americans were unfamiliar. Aesthetic excellence and flamboyance were crucial in drag performances and competitions. Stylized [[vogue (dance)|vogue]] dancing was also exhibited as central to the drag experience, notably influencing the artistry of pop icon [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. New queer cinema figures like Livingston encouraged viewers to suspend their ignorance, and enjoy the diversity of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=How Paris is Burning became a touchstone of queer cinema - The Skinny|url=https://www.theskinny.co.uk/festivals/edinburgh-festivals/film/how-paris-is-burning-becomes-a-touchstone-of-queer-cinema|access-date=2020-06-05|website=www.theskinny.co.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=George|first=Cassidy|date=2019-06-12|title=The 'Paris Is Burning' Director on Its Message: 'Be Yourself'|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/movies/paris-is-burning-jennie-livingston.html|access-date=2020-06-05|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-02-26|title=Jennie Livingston on Paris Is Burning 30 Years Later|url=https://hyperallergic.com/544265/jennie-livingston-interview-paris-is-burning-criterion-collection/|access-date=2020-06-05|website=Hyperallergic|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Turner|first=Kyle|title=The Re-released 'Paris Is Burning' Brings Us into the Future|url=https://www.gq.com/story/paris-is-burning|access-date=2020-06-05|website=GQ|date=25 June 2019|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did these films frequently reference the [[AIDS]] crisis of the 1980s, the film movement itself can be seen as a response to the crisis. The tone and energy of these movies reflected the assertive outrage of [[HIV/AIDS activism|AIDS activist organizations]] of the past decade.&lt;ref name="Queer Images" /&gt;{{rp|220}} AIDS activist videos, in particular, had a strong influence on the themes and imagery in new queer cinema as many of its notable figures were directly involved with AIDS activism.&lt;ref name="Queer Images" /&gt;{{rp|221}} These films commented on the failure of the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration to respond to the AIDS epidemic and the social stigma experienced by the gay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rich|first=B.

Among the films cited by Rich were [[Todd Haynes]]'s ''[[Poison (film)|Poison]]'' (1991),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emanuellevy.com/review/featured-review/gay-pride-2015-celebrating-haynes-poison/ |title=Gay Pride 2015: Celebrating Todd Haynes' ''Poison'' |first=Emanuel |last=Levy |author-link=Emanuel Levy |website=Emmanuel Levy |date=June 27, 2015 |access-date=November 3, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713162437/http://emanuellevy.com/review/featured-review/gay-pride-2015-celebrating-haynes-poison/ |archive-date=July 13, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/hearth-of-darkness-rob-whites-todd-haynes |title=Hearth of Darkness: Rob White's Todd Haynes |work=[[Slant Magazine]] |first=Clayton |last=Dillard |date=April 3, 2013 |access-date=November 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurie Lynd]]'s ''[[RSVP (1991 film)|RSVP]]'' (1991), [[Isaac Julien]]'s ''[[Young Soul Rebels]]'' (1991), [[Derek Jarman]]'s ''[[Edward II (film)|Edward II]]'' (1991), [[Tom Kalin]]'s ''[[Swoon (film)|Swoon]]'' (1992),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/7418-on-the-margins-todd-haynes-s-poison On the Margins: Todd Haynes's Poison|Current|The Criterion Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gregg Araki]]'s ''[[The Living End (film)|The Living End]]'' (1992). All the films feature explicitly gay and lesbian protagonists and subjects; explicit and unapologetic depictions of or references to gay sex; and a confrontational and often antagonistic approach towards heterosexual culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These directors were making their films at a time when the gay community was facing new challenges from the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and the [[conservatism|conservative]] political wave brought on by the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the United States and the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the United Kingdom. Jarman was diagnosed with AIDS in 1986, and died in 1994 at the age of 52. Jarman's public promotion of [[gay rights]] and equality have established him as an influential activist within the [[LGBT]] community. [[Queer theory]] and politics were emerging topics in academic circles, with proponents arguing that gender and sexual categories, such as homosexual and heterosexual, were historical social constructs, subject to change with cultural attitudes. Rich noted that many films were beginning to represent sexualities that were unashamedly neither fixed nor conventional, and coined the phrase "new queer cinema".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other important examples of new queer cinema include the first feature film by a black lesbian, [[Cheryl Dunye]]'s ''[[The Watermelon Woman]]'' (1996),&lt;ref name=PK&gt;{{Citation|last=Keough|first=Peter|title=Slice of life&amp;nbsp;— The Watermelon Woman refreshes| newspaper = [[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]]  | date = May 8, 1997  | url = http://www.bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/movies/reviews/05-08-97/THE_WATERMELON_WOMAN.html  | access-date=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==In the 21st century==
Beginning in the 2010s, a number of LGBT filmmakers, including [[Rose Troche]] and [[Travis Mathews]], identified a newer trend in LGBT filmmaking, in which the influence of new queer cinema was evolving toward more universal audience appeal.&lt;ref name=concussion&gt;[http://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/sundance-interview-concussion-directed-by-stacie-passon-produced-by-rose-troche-starring-robin-weigert "Sundance Interview: Concussion"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305072540/http://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/sundance-interview-concussion-directed-by-stacie-passon-produced-by-rose-troche-starring-robin-weigert |date=2016-03-05 }}.

''Nightcharm'', March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich, the originator of the phrase "new queer cinema", has identified the emergence in the late 2000s of LGBT-themed mainstream films such as ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', ''[[Milk (2008 American film)|Milk]]'', and ''[[The Kids Are All Right (film)|The Kids Are All Right]]'' as a key moment in the evolution of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Q (radio show)|Q]]'', May 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Troche and Mathews singled out [[Stacie Passon]]'s 2013 ''[[Concussion (2013 film)|Concussion]]'', a film about [[marital infidelity]] in which the central characters' lesbianism is a relatively minor aspect of a story and the primary theme is how a long-term relationship can become troubled and unfulfilling regardless of its gender configuration, as a prominent example of the trend.&lt;ref name=concussion /&gt;&lt;ref name=nightcharm /&gt; The French film ''[[Blue Is the Warmest Colour]]'', which won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]], has also been singled out as a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xtra.ca/public/National/B_Ruby_Rich_on_this_years_queer_film_festival_circuit-13653.aspx "B Ruby Rich on this year's queer film festival circuit"].
