In [[1992]], ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' magazine printed an article by North American [[Feminist]] and critic, [[B. Ruby Rich]].  The article, which gathered together Rich’s experiences of, and reflections upon, the strong “[[gay]]” presence on the previous year’s film festival circuit, effectively coined the phrase "New Queer Cinema"
&lt;ref name=OutNQC&gt;History of New Queer Cinema, webpage: [http://www.outrate.net/newqueercinema.html Outrate-NQC]&lt;/ref&gt;. New Queer Cinema refers to the seemingly simultaneous appearance on the independent film circuit of films dealing openly and even aggressively with [[queer|queer culture]], politics, and identity in the early nineties. These films were heavily influenced by the AIDS crisis, the indifference of the [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H W Bush]] presidential administrations and the resulting homophobia and fear that ensued. 

As B. Ruby Rich also wrote in the [[Village Voice]],&lt;ref name=OutNQC&gt;History of New Queer Cinema, webpage: [http://www.outrate.net/newqueercinema.html Outrate-NQC].&lt;/ref&gt; she described films that were radical in form and aggressive in their espousal of sexual identities which challenged both the [[heteronormative]] status quo and the promotion of positive images of [[lesbian]]s and [[gay]] men that had been advocated by the [[gay liberation movement]] for more than ten years: films such as [[Todd Haynes]]' ''[[Poison]]'' (1990), [[Isaac Julien]]'s ''Young Soul Rebels'' (1991), [[Derek Jarman]]'s ''[[Edward II (film)|Edward II]]'' and Tom Kalin's ''[[Swoon (film)|Swoon]]'' (1992).

These directors were making their films at a time when the gay community was still reeling at the [[heterosexual]] hysteria and policies of witch-hunting which had characterized the early days of the [[AIDS]] crisis in the [[1980's]].  Jarman himself had been diagnosed with AIDS in 1986.

Simultaneously, [[queer theory]] and politics had begun to take hold in academic circles. [[Queer]] contends that “gay”, and the concepts of “[[homosexuality]]” and “[[heterosexuality]]”, are pre-constructed identities.  Queer theory asserts that as these are the products of a specific era of social history, they are arbitrary and that there will come a time when they are no longer relevant categorizations.  Queer is the freedom to make a choice.  Whether a lesbian wants to sleep with a man, or a “straight” person wants to experiment, queer is about forging an identity of one's own.  

When Rich noted that many films were beginning to represent sexualities which were unashamedly neither fixed nor conventional, the phrase "[[New Queer Cinema]]" was coined.

==Evolution of Queer Cinema==
New Queer Cinema is not really an organized movement, despite the fact that the directors and producers associated with the term may share similar intentions. However, the attitude and openness of New Queer Cinema may be felt today in the production of more and more films such as ''[[Boys Don't Cry (movie)|Boys Don't Cry]]'' and ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]''.

In the 21st Century, Queer Cinema is no longer a small sub-genre of independent film; it is rather a traceable movement of cinematic representations of sex towards the destabilisation of conventional sexualities and identities.  Contemporary queer is less about the radical form of those early examples of “New Queer Cinema”, than about the queering of traditional/classic cinematic content.  

The list below highlights the trajectory of what was once considered a radical concept into the mainstream, taking less prescriptive and more fluid representations of sexuality with it.
