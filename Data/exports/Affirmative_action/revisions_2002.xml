It can refer to anything from [[equal opportunity]] hiring practices to practices that actually prefer [[minority|minorities]], such as [[racial quota]]s and lowered standards for minority applicants.
Some claim that racial preferences have in effect caused a [[reverse discrimination]] against the traditional majority (white males in Europe and North America) and liken such preferences to [[apartheid]].
