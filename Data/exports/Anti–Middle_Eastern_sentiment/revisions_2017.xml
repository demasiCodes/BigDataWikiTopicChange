Anti-Middle Eastern racism has a long history in the United States, although it had generally been limited to Jews until recent decades. It is suggested by [[Leo Rosten]] that as soon as they left the boat, Jews were subject to racism from the port immigration authorities. The derogatory term ''[[kike]]'' was adopted when referring to Jews (because they often could not write so they may have signed their immigration papers with circles – or kikel in [[Yiddish]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosten, Leo |year=1968|title=The Joys of Yiddish|isbn=978-0671728137}}&lt;/ref&gt; &gt; In early films, such as Cohen's Advertising Scheme (1904, silent), Jews were stereotyped as "scheming merchants", often with exaggerated West Asian racial features such as big, hooked noses, big lips, small eyes, black curly hair, and olive and/or brown-colored skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/imagesjews.html |title=The Movies, Race, and Ethnicity: Jews|work= Media Resources Center |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1910s, Southern Jewish communities were attacked by the Ku Klux Klan, who objected to Jewish immigration, and often used "The Jewish Banker" in their propaganda. In 1915, [[Leo Frank]] was lynched in Georgia after being convicted of rape and sentenced to death (his punishment was commuted to life imprisonment).&lt;ref name="lynching openly organized"&gt;Phagan, 1987, p. 27, states that "everyone knew the identity of the lynchers" (putting the words in her father's mouth). Oney, 2003, p. 526, quotes Carl Abernathy as saying, "They'd go to a man's office and talk to him or … see a man on the job and talk to him," and an unidentified lyncher as saying "The organization of the body was more open than mysterious."&lt;/ref&gt; The second  [[Ku Klux Klan]], which grew enormously in the early 1920s by promoting "100% Americanism", focused its hatred on Jews, as well as Catholics and African American.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Pegram, ''One Hundred Percent American: The Rebirth and Decline of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s'' (Ivan R. Dee, 2011), ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The events in [[Nazi Germany]] also attracted attention from the United States. Jewish lobbying for intervention in Europe drew opposition from the [[isolationists]], amongst whom was Father [[Charles Coughlin]], a well-known radio priest, who was known to be critical of Jews, believing that they were leading the United States into the war.&lt;ref name="Coughlin"&gt;[http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/53/coughlin.html Father Charles Edward Coughlin (1891–1971)] By Richard Sanders, Editor, ''Press for Conversion!''&lt;/ref&gt; He preached in weekly, overtly [[anti-Semitic]] sermons and, from 1936, began publication of a newspaper, ''[[Social Justice (periodical)|Social Justice]]'', in which he printed anti-Semitic accusations such as [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Mary Christine Athans|title=A New Perspective on Father Charles E. Coughlin|journal=Church History|volume= 56|number= 2|date=June 1987|pages= 224–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] confronted [[The Walt Disney Company]] about [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab]] [[Racism|racist]] content in its animated film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. At first, Disney denied any problems but eventually relented and changed two lines in the opening song.&lt;ref name="adc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=283|title=Arab Stereotypes and American Educators|publisher=[[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]]|accessdate=2007-03-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405005650/http://www.adc.org/index.php?id=283| archivedate= April 5, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the ADC were still unhappy with the portrayal of Arabic characters and the referral to the Middle East as "[[Barbarian|barbaric]]".&lt;ref name="adc" /&gt;

Since 9/11, anti-Middle Eastern racism has risen dramatically. A man in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], who was shot and wounded after an assailant accused him of "blowing up the [[country]]", and four immigrants shot and killed by a man named Larme Price, who confessed to killing them as revenge for the [[September 11 attacks]]. Price said he was motivated by a desire to kill people of Arab descent after the attacks.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/31/nyregion/police-arrest-brooklyn-man-in-slayings-of-4-shopkeepers.html |title=Police Arrest Brooklyn Man In Slayings of 4 Shopkeepers - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2003-03-31 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Price described his victims as Arabs, only one was from an [[Arab country]]. This appears to be a trend; because of stereotypes of Arabs, several non-Arab, non-Muslim groups were subjected to attacks in the wake of 9/11, including several Sikh men attacked for wearing their religiously-mandated [[turban]]. Price's mother, Leatha Price, said that her son's anger at Arabs was a matter of mental illness, not ethnic hatred.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

One widely publicized incident was the [[murder of Balbir Singh Sodhi]]. The term "towel-head" is a pejorative reference to Middle Eastern headdresses including turbans and is mainly used to refer to both Arabs and terrorists. Middle Eastern, Central Asian, and Sikh turban wearers usually wind their turban anew for each wearing, using long strips of cloth that are usually five meters or less. However, some elaborate South Asian turbans may be permanently formed and sewn to a foundation. Turbans can be very large or quite modest dependent upon region, culture, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeastexplorer.com/Turkey/Turban |title=Turban profile.

In November 2005, the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] examined antisemitism on college campuses. It reported that "incidents of threatened bodily injury, physical intimidation or property damage are now rare", but antisemitism still occurs on many campuses and is a "serious problem." The Commission recommended that the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] protect college students from antisemitism through vigorous enforcement of ''Title VI'' of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and further recommended that [[United States Congress|Congress]] clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eusccr.com/Ending%20Campus%20Ant-Semitism1.htm |title=Ending Campus Anti-Semitism|accessdate= 2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 2006, [[Yale University]] founded the [[Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism]] (YIISA), the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, as part of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Director [[Charles A. Small|Charles Small]] of the Center cited the increase in antisemitism worldwide in recent years as generating a "need to understand the current manifestation of this disease".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/19/america/NA_GEN_US_Yale_Anti_Semitism.php Yale creates center to study antisemitism] Associated Press, 19 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, Yale voted to close this initiative. After carrying out a routine review, the faculty review committee said that the initiative had not met its research and teaching standards. [[Donald Green]], then head of Yale’s Institution for Social and Policy Studies, the body under whose aegis the antisemitism initiative was run, said that it had not had many papers published in the relevant leading journals or attracted many students. As with other programs that had been in a similar situation, the initiative had therefore been cancelled.&lt;ref name=nhregister201106&gt;{{Cite news | author = Mary E.

Marcus]], who is now the director of the Initiative to Combat Anti-Semitism and Anti-Israelism in America’s Educational Systems at the Institute for Jewish and Community Research, and [[Deborah Lipstadt]], who described the decision as "weird" and "strange."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Yale-C-123455979.html Yale Pulls the Plug on Anti-Semitism Institute]. nbcconnecticut.com (9 June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antony Lerman]] has supported Yale's decision, describing the YIISA as a politicized initiative that was devoted to the promotion of Israel rather than to serious research on antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antonylerman.com/2011/06/10/antisemitism-research-just-improved-yale%E2%80%99s-initiative-for-studying-antisemitism-is-axed/|author= Antony Lerman|title=Antisemitism Research Just Improved: Yale’s ‘Initiative’ for Studying Antisemitism is Axed| date=10 June 2011|accessdate=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) concluded that 15% of Americans hold antisemitic views, which was in-line with the average of the previous ten years, but a decline from the 29% of the early sixties. The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, "with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views." The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech. The 2007 survey also found that 29% of foreign-born [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] and 32% of [[African American|African-Americans]] hold strong antisemitic beliefs, three times more than the 10% for whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/poll_2007/Anti-Semitism%20Poll%202007.pdf|archivedate=10 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110184424/http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/poll_2007/Anti-Semitism%20Poll%202007.pdf|title= ADL Survey: American Attitudes Towards Jews in America|publisher=Anti Defamation League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study published in ''[[Boston Review]]'' found that nearly 25% of non-Jewish Americans blamed Jews for the [[financial crisis of 2008–2009]], with a higher percentage among Democrats than Republicans. 32% of Democrats blamed Jews for the financial crisis, versus 18% for Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Neil Malhotra and Yotam Margalit|url=http://bostonreview.net/BR34.3/malhotra_margalit.php|title= State of the Nation: Anti-Semitism and the economic crisis|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430102625/http://bostonreview.net/BR34.3/malhotra_margalit.php |archivedate=April 30, 2013 |publisher= Boston Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/blog/the-stash/blaming-jews-the-financial-crisis|title=Blaming Jews For The Financial Crisis|date=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the [[California state assembly]] approved a [[non-binding resolution]] that "encourages university leaders to combat a wide array of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel actions," although the resolution "is purely symbolic and does not carry policy implications".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/calif-resolution-denouncing-anti-semitism-on-college-campuses-targets-anti-israel-protests/2012/08/29/17a0188a-f1b2-11e1-b74c-84ed55e0300b_story.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901023521/http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/calif-resolution-denouncing-anti-semitism-on-college-campuses-targets-anti-israel-protests/2012/08/29/17a0188a-f1b2-11e1-b74c-84ed55e0300b_story.html|archivedate=1 September 2012|title=Calif. resolution denouncing anti-Semitism on college campuses targets anti-Israel protests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] brought charges against [[NCL America Inc.]], alleging that the company discriminated against seven crew members with Middle East backgrounds. The suit, filed on behalf of the employees, stated that the discrimination led to the plaintiffs losing their jobs aboard the cruise ship ''Pride of Aloha''. The 2006 lawsuit had the company deny the allegations, refusing to accept that it had acted improperly in firing the seven Middle Eastern crew members. Sources stated that the two sides reached a settlement agreement, in which [[NCL America Inc.]] has agreed to pay $485,000 to resolve allegations. Additionally, the company also agreed to revise its policies to ensure a workplace that promotes equal employment opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/settlements/11837/ncl-america-middle-eastern-discrimination.html |title=Cruise lines to pay $485,000 settlement in employment lawsuit |publisher=Lawyersandsettlements.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with a conservative website, [[Saucedo Mercer]], a Mexican immigrant who became a U.S. citizen, talked in depth about her views on [[immigration]]. She stated the issue was important because people from places other than Mexico were among those coming across the border illegally.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"That includes Chinese, Middle Easterners. If you know Middle Easterners, a lot of them, they look [[Mexican people|Mexican]] or they look, you know, like a lot of people in South America, [[dark skin]], dark hair, [[brown eyes]]. And they mix. They mix in. And those people, their only goal in life is to, to cause harm to the United States. So why do we want them here, either [[legally]] or illegally?

Attacks in Spain, London, and Bali have increasingly associated people of "Middle Eastern appearance" with terrorism.&lt;ref name = "epress"&gt;[http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/research/bitstream/handle/10453/8089/2009001804.pdf?sequence=1 ]{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clearer picture of the impact of these events on Sydney's Muslim, Arabic, and Middle Eastern population emerged from data collected from a hotline between September 12, 2001 and November 11, 2001 by the Community Relations Commission for a Multicultural NSW, during which time 248 incidents were logged. There were seven categories of attack: physical assault; verbal assault; sexual assault; threat; racial discrimination or harassment, damage to property; and media attack. Half of all victims were female; seven out of ten were adults. The largest language groups to use the hotline were Arabic, consisting 52.4% of calls. 47.2% of the incidents occurred in public spaces.&lt;ref name="epress" /&gt;

On 11 December 2005, a violent mob of about five thousand young white Australians gathered on the beach at Cronulla, [[New South Wales]]. Waving Australian flags, singing [[Waltzing Matilda]] and Australia's national anthem, the mob verbally abused and physically assaulted anyone of Middle Eastern appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/article/261/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917011835/http://www.turkishweekly.net/article/261 |archivedate=September 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five thousand people reportedly gathered at the site and marched through the streets of [[Cronulla]], attacking anyone who they identified as Middle Eastern.&lt;ref name="sgo.sagepub.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jayde Cahir1 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/3/2/2158244013484733.full |title=Balancing Trust and Anxiety in a Culture of Fear |publisher=Sgo.sagepub.com |date=2013-04-14 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One victim recalled how the violence erupted when a man deemed to be "of Middle Eastern appearance" was walking along the beachfront with his girlfriend and "two girls turned around and screamed ... 'get off our f__king beaches' [and then] the whole street turned on them"&lt;ref name="sgo.sagepub.com"/&gt; The riots put the spotlight on two segments of Sydney's population (the white, Anglo-Celtic majority and a Middle Eastern minority) and two parts of the city: the Sutherland Shire Local Government Area (LGA), located in Sydney's southern suburbs where [[Cronulla Beach]]is located (known as the Shire); and the Canterbury and Bankstown LGAs, located in south-western Sydney, where most of the city's Lebanese and Middle Eastern immigrants live.&lt;ref name="epress" /&gt; Middle Eastern males were tagged as criminal and un-Australian by the media brush of ethnic crime.&lt;ref name="epress" /&gt;

In another incident, two [[Bangladeshis|Bangladeshi]] students were apparently suspected of being [[Muslim]]s and chased up the street by a violent mob. They managed to escape in their car, though it was attacked and pelted with bottles. In another incident, two young men of Middle Eastern appearance, on their way for a swim, were mobbed and beaten on a train carriage, with both responding police officers and a nearby press photographer  fearing there would be a killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crsi.mq.edu.au/public/download.jsp?id%3D10589 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423212859/http://www.crsi.mq.edu.au/public/download.jsp?id=10589 |archivedate=April 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest incident occurred in 2011, when criminal lawyer of Middle Eastern background, Adam Houda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tineka Everaardt |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/today-tonight/lifestyle/article/-/16406193/targeted-through-racial-profiling/ |title=Targeted through racial profiling - Today Tonight |publisher=Au.news.yahoo.com |date=2013-03-20 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was arrested for refusing a frisk search and resisting arrest after having been approached by police, who suspected him of involvement in a recent robbery. These charges were thrown out of court by Judge John Connell, who stated, "At the end of the day, here were three men of Middle Eastern [[Human physical appearance|appearance]] walking along a suburban street, for all the police knew, minding their own business at an unexceptional time of day, in unexceptional clothing, except two of the men had hooded jumpers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mercer |first=Neil |url=http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/939697/suing-police-again-the-lawyer-of-middle-eastern-appearance/ |title=Suing police again, the lawyer of Middle Eastern appearance |publisher=The Border Mail |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The place they were in could not have raised a reasonable suspicion they were involved in the robberies."
