[[File:Photo of Madison Grant.jpg|thumb|Madison Grant]]

In 1916, the American [[eugenics|eugenicist]] and lawyer [[Madison Grant]] wrote a book entitled ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' which, while largely ignored when it first appeared, went through four editions, becoming part of popular culture in 1920s America and, in the process, spawned the ideology that the founding-stock of the United States, the so-called [[Nordic race]], were under extinction threats from assimilation with non-whites. Grant wrote of it:

{{quote|Neither the black, nor the brown, nor the yellow, nor the red will conquer the white in battle. But if the valuable elements in the Nordic race mix with inferior strains or die out through race suicide, then the citadel of civilization will fall for mere lack of defenders.&lt;ref name="VoxIdeology" /&gt;}}

The ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' described Grant's assertion that the race which "built" America was in danger of extinction unless the US reined in immigration of [[Jews]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-fellow-examines-rise-and-roots-of-white-supremacy/ |title=Probing the roots and rise of white supremacy |date=18 March 2019 |work=[[Harvard Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[F.

Starting with French author [[Renaud Camus]] and his 2012 book ''Le Grand Remplacement''; the conspiracy theory of a [[Great Replacement]] occurring, first in France, which focused on a displacement of French Catholics by predominantly Muslims, then becoming a pan-European concept which spread across most major European countries' politics on the continent. This also drew from the European [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]] strain of [[Bat Ye'or]]'s 2002 [[Eurabia]] conspiracy theory,&lt;ref name="Spinoff - eurabia" /&gt; and that was also was expressed by [[Anders Behring Breivik]], perpetrator of the [[22 July attacks]] in Norway, in his ''2083: A European Declaration of Independence'' manifesto, which was widely compared with the "white genocide" myth.&lt;ref name="BI - eurabia" /&gt; By 2018, the concept of a large population replacement of white people, and the term Great Replacement itself, was being compared increasingly with the white genocide conspiracy theory and presented as simply a localized version of the same ideology.&lt;ref name="Day trope" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Overland" /&gt; After the 2019 [[Christchurch mosque shootings]], where the shooter named his manifesto ''The Great Replacement'', the French-originated phrase is widely established as synonymous with "white genocide", used by mainstream Western media interchangeably, and is largely responsible for the emerging term of "white replacement".&lt;ref name="ABC - white replacement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GQ - white replacement" /&gt;

By 2017, at the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], white nationalists were referencing the conspiracy theory as tiki torch-wielding protestors, who yelled "You will not replace us!" and "Jews will not replace us!".

Former diplomat and scholar [[Alfredo Toro Hardy]], who credits journalist [[Charles M. Blow]] with the term "white extinction anxiety", has outlined how "the anxieties related to the changing racial landscape of the United States" were at the heart of the concept, and propelled policies such as the Trump administration's "[[Trump administration family separation policy|extreme measures]] against Southern immigrants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hardy |first1=Alfredo Toro |date=2019 |title=The Crossroads of Globalization: A Latin American View |page=105 |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |isbn=978-9813277304 |authorlink=Alfredo Toro Hardy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Trump has been accused of capitalizing on "white genocide anxiety" with claims that immigration had "changed the fabric of Europe", and empowering his supporters in media, such as [[Laura Ingraham]], to stoke fears of "massive demographic changes" within the US&lt;ref name="NYR Books" /&gt; Science journalist [[Ronald Bailey]] proposes that Trump is merely "the latest [[demagogue]] to rise to power by stoking white folks' ethnic fears", and that "white extinction panics" have historically occurred in the US each time the foreign-born population reached above 13 percent.&lt;ref name="White Extinction Panic" /&gt;

Blow has defined "white extinction anxiety" as the fear that white people will become a minority, stripped of their race-based privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/4957560/white-extinction-anxiety-twitter/|title='White Extinction Anxiety' Trends On Twitter: Do White People Really Fear Dying Off? 'NYT' Columnist Explains |publisher=[[Inquisitr]]|date=25 June 2018|quote=In Blow’s analysis, the heavy white support for Trump is due to "white extinction anxiety," the fear expressed by Buchanan that non-white people will soon become the majority in the United States, causing whites to lose their privileged status based on their skin color.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyzing the concept, he examined [[Pat Buchanan]]'s rhetoric (described by Bailey as a form of [[blood and soil]] mantra);&lt;ref name="White Extinction Panic" /&gt; of whether the nations of Europe and North America had the "will and capacity to halt the invasion of the countries" before immigration altered the "political, social, racial, ethnic - character of the country entirely." Addressing Buchanan's arguably [[ethnic nationalist]] conclusions that "You cannot stop these sentiments of people who want to live together with their own and they want their borders protected", Blow said, "Make no mistake here, Buchanan is talking about protecting white dominance, white culture, white majorities and [[white power]]".&lt;ref name="white anxiety" /&gt;

Anti-racism activist [[Jane Elliott]] has suggested that this anxiety, or "Fear of White Genetic Annihilation", is so great that political leaders will resort to any measures in order to prevent the white extinction event that they believe is unfolding, including measures such as the [[Alabama abortion ban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yesmagazine.org/peace-justice/abortion-ban-fear-white-extinction-babies-20190703|title=Race Against Time: How White Fear of Genetic Annihilation Fuels Abortion Bans |publisher=[[Yes!

According to professor [[Alexandra Minna Stern]], who has detailed the connection between the conspiracy theory and the anxiety-framed concept, factions of the [[alt-right]] are distorting fertility statistics into a "conspiratorial campaign of white extinction" which is being fueled by a looming "white extinction anxiety". This phenomenon is driving alt-right strategies such as encouraging couples of [[Western European|Western]] and [[Northern European]] ethnicity to have up to eight children.&lt;ref name="Warping"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Stern |first1=Alexandra Minna |date=2019 |title=Proud Boys and the White Ethnostate: How the Alt-Right Is Warping the American Imagination |page=99 |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |isbn=978-0807063361 |authorlink=Alexandra Minna Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fox News era ===

{{see also|#Subsequent events}}

The American news channel [[Fox News]] is increasingly described by multiple mainstream media sources as aligned with the concept and narrative of the white genocide conspiracy theory and using its prominence to bring rhetoric of demographic threats to white Americans further into the center of US discourse. For example, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' has stated that the news channel's default ideology is "strikingly similar" to "[[fascistic]] replacement theory" and "white genocide". They report that this is especially the case for their prime-time commentators, such as [[Tucker Carlson]] and [[Laura Ingraham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2019/04/29/fox-news-and-the-synagogue-shooter-right-wing-network-airs-similar-views-every-day/ |title=Fox News and the synagogue shooter: Right-wing network airs similar views every day |date=29 April 2019 |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|quote=fascistic "replacement" theory, which holds that white people are entitled to cultural dominance and that racial diversity and immigration are equivalent to a "white genocide" ...

Sadly, this toxic notion is not limited to the dregs of the internet, where it appears Earnest was radicalized. These days, anyone who flips on Fox News, especially if they watch prime-time commentators like Tucker Carlson or Laura Ingraham, will hear strikingly similar ideas.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine has argued that "far-right" [[Great Replacement]] rhetoric is not only a nightly fixture of ''[[Tucker Carlson Tonight]]'', but a "foundational" principle of Rupert Murdoch's media empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/03/tucker-carlson-is-who-we-thought-he-was.html|title=The Audio Doesn't Lie: Tucker Carlson Is Who We Thought He Was |website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=15 March 2019|quote=Fantasizing about this far-right “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory has been practically a nightly fixture of Carlson's program since its inception, it's a foundational part of right wing media from the Rupert Murdoch empire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[GQ]]'' has reported that Fox News' "popular primetime" shows are an important pipeline to President [[Donald Trump]]'s political positions, such as the investigation into land reform in South Africa, and that Carlson's show in particular dedicates segments to "'great replacement' propaganda".&lt;ref name="GQ - white replacement" /&gt; The warnings delivered by "conservative pundits on Fox News" are driving fears of an "existential threat" of a white genocide, according to ''[[The Atlantic]]'', who particularly analyzed Laura Ingraham's nativist remarks, such as "massive demographic changes" apparently being inflicted upon [[white Americans]] against their will.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic" /&gt; While the ''[[New York Times]]'' have identified Carlson as engaging in replacement theory fear-mongering, in relation to family birthrates in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Replacement Theory,' a Racist, Sexist Doctrine, Spreads in Far-Right Circles |website=[[New York Times]] |date=30 April 2019 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/technology/replacement-theory.html |quote=Though these fears fester in online message boards, it is spreading to more mainstream right-wing conversations.

Much of the white genocide claims in South Africa rest on a misrepresentation of the Afrikaner people as conforming to the popular ''[[Boer]]'' stereotype as hard-working, devoutly Calvinist, gun-loving farmers. In 1989, the British journalist Patrick Brogan noted that the Afrikaners once called themselves ''Boers'' ({{Lit|farmers}}) because that was what they were, but the term ''Boer'' fell out of use in the 20th century as most of the Afrikaners moved to urban areas, making the term ''Boer'' highly [[anachronistic]].&lt;ref name="Brogan, Patrick p.87"&gt;Brogan, Patrick ''The Fighting Never Stopped'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Brogan concluded the popular ''Boer'' stereotype does not accurately describe the majority of the Afrikaners, whose way of life is very similar to that of middle-class people in other Western nations.&lt;ref name="Brogan, Patrick p.87"/&gt;

[[File:William F. Buckley, Jr. 1985.jpg|thumb|right|William F. Buckley, Jr. at the second inauguration of US President [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1985]]

Even mainstream American conservatives who often championed the causes of [[Rhodesia]] and [[apartheid South Africa]], seeing both regimes as having supposedly more enlightened policies towards black people than the policy of [[Desegregation in the United States|integration in the United States]], embraced the variants of the white genocide theory as part of the defense of Rhodesia and South Africa.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; In 2015, the Canadian journalist [[Jeet Heer]] wrote: "The idea that whites in America have a natural affinity with white colonialists in Africa did not spring from the neo-Nazi far-right, but rather the conservative movement that coalesced around ''[[National Review]]'' in the 1950s."&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/122140/dylann-roofs-defense-apartheid-africa-has-roots-us-conservatism|last=Heer|first=Jeet||title=Dylann Roof's Defense of White Rule in Africa Has Roots in American Conservatism|date=24 June 2015|work=The New Republic|access-date=2018-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, the American journalist [[William F. Buckley]] wrote in ''National Review'' in defense of white supremacy around the world: "The question, as far as the White community is concerned, is whether the claims of civilization supersede those of [[universal suffrage]]. The British believe they do, and acted accordingly, in Kenya, where the choice was dramatically one between civilization and barbarism, and elsewhere; the South, where the conflict is by no means dramatic, as in Kenya, nevertheless perceives important qualitative differences between its culture and the Negroes', and intends to assert its own."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The "choice" that Britain faced "between civilization and barbarism" in Kenya that Buckley was referring to was the [[Kenya Emergency]] where the [[Kikuyu people]] and Freedom Army, better known as the Mau Mau, fought for independence in the [[Mau Mau Uprising]], and in the process the [[British Armed Forces]] killed approximately 10,000-20,000 Kikuyu to put down the rebellion. The Mau Mau were depicted in the 1950s as savages who killed white British settlers, which justified British atrocities against the Kikuyu, and by linking the [[American civil rights movement]] with the Mau Mau, Buckley was suggesting that civil rights for African-Americans would lead to atrocities against white Americans.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Heer wrote that Buckley's equation of whiteness with "civilization" and blackness with "barbarism" led him to support racist regimes in both South Africa and Rhodesia, to paint the possibility of majority rule in both places in the darkest of colors, and his writings on the subject from the 1950s to the 1990s show a strong emotional identification with the whites of Rhodesia and South Africa.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Buckley and other American conservatives consistently portrayed apartheid era South Africa in a favorable light, and warned that majority rule would cause a disaster for whites.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://prospect.org/article/apologists-without-remorse|last=Heilbrunn|first=Jacob||title=Apologists Without Remorse|date=January–February 1998|work=The American Prospect |access-date=2018-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 April 1960 in the aftermath of the [[Sharpeville massacre]] of March 1960, ''National Review'' ran an editorial stating "the whites are entitled, we believe, to pre-eminence in South Africa."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; [[Russell Kirk]] in a column in ''National Review'' on 9 March 1965 warned that letting African-Americans vote in the US "will work mischief—much injuring, rather than fulfilling, the responsible democracy for which [[Tocqueville]] hoped," but in the case of South Africa "this degradation of the democratic dogma, if applied, would bring anarchy and the collapse of civilization."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Kirk stated apartheid was just because South African whites were [[Racial superiority|racially superior]] and "Bantu political domination would be domination by witch doctors (still numerous and powerful) and reckless demagogues."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; On 13 April 1979, Buckley in a column gave an account of South African history very sympathetic to [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner nationalists]], suggesting that their concerns about black rule were rational and "their fears are understandable."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; In an editorial on 14 March 1986, ''National Review'' asked "To what extent, is the vast majority of South African blacks intellectually and practically prepared to assume the social, economic, and political leadership in a highly industrialized country?"&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; In the July 1988 edition of ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', David Roberts, Jr compared [[Nelson Mandela]] to [[Pol Pot]] and the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), the now ruling party in South Africa, to the [[Khmer Rouge]], implying that the ANC would exterminate South African whites if it came to power.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Shortly before his death in 2005 [[Samuel T. Francis]], the former editor of the conservative ''[[Washington Times]]'', warned about the possibility of a "white genocide" in South Africa.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;

Simon Roche, an Afrikaner nationalist from South Africa and a spokesman for the survivalist group, the [[Suidlanders]], that exists in his words "to prepare a Protestant Christian South African Minority for a coming violent revolution," visited the US in 2017 to promote the thesis that the white minority in South Africa is faced with the threat of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref name="far-right idea" /&gt; Roche stated he went to the US to "raise awareness of and support for the Caucasian Christian conservative ''volk'' [people] of South Africa ...

In September 2016, [[:fr:François Lafargue|François Lafargue]], a senior lecturer at the [[Paris School of Business]], claimed that the [[Boer]] white minority of South Africa (referring to them as "Europeans") will experience "the same fate as the [[French Algeria|French of Algeria]] or the British of Southern Rhodesia". Invoking the themes of both [[white Rhodesians]] and the [[French-Algerian colonist]] population; Lafargue stated that around 400,000 [[white South Africans]] lived in poverty, "grouped together in makeshift encampments to better protect themselves", and that thousands had been violently murdered since 2000, claiming that the country's apparently increased "crime fuels the fear of a white genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.francetvinfo.fr/monde/afrique/afrique-du-sud/tensions-raciales-en-afrique-du-sud-lannee-2016-bat-tous-les-records_3062659.html|title=Tensions raciales en Afrique du Sud : l'année 2016 bat tous les records |language=french|trans-title=Racial tensions in South Africa: 2016 beats all records|publisher=[[France Info (TV channel)]]|date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; White genocide was used as a [[slogan]] by anti-immigrant/refugee protesters in [[Calais]] during the [[European migrant crisis]].

The [[2015–16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany|2015 New Year's Eve attacks]] in Cologne resulted in accusations that the federal government and media were deliberately avoiding public interest reporting on 1,200 [[sexual assault]]s by thousands of young male Muslim immigrants. Apologies for hesitancy by public television channel [[ZDF]] strengthened claims of a ''Lügenpresse'' (lying press) by populist and far-right parties as evidence for widespread conspiracy by German institutions. The unprecedented scale of border crossings during 2015 and 2016 compelled Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] to impose "temporary restrictions" on transit across the border with Austria. The alt-right conspiracy website [[Zero Hedge]] listed statistics on migrant crime in Germany alongside  statements from politicians and news articles, presented as "contradictions confirming a deep-state level of conspiracy ... to push through a pro-immigration policy in Germany". During the 2017 German election campaign, the far-right [[Alternative for Germany]] party ran advertisements featuring a pregnant woman's abdomen with the slogan, "New Germans?

A state-sponsored campaign led by President [[Viktor Orbán]] has employed a wide range of historical anti-Semitic tropes to accuse philanthropist [[George Soros]] of engaging in conspiracies to support and deceive the public about nonwhite immigrants. Orbán has accused Soros, a Jew whose family survived hostile conditions during Hungary's Nazi occupation, of being a Nazi himself, and has introduced legislation known as the "Stop Soros law" to criminalize organized support of immigrants.

==== Poland ====

Hundreds of Polish [[Facebook]] groups such as "Stop White Genocide" have produced and disseminated  images depicting African and Middle eastern people as belonging to separate "primitive" species, lacking the human intelligence of white Europeans. Websites such as "Conspiracy Files" have fabricated allegations of political compacts to bolster nonwhite immigration against popular will, such as agreements signed by EU leaders and African nations to increase Europe's African population to 300 million by 2068, making native whites, "minorities within their own homeland".&lt;ref name="GastonS" /&gt;

==== Russia ====

Much of the theory that South African whites are faced with the threat of "genocide" originates with internet rumors started by the [[Government of Russia]]. [[Russia-24]], a television channel owned by the Russian government, aired a segment in the summer of 2018 about Afrikaner farmers wanting to immigrate to Russia as "brothers in faith". The present government in Russia led by Vladimir Putin often attacks the ideology of liberalism for putting the individual before the collective, and promotes "white genocide" stories both as a way of showing the failure of liberalism and to promote the thesis that group identities matter far more than individual identities. The ideology of the Russian state is that the interests of the collective take precedence over the individual, and evidence of alleged failures of liberalism abroad are extensively covered by the Russian media.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt; The Australian historian Mark Edele stated: "There is definitely an attempt [by Russia] to support alt-right views and extreme right organisations outside of Russia ... Russia supports groups that will undermine liberal views. That's the logic of sponsorship of alt-right groups by Russia ... There is a longstanding anxiety among Russia's nationalists that Russians are dying out because of falling birth rates compared to non-Slavic peoples. It reverberates with white genocide fears."

The Canadian alt-right personality [[Lauren Southern]] had a sympathetic interview with the Russian Eurasianist thinker [[Aleksandr Dugin]], who told her "liberalism denies the existence of any collective identities" and that "liberalism is based on the absence of any form of collective identity". Dugin used the case of white South African farmers allegedly threatened with genocide as proof of the failure of liberalism, for putting the individual ahead of the collective. After the end of apartheid in 1994, South Africa was presented as the "rainbow nation" where henceforward people, regardless of their skin color, would be judged only as individuals. From the viewpoint of the Russian state, presenting liberalism in South Africa as a blood{{nbh}}soaked disaster is a way of discrediting liberalism in general.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

According to ''[[Vice Media|Vice]]'', he pushed the narrative of "white genocide", after publishing an article in ''[[The Spectator]]'' which suggested that the apparent genocide that [[Lauren Southern]] had exposed in her documentary in South Africa would have been rewarded with professional acclaim had it been "any other brand of genocide".&lt;ref name="preppers" /&gt;

In October 2014, white nationalist [[Greg Johnson (white nationalist)|Greg Johnson]] promoted the white extinction conspiracy theory, suggesting that "the organized Jewish community" were responsible for "every attempt to halt and reverse white extinction". Johnson concluded, "One cannot defeat an enemy one will not name.

In December 2014, [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader [[Thomas Robb (activist)|Thomas Robb]] proposed in an interview with [[Al Jazeera]] that a white genocide was occurring due to the immigration and high birth-rates of non-whites.

While Donald Trump supporters on the [[Reddit]] discussion forum [[/r/The Donald]] generally agree that white genocide is occurring, they disagree about the responsible parties. "Tea Party conservatives characterize it as a scheme by Democrats to gain voters. For the white nationalists, the main villain is 'international Jewry.' Infowars fans blame 'globalists'—a label that is often interchangeable with 'Jews'—seeking to dumb down Western populations with 'low-IQ migrants' who are more easily controlled." In August 2017, at least 330 /r/The_Donald posts referred to the "[[Kalergi plan]]," a purported conspiracy to replace the European population with African migrants.&lt;ref name="Day trope" /&gt;

=====Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville=====

[[File:Jason Kessler (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Jason Kessler {{circa}} 2017]]

In August 2017, a white supremacist protest named the [[Unite the Right rally]] was held in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], largely driven by the ideology of the "white genocide" narrative. The protest was ostensibly centered around the impending removal of a [[Robert Edward Lee (sculpture)|statue of Robert E. Lee]], who was the commander of the  [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The night before the rally, leaflets were distributed en masse in the city, bearing the recurrent slogan "Diversity is a code word for white genocide".&lt;ref name="guardian-utr"&gt;{{cite news|title='Increasingly Nazified' white nationalist rally descends on Virginia amid expected protests  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/12/nazi-white-nationalist-rallies-virginia-protests |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Trump administration foreign policy on South Africa=====

In the fall of 2017, it was reported how renowned conspiracy theorist [[Alex Jones]] and his fake news media organization ''InfoWars'' had began promoting the white genocide myth, after they invited the [[Suidlanders]] (a [[völkisch]] group crucial to the spread of the conspiracy theory in South Africa) onto their platform on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name="M&amp;G" /&gt; Around the same period, Jones also claimed white genocide was a serious threat in the US; on a cultural front, with what he claimed were black NFL players advocating for "white genocide" by [[U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)|refusing to stand]] for the national anthem, and the apparent physical threat of Democrats and communists plotting genocidal attacks specifically against [[white Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Laura Ingraham loses sponsor over defense of white supremacist |url=https://thinkprogress.org/laura-ingraham-loses-sponsor-over-defense-of-white-supremacist-1dc92e0b01f5/ |work=[[ThinkProgress]] |date=1 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump had apparently gotten his information from [[Tucker Carlson]], a conservative political commentator for [[Fox News]], who has been described as playing a key role in bringing the conspiracy theory of an ongoing "white genocide" in South Africa into the mainstream after a piece about the topic on his show caught the attention of president.&lt;ref name="SalonCarlson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carson Rebuttal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="far-right idea" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/08/24/president-trump-is-pushing-white-nationalist-ideas-into-mainstream/|title=Perspective: President Trump is pushing white nationalist ideas into the mainstream|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-farmers-south-africa-conspiracy-theory_us_5b7f2d38e4b0729515115d9d|title=Trump Boosted A White Nationalist Conspiracy Theory He Saw On Fox News|last=Schulberg|first=Jessica|date=August 23, 2018|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'' described him as having "taken up the cause" of the "virulent, racist conspiracy theory" of white genocide.&lt;ref name="Vox explained" /&gt; Amanda Marcotte in ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' has said that while Carlson avoids using the specific phrase "white genocide," but that "its basic premise is embedded throughout his show."&lt;ref name="SalonCarlson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcotte|first=Amanda|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/08/15/tucker-carlson-claims-theres-no-white-nationalism-his-shows-obsessive-racism-suggests-otherwise/ |title=Tucker Carlson claims there's no white nationalism.

===== Reaction to US-South Africa policy =====
In August 2018, many politicians and public figures responded critically to US President [[Donald Trump]]'s foreign policy initiative to investigate the seizure of land from white farmers and apparent evoking of the conspiracy theory. These included multiple members of the [[22nd South African Parliament|South African Parliament]] and RSA [[Deputy President of South Africa|Deputy President]] [[David Mabuza]], who rejected the conspiracy theory, calling it "far from the truth." He stated that "we would like to discourage those who are using this sensitive and emotive issue of land to divide us as South Africans by distorting our [[Land reform in South Africa|land reform measures]] to the international community and spreading falsehoods that our '[[White South Africans#Post-apartheid era|white farmers]]' are facing the onslaught from their own government."&lt;ref name="WP1"/&gt;

[[Julius Malema]] MP reacted, saying "there is no white genocide in South Africa",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Trump's land seizures tweet draws angry reaction in South Africa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/23/trump-orders-close-study-of-south-africa-farmer-killings |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Trump's intervention into their ongoing [[Land reform in South Africa|land reform issues]] "only made them more determined&amp;nbsp;... to expropriate our land without compensation",&lt;ref name="bbc malema"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45282088 |title=South Africa rejects Donald Trump's tweet on farmer killings |date=23 August 2018 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP1" /&gt; and that there is a [[black genocide]] in the US&lt;ref name="bbc malema" /&gt; [[Jeremy Cronin]] MP stated that the South African government needed to "send a signal to the courts‚ to Trump‚ to [[Fox News]] Agency" over the issue. The deputy [[Minister of Public Works (South Africa)|Minister of Public Works]] spoke against the conspiracy theory; in a committee meeting in the [[South African parliament]], he indicated that land expropriation without compensation should not be viewed as a white genocide.&lt;ref name="TimesLive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2018-08-28-expropriation-bill-to-be-redrafted-to-accommodate-expropriation-without-compensation/ |title=Expropriation Bill to be redrafted to accommodate expropriation without compensation |date=28 August 2018 |publisher=[[The Times (South Africa)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, [[Lindiwe Sisulu]], claimed that his foreign policy tweet was "regrettable" and "based on false information",&lt;ref name="False claims" /&gt; and that the conspiracy theory in general was "a [[right-wing]] ideology, and it is very unfortunate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/27/africa/south-africa-trump-tweet-land-reform-intl/index.html |title=South Africa's top diplomat slams Trump tweet as 'right-wing ideology' |date=27 August 2018 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, former [[United States Ambassador to South Africa|US Ambassador]] to South Africa [[Patrick Gaspard]], and American media personalities [[Chris Cuomo]], [[Mika Brzezinski]] and [[Al Sharpton]] spoke out against the US President on the issue. Labelling Trump's actions as "dangerous and poisoned",&lt;ref name="WP1" /&gt; Gaspard opposed the concept, claiming the conspiracy theory was "trafficking in a [[white supremacist]] story line,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/politics/trump-south-africa-land.html |title=Trump's South Africa Tweet Seems to Embrace Racist Narrative on Land Dispute |date=23 August 2018 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the concept is a "white-supremacist [[Alt-right#Use of memes|meme]] from the darkest place."&lt;ref name="WP1" /&gt;

Cuomo, a television journalist, while stating that "like all conspiracy tripe, there's a kernel of truth" to the theory (in relation to [[land reform in South Africa]]) but concluded that the concept was a "bogus cause that [[white nationalists]] are selling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/08/24/trump-south-africa-scrutiny-cuomo-cpt-sot-vp.cnn|title=Cuomo offers Trump tips to avoid scrutiny |date=24 August 2018|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BI"/&gt; He rejected what he said was Donald Trump, and his administration, claiming "white farmers" were "being hunted down and killed and having their land stolen".&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/kellyanne-conway-and-chris-cuomo-interview-cnn-2018-8 |title=Kellyanne Conway and Chris Cuomo squeezed a week's worth of news into one wild 30-minute debate on CNN |date=24 August 2018 |work=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a substantive response, American anti-racism activist, [[Tim Wise]], critically analyzed the conspiracy theory further; stating that it was a form of [[negrophobia]], being directed politically to "scare [[white Americans]]" about non-whites within the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/relationships/tim-wise-trump-tweet-about-south-africa-directed-at-white-americans/vi-BBMqGEZ |title=Tim Wise: Trump tweet about South Africa directed at white Americans |date=25 August 2018 |publisher=[[MSN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wise has proposed that the paranoia around the conspiracy theory dates back to the [[Haitian Revolution]] and North American [[Slave rebellion#North America|slave rebellions]], but that changing demographics of the United States have heightened existing anxiety, stating that "the reason it is amplified today is that in the recent past the cultural norm of the country was still dominantly white."&lt;ref name="DeVegaC" /&gt;

American Neo-Nazi literature such as ''[[The Turner Diaries]]'' and Lane's ''White Genocide Manifesto'' have spread online to right wing groups in Australia. An influential collection of writings called ''Siege'' by [[James Mason (neo-Nazi)|James Mason]] was cited as an inspiration by some of the twenty-two neo-Nazis who infiltrated the New South Wales [[Young Nationals (Australia)|Young Nationals]] party from which they were banned for life for trying to advance the creation of an ethno-state.&lt;ref name="RossK"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Kaz |title=How believers in 'white genocide' spread their hate campaign in Australia |url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/how-believers-in-white-genocide-spread-their-hate-campaign-in-australia-119031600127_1.html |accessdate=19 March 2019 |work=Business Standard |date=March 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes of the "defense of Western civilization" and the achievements of ethnic Whites have become racist [[dog whistles]] for groups advancing theories of an impending white genocide.&lt;ref name="RossW" /&gt;

In March 2018, several Australian tabloids owned by the News Corporation ran articles alleging that South African whites were faced with genocide and which led the Australian home affairs minister [[Peter Dutton]] to promise fast-track visas for any South African white wishing to emigrate to Australia.&lt;ref name="far-right idea"/&gt; Dutton is known for his anti-immigrant and anti-refugee stance, which led to questions about his willingness to accept South African whites into Australia as refugees, since he normally opposes Australia accepting refugees.&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt; One News Corp columnist, [[Miranda Devine]], wrote about the ties as she saw them between the Australian people and "our oppressed white, Christian, industrious, rugby and cricket-playing Commonwealth cousins" threatened by South African blacks whom she promised would integrate "seamlessly" into Australia as opposed to immigration from Third World countries.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/peter-duttons-offer-to-white-south-african-farmers-started-on-the-far-righte|title=Peter Dutton's offer to white South African farmers started on the far right|last=Wilson|first=Jason|date=16 March 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Australian News Corporation columnist, Caroline Marcus, connected the alleged plight of South African whites to what she saw as a broader attack on whites across the world, writing "the truth is, there are versions of this anti-white, vengeance theme swirling in movements around the western world, from Black Lives Matter in the US to Invasion Day protests back home."&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; The British journalist Jason Wilson noted that the News Corporation run by the Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch also owns Fox News, which has aired stories portraying South African whites as a persecuted minority, leading him to accuse the News Corporation of promoting this narrative around the world.&lt;ref name="far-right idea"/&gt;

The purpose of the white genocide conspiracy theory is to scare white people in countries that are diversifying and justify a commitment to a white nationalist agenda,&lt;ref name="MarcotteA" /&gt; using evidence of a declining birth rate in support of their extremist views and calls to violence.&lt;ref name="BetuelE"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Betuel |first1=Emma |title=CDC Data on Declining US Fertility Rate Is Being Used by White Nationalists |date=January 13, 2019 |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/52409-cdc-fertility-report-race-breakdown-white-nationalism |website=Inverse |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; White supremacists are successfully constructing false narratives of genocide to incite violence at an increasing rate.&lt;ref name="PerryB"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perry |first1=Barbara |editor1-last=Ferber |editor1-first=Abby L. |title=Home-grown hate: gender and organized racism |date=November 2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415944155 |chapter-url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781135946005/chapters/10.4324/9780203644058-9 |chapter='White Genocide': White Supremacists and the Politics of Reproduction |pages=75–95|doi=10.4324/9780203644058-9 |doi-broken-date=2019-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Literature propounding the white genocide conspiracy theory has incited violence; ''[[The Turner Diaries]],'' for instance, is responsible for inciting many violent crimes, including those of [[Timothy McVeigh]].{{r|Darby Telegraph}}&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berger |first1=J.M. |title=The Turner Legacy: The Storied Origins and Enduring Impact of White Nationalism's Deadly Bible |journal=Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism Studies |date=September 2016 |doi=10.19165/2016.1.11 |url=https://icct.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ICCT-Berger-The-Turner-Legacy-September2016-2.pdf |accessdate=19 March 2019 |series=ICCT Research Paper Series |publisher=International Centre for Counter-Terrorism |issn=2468-0656 |page= 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MarcotteA" /&gt; The US Republican Party as led by Donald Trump has repeatedly and openly courted white supremacists and endorsed the falsehoods they promote, including those of white genocide.&lt;ref name="TaylorK"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Keeanga-Yamahtta |title=The White Power Presidency: Race and Class in the Trump Era |journal=New Political Science |date=16 February 2018 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=103–112 |doi=10.1080/07393148.2018.1420555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, [[Sanjiv Bhattacharya]] analyzed the belief in the conspiracy theory amongst the [[alt-right]]. While considering the prospect that non-Hispanic whites will be less than 50% of the US population by 2044; Bhattacharya, a British journalist, pointed out the racist hypocrisy in the statement "Diversity equals white genocide", discussing how the "alt right loves to evoke genocide while harbouring [[Holocaust deniers]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Call me a racist, but don't say I'm a Buddhist': meet America's alt right |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/09/call-me-a-racist-but-dont-say-im-a-buddhist-meet-the-alt-right |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |author=Bhattacharya, Sanjiv|authorlink=Sanjiv Bhattacharya|date=October 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the Christmas period of 2016, [[George Ciccariello-Maher]], an American political scientist, satirically tweeted "All I Want for Christmas is White Genocide". As a result of the stunt, losing his job as an associate professor of [[politics]] and [[global studies]] at [[Drexel University]], Ciccariello-Maher continued to strongly oppose the conspiracy theory, claiming that it was "invented by white supremacists and used to denounce everything from [[inter-racial relationships]] to multicultural policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/history-professor-twitter-storm-white-genocide-death-threats-george-ciccariello-maher-a7497301.html |title='All I want for Christmas is white genocide': Professor receives death threats after mocking supremacists |date=27 December 2016 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has labelled the concept as a "figment of the racist imagination" and claimed that "it should be mocked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://time.com/4618146/drexel-professor-white-genocide-tweet/ |title=A Drexel Professor Tweeted That He Wants 'White Genocide' for Christmas |date=26 December 2016 |magazine=[[TIME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He stated that "unfortunately, in part because it's built upon a very real and dark truth in [[American history]]—which is that [[white supremacy]] has always been a big part of what this country is—white nationalists were able to start capitalizing on that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The White Nationalist Heir Who Rejected His Dad's Vile Bigotry |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yw4dkb/the-white-nationalist-heir-who-rejected-his-dads-vile-bigotry |publisher=[[Vice Media]] |date=September 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saslow has claimed the conspiracy theory is a way to "sanitize" [[white America]]'s history of racism and violence, by focusing on the "ways that white people are under attack in this country," including "white genocide" and "[[Executive Order 13767|building a wall]]."&lt;ref name="NEA" /&gt;

In January 2019, Democratic [[Philadelphia City Council]] member [[Kenyatta Johnson]] labelled the [[Ku Klux Klan]]'s distribution of "white genocide" promotional material in black neighborhoods of Philadelphia as an "upsetting and disgusting" act.&lt;ref name="KKK material" /&gt; In June 2019, Canadian author [[Naomi Klein]] addressed the narrative of "white genocide", criticizing the concept as an attack on women's reproductive freedom, in that it wished to deny [[abortion rights]] to white women having white children, while seeking to suppress non-white immigrant birthrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2019/06/02/news/naomi_klein_dig_festival_2019-227798940/|title=Naomi Klein: "Economia e ambiente, serve un'unica rivoluzione globale" |language=italian|trans-title=Naomi Klein: "Economy and environment, we need a single global revolution"|publisher=[[la Repubblica]]|date=June 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, critical theorist [[Bernard Harcourt]] detailed how the American [[New Right#United States|New Right]] was seeking to orient its political message around the fear of a white genocide occurring. He proposed that "neo-fascist, white supremacist, revolutionary language" was becoming mainstream and was in effect "starting to change the way people are willing to express themselves", including President Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump the storyteller: His gift for narrative is why he may win again |url=https://www.salon.com/2019/07/13/trump-the-storyteller-his-gift-for-narrative-is-why-he-may-win-again/ |work=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]|date=July 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2019, journalist [[Adam Serwer]] suggested that the conspiracy theory did not sincerely refer to "mass murder, ethnic cleansing, or even violence," but rather to a perceived "loss of political and [[cultural hegemony]] in countries that white supremacists think should belong to white people by law." Serwer proposed that the conspiracy was "a kind of projection, a paranoia that the past genocide, colonialism, and [[ethnic cleansing]] forced on the West's former subjects will be visited upon it."&lt;ref name="Serwer1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nazis Have Always Been Trolls |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/03/mosque-shooter-troll-like-original-nazis/585415/ |work=[[The Atlantic]] |author=Serwer, Adam|authorlink=Adam Serwer|date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Serwer2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Harvard fellow examines rise — and roots — of white supremacy |url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-fellow-examines-rise-and-roots-of-white-supremacy/ |accessdate=27 August 2019 |work=Harvard Gazette |date=18 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, [[Farhad Manjoo]] detailed how "white-extinction theory" was nonsense. Proposing that the "white genocide" label had "failed to take off", proving ineffective for conspiracy theorists attempting to push the narrative. Manjoo, an American journalist, suggested that the "[[Great Replacement]]" (which the Christchurch mosque shooter used for a manifesto title) was a softer reinvention, being to the white genocide conspiracy theory what the term [[Identitarian]] is to "white supremacist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The White-Extinction Conspiracy Theory Is Bonkers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/opinion/new-zealand-great-replacement.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |author=Manjoo, Farhad |authorlink=Farhad Manjoo|date=March 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2019, British academic [[Elif Shafak]] detailed how [[Renaud Camus]]' theory of the [[Great Replacement]] has created an ideological worldview for the far-right to amplify into a "white genocide" narrative in the West. Shafak argues that the conspiracy theory is also embedded in the works of [[Thilo Sarrazin]], such as ''[[Germany Abolishes Itself]]'' and 2018's ''[[Hostile Takeover: How Islam Impedes Progress and Threatens Society|Hostile Takeover]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To understand the far right, look to their bookshelves   |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/01/far-right-bookshelves-jordan-peterson-thilo-sarrazin |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |author=Shafak, Elif|authorlink=Elif Shafak|date=April 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, [[Jonathan Freedland]] and [[Mehdi Hasan]] released a joint analysis of far-right extremism and the ideology behind "white genocide". Discussing Pittsburgh synagogue shooter, [[Robert Gregory Bowers]], and his rhetoric; Freeland and Hasan, both political journalists, labelled the conspiracy theory as racist and unhinged and argued that it had both the Muslim and Jewish "communities in its murderous sights". They concluded that both groups should "stand and fight it together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslims and Jews face a common threat from white supremacists.

In May 2019, political commentator [[Nick Cohen]] analyzed how "white genocide" narratives created anti-immigrant and societal sexual tension. He argued that the conspiracy theory was an effective form of racism and propaganda, which had penetrated [[Viktor Orbán]]'s Hungarian government, but revealed a far-right paranoia that European men were not [[virile]] enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/18/when-the-far-right-crack-rape-jokes-part-of-a-systemic-bid-to-demean|title=When the far right crack rape jokes, it's part of a systemic bid to demean |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|author=Cohen, Nick|authorlink=Nick Cohen|date=18 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2019, professor of economics [[Jonathan Portes]], while describing the concept as a "lunatic" conspiracy theory, detailed how more respectable versions of "white genocide" were being promoted by academic and media figures, and therefore pushing the idea further into mainstream discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/30/tragedy-is-inevitable-if-we-fear-migration-rather-than-celebrate-its-benefits|title=Tragedy is inevitable if we fear migration rather than celebrate its benefits |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|author=Portes, Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Portes|date=30 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
