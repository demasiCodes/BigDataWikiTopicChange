The idea of a distinct white [[Race (human categorization)|human race]] began with German physician and anthropologist [[Johann Blumenbach]], who in 1775 claimed that there were five such races, [[Historical race concepts|Caucasian, Mongolian, Malayan, Ethiopian (or Negroid), and American Indian.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Walrath |first1=Dana |title=White genocide: A dangerous myth employed by racists |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/white-genocide-a-dangerous-myth-employed-by-racists-1.3981739 |date= 10 August 2019 |access-date=26 August 2019 |newspaper=The Irish Times |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background ===
====France====
The idea of a "replacement" of indigenous white people under the guidance of a hostile elite can be further traced back to pre-WWII [[Antisemitic canards|antisemitic conspiracy theories]] which posited the existence of a Jewish plot to destroy Europe through miscegenation, especially in [[Édouard Drumont]]'s [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] bestseller ''[[La France juive]]'' (1886).&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Weil and Nicolas Truong, ''Le sens de la République'' (Grasset, 2015). ISBN 978-2246858232.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on this resemblance, historian [[Nicolas Lebourg]] and political scientist [[Jean-Yves Camus]] suggest that [[Renaud Camus]]'s contribution in ''The Great Replacement'' (2011) was to replace the antisemitic elements with a [[Clash of Civilizations|clash of civilizations]] between Muslims and Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, ''Far-Right Politics in Europe'' (Harvard University Press, 2017). pp 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the late 19th century, imperialist politicians invoked the ''Péril jaune'' ([[Yellow Peril]]) in their negative comparisons of France's low birth-rate and the high birth-rates of Asian countries.  From that claim arose an artificial, cultural fear that immigrant-worker Asians soon would "flood" France. This danger supposedly could be successfully countered only by increased fecundity of French women. Then, France would possess enough soldiers to thwart the eventual flood of immigrants from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cook Anderson, ''Regeneration Through Empire: French Pronatalists and Colonial Settlement in the Third Republic'' (University of Nebraska Press, 2014) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice Barrès]]'s nationalist writings of that period have also been noted in the ideological genealogy of the "Great Replacement", Barrès contending both in 1889 and in 1900 that a replacement of the native population under the combined effect of immigration and a decline in the birth rate was happening in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Nouveau FN.

==== Eugenics ====
{{see also|Miscegenation#Genetic admixture}}

The conspiracy theory had precursors in early 20th-century [[eugenics]] theories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/03/15/when-the-president-inspires-violence/ |title=When the President Inspires Violence  |date=15 March 2019 |work=[[Washington Monthly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were popular in white-majority countries such as Australia and New Zealand, where it was feared that non-white immigrants would eventually supplant the white population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Paul |first1=Diane |last2=Stenhouse |first2=John |last3=Spencer |first3=Hamish |date=2018 |title=Eugenics at the Edges of Empire: New Zealand, Australia, Canada and South Africa |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-3-319-64685-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Madison Grant in the United States ====
[[File:Photo of Madison Grant.jpg|thumb|175px|Madison Grant]]

In 1916, the American [[eugenics|eugenicist]] and lawyer [[Madison Grant]] wrote a book entitled ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' which, while largely ignored when it first appeared, went through four editions, becoming part of popular culture in 1920s America and, in the process, spawned the ideology that the founding-stock of the United States, the so-called [[Nordic race]], were under extinction threats from assimilation with non-whites. Grant wrote of it:

{{blockquote|Neither the black, nor the brown, nor the yellow, nor the red will conquer the white in battle. But if the valuable elements in the Nordic race mix with inferior strains or die out through race suicide, then the citadel of civilization will fall for mere lack of defenders.&lt;ref name="VoxIdeology" /&gt;}}

Grant claimed that the race which "built" America was in danger of extinction unless the US reined in immigration of Jews and others.&lt;ref name="Serwer2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winston |first1=Andrew S. |title='Jews will not replace us!': Antisemitism, Interbreeding and Immigration in Historical Context |journal=American Jewish History |date=April 2021 |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |id={{Gale|A676309948}} {{Project MUSE|804146}} |doi=10.1353/ajh.2021.0001 |s2cid=239725899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Atlantic"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Serwer |first1=Adam |title=White Nationalism's Deep American Roots |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/adam-serwer-madison-grant-white-nationalism/583258/ |access-date=24 March 2019 |work=The Atlantic |date=April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nazi Germany ====
{{Main|Nazi eugenics}}

[[Adolf Hitler]] wrote to Grant to thank him for writing ''The Passing of the Great Race'', calling it "my Bible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kühl |first1=Stefan |title=Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incorporating Grant's theory, Nazis employed the conspiracy theory widely as propaganda, as exemplified in a 1934 pamphlet written for the "Research Department for the [[Jewish question]]" of [[Walter Frank]]'s "Reich Institute" with the title "Are the white people dying: the future of the white and the colored peoples in the light of biological statistics".&lt;ref name="DrFB"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burgdörfer |first1=Friedrich |title=Sterben die weissen Völker: die Zukunft der weissen und farbigen Völker im Lichte der biologischen Statistik |trans-title=The white peoples die: the future of the white and colored peoples in the light of biological statistics |language=de |date=1934 |publisher=G.D.W.

Prior to Nazis coming to power, German eugenicists, including Jewish medical and psychiatric professionals, did consider Jews to be distinct from white Europeans, but not so "degenerate" or unfit as to require anything more than guidance avoiding heritable disease via [[marriage counseling]] and, as early as 1918, screening for Jews wishing to emigrate to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Feldman |first1=Yotam |title=Eugenics in Israel: Did Jews Try to Improve the Human Race Too? |url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5052629 |work=Haaretz |date=14 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neo-Nazis' accusations against Jews ===

The modern conspiracy theory can be traced back to post-war European [[neo-Nazi]] circles, especially [[René Binet (neo-Fascist)|René Binet]]'s 1950 book ''Théorie du Racisme.&lt;ref name="Lebourg-2020"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lebourg|first=Nicolas|author-link=Nicolas Lebourg|date=2 November 2020|title=René Binet, the French Father of White Nationalism|url=https://www.illiberalism.org/rene-binet-the-french-father-of-white-nationalism|website=Illiberalism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CamusLebourg2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Yves Camus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_j5YDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206|title=Far-Right Politics in Europe|author2=Nicolas Lebourg|date=2017|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-97153-0|pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=François|first=Stéphane|date=6 September 2018|title=En Europe, une partie de l'extrême droite revient à l'action violente|language=fr|work=Le Monde|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2018/09/06/une-partie-de-l-extreme-droite-europeenne-revient-a-l-action-violente_5350854_3232.html|access-date=2 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter influenced French 1960s far-right movements such as ''[[Europe-Action]]'', which argued that "systematic race mixing [was] nothing more than a slow genocide".&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Fournier, "La guerre de demain est déjà déclenchée", ''Europe-Action'', nº 16, April 1964, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;ref name="Francois-2013"&gt;{{Cite web|last=François|first=Stéphane|author-link=Stéphane François|date=23 May 2013|title=Dominique Venner et le renouvellement du racisme|url=https://tempspresents.com/2013/05/23/dominique-venner-renouvellement-racisme-stephane-francois-nicolas-lebourg/|access-date=12 August 2019|website=Fragments sur les Temps Présents|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' In December 1948, Binet's newspaper ''L'Unité'' wrote: "We accuse the Zionists and anti-racists of the crime of genocide because they claim to be imposing on us a crossbreeding that would be the death and destruction of our race and civilization".&lt;ref name="Lebourg-2020" /&gt;

Shortly after Lane's ''Manifesto,'' the [[Aryan Nations]] published their 1996 ''Declaration of Independence'' stating that the Zionist Occupation Government sought "the eradication of the white race and its culture" as "one of its foremost purposes". It accused such Jews of subverting the constitutional rule of law; responsibility for post-Civil War [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]; subverting the monetary system with the [[Federal Reserve System]], confiscating land and property; limiting freedoms of speech, religion, and gun ownership; murdering, kidnapping and imprisoning patriots; abdicating national sovereignty to the [[United Nations]]; political repression; wasteful bureaucracy; loosening restrictions on immigration and drug trafficking; raising taxes; polluting the environment; commandeering the military, mercenaries, and police; denying Aryan cultural heritage; and inciting immigrant insurrections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Aryan Nations|date=12 March 1996|title=The Declaration of Independence|url=https://archive.org/details/AryanNationsDeclaration|access-date=18 August 2019|publisher=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aryan Nations/Church of Jesus Christ Christian|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/profiles/aryan-nations|access-date=20 August 2019|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verhovek|first1=Sam Howe|date=8 September 2000|title=Leaders of Aryan Nations Found Negligent in Attack|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/08/us/leaders-of-aryan-nations-found-negligent-in-attack.html|access-date=20 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steiger|first1=Brad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jQRlCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Conspiracies and Secret Societies: The Complete Dossier|last2=Steiger|first2=Sherry|date=2012|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=9781578593859|pages=34–35|language=en|access-date=20 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these accusations, only passage of the [[Federal Reserve Act]], ratification of the [[Charter of the United Nations]], and imprisonment of members of The Order were cited as specific instances.

In 1966, Rhodesian Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] was described as having convinced white Rhodesians that their only alternative to his government's [[Rhodesian Bush War]] was "dictatorship and white genocide" by communist-backed black nationalist guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cefkin |first1=J.

White supremacists are described as being obsessed with the treatment of the formerly dominant white minorities in [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]] by the black majorities where "the diminished stature of whites is presented as an ongoing genocide that must be fought."&lt;ref name="MurphyD"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2015/0618/Why-would-an-American-white-supremacist-be-fond-of-Rhodesia|title=Why would an American white supremacist be fond of Rhodesia?|last=Murphy|first=Dan|date=15 June 2015|work=The Christian Science Monitor|access-date=9 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the story of [[Rhodesia]], as Zimbabwe was formerly known, ruled by a segregationist government under which most black people were denied the right to vote, holds a particular fascination for white supremacists.

Starting with French author [[Renaud Camus]] and his 2011 book ''Le Grand Remplacement,'' the conspiracy theory of the [[Great Replacement]] focused on a displacement of French whites by predominantly Muslim population from the Middle East and Africa, then turned into a pan-European concept which spread across most major countries' politics on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Taguieff|first=Pierre-André|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guYJCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT71|title=La revanche du nationalisme: Néopopulistes et xénophobes à l'assaut de l'Europe|date=2015|publisher=Presses Universitaires de France|isbn=978-2-13-072950-1|language=fr|author-link=Pierre-André Taguieff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a common reference to a "genocide" of indigenous white peoples and a global plan led by a conspiring power, Camus's theory does not include an [[antisemitic]] [[Antisemitic canard|Jewish plot]]. His removal of antisemitism from the original neo-Nazi theory (which has been replaced in the European context with [[Islamophobia]]), along with his use of simple catch-all slogans, have been cited as reasons for its broader appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Camus|first1=Jean-Yves|title=Far-Right Politics in Europe|last2=Lebourg|first2=Nicolas|date=2017|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-97843-0|pages=206–207|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosentino-2020"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cosentino|first=Gabriele|title=Social Media and the Post-Truth World Order |date=2020|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-030-43005-4|page=75|chapter=From Pizzagate to the Great Replacement: The Globalization of Conspiracy Theories|doi=10.1007/978-3-030-43005-4_3|s2cid=216239634|quote=While the Great Replacement is at its core an Islamophobic belief, Lane's ideology is anti-Semitic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Replacement has also been compared with the European Islamophobic strain of [[Bat Ye'or]]'s 2002 [[Eurabia]] conspiracy theory,&lt;ref name="Spinoff - eurabia" /&gt; and with ideas expressed by far-right terrorist [[Anders Behring Breivik]], the perpetrator of the [[2011 Norway attacks]], in his ''2083: A European Declaration of Independence'' manifesto.&lt;ref name="BI - eurabia" /&gt; Since the 2019 [[Christchurch mosque shootings]], where the shooter named his manifesto ''The Great Replacement'', the French-originated phrase has been widely established as synonymous with "white genocide", used by mainstream Western media interchangeably, and deemed largely responsible for the emerging term of "white replacement".&lt;ref name="ABC - white replacement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GQ - white replacement" /&gt;

Former diplomat and scholar [[Alfredo Toro Hardy]], who credits journalist [[Charles M. Blow]] with the term "white extinction anxiety", has outlined how "the anxieties related to the changing racial landscape of the United States" were at the heart of the concept, and propelled policies such as the Trump administration's "[[Trump administration family separation policy|extreme measures]] against Southern immigrants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hardy |first1=Alfredo Toro |date=2019 |title=The Crossroads of Globalization: A Latin American View |page=105 |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |isbn=978-9813277304 |author-link=Alfredo Toro Hardy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Trump has been accused of capitalizing on "white genocide anxiety" with claims that immigration had "changed the fabric of Europe", and empowering his supporters in media, such as [[Laura Ingraham]], to stoke fears of "massive demographic changes" within the US.&lt;ref name="NYR Books" /&gt; Science journalist [[Ronald Bailey]] proposes that Trump is merely "the latest [[demagogue]] to rise to power by stoking white folks' ethnic fears", and that "white extinction panics" have historically occurred in the US each time the foreign-born population reached above 13 percent.&lt;ref name="White Extinction Panic" /&gt;[[File:Patrickjbuchanan.JPG|thumb|right|175px|[[Pat Buchanan]] in 2008]]Blow has defined "white extinction anxiety" as the fear that white people will become a minority, stripped of [[White privilege|their race-based privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/4957560/white-extinction-anxiety-twitter/|title='White Extinction Anxiety' Trends On Twitter: Do White People Really Fear Dying Off?

Anti-racism activist [[Jane Elliott]] has suggested that this anxiety, or "Fear of White Genetic Annihilation", is so great that political leaders will resort to any measures in order to prevent the white extinction event that they believe is unfolding, including measures such as the [[Alabama abortion ban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yesmagazine.org/peace-justice/abortion-ban-fear-white-extinction-babies-20190703|title=Race Against Time: How White Fear of Genetic Annihilation Fuels Abortion Bans |publisher=[[Yes!

According to professor [[Alexandra Minna Stern]], who has detailed the connection between the conspiracy theory and the anxiety-framed concept, factions of the [[alt-right]] are distorting fertility statistics into a "conspiratorial campaign of white extinction" which is being fueled by a looming "white extinction anxiety". This phenomenon is driving alt-right strategies such as encouraging couples of [[Western European|Western]] and [[Northern European]] ethnicity to have up to eight children.&lt;ref name="Warping"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Stern |first1=Alexandra Minna |date=2019 |title=Proud Boys and the White Ethnostate: How the Alt-Right Is Warping the American Imagination |page=99 |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |isbn=978-0807063361 |author-link=Alexandra Minna Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the white genocide claims in South Africa rest on a misrepresentation of the Afrikaner people as conforming to the popular ''[[Boer]]'' stereotype as hard-working, devoutly Calvinist, gun-loving farmers. In 1989, the British journalist Patrick Brogan noted that the Afrikaners once called themselves ''Boers'' ({{Lit|farmers}}) because that was what they were, but the term ''Boer'' fell out of use in the 20th century as most of the Afrikaners moved to urban areas, making the term ''Boer'' highly [[anachronistic]].&lt;ref name="Brogan, Patrick p.87"&gt;Brogan, Patrick ''The Fighting Never Stopped'', New York: Vintage Books, 1989 p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Brogan concluded the popular ''Boer'' stereotype does not accurately describe the majority of the Afrikaners, whose way of life is very similar to that of middle-class people in other Western nations.&lt;ref name="Brogan, Patrick p.87" /&gt;

Even mainstream American conservatives who often championed the causes of [[Rhodesia]] and [[apartheid South Africa]], seeing both regimes as having supposedly more enlightened policies towards black people than the policy of [[Desegregation in the United States|integration in the United States]], embraced the variants of the white genocide theory as part of the defense of Rhodesia and South Africa.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Heer|first=Jeet|date=24 June 2015|title=Dylann Roof's Defense of White Rule in Africa Has Roots in American Conservatism|magazine=The New Republic|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/122140/dylann-roofs-defense-apartheid-africa-has-roots-us-conservatism|access-date=9 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Canadian journalist [[Jeet Heer]] wrote: "The idea that whites in America have a natural affinity with white colonialists in Africa did not spring from the neo-Nazi far-right, but rather the conservative movement that coalesced around ''[[National Review]]'' in the 1950s."&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; In the July 1988 edition of ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', David Roberts, Jr compared [[Nelson Mandela]] to [[Pol Pot]] and the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), the now ruling party in South Africa, to the [[Khmer Rouge]], implying that the ANC would exterminate South African whites if it came to power.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Heilbrunn|first=Jacob|date=January–February 1998|title=Apologists Without Remorse|work=The American Prospect|url=http://prospect.org/article/apologists-without-remorse|access-date=9 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death in 2005 [[Samuel T.

Simon Roche, an Afrikaner nationalist from South Africa and a spokesman for the survivalist group, the [[Suidlanders]], that exists in his words "to prepare a Protestant Christian South African Minority for a coming violent revolution," visited the US in 2017 to promote the thesis that the white minority in South Africa is faced with the threat of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref name="far-right idea" /&gt; Roche stated he went to the US to "raise awareness of and support for the Caucasian Christian conservative ''volk'' [people] of South Africa ...

==== Germany ====

The [[2015–16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany|2015 New Year's Eve attacks]] in Cologne resulted in accusations that the federal government and media were deliberately avoiding public interest reporting on 1,200 [[sexual assault]]s by thousands of young male Muslim immigrants.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Apologies for hesitancy by public television channel [[ZDF]] strengthened claims of a ''[[Lügenpresse]]'' (lying press) by populist and far-right parties as evidence for widespread conspiracy by German institutions.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The unprecedented scale of border crossings during 2015 and 2016 compelled Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] to impose "temporary restrictions" on transit across the border with Austria. The alt-right conspiracy website [[Zero Hedge]] listed statistics on migrant crime in Germany alongside statements from politicians and news articles, presented as "contradictions confirming a deep-state level of conspiracy ... to push through a pro-immigration policy in Germany". During the 2017 German election campaign, the far-right [[Alternative for Germany]] party ran advertisements featuring a pregnant woman's abdomen with the slogan, "New Germans? We'll make them ourselves."&lt;ref name="GastonS" /&gt; Events like the 2015 New Year's Eve sexual assaults, and the great replacement conspiracy theory also further radicalized right-wing extremist Stephan Ernst, who in response [[Murder of Walter Lübcke|assassinated]] the local politician [[Walter Lübcke]] in 2019. Based on protocols of his first confession, Ernst held Lübcke responsible for letting non-white refugees into the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.daserste.de/information/reportage-dokumentation/dokus/sendung/toedlicher-hass-der-mordfall-walter-luebcke-112.html|title=Der Mordfall Walter Lübcke - Reportage &amp; Dokumentation - ARD &amp;#124; Das Erste|website=www.daserste.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hungary ====
[[File:EPP Helsinki Congress in Finland, 7-8 November 2018 (45777983671) cropped.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Viktor Orbán]]]]

A state-sponsored campaign led by Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] has employed a wide range of historical anti-Semitic tropes to accuse philanthropist [[George Soros]] of engaging in conspiracies to support and deceive the public about nonwhite immigrants. Orbán has accused Soros, a Jew whose family survived hostile conditions during Hungary's Nazi occupation, of being a Nazi himself, and has introduced legislation known as the "Stop Soros law" to criminalize organized support of immigrants. These fabrications have become popular with the alt-right in Europe and the US.&lt;ref name="GastonS" /&gt; Orbán's 2018 campaign slogan was, "Christianity is Europe's last hope",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bromley|first1=Richard|date=2018|title=The politics of displacement: the Far Right narrative of Europe and its 'others'|url=http://europeansouth.postcolonialitalia.it/journal/2018-3/2.Bromley.pdf|journal=From the European South|volume=3|pages=13–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "our worst nightmares can come true.

==== Poland ====

Hundreds of Polish [[Facebook]] groups such as "Stop White Genocide" have produced and disseminated images depicting African and Middle eastern people as belonging to separate "primitive" species, lacking the human intelligence of white Europeans. Websites such as "Conspiracy Files" have fabricated allegations of political compacts to bolster nonwhite immigration against popular will, such as agreements signed by EU leaders and African nations to increase Europe's African population to 300 million by 2068, making native whites, "minorities within their own homeland".&lt;ref name="GastonS" /&gt;

==== Russia ====
Much of the theory that South African whites are faced with the threat of "genocide" originates with internet rumors started by the [[Government of Russia]]. [[Russia-24]], a television channel owned by the Russian government, aired a segment in the summer of 2018 about Afrikaner farmers wanting to immigrate to Russia as "brothers in faith". The present government in Russia led by [[Vladimir Putin]] often attacks the ideology of liberalism for putting the individual before the collective, and promotes "white genocide" stories both as a way of showing the failure of liberalism and to promote the thesis that group identities matter far more than individual identities. The ideology of the Russian state is that the interests of the collective take precedence over the individual, and evidence of alleged failures of liberalism abroad are extensively covered by the Russian media.&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt; The Australian historian [[Mark Edele]] stated: "There is definitely an attempt [by Russia] to support alt-right views and extreme right organisations outside of Russia ... Russia supports groups that will undermine liberal views. That's the logic of sponsorship of alt-right groups by Russia ... There is a longstanding anxiety among Russia's nationalists that Russians are dying out because of falling birth rates compared to non-Slavic peoples. It reverberates with white genocide fears."&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt;

The Canadian alt-right personality [[Lauren Southern]] had a sympathetic interview with the Russian fascist thinker [[Aleksandr Dugin]], who told her "liberalism denies the existence of any collective identities" and that "liberalism is based on the absence of any form of collective identity". Dugin used the case of white South African farmers allegedly threatened with genocide as proof of the failure of liberalism, for putting the individual ahead of the collective. After the end of apartheid in 1994, South Africa was presented as the "rainbow nation" where henceforward people, regardless of their skin color, would be judged only as individuals. From the viewpoint of the Russian state, presenting liberalism in South Africa as a blood{{nbh}}soaked disaster is a way of discrediting liberalism in general.&lt;ref name="smh"/&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====
[[File:Anne Maria Waters.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Anne Marie Waters]]]]

In a 2015 ''[[Breitbart News]]'' article, the anti-Islamic [[For Britain Movement|For Britain]] party founder and leader [[Anne Marie Waters]] described white genocide as "part of a broad-ranging, virulent, and vicious hatred of white Western people" and claimed that European leaders aimed to "extinguish Western culture".&lt;ref name="GastonS" /&gt;

In December 2015, former EDL leader [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]] endorsed the white genocide myth.&lt;ref name="Examining white genocide"&gt;{{cite news|date=13 November 2019|title=At an Arkansas white nationalist rally, Trump's support for racist conspiracies provides inspiration|work=[[ThinkProgress]]|url=https://thinkprogress.org/arkansas-white-nationalist-nsm-rally-trump-tweets-white-genocide-false-14c1e5b561d4/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2015 book ''Enemy of the State'', Robinson claimed how previously [[white British]] majority areas of his hometown, [[Luton]], had suffered "[[ethnic cleansing]]" and claimed that the United Kingdom was "sleepwalking" its "way towards a Muslim takeover".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=25 October 2018|title=Tommy Robinson and the far right's new playbook|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/25/tommy-robinson-and-the-far-rights-new-playbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks before the 2016 [[Brexit]] referendum, an unemployed gardener with links to far-right organisations [[Murder of Jo Cox|murdered]] Member of Parliament [[Jo Cox]] because of her support of the European Union and work in support of immigrants, saying she was part of a left-wing conspiracy perpetuated by the mainstream media and a traitor to the white race.&lt;ref name="GastonS" /&gt; A March 2016 survey ahead of the referendum found 41% of Britons thought their government was concealing the true number of immigrants.&lt;ref name="GastonS" /&gt;

[[Katie Hopkins]], an English media personality, made a documentary supporting the conspiracy theory of an ongoing white genocide against farmers in South Africa.&lt;ref name="preppers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Walsh|first=Joe|date=22 May 2018|title=No, Katie Hopkins, there is no white genocide in South Africa|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/world/africa/2018/05/no-katie-hopkins-there-no-white-genocide-south-africa|magazine=[[New Statesman]]|access-date=15 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, British journalist [[Rod Liddle]] was identified as promoting the conspiracy theory in an article in ''[[The Spectator]]'', according to ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' website.&lt;ref name="preppers"&gt;{{cite news|last=Haynes|first=Gavin|date=10 May 2018|title=The Race War Preppers Behind South Africa's 'White Genocide' Meme|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/qvn44v/the-race-war-preppers-behind-south-africas-white-genocide-meme|access-date=15 December 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested [[Lauren Southern]], who had made her own documentary about South Africa, would have been greeted positively had it been about "any other brand of genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liddle|first=Rod|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/03/genocide-in-south-africa-now-thats-a-black-and-white-issue/|title=Genocide in South Africa: now that's a black-and-white issue|work=The Spectator|date=17 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317111902/https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/03/genocide-in-south-africa-now-thats-a-black-and-white-issue/|archive-date=17 March 2018|quote=Shockingly, almost I might say unbelievably, a Canadian libertarian blogger has been refused entry to the UK because she subscribes to the narrative which I outlined above.

Katie Hopkins has also promoted the idea that both immigration and [[multiculturalism]] are intended to cause white genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=24 July 2018|title=The Rebel Media-branded retirement savings fund is not happening|url=https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-rebel-media-branded-retirement-savings-fund-is-not-happening/|magazine=[[Maclean's]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Yahoo!

In September 2018, with the arrest of some Neo-Nazi members of [[National Action (UK)|National Action]], the counter-terrorist [[CONTEST#Prevent|Prevent]] programme identified the white supremacist group as subscribing to the white extinction conspiracy theory. A governmental co-ordinator stated that the organization "sees the extinction of white people as a very real and likely possibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=7 September 2017|title=Neo-Nazi arrests: National Action suspects are in the Army|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41161233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2019, [[Catherine Blaiklock]] resigned as leader of The [[Brexit Party]] after she shared a photo on social media of a multi-racial primary school in England with the caption "This is a British school.

According to Erika Lee, in 1894 the old stock Yankee upper-class founders of the [[Immigration Restriction League]] were, “convinced that Anglo-Saxon traditions, peoples, and culture were being drowned in a flood of racially inferior foreigners from Southern and Eastern Europe.”&lt;ref&gt;Erika Lee, ''America for Americans a history of xenophobia in the United States'' (2019) p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, white nationalist [[Greg Johnson (white nationalist)|Greg Johnson]] promoted the white extinction conspiracy theory, suggesting that "the organized Jewish community is the ''principal'' enemy—not the sole enemy, but the principal enemy—of every attempt to halt and reverse white extinction.

In December 2014, [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader [[Thomas Robb (Ku Klux Klan)|Thomas Robb]] proposed that white genocide was occurring due to the immigration and high birth-rates of non-whites.

By March 2016, Trump's eldest son, [[Donald Trump Jr.]], had been accused by mainstream media of being an advocate of the conspiracy theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=20 September 2016|title=Donald Trump Jr. Is His Father's Id|work=[[The Atlantic]]|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/donald-trump-jr-is-his-fathers-id/500762/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or pretending to be an advocate for political gain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=20 September 2016|title=Donald Trump Jr. Emerges as 'Alt-Right' Hero Even as Dad Tones Down Rhetoric|work=[[The Forward]]|url=https://forward.com/news/350364/donald-trump-jr-emerges-as-alt-right-hero-even-as-dad-tones-down-rhetoric/}}&lt;/ref&gt; after his interview with white supremacist [[The Political Cesspool#James Edwards|James Edwards]] during the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 Trump presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=4 March 2016|title=Donald Trump Jr. sat down for interview with supremacist who once said 'interracial sex is white genocide'|work=[[National Post]]|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/donald-trump-jr-sat-down-for-interview-with-white-supremacist-who-once-said-interracial-sex-is-white-genocide}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, [[Jack Posobiec]], a leading [[alt-right]] Trump activist and, at the time, US [[naval intelligence]] officer with military security clearance, began frequently tweeting about white genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=15 August 2017|title=Trump Retweets Alt-Right Leader Who Has Praised White Supremacist Richard Spencer|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=https://www.newsweek.com/trump-tweets-alt-right-leader-who-praised-white-supremacist-richard-spencer-650852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Donald Trump supporters on the [[Reddit]] discussion forum [[/r/The Donald]] generally agreed that white genocide is occurring, they disagreed about the responsible parties. The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] said "Tea Party conservatives characterize it as a scheme by Democrats to gain voters. For the white nationalists, the main villain is 'international Jewry.' ''[[InfoWars]]'' fans blame 'globalists'—a label that is often interchangeable with 'Jews'—seeking to dumb down Western populations with 'low-IQ migrants' who are more easily controlled." In August 2017, at least 330 /r/The_Donald posts referred to the "[[Kalergi plan]]", a purported conspiracy to replace the European population with African migrants.&lt;ref name="Day trope" /&gt;

The month before the US presidential election, white supremacist [[Richard B. Spencer]] declared that whatever the upcoming result, that he would be "profoundly grateful to Donald Trump for the rest of my life". Invoking "white genocide" in the same interview, he labelled [[Employment discrimination law in the United States|anti-discrimination laws]] "the enemy of all tradition, not just the Anglo-Saxon American society it has helped destroy", and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] as "the god of white dispossession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=18 October 2016|title=Meet the Alt-Right 'Spokesman' Who's Thrilled With Trump's Rise|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/meet-the-alt-right-spokesman-whos-thrilled-with-trumps-rise-129588/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, [[William Daniel Johnson]], leader of the [[American Freedom Party]], was pushing the theory in support of Trump for president; denouncing "the death of the white race, caused by the concepts of diversity and multiculturalism", he said that America needed a "strong leader" like Trump, likening the Republican candidate favorably with Philippine president [[Rodrigo Duterte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=17 October 2016|title=Donald Trump réveille le géant assoupi de l'Amérique blanche|language=fr|trans-title=Donald Trump wakes up the sleeping giant of white America|newspaper=[[Le Figaro]]|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2016/10/16/01003-20161016ARTFIG00120-donald-trump-reveille-le-geant-assoupi-de-l-amerique-blanche.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville ====

[[File:Jason Kessler (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Jason Kessler]] {{circa}} 2017]]

In August 2017, a white supremacist protest named the [[Unite the Right rally]] was held in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], largely driven by the ideology of the "white genocide" narrative. The protest was ostensibly centered around the impending removal of a [[Robert Edward Lee (sculpture)|statue of Robert E. Lee]], who was the commander of the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The night before the rally, leaflets were distributed en masse in the city, bearing the recurrent slogan "Diversity is a code word for white genocide".&lt;ref name="guardian-utr" /&gt;

Speaking at the event in Charlottesville, [[Jason Kessler]], the primary organizer behind the rally and a white nationalist blogger, claimed that "the first and foremost reason that we're having this rally, is for that park and for that statue. It's about white genocide. It's about the replacement of our people, culturally and ethnically".&lt;ref name="aljazeera-utr" /&gt; Kessler has repeatedly promoted the conspiracy theory, using his website to criticize what he called "white genocide" and an "attack on white history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hawkins|first1=Derek|date=4 October 2017|title=Jason Kessler, Charlottesville protest organizer, indicted on a charge of perjury|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/10/04/jason-kessler-charlottesville-protest-organizer-indicted-for-perjury/|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=White nationalist sues Charlottesville to hold Unite the Right anniversary rally|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/07/white-nationalist-sues-charlottesville-hold-unite-right-anniversary-rally/403556002/|access-date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=11 August 2018|title=In Remarks For Charlottesville Anniversary, Trump Still Plays To Both Sides|url=https://www.refinery29.com/2018/08/207046/trump-charlotttesville-riot-unite-the-right-rally-anniversary-tweet/|work=[[Refinery29]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent white nationalists also tied the conspiracy theory to the motivations behind Unite the Right. Giving a speech at the rally, Neo-nazi [[Mike Enoch]] said "We're here to talk about white genocide, the deliberate and intentional displacement of the white race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=9 October 2017|title=Birth of a White Supremacist|work=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/16/birth-of-a-white-supremacist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trump administration foreign policy on South Africa ====

In the fall of 2017, it was reported broadcaster [[Alex Jones]] and his fake news organization ''[[InfoWars]]'' were promoting the white genocide myth. The [[Suidlanders]] (a [[völkisch]] group involved in spreading the conspiracy theory in South Africa) accepted invitations to contribute to the platform on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name="M&amp;G" /&gt; Around the same time, Jones claimed white genocide was a serious threat in the US; on a cultural front, with what he asserted were black NFL players advocating for "white genocide" by [[U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)|refusing to stand]] for the national anthem, and the apparent physical threat of Democrats and communists plotting genocidal attacks specifically against [[white Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1 June 2019|title=Laura Ingraham loses sponsor over defense of white supremacist|work=[[ThinkProgress]]|url=https://thinkprogress.org/laura-ingraham-loses-sponsor-over-defense-of-white-supremacist-1dc92e0b01f5/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alex Jones Portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Alex Jones]] in 2017]]

Jones has been described as particularly instrumental in the American spread of conspiracy theories about white genocide in Africa,&lt;ref name="M&amp;G" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Here's Twitter's position on Alex Jones (and hate-peddling anti-truthers) – hint: It's a fudge|work=[[TechCrunch]]|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/heres-twitters-position-on-alex-jones-and-hate-peddling-anti-truthers-hint-its-a-fudge/|access-date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his long-time political ally, radio host [[Michael Savage]], has devoted an episode of his show to conspiracy theories about white genocide in the region.&lt;ref name="far-right idea" /&gt;

In August 2018, US President [[Donald Trump]] brought the concept of "white genocide" in relation to [[South Africa]] significantly further into mainstream media discourse, after he publicly instructed Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] to investigate [[South African farm attacks]],&lt;ref name="The Washington Post" /&gt; an instruction which was broadly portrayed in media as Trump and his administration advocating for an unfounded conspiracy theory.&lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=23 August 2018|title=ADL blasts Trump for tweeting a white nationalist talking point|work=[[The Times of Israel]]|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/adl-blasts-trump-for-tweeting-a-white-nationalist-talking-point/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=23 August 2018|title=White Nationalists Praise Donald Trump for Spreading White South African Farmers Conspiracy Theory|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=https://www.newsweek.com/white-nationalists-trump-south-african-farmers-1087549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=23 August 2018|title=Trump Is Using a White Nationalist Conspiracy Theory to Inform Policy|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-south-africa-714744/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump had apparently gained his information from [[Tucker Carlson]], a conservative political commentator for [[Fox News]], who has been described as bringing the conspiracy theory of an ongoing "white genocide" in South Africa into the mainstream after a piece about the topic on his show caught the attention of president.&lt;ref name="SalonCarlson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcotte|first=Amanda|date=15 August 2018|title=Tucker Carlson claims there's no white nationalism.

==== Reaction to US-South Africa policy ====
In August 2018, many politicians and public figures responded critically to US President [[Donald Trump]]'s foreign policy initiative to investigate the seizure of land from white farmers and apparent evoking of the conspiracy theory. These included multiple members of the [[22nd South African Parliament|South African Parliament]] and RSA [[Deputy President of South Africa|Deputy President]] [[David Mabuza]], who rejected the conspiracy theory, calling it "far from the truth". He stated that "we would like to discourage those who are using this sensitive and emotive issue of land to divide us as South Africans by distorting our [[Land reform in South Africa|land reform measures]] to the international community and spreading falsehoods that our '[[White South Africans#Post-apartheid era|white farmers]]' are facing the onslaught from their own government."&lt;ref name="WP1" /&gt;

[[Julius Malema]] MP reacted, saying "there is no white genocide in South Africa",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=23 August 2018|title=Donald Trump's land seizures tweet draws angry reaction in South Africa|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/23/trump-orders-close-study-of-south-africa-farmer-killings}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Trump's intervention into their ongoing [[Land reform in South Africa|land reform issues]] "only made them more determined&amp;nbsp;... to expropriate our land without compensation",&lt;ref name="bbc malema"&gt;{{cite web|date=23 August 2018|title=South Africa rejects Donald Trump's tweet on farmer killings|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45282088|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP1" /&gt; and that there is a [[black genocide]] in the US.&lt;ref name="bbc malema" /&gt; [[Jeremy Cronin]] MP stated that the South African government needed to "send a signal to the courts‚ to Trump‚ to [[Fox News]] Agency" over the issue. The deputy [[Minister of Public Works (South Africa)|Minister of Public Works]] spoke against the conspiracy theory; in a committee meeting in the [[South African parliament]], he indicated that land expropriation without compensation should not be viewed as a white genocide.&lt;ref name="TimesLive"&gt;{{cite web|date=28 August 2018|title=Expropriation Bill to be redrafted to accommodate expropriation without compensation|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2018-08-28-expropriation-bill-to-be-redrafted-to-accommodate-expropriation-without-compensation/|publisher=[[The Times (South Africa)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, [[Lindiwe Sisulu]], claimed that his foreign policy tweet was "regrettable" and "based on false information",&lt;ref name="False claims" /&gt; and that the conspiracy theory in general was "a [[right-wing]] ideology, and it is very unfortunate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=27 August 2018|title=South Africa's top diplomat slams Trump tweet as 'right-wing ideology'|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/27/africa/south-africa-trump-tweet-land-reform-intl/index.html|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, former [[United States Ambassador to South Africa|US Ambassador]] to South Africa [[Patrick Gaspard]], and American media personalities [[Chris Cuomo]], [[Mika Brzezinski]] and [[Al Sharpton]] spoke out against the US President on the issue. Labelling Trump's actions as "dangerous and poisoned",&lt;ref name="WP1" /&gt; Gaspard opposed the concept, claiming the conspiracy theory was "trafficking in a [[white supremacist]] story line",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=23 August 2018|title=Trump's South Africa Tweet Seems to Embrace Racist Narrative on Land Dispute|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/politics/trump-south-africa-land.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the concept is a "white-supremacist [[Alt-right#Use of memes|meme]] from the darkest place."&lt;ref name="WP1" /&gt;

Cuomo, a television journalist, while stating that "like all conspiracy tripe, there's a kernel of truth" to the theory (in relation to [[land reform in South Africa]]) but concluded that the concept was a "bogus cause that [[white nationalists]] are selling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=24 August 2018|title=Cuomo offers Trump tips to avoid scrutiny|url=https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/08/24/trump-south-africa-scrutiny-cuomo-cpt-sot-vp.cnn|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite web|date=24 August 2018|title=Kellyanne Conway and Chris Cuomo squeezed a week's worth of news into one wild 30-minute debate on CNN|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/kellyanne-conway-and-chris-cuomo-interview-cnn-2018-8|work=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected what he said was Donald Trump, and his administration, claiming "white farmers" were "being hunted down and killed and having their land stolen".&lt;ref name="BI" /&gt;

==== Fox News era ====
[[File:Tucker Carlson by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Tucker Carlson]] in 2018]]
The American news channel [[Fox News]] is described by multiple mainstream media sources as aligned with the concept and narrative of the white genocide conspiracy theory and using its prominence to bring rhetoric of demographic threats to white Americans further into the center of US discourse.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}} [[Amanda Marcotte]], writing in ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', has stated that Fox's default ideology is "strikingly similar" to "[[fascistic]] replacement theory" and "white genocide". Marcotte wrote that this ideology is especially the case for the network's prime-time commentators, such as [[Tucker Carlson]] and [[Laura Ingraham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcotte|first=Amanda|date=29 April 2019|title=Fox News and the synagogue shooter: Right-wing network airs similar views every day|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|url=https://www.salon.com/2019/04/29/fox-news-and-the-synagogue-shooter-right-wing-network-airs-similar-views-every-day/|quote=fascistic "replacement" theory, which holds that white people are entitled to cultural dominance and that racial diversity and immigration are equivalent to a "white genocide" ... Replacement theory is an idea that's been coursing through the burgeoning neo-Nazi and white nationalist movement for some time ... Sadly, this toxic notion is not limited to the dregs of the internet, where it appears Earnest was radicalized. These days, anyone who flips on Fox News, especially if they watch prime-time commentators like Tucker Carlson or Laura Ingraham, will hear strikingly similar ideas.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine has argued that "far-right" [[Great Replacement]] rhetoric is not only a nightly fixture of ''[[Tucker Carlson Tonight]]'', but a "foundational" principle of [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s media empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=15 March 2019|title=The Audio Doesn't Lie: Tucker Carlson Is Who We Thought He Was|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/03/tucker-carlson-is-who-we-thought-he-was.html|website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|quote=Fantasizing about this far-right "Great Replacement" conspiracy theory has been practically a nightly fixture of Carlson's program since its inception, it's a foundational part of right wing media from the Rupert Murdoch empire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[GQ]]'' has reported that Fox News' "popular primetime" shows are an important pipeline to President [[Donald Trump]]'s political positions, such as the investigation into land reform in South Africa, and that Carlson's show in particular dedicates segments to "'great replacement' propaganda".&lt;ref name="GQ - white replacement" /&gt; The warnings delivered by "conservative pundits on Fox News" are driving fears of an "existential threat" of a white genocide, according to ''[[The Atlantic]]'', who particularly analyzed Laura Ingraham's nativist remarks, such as "massive demographic changes" apparently being inflicted upon [[white Americans]] against their will.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic" /&gt; While ''[[The New York Times]]'' identified Carlson as engaging in replacement theory fear-mongering, in relation to family birthrates in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=30 April 2019|title='Replacement Theory,' a Racist, Sexist Doctrine, Spreads in Far-Right Circles|website=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/technology/replacement-theory.html|quote=Though these fears fester in online message boards, it is spreading to more mainstream right-wing conversations.

American Neo-Nazi literature such as ''[[The Turner Diaries]]'' and Lane's ''White Genocide Manifesto'' have spread online to right wing groups in Australia. A collection of writings called ''Siege'' by [[James Mason (neo-Nazi)|James Mason]] was cited as an inspiration by some of the twenty-two neo-Nazis who infiltrated the New South Wales [[Young Nationals (Australia)|Young Nationals]] party from which they were banned for life for trying to advance the creation of an ethno-state.&lt;ref name="RossK"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Kaz|date=16 March 2019|title=How believers in 'white genocide' spread their hate campaign in Australia|work=Business Standard|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/how-believers-in-white-genocide-spread-their-hate-campaign-in-australia-119031600127_1.html|access-date=19 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes of the "defense of Western civilization" and the achievements of ethnic Whites have become racist [[dog whistles]] for groups advancing theories of an impending white genocide.&lt;ref name="RossW"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Webb|first1=Ross|date=24 March 2019|title=NZ's South African community needs to stop peddling the myth of white genocide|work=The Spinoff|url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/24-03-2019/ex-pat-south-africans-need-to-stop-pedalling-the-myth-of-white-genocide/|access-date=24 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, several Australian tabloids owned by the News Corporation ran articles alleging that South African whites were faced with genocide and which led the Australian home affairs minister [[Peter Dutton]] to promise fast-track visas for any South African white wishing to emigrate to Australia.&lt;ref name="far-right idea" /&gt; Dutton is known for his anti-immigrant and anti-refugee stance, which led to questions about his willingness to accept South African whites into Australia as refugees, since he normally opposes Australia accepting refugees.&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt; One News Corp columnist, [[Miranda Devine]], wrote about the ties as she saw them between the Australian people and "our oppressed white, Christian, industrious, rugby and cricket-playing Commonwealth cousins" threatened by South African blacks whom she promised would integrate "seamlessly" into Australia as opposed to immigration from Third World countries.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wilson|first=Jason|date=16 March 2018|title=Peter Dutton's offer to white South African farmers started on the far right|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/16/peter-duttons-offer-to-white-south-african-farmers-started-on-the-far-right|access-date=9 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Australian News Corporation columnist Caroline Marcus connected the alleged plight of South African whites to what she saw as a broader attack on whites across the world, writing "the truth is, there are versions of this anti-white, vengeance theme swirling in movements around the western world, from Black Lives Matter in the US to Invasion Day protests back home."&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt; The British journalist Jason Wilson noted that the News Corporation run by the Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch also owns Fox News, which has aired stories portraying South African whites as a persecuted minority, leading him to accuse the News Corporation of promoting this narrative around the world.&lt;ref name="far-right idea" /&gt;

After Australian white-genocide conspiracy theorist [[Brenton Tarrant]] carried out the March 2019 [[Christchurch mosque shootings]], Queensland Senator [[Fraser Anning]] released a statement saying the cause of the attacks was "the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place".

In March 2019, journalist [[Adam Serwer]] suggested that the conspiracy theory did not sincerely refer to "mass murder, ethnic cleansing, or even violence," but rather to a perceived "loss of political and [[cultural hegemony]] in countries that white supremacists think should belong to white people by law."

Proposing that the "white genocide" label had "failed to take off", proving ineffective for conspiracy theorists attempting to push the narrative. Manjoo, an American journalist, suggested that the "[[Great Replacement]]" (which the Christchurch mosque shooter used for a manifesto title) was a softer reinvention, being to the white genocide conspiracy theory what the term [[Identitarian]] is to "white supremacist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The White-Extinction Conspiracy Theory Is Bonkers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/opinion/new-zealand-great-replacement.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |author=Manjoo, Farhad |author-link=Farhad Manjoo|date=20 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2019, British academic [[Elif Shafak]] detailed how [[Renaud Camus]]' theory of the [[Great Replacement]] has created an ideological worldview for the far-right to amplify into a "white genocide" narrative in the West. Shafak argues that the conspiracy theory is also embedded in the works of [[Thilo Sarrazin]], such as ''[[Germany Abolishes Itself]]'' and 2018's ''[[Hostile Takeover: How Islam Impedes Progress and Threatens Society|Hostile Takeover]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To understand the far right, look to their bookshelves   |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/01/far-right-bookshelves-jordan-peterson-thilo-sarrazin |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |author=Shafak, Elif|author-link=Elif Shafak|date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, [[Jonathan Freedland]] and [[Mehdi Hasan]] released a joint analysis of far-right extremism and the ideology behind "white genocide". Discussing Pittsburgh synagogue shooter, [[Robert Gregory Bowers]], and his rhetoric, Freeland and Hasan, both political journalists, labelled the conspiracy theory as racist and unhinged and argued that it had both the Muslim and Jewish "communities in its murderous sights". They concluded that both groups should "stand and fight it together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslims and Jews face a common threat from white supremacists.

In May 2019, political commentator [[Nick Cohen]] analyzed how "white genocide" narratives created anti-immigrant and societal sexual tension. He argued that the conspiracy theory was an effective form of racism and propaganda, which had penetrated [[Viktor Orbán]]'s Hungarian government, but revealed a far-right paranoia that European men were not [[virile]] enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/18/when-the-far-right-crack-rape-jokes-part-of-a-systemic-bid-to-demean|title=When the far right crack rape jokes, it's part of a systemic bid to demean |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|author=Cohen, Nick|author-link=Nick Cohen|date=18 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2019, professor of economics [[Jonathan Portes]], while describing the concept as a "lunatic" conspiracy theory, detailed how more respectable versions of "white genocide" were being promoted by academic and media figures, and therefore pushing the idea further into mainstream discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/30/tragedy-is-inevitable-if-we-fear-migration-rather-than-celebrate-its-benefits|title=Tragedy is inevitable if we fear migration rather than celebrate its benefits |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|author=Portes, Jonathan|author-link=Jonathan Portes|date=30 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
