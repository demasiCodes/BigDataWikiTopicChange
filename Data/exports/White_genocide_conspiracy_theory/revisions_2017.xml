The '''white genocide conspiracy theory''' is a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[conspiracy theory]] that mass [[immigration]], [[racial integration]], [[miscegenation]], [[Sub-replacement fertility|low fertility rates]] and [[abortion]] are being promoted in predominantly white countries to deliberately turn them minority-white and hence cause [[white people]] to become [[extinct]] through [[forced assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Jeffrey|title=Encyclopedia of White Power: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right|date=2000|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=9780742503403|page=539|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNWbbhUYv8oC&amp;pg=PA539&amp;dq=%22white+genocide%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yxRDVdvNKojFggSC0oGACQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22white%20genocide%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KivistoRundblad&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kivisto|first1=Peter|last2=Rundblad|first2=Georganne|title=Multiculturalism in the United States: Current Issues, Contemporary Voices|date=2000|publisher=SAGE Knowledge|isbn=9780761986485|pages=57–60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Co-4x6OXLiIC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22white+genocide%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DxFDVa2vHsScNqCegdAJ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22white%20genocide%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Capehart|first1=Jonathan|title=A petition to ‘stop white genocide’?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/01/18/petition-stop-white-genocide/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='White Genocide' Billboard Removed|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/nbc-news-channel/white-genocide-billboard-removed-384737859715|publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sexton|first1=Jared|title=Amalgamation Schemes: Antiblackness and the Critique of Multiracialism|date=2008|publisher=Univ Of Minnesota Press|isbn=0816651043|pages=207–208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHaxP1emCoUC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=%22white+genocide%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RhJDVbzBLcGngwTZ3YGQDw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22white%20genocide%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Barbara.

The conspiracy theory was purported in 1934 in [[Nazi Germany]] by a pamphlet written for the "Research Department for the [[Jewish question]]" of [[Walter Frank]]'s "Reich Institute" with the title "Are the White Nations Dying? The Future of the White and the Colored Nations in the Light of Biological Statistics".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Friedrich Burgdörfer: "Sterben die weißen Völker? Die Zukunft der weißen und farbigen Völker im Lichte der biologischen Statistik", Munich, Callwey, 1934, 88 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs about the causes==
In his ''White Genocide Manifesto'' (ca. 1995, the probable origin of the term),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/how-the-turner-diaries-changed-white-nationalism/500039/|title=How 'The Turner Diaries' Changed White Nationalism|last=Berger|first=J.M.|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/12/26/drexel_censures_professor_for_white_genocide_tweet.html|title=Drexel University, Apparently Unfamiliar With White Supremacist Lingo, Censures Prof For “White Genocide” Tweet|last=Dessem|first=Matthew|date=2016-12-26|work=Slate|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; white supremacist [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]] made the claim that the government policies of many [[Western world|western countries]] had the intent of destroying white [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] culture and making White people an "extinct species".&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; Lane, a founding member of the organization [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]], criticized race-mixing, abortion, [[homosexuality]], the legal repercussions against those who "resist genocide"  and also the "[[The Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|Zionist Occupation Government]]" that he said controls the U.S. and the other majority-white countries and encourages "white genocide". It is rooted in "doctrines of universalism both secular and religious" according to Lane, and it may have been a factor that led to the murder of [[anti-Nazi]] Jewish  talk-show commentator [[Alan Berg]] in 1984. Prior to his murder, Berg regularly taunted racists on his show.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Jackson | first = Paul | title = 'White genocide': Postwar fascism and the ideological value of evoking existential conflicts | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6rvlCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207 | encyclopedia = The Routledge History of Genocide | editors = Cathie Carmichael, Richard C.

However, the view that Jews are responsible for a white genocide is contested by other white supremacist figures, such as [[Jared Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=Kathleen|title=Anti-Immigration in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia: A Historical Encyclopedia|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=508|accessdate=26 July 2015|quote="Unlike many other white supremacists, Taylor is not anti-Semitic, and in fact encourages Jews to join his fight...however many within the white supremacist/anti-immigration movement disagree with Taylor, most notably David Duke, and he has been under tremendous pressure to break ties with the Jewish community. Taylor, at least for now, has refused to submit to this pressure and continues to work with Jews to further his platform."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
[[Far-right]] and [[alt-right]] figures, such as [[Steve Hofmeyr]] have claimed that a "white genocide" is taking place in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/donald-trump-white-victimhood-and-the-south-african-far-right-73400|title=Donald Trump, white victimhood and the South African far-right|first=Charles|last=Villet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The manifesto of far-right terrorist [[Anders Behring Breivik]] entitled ''2083: A European Declaration of Independence'' devotes an entire section to an alleged "genocide" against [[Afrikaners]]. It also contains several other references to alleged persecution of whites in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2017-02-27-donald-trump-white-victimhood-and-the-south-african-far-right/|title=Donald Trump, white victimhood and the South African far-right|first=Charles|last=Villet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Cernovich]], an American alt-right commentator has previously stated that "white genocide in South Africa is real".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/opinion/trumps-alt-right-coming-to-sa-7803189|title=Trump’s Alt-Right coming to SA - IOL News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, [[Africa Check]], a [[fact-checking]] organisation has rejected the claims as false: "In fact, whites are less likely to be murdered than any other race group." Africa Check reported that while whites account for nearly 9% of the South African population they represent just 1.8% of murder victims. Lizette Lancaster from the [[Institute for Security Studies]] has said that "Whites are far less likely to be murdered than their black or coloured counterparts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://africacheck.org/reports/are-white-afrikaners-really-being-killed-like-flies/|title=Are SA whites really being killed ‘like flies’?

==Discourse==
Anders Behring Breivik's entitled manifesto makes frequent mention of an alleged ongoing genocide against white Europeans.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

In 2016, [[Donald Trump]] garnered controversy after retweeting [[Twitter]] user @WhiteGenocideTM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=CNN|first1=Tal Kopan|title=Donald Trump retweets 'White Genocide' Twitter user|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/22/politics/donald-trump-retweet-white-genocide/|accessdate=March 15, 2017|work=CNN|date=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and @EustaceFash, whose Twitter header image at the time also included the term "white genocide".&lt;ref name="Fortune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kharakh|first1=Ben|last2=Primack|first2=Dan|title=Donald Trump's Social Media Ties to White Supremacists|url=http://fortune.com/donald-trump-white-supremacist-genocide/|accessdate=March 15, 2017|work=Fortune|date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 analysis of his feed during the primaries showed that 62% of those that he chose to retweet in an average week followed multiple accounts which discussed the conspiracy theory, and 21% following prominent white nationalists online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staufenberg|first1=Jess|title=Turns out Donald Trump 'mostly' retweets white supremacist sympathisers|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trumps-re-tweets-are-mostly-of-white-supremacist-sympathisers-a6838521.html|accessdate=March 15, 2017|work=The Independent|date=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Anglin]] of the neo-Nazi website ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'' said that "it isn't statistically possible that two ['white genocide' tweets] back to back could be a random occurrence.

Discussion threads on the white nationalist Internet forum [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] often center around the theme of white people being subjected to genocidal policies by their governments.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

The notion of racial purity, homogeneity, or "[[racial hygiene]]" is an underlying theme of the white genocide discourse and it has been used by people with a [[neo-Nazi]] and [[white supremacist]] background.&lt;ref name=Routledge2015 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waltman|first1=Michael|last2=Haas|first2=John|title=The Communication of Hate|date=2011|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|page=27|accessdate=10 August 2015|quote=Race categories are organized hierarchically to reflect differences that are inherent in the essence of these categories.
