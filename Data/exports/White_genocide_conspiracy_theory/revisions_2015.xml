However, the view that Jews are responsible to white genocide is contested by other figures, such as [[Jared Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnold|first1=Kathleen|title=Anti-Immigration in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia: A Historical Encyclopedia|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=508|accessdate=26 July 2015|quote="Unlike many other white supremacists, Taylor is not anti-Semitic, and in fact encourages Jews to join his fight...however many within the white supremacist/anti-immigration movement disagrees with Taylor, most notably David Duke, and he has been under tremendous pressure to break ties with the Jewish community. Taylor, at least for now, has refused this pressure and continues to work with Jews to further his platform."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discourse==
The notion of racial purity or “[[racial hygiene]]” is an underlying theme among the White genocide discourse and has been used within those of a [[Neo-Nazi]] and [[White Supremacist]] background.&lt;ref name=Routledge2015&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waltman|first1=Michael|last2=Haas|first2=John|title=The Communication of Hate|date=2011|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|page=27|accessdate=10 August 2015|quote="Race categories are organized hierarchically to reflect differences that are inherent in the essence of these categories. These differences justify and underlie the hostility that is expressed toward inferior groups. This hostility further fuels the drive for racial purity. “Race-mixing” is treated as genocide and is understood to be the goal of all non-whites”}}&lt;/ref&gt;
