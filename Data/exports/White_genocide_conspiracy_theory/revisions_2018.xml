The conspiracy theory was developed by the neo-Nazi [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]] in about 1995. The phrase "[[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] is a [[code word (figure of speech)|code word]] for anti-white", coined by high-profile white nationalist Robert Whitaker, is commonly associated with the topic of white [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/billboard-white-genocide-group-ala-article-1.2074126|title=Billboard from 'white genocide' group goes up in Ala.|publisher=|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/06/where_does_that_billboard_phra.html|title=Where does that billboard phrase, 'Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white,' come from?

===Alt-right===
In the first decade of the 21st century, the conspiracy theory spread beyond its explicit neo-Nazi and white nationalist origins, to be embraced by the newer [[alt-right]] movement.

Anders Behring Breivik's entitled manifesto makes frequent mention of an alleged ongoing genocide against white Europeans.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

Discussion threads on the white nationalist Internet forum [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] often center around the theme of white people being subjected to genocidal policies by their governments.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; The concept has also been popularized by the [[alt-right]] movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/alt-right-a-primer-about-the-new-white-supremacy|title=Alt Right: A Primer about the New White Supremacy|website=Anti-Defamation League|language=en|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-alt-right-terminology-20161115-story.html|title='Cuck', 'snowflake,' 'masculinist': A guide to the language of the 'alt-right'|last=Roy|first=Jessica|date=2016-11-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] referenced the conspiracy theory as tiki torch-wielding protestors yelled "You will not replace us!" and "Jews will not replace us!"

The notion of racial purity, homogeneity or "[[racial hygiene]]" is an underlying theme of the white genocide discourse and it has been used by people with neo-Nazi and [[white supremacist]] backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Routledge2015 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waltman|first1=Michael|last2=Haas|first2=John|title=The Communication of Hate|date=2011|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|page=27|accessdate=10 August 2015|quote=Race categories are organized hierarchically to reflect differences that are inherent in the essence of these categories.

==Appearance in mainstream US politics==
Starting with the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]], there have been allegations that aspects of the conspiracy theory have been adopted as [[Dog-whistle politics|dog-whistling]] by some mainstream conservative political figures.

Iowa congressman [[Steve King]] has used rhetoric that [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] and [[Paste Magazine]] writers described as invoking the conspiracy theory, saying that "We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else's babies" and using the phrase "cultural suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-03|title=Steve King's district was built by "somebody else's babies"|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/steve-kings-iowa-immigrants/|newspaper=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-03|title=Steve King's White Nationalism is Echoed in the White House|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/03/steve-kings-white-nationalism-is-echoed-in-the-whi.html|newspaper=pastemagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vox (website)|Vox]] and [[The New Republic]] have described him as an adherent of the theory that immigration and other forms of population shift represent a slow genocide against white populations.&lt;ref name="VoxIdeology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-03|title=Steve King says racist things because he knows the GOP won't call him out on it.|url=https://newrepublic.com/minutes/141310/steve-king-says-racist-things-knows-gop-wont-call-it|newspaper=The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2018, US President [[Donald Trump]] brought the concept of "white genocide" in relation to [[South Africa]] significantly further into mainstream media discourse, after he publicly instructed Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] to investigate [[South African farm attacks]],&lt;ref name="The Washington Post" /&gt; an instruction which was broadly portrayed in media as the Trump and his administration advocating for an unfounded conspiracy theory.&lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ADL blasts"&gt;{{cite news|title=ADL blasts Trump for tweeting a white nationalist talking point |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/adl-blasts-trump-for-tweeting-a-white-nationalist-talking-point/ |work=[[The Times of Israel]]|date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite news|title=White Nationalists Praise Donald Trump for Spreading White South African Farmers Conspiracy Theory |url=https://www.newsweek.com/white-nationalists-trump-south-african-farmers-1087549 |work=[[Newsweek]]|date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolling stone"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump Is Using a White Nationalist Conspiracy Theory to Inform Policy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-south-africa-714744/ |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump had apparently gotten his information from a [[Tucker Carlson]] segment on [[Fox News]].&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-farmers-south-africa-conspiracy-theory_us_5b7f2d38e4b0729515115d9d|title=Trump Boosted A White Nationalist Conspiracy Theory He Saw On Fox News|last=Schulberg|first=Jessica|date=August 23, 2018|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine had claimed Trump was attempting to "change the conversation – to one about 'white genocide' in South Africa";&lt;ref name="NYmag" /&gt; ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' reported that the "President of the United States is now openly promoting an international racist conspiracy theory as the official [[foreign policy of the United States]]".&lt;ref name="Esq"&gt;{{cite news|title=No One Should Need a Tape of Him Using a Racial Slur |url=https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a22810662/donald-trump-south-africa-white-land-grabs-killings/ |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|]] |date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Southern Poverty Law Center|SPLC]], Trump had "tweeted out his intention to put the full force of the [[U.S. State Department]] behind a white nationalist conspiracy theory".&lt;ref name="stoking"&gt;{{cite news|title=President Trump is stoking white nationalism, exploiting racist fear |url=https://www.splcenter.org/news/2018/08/23/president-trump-stoking-white-nationalism-exploiting-racist-fear |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Causing "angry reaction in South Africa", many politicians and public figures responded critically to Trump.

In the U.S., former [[United States Ambassador to South Africa|US Ambassador]] to South Africa [[Patrick Gaspard]], and American media personalities [[Chris Cuomo]] and [[Al Sharpton]] spoke out against the US President on the issue.

[[Africa Check]], a [[fact-checking]] organisation, has rejected these claims as false: "In fact, whites are less likely to be murdered than any other race group."
