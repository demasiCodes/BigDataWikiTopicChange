The '''Guttmacher Institute''' is a research and policy [[NGO]] that aims to improve sexual health and expand reproductive rights worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/about| title= Guttmacher Institute About|access-date=2022-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emaoconnor/abortion-rights-decade-bans-trump-kavanaugh-planned|title=The Decade That Dismantled Abortion Rights|website=BuzzFeed News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-10|quote=... reproductive rights group Guttmacher Institute ... .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was started in 1968 and functions as both a research and educational organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bass|first=Hannah|date=2012-01-25|title=Guttmacher Institute|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e623|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=344|pages=e623|doi=10.1136/bmj.e623|issn=0959-8138|pmid=22279095|s2cid=5319414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benefunder.com/life-science-causes/guttmacher-institute/the-guttmacher-institute-the-scientific-backbone-of-the-reproductive-health-community|title=The Guttmacher Institute: The Scientific Backbone of the Reproductive Health Community {{!}} Benefunder|website=www.benefunder.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates mainly in the [[United States]] but also focuses on developing countries.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Founded as part of [[Planned Parenthood]], the Guttmacher Institute became independent from Planned Parenthood in 2007.

The institute is named after [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrician-gynecologist]] and former president of [[Planned Parenthood]] [[Alan Frank Guttmacher|Alan F. Guttmacher]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Guttmacher Institute|last=Valentine|first=Barbara|work=College &amp; Research Libraries News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guttmacher Institute has many sources of funding nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of its projects is keeping a running list of the reproductive health laws and policies throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The current CEO is [[Herminia Palacio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2019-06-24 |title=Herminia Palacio |url=https://www.guttmacher.org/about/staff/herminia-palacio |access-date=2022-06-21 |website=Guttmacher Institute |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1968, the Guttmacher Institute was originally called the Center for Family Planning Program Development and was a branch of [[Planned Parenthood]].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; After Alan Guttmacher's death, the Center for Family Planning Program Development was renamed and became an independent [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization.]]&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; In 2007, the organization officially split from Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Activities ==
The Guttmacher Institute continually monitors state and national laws and policies about contraception and abortion. The institute records  the restrictions on reproductive health that different states have put in place. The organization also keeps data about how teens are affected by pregnancy and the number of teens who use contraception.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Internationally, the Guttmacher Institute uses statistical models to give an approximation of the number of abortions in places where they are illegal and/or the abortions happen outside of formal health care settings.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In 2013, the Guttmacher Institute was awarded a Population Center grant by the US [[National Institutes of Health]] in support its Center for Population Research Innovation and Dissemination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Guttmacher Institute has received [[Charity Navigator]]'s highest (4-Star) rating annually since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3226#.V0N1h-IrJD8|title=Charity Navigator - Rating for Guttmacher Institute|website=Charity Navigator|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Funding ==

When the institute was founded in 1968 its parent organization, Planned Parenthood, was its sole source of its funding.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Three years after becoming independent in 2007, the organization received less than 1% of its funding from Planned Parenthood in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Now, most of the funding is gained through private foundations based in the United States. Other funding comes from international organizations such as the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The Guttmacher Institute was awarded $3.9 million between 1986 and 2015 by the [[MacArthur Foundation]], including 13 grants in population and reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Guttmacher Institute - MacArthur Foundation| access-date = 2020-05-15| url = https://www.macfound.org/grantees/356/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nonpartisanship ==
The Guttmacher Institute is not affiliated with a political party, and so it is nonpartisan in the strict sense of the word. The group work to "ensure that all women are able to exercise their [[reproductive rights]] and responsibilities", which puts them among advocates of abortion rights. According to ''[[FactCheck]]'', Guttmacher "provides the most highly respected statistics on the sexual health of women and men. Its figures on abortion are widely cited by the media as well as by groups on both sides of the political aisle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2010/04/factcheck-mailbag-week-of-april-6-april-12/|title=FactCheck Mailbag, Week of April 6-April 12 - FactCheck.org|date=2010-04-13|work=FactCheck.org|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
