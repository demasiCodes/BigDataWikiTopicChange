The '''Guttmacher Institute''' is a [[non-profit organization]] which works to advance [[reproductive health]] through [[birth control]], including [[abortion]]. The institute operates in the [[United States]] and globally "through an interrelated program of social science research, policy analysis, and public education".&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[http://www.guttmacher.org/about/mission.html "Mission: The Guttmacher Instituteâ€™s Future"] ''guttmacher.org'' Retrieved November 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phishare.org/partners/Guttmacher/ Population and Health InfoShare]&lt;/ref&gt; According to their mission statement, this program aims to "generate new ideas, encourage enlightened public debate, promote sound policy and program development and, ultimately, inform individual decision making".&lt;ref name="mission"/&gt;

The Institute was founded in 1968 as the '''Center for Family Planning Program Development''', a semi-autonomous division of the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]]. It was renamed in memory of [[Alan Frank Guttmacher]], an [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|Ob/Gyn]] and former president of Planned Parenthood. The Guttmacher Institute became an independent, non-profit corporation in 1977 under the direction of [[Frederick S. Jaffe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guttmacher.org/about/history.html The History of the Guttmacher Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The institute has offices in both [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] Its annual revenue in 2012 was over [[US$]]22 million, with expenses of $15.3 million and an asset reserve of over $36.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guttmacher.org/about/Guttmacher-Financials.pdf Guttmacher Institute, Inc.
