The '''Guttmacher Institute''' is a research and policy organization committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in the United States and globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/about|title=About|date=2015-11-20|website=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was founded as an arm of [[Planned Parenthood]], but now operates independently, though it has frequently received financial support from Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="relationship"&gt;[https://www.guttmacher.org/guttmacher-institute-faq#5 WHAT IS GUTTMACHER'S RELATIONSHIP WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was founded in 1968 as the Center for Family Planning Program Development, a semiautonomous division of the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]]. It was renamed in memory of [[Alan Frank Guttmacher]], an [[obstetrician-gynecologist]] and former president of Planned Parenthood. The Guttmacher Institute became an independent, non-profit corporation in 1977, under the direction of [[Frederick S. Jaffe]], but remained affiliated with Planned Parenthood until 2007.&lt;ref name="relationship"/&gt; According to the Guttmacher Institute, it has not received financial support from Planned Parenthood since 2013.&lt;ref name="relationship"/&gt;

== Activities ==
The Institute has offices in both New York City and Washington, D.C. Its annual revenue in 2014 was US$16 million, with expenses of $17.5 million and an asset reserve of $43.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/about/financials|title=Financials|date=2015-11-20|website=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute produces a wide range of resources on topics pertaining to SRHR, and also publishes two peer-reviewed journals, ''[[International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health]]'' and ''[[Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health]]'', and a public policy journal, the ''Guttmacher Policy Review''.

The Institute defines SRHR to encompass the rights of all individuals to make decisions concerning their sexual activity and reproduction, free from discrimination, coercion and violence. The Institute’s focus areas include contraception, unintended pregnancy, abortion, and adolescent sexual and reproductive health.

In 2013, it was awarded a Population Center grant by the US [[National Institutes of Health]] in support of the Guttmacher Center for Population Research Innovation and Dissemination.{{cn|date=July 2016}} The Guttmacher Institute has received [[Charity Navigator]]’s highest 4-star rating annually since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3226#.V0N1h-IrJD8|title=Charity Navigator - Rating for Guttmacher Institute|website=Charity Navigator|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 and 2013, the Institute was named the #1 organization in the field of reproductive health by Philanthropedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myphilanthropedia.org/top-nonprofits/national/reproductive-health-rights-justice/2010/guttmacher-institute|title=Guttmacher Institute|website=Philanthropedia|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
