==Grooming conspiracy theory==

{{LGBTQ sidebar|attitudes}}

Members of the far-right and a number of mainstream [[Conservatism|conservatives]], mostly in the United States, have used the term "groomer" to falsely accuse LGBTQ people, as well as their allies and progressives in general, of systematically using LGBTQ sex education and campaigns for LGBTQ rights as a method of [[child grooming]] and enabling [[pedophilia]]. Usage of this term increased in the 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Romano |first1=Aja |title=The right's moral panic over "grooming" invokes age-old homophobia |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/23025505/leftist-groomers-homophobia-satanic-panic-explained |access-date=19 April 2024 |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=21 April 2022 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the popularization of the term has been linked to [[Christopher Rufo]], who tweeted about "winning the language war", and [[James A.

Many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] legislators across the country are increasingly proposing legislation that would restrict gender-affirming care for adults or make such treatments harder to access. However, no states have succeeded at outright banning gender-affirming care for adults in a way similar to what is being done with minors. Efforts to restrict adults' access to healthcare relies heavily on claims from self-described "[[gender-critical]]" organizations such as [[Genspect]] that young people should not be recognized as adults until they turn 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Migdon |first=Brooke |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3810926-transgender-youth-health-care-bans-have-a-new-target-adults/ |title=Transgender youth health care bans have a new target: adults |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=January 13, 2023 |access-date=March 5, 2024 |archive-date=December 29, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231229011130/https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3810926-transgender-youth-health-care-bans-have-a-new-target-adults/ |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldman |first=Maya |url=https://www.axios.com/2024/01/10/trans-care-adults-red-states |title=States are limiting gender-affirming care for adults, too |website=[[Axios (website)|Axios]] |date=January 10, 2024 |access-date=February 5, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lang |first=Nico |url=https://www.them.us/story/trans-adults-next-target-gop-war-on-gender-affirming-health-care |title=Trans Adults Are the Next Target in the GOP's War on Gender-Affirming Health Care |website=[[Them (website)|them.us]] |date=February 16, 2024 |access-date=March 10, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2024, seven states limit access to gender-affirming care for adults in some way without banning it, such as allowing private health plans, Medicaid, and correctional facilities to exclude all coverage for gender-affirming care, prohibiting the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care or requiring informed consent practices beyond those typically required in medical practice.&lt;ref name="KFF-2024" /&gt;

As part of his [[Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign|2024 presidential campaign]], [[Donald Trump]] has stated that if elected, he will sign an executive order instructing every federal agency to cease the promotion of sex or gender transition at any age as well as ask Congress to pass a bill stating that the United States will only recognize two genders as determined at birth, and has promised to crackdown on gender-affirming care for all ages. Additionally, Trump stated that he would make hospitals and health care providers that provide transitional hormones or surgery no longer qualify for federal funding, including Medicare and Medicaid funding.

Six states have only partial bans and two are currently blocked from taking effect. While some states have banned all forms of medical transition, others such as Arizona, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Georgia have banned only specific types such as hormone therapy or surgery. Six states have exceptions which allow minors who were already receiving gender affirming care prior to the ban to continue their treatments.&lt;ref name="KFF-2024"/&gt; Currently, all 26 states make exceptions for puberty blockers, hormones and surgery for cisgender and intersex children.&lt;ref name="KFF-2024"/&gt; Only one state, West Virginia, makes exceptions in cases of "severe dysphoria". There is also currently only one state, Missouri, that has a ban which is set to expire after a certain period of time. Nearly all states with restrictions include specific provisions with penalties for providers and 4 states include provisions directed at parents or guardians.&lt;ref name="KFF-2024"/&gt; An additional 4 states include laws/policies that impact school officials such as teachers and counselors, among others.&lt;ref name="KFF-2024"/&gt;

At the same time, many Democrat-controlled states have gone in the opposite direction and enacted laws protecting access to gender affirming care for minors and adults. These laws, often called "shield" laws, often explicitly combine protections for gender-affirming care and abortion and cover a variety of protections including protecting both providers and patients from being punished, mandating insurance providers to cover the procedures and acting as "sanctuary states" that protect patients traveling to the state from other states that have banned such treatments among other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Panetta |first=Grace |title=Lawmakers in blue states are linking protections for abortion and gender-affirming care |url=https://19thnews.org/2023/06/abortion-trans-health-care-shield-laws/ |access-date=2024-01-01 |website=[[The 19th]] |date=June 9, 2023 |language=en-US |archive-date=February 5, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240205155546/https://19thnews.org/2023/06/abortion-trans-health-care-shield-laws/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2024, 16 states and the District of Columbia have enacted "shield" laws.

Conversely, around 146,700 transgender youth live in states that have passed gender-affirming care "shield" laws that support access to care by protecting doctors and parents who prescribe or seek access to medical care for youth.&lt;ref name="Williams Institute-2023"/&gt; An analysis from [[Kaiser Family Foundation|KFF]] in late January 2024 estimated that 38% of trans youth between the ages of 13–17 in the United States lived in states with laws limiting youth access to gender-affirming care.&lt;ref name="KFF-2024"/&gt;

Bans on gender-affirming care have been criticized as governments interfering with the patient-doctor relationship and taking away healthcare decisions from parents and families for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parents raise concerns as Florida bans gender-affirming care for trans kids|vauthors=Block M|website=[[NPR]]|url=https://www.npr.org/2023/02/20/1157493433/florida-bans-gender-affirming-care-trans-kids|access-date=11 June 2023|archive-date=11 June 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230611072637/https://www.npr.org/2023/02/20/1157493433/florida-bans-gender-affirming-care-trans-kids|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why GOP lawmakers want to stop doctors from prescribing gender-affirming care for Utah's youth |vauthors=Schott B |url=https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/01/18/why-gop-lawmakers-want-stop/ |access-date=2023-08-14 |website=The Salt Lake Tribune |language=en-US |archive-date=11 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230611072640/https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2023/01/18/why-gop-lawmakers-want-stop/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; State level bans on gender-affirming care in the United States have led some families with transgender children to move out of their states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=27 November 2022 |title=Conservative states are blocking trans medical care.

In an early example of an anti-trans bathroom bill, the [[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act]] in [[North Carolina]], was approved as a law in 2016. The bill, however, sparked widespread condemnation and threats of boycotts, and portions of the measure were repealed in 2017 as part of a compromise between the Democratic governor and Republican-controlled Legislature. Also in 2016, guidance was issued by the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education stating that schools which receive federal money must treat a student's gender identity as their sex (for example, in regard to bathrooms).&lt;ref name="Terkel-2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-transgender_n_58ac4fe8e4b0a855d1d9d278 |title=Trump Administration Rescinds Protections For Transgender Students |work=[[HuffPost]] |first=Amanda |last=Terkel |date=February 22, 2017 |access-date=January 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120155803/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-transgender_us_58ac4fe8e4b0a855d1d9d278 |archive-date=January 20, 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was revoked in 2017.&lt;ref name="Terkel-2017" /&gt;

A number of the bills put forth and passed made it some form of criminal offense, often a [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offense]], for a transgender person to use a bathroom, locker room, changing room, or other similar facility not corresponding with their assigned sex. The most severe of these was that of Arkansas, which made it an offense of "sexual indecency with a child" for a trans person to use any such facility if said facility contained anyone under 18 at the time of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite act|type=Senate Bill|index=270|date=2023|legislature=Arkansas State Legislature|url=https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2023R%2FPublic%2FSB270.pdf|archive-date=April 5, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405005417/https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2023R%2FPublic%2FSB270.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Shapero |first=Julia |date=2023-05-04 |title=Florida passes transgender bathroom bill |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3987176-florida-passes-transgender-bathroom-bill/ |access-date=2023-05-04 |website=The Hill |language=en-US |archive-date=May 16, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230516150350/https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3987176-florida-passes-transgender-bathroom-bill/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such bans is that passed by Florida in March 2022, which created a list of sanctioned reading material for students in educational settings, and punished any teacher or school librarian whose classrooms or libraries contained unsanctioned books with felony charges. Sanctioned books must be reviewed by the state to be free of "prohibited material harmful to minors", which critics have said that under Florida state law includes content regarding the LGBTQ community and black history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=January 27, 2023|last1=Hall|first1=Richard|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ron-desantis-book-bans-florida-b2270116.html|title='I've never seen anything like it': Florida teachers strip classroom shelves of books in response to DeSantis ban|access-date=July 14, 2023|archive-date=June 1, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230601083444/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ron-desantis-book-bans-florida-b2270116.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 2022 [[Pew Research Center|Pew Research Poll]] found that most Americans were uncomfortable with the speed of change on issues related to transgender people, with young adults and Democrats being the most supportive of transgender issues and Republicans and people in the 55-64 years age group being the least supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=June 28, 2022 |title=Americans' Complex Views on Gender Identity and Transgender Issues |work=Pew Research Center |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/06/28/americans-complex-views-on-gender-identity-and-transgender-issues/ |access-date=November 25, 2024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians are dealing with a real danger that needs to be addressed."

==Election campaigning and results==
===2024 presidential election===
During the [[2024 United States presidential election|2024 presidential election]], anti-trans advertisements became commonplace, with the Republican party making trans issues a top issue in their campaign, spending over $215 million dollars on anti-trans ads and more than on ads regarding housing, immigration, and the economy combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=November 5, 2024 |title=Republicans Spent Nearly $215M on TV Ads Attacking Trans Rights This Election |url=https://truthout.org/articles/republicans-spent-nearly-215m-on-tv-ads-attacking-trans-rights-this-election/ |access-date=2024-11-10 |website=[[Truthout]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, Democrats largely avoided discussing transgender issues during the election campaign period.&lt;ref name="NBCNews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=October 25, 2024 |title=Even if Harris isn't talking about gender, everyone else is |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-talking-gender-election-rcna177139 |access-date=2024-11-10 |website=NBC News |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=October 15, 2024 |title=The Harris Campaign Has Offered Trans People Almost Nothing |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kamala-harris-trans-rights-platform/ |access-date=2024-11-10 |website=[[The Nation]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ads became especially common during the closing days of the race, often pushing disparaging claims about transgender healthcare, existence in society, and participation in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |title=Trump and allies are pouring millions into anti-trans election ads as election nears |url=https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/trump-spends-millions-anti-trans-ads-despite-polls/story?id=115001816 |access-date=2024-10-30 |work=[[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=2024-10-24 |title=Republicans have bet big on anti-trans ads.

Jay Brown, chief of staff at the Human Rights Campaign said that the ads have had a negative impact on the mental health of trans people due to it being "in their faces all the time." [[LGBTQ Nation]] called the ads "wildly unpopular" among voters and said "there is a solid chance that the fate of transgender rights could mirror that of gay rights, becoming a sport of "political albatross" that instantly kills support for candidates.

In 2022, Connecticut became the first state to implement such a law, alongside similar protections for reproductive healthcare providers and recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite act |type=House Bill |index=5506 |date=May 24, 2022 |article=Sec 484, 485, 486, 487, 488 |article-type=Section |legislature=The Connecticut General Assembly |page=681-686 |url=https://legiscan.com/CT/text/HB05506/2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220812193552/https://legiscan.com/CT/text/HB05506/2022 |archive-date=August 12, 2022}}; {{Cite web |url=https://legiscan.com/CT/text/HB05506/2022 |title=Connecticut HB05506 &amp;#124; 2022 &amp;#124; General Assembly |access-date=July 16, 2023 |archive-date=April 6, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406171533/https://legiscan.com/CT/text/HB05506/2022 |url-status=bot: unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. have passed similar laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Migdon |first=Brooke |date=June 8, 2023 |title=Maryland governor signs executive order protecting access to gender-affirming care |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4040993-maryland-governor-signs-executive-order-protecting-access-to-gender-affirming-care/ |access-date=June 9, 2023 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |language=en-US |archive-date=June 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230614205309/https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4040993-maryland-governor-signs-executive-order-protecting-access-to-gender-affirming-care/ |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some trans Americans have considered [[Transgender asylum seekers|claiming asylum]] in other countries, including European countries or Canada. However, some political analysts note that asylum applications will likely be denied, as no federal law exists restricting LGBT safety and because transgender individuals can likely move to a safer state in their own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Zoledziowski |first=Anya |date=January 10, 2023 |title=Some Trans People Are Preparing to Flee the US and Seek Asylum Abroad |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7qnj/trans-people-fleeing-us-seek-asylum |access-date=July 22, 2023 |website=[[Vice Media]] |language=en |archive-date=July 22, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230722192032/https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy7qnj/trans-people-fleeing-us-seek-asylum |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Hagen |first=Isobel van |title=Transphobia is on the rise in the US.

====Self-defense====
The increased targeting of LGBT people by right-wing militia groups such as the [[Proud Boys]] and the [[Oath Keepers]], has led some LGBT people, particularly in conservative states such as Texas, to stockpile and train to use weapons and gear, including [[AR-15 rifle]]s and modern body armor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-in-texas-members-of-lgbtq-community-arm-themselves-to-fight-right-wing/ |title=In Texas, members of LGBTQ community arm themselves to fight right-wing extremists |last=Vanderklippe |first=Nathan |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=November 27, 2022 |access-date=July 18, 2023 |archive-date=June 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230603054221/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-in-texas-members-of-lgbtq-community-arm-themselves-to-fight-right-wing/ |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Travel warnings====
In May 2023, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] issued a [[travel warning|travel advisory]] for the state of [[Florida]], citing new laws targeting the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Migdon |first1=Brooke |title=Human Rights Campaign issues Florida travel advisory |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/4017783-human-rights-campaign-issues-florida-travel-advisory/ |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=May 23, 2023 |access-date=8 September 2023 |archive-date=September 15, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230915030305/https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/4017783-human-rights-campaign-issues-florida-travel-advisory/ |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a ten-day tour in which he met with State officials in Alabama, Florida, and California in August 2022, [[Victor Madrigal-Borloz]], a [[United Nations special rapporteur|United Nations Independent Expert]] on protection against violence and discrimination, warned about the erosion of LGBT rights in the United States.&lt;ref name="UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner"&gt;{{cite web |title=United States: UN expert warns LGBT rights being eroded, urges stronger safeguards |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/08/united-states-un-expert-warns-lgbt-rights-being-eroded-urges-stronger |website=UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner |publisher=[[United Nations]] |access-date=June 15, 2023 |archive-date=October 11, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221011182808/http://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/08/united-states-un-expert-warns-lgbt-rights-being-eroded-urges-stronger |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madrigal-Borloz stated, "I am deeply alarmed by a widespread, profoundly negative riptide created by deliberate actions to roll back the human rights of LGBT people at state level. The evidence shows that, without exception, these actions rely on prejudiced and stigmatising views of LGBT persons, in particular transgender children and youth, and seek to leverage their lives as props for political profit."&lt;ref name="UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner"/&gt;

In August 2023, the [[Government of Canada]] issued a [[travel warning]] for LGBT visitors to the United States, advising citizens to check their destination's local laws before traveling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gillies |first1=Rob |title=Canada issues travel advisory warning LGBTQ+ community about U.S. laws that may affect them |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/canada-issues-travel-advisory-warning-lgbtq-community-about-u-s-laws-that-may-affect-them |work=[[PBS NewsHour]]  |date=August 31, 2023 |access-date=8 September 2023 |archive-date=September 8, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230908180406/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/canada-issues-travel-advisory-warning-lgbtq-community-about-u-s-laws-that-may-affect-them |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Austen |first1=Ian |title=Canada Cautions L.G.B.T.Q.
