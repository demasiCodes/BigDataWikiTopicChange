==Grooming conspiracy theory==
{{main|LGBT grooming conspiracy theory}}{{LGBT sidebar|history}}

Members of the far-right and a number of mainstream [[Conservatism|conservatives]], mostly in the United States, have used the term "groomer" to falsely accuse LGBT people, as well as their allies and progressives in general, of systematically using LGBT sex education and campaigns for LGBT rights as a method of [[child grooming]] and enabling [[pedophilia]]. Usage of this term increased in the 2020s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

In the United States, the popularization of the term has been linked to [[Christopher Rufo]], who tweeted about "winning the language war", and [[James A. Lindsay]] in August 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/05/qanon-groomer-hawley-desantis-jackson/ |title=The QAnon catchphrases that took over the Jackson hearings |date=April 7, 2022 |orig-date=April 5, 2022 |author1=Donald Moynihan |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |place=Washington, D.C. |issn=0190-8286 |oclc=1330888409 |access-date=May 24, 2023 |archive-date=April 10, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230410145445/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/04/05/qanon-groomer-hawley-desantis-jackson/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date= April 27, 2022 |title= How the Intellectual Dark Web Spawned 'Groomer' Panic |work= The Daily Beast |url= https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-intellectual-dark-web-spawned-anti-lgbtq-groomer-panic |access-date= May 16, 2022 |archive-date= May 16, 2022 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20220516083524/https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-intellectual-dark-web-spawned-anti-lgbtq-groomer-panic |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Wi Spa controversy]]&amp;nbsp;in July 2021, [[Julia Serano]] noted a rise in false accusations of grooming directed towards transgender people, saying that it appeared as if there was a movement to "lay the foundation for just smearing all trans people as child sexual predators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/28/anti-trans-video-los-angeles-protest-wi-spa | title='A nightmare scenario': How an anti-trans Instagram post led to violence in the streets | website=[[TheGuardian.com]] | date=July 28, 2021 | access-date=May 24, 2023 | archive-date=January 4, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220104121718/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/28/anti-trans-video-los-angeles-protest-wi-spa | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libs of TikTok]] (LoTT) also slurs LGBT people, supporters of LGBT youth,&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stahl |first1=Jeremy |title=The Hate-Fueled and Hugely Influential World of Libs of TikTok |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/chaya-raichik-libs-tiktok-groomer-tweets.html |website=Slate Magazine |access-date=July 27, 2022 |language=en |date=April 27, 2022 |archive-date=July 27, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220727081413/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/chaya-raichik-libs-tiktok-groomer-tweets.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Persaud |first1=Chris |title=Babylon Bee CEO of Juno Beach backs Twitter firebrand who calls LGBTQ people pedophiles |url=https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/2022/05/10/babylon-bee-ceo-juno-beach-backs-libs-tiktok-creator/7385009001/ |website=The Palm Beach Post |access-date=July 27, 2022 |archive-date=May 16, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220516050225/https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/2022/05/10/babylon-bee-ceo-juno-beach-backs-libs-tiktok-creator/7385009001/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and those who teach about sexuality as "groomers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Twitter activist behind the far-right 'Libs of TikTok' is an Orthodox Jew.

The conspiracy theory then moved into the American conservative mainstream, with a number of high-profile cases of its use in Spring 2022, including its use by members of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name= Vox&gt;{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Aja |title=The right's moral panic over "grooming" invokes age-old homophobia |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/23025505/leftist-groomers-homophobia-satanic-panic-explained |website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |date=April 21, 2022 |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |access-date=July 28, 2022 |archive-date=May 17, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230517125930/https://www.vox.com/culture/23025505/leftist-groomers-homophobia-satanic-panic-explained |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, the right-wing [[The Heritage Foundation]] issued a tweet stating that the [[Florida Parental Rights in Education Act]] "protects young children from sexual grooming".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/christina-pushaw-ron-desantis-libsoftiktok-groomer.html |title=How One Florida Woman With Twitter Problems Plunged Us Into a Nightmarish National Conversation About "Grooming" |last1=Mathis-Lilley |first1=Ben |date=April 21, 2022 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |access-date=May 24, 2023 |archive-date=May 28, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230528043711/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/christina-pushaw-ron-desantis-libsoftiktok-groomer.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the debate over the act, [[Christina Pushaw]], press secretary to the state's governor [[Ron DeSantis]], tweeted that anyone who opposes the act was "probably a groomer". In April 2022, [[Marjorie Taylor Greene]] referred to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as "the party of killing babies, grooming and transitioning children, and pro-pedophile politics". Also that month, a group of [[Radical right (United States)|far-right]] extremists and conspiracy theorists held a demonstration at [[Disney World]] in which they accused Disney of grooming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Alfonseca |first1=Kiara |title=Some Republicans use false 'pedophilia' claims to attack Democrats, LGBTQ people |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/republicans-false-pedophilia-claims-attack-democrats-lgbtq-people/story?id=84344687 |website=abcnews.go.com |publisher=ABC News |access-date=July 28, 2022 |archive-date=February 13, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230213101039/https://abcnews.go.com/US/republicans-false-pedophilia-claims-attack-democrats-lgbtq-people/story?id=84344687 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney has been the focus of several other uses of the conspiracy – [[Jim Banks]] and 19 other members of the [[Republican Study Committee]] published a letter to Disney accusing the corporation of "purposefully influencing small children with its political and sexual agenda".&lt;ref name="Brooks April2022"/&gt;

Since then, numerous right wing pundits have described the behavior of parents and teachers who support minors in their transgender identities as grooming, and the term "groomer" has widely been used by conservative media and politicians who want to denounce the LGBT community and its allies by implying that they are pedophiles or pedophile-enablers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/culture/23025505/leftist-groomers-homophobia-satanic-panic-explained |title=The right's moral panic over 'grooming' invokes age-old homophobia |last1=Romano |first1=Aja |date=April 21, 2022 |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |access-date=May 24, 2023 |archive-date=April 25, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230425100822/https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/culture/23025505/leftist-groomers-homophobia-satanic-panic-explained |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/g5q9vx/child-grooming-lgbtq-smear |title=Conservatives Are Smearing 'Don't Say Gay' Opponents as Pedophile 'Groomers' |last1=Cameron |first1=Joseph |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=April 5, 2022 |access-date=May 24, 2023 |archive-date=January 8, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230108090000/https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/g5q9vx/child-grooming-lgbtq-smear |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate Magazine]]'' later described the word "grooming" as "the buzzword of the season".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/christina-pushaw-ron-desantis-libsoftiktok-groomer.html |title=How One Florida Woman With Twitter Problems Plunged Us Into a Nightmarish National Conversation About "Grooming" |last1=Mathis-Lilley |first1=Ben |date=April 21, 2022 |work=[[Slate Magazine]] |access-date=May 24, 2023 |archive-date=May 28, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230528043711/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/04/christina-pushaw-ron-desantis-libsoftiktok-groomer.html |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2022, Fox News host [[Laura Ingraham]] claimed that schools were becoming "grooming centers for gender identity radicals", dedicating an entire segment of her show to the topic a couple of weeks later.&lt;ref name="Brooks April2022"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3262988-groomer-debate-inflames-gop-fight-over-florida-law/ | title='Groomer' debate inflames GOP fight over Florida law | date=April 8, 2022 | work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | access-date=May 24, 2023 | archive-date=April 1, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230401050441/https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3262988-groomer-debate-inflames-gop-fight-over-florida-law/ | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2022, the left-leaning media watchdog [[Media Matters]] published a study stating that within a three-week period spanning from March 17 to April 6, [[Fox News]] ran 170 segments on trans people, throughout which the network "repeatedly invoked the long-debunked myth that trans people pose a threat to minors and seek to groom them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/doom-groom-fox-news-has-aired-170-segments-discussing-trans-people-past-three-weeks |title="Doom &amp; Groom": Fox News has aired 170 segments discussing trans people in the past three weeks |last1=Paterson |first1=Alex |website=[[Media Matters for America]] |date=April 8, 2022 |access-date=May 24, 2023 |archive-date=June 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230601182823/https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/doom-groom-fox-news-has-aired-170-segments-discussing-trans-people-past-three-weeks |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an early example of an anti-trans bathroom bill, the [[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act]] in [[North Carolina]], was approved as a law in 2016. The bill, however, sparked widespread condemnation and threats of boycotts, and portions of the measure were repealed in 2017 as part of a compromise between the Democratic governor and Republican-controlled Legislature. Also in 2016, guidance was issued by the U.S. Departments of Justice and Education stating that schools which receive federal money must treat a student's gender identity as their sex (for example, in regard to bathrooms).&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-transgender_us_58ac4fe8e4b0a855d1d9d278 |title=Trump Administration Rescinds Protections For Transgender Students &amp;#124; HuffPost |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=February 22, 2017 |access-date=January 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120155803/https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-transgender_us_58ac4fe8e4b0a855d1d9d278 |archive-date=January 20, 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was revoked in 2017.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost2" /&gt;

A number of the bills put forth and passed made it some form of criminal offense, often a [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offense]], for a transgender person to use a bathroom, locker room, changing room, or other similar facility not corresponding with their assigned sex. The most severe of these was that of Arkansas, which made it an offense of "sexual indecency with a child" for a trans person to use any such facility if said facility contained anyone under 18 at the time of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite act|type=Senate Bill|index=270|date=2023|legislature=Arkansas State Legislature|url=https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/FTPDocument?path=%2FBills%2F2023R%2FPublic%2FSB270.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Shapero |first=Julia |date=2023-05-04 |title=Florida passes transgender bathroom bill |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3987176-florida-passes-transgender-bathroom-bill/ |access-date=2023-05-04 |website=The Hill |language=en-US |archive-date=May 16, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230516150350/https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3987176-florida-passes-transgender-bathroom-bill/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such bans is that passed by Florida in March 2022, which created a list of sanctioned reading material for students in educational settings, and punished any teacher or school librarian whose classrooms or libraries contained unsanctioned books with felony charges. Sanctioned books must be reviewed by the state to be free of "prohibited material harmful to minors", which critics have said that under Florida state law includes content regarding the LGBT community and black history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=January 27, 2023|last1=Hall|first1=Richard|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ron-desantis-book-bans-florida-b2270116.html|title='I've never seen anything like it': Florida teachers strip classroom shelves of books in response to DeSantis ban|access-date=July 14, 2023|archive-date=June 1, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230601083444/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ron-desantis-book-bans-florida-b2270116.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-defense====
The increased targeting of LGBT people by right-wing militia groups such as the [[Proud Boys]] and the [[Oath Keepers]], led many LGBT people, particularly in conservative states such as Texas, to stockpile weapons and gear, including AR-15 rifles and modern body armor, while training to use them, often in groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-in-texas-members-of-lgbtq-community-arm-themselves-to-fight-right-wing/ |title=In Texas, members of LGBTQ community arm themselves to fight right-wing extremists |last=Vanderklippe |first=Nathan |work=The Globe and Mail |date=November 27, 2022 |access-date=July 18, 2023 |archive-date=June 3, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230603054221/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-in-texas-members-of-lgbtq-community-arm-themselves-to-fight-right-wing/ |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Travel warnings====
In May 2023, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] issued a [[travel warning|travel advisory]] for the state of [[Florida]], citing new laws targeting the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Migdon |first1=Brooke |title=Human Rights Campaign issues Florida travel advisory |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/4017783-human-rights-campaign-issues-florida-travel-advisory/ |website=The Hill |date=May 23, 2023 |access-date=8 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International ===
After a ten-day tour in which he met with State officials in Alabama, Florida, and California in August 2022, [[Victor Madrigal-Borloz]], a [[United Nations special rapporteur|United Nations Independent Expert]] on protection against violence and discrimination, warned about the erosion of LGBT rights in the United States.&lt;ref name="UN expert"&gt;{{cite web |title=United States: UN expert warns LGBT rights being eroded, urges stronger safeguards |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/08/united-states-un-expert-warns-lgbt-rights-being-eroded-urges-stronger |website=UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner |publisher=United Nations |access-date=June 15, 2023 |archive-date=October 11, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221011182808/http://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/08/united-states-un-expert-warns-lgbt-rights-being-eroded-urges-stronger |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Madrigal-Borloz stated, "I am deeply alarmed by a widespread, profoundly negative riptide created by deliberate actions to roll back the human rights of LGBT people at state level. The evidence shows that, without exception, these actions rely on prejudiced and stigmatising views of LGBT persons, in particular transgender children and youth, and seek to leverage their lives as props for political profit."&lt;ref name="UN expert"/&gt;

In August 2023, the [[Government of Canada]] issued a [[travel warning]] for LGBT visitors to the United States, advising citizens to check their destination's local laws before traveling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gillies |first1=Rob |title=Canada issues travel advisory warning LGBTQ+ community about U.S. laws that may affect them |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/canada-issues-travel-advisory-warning-lgbtq-community-about-u-s-laws-that-may-affect-them |website=PBS |date=August 31, 2023 |access-date=8 September 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Austen |first1=Ian |title=Canada Cautions L.G.B.T.Q.
