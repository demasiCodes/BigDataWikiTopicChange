Commentators on the left have said that conservatives pushed the term in order to divert attention from more substantive matters of discrimination and as part of a broader [[culture war]] against [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Messer–Davidow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton"/&gt; They also argue that conservatives have their own forms of political correctness, which are generally ignored by conservative commenters.&lt;ref name="WilsonConservativeCorrectness"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DonWilliams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krugman"/&gt;

==History==
The term "politically correct" was used infrequently until the latter part of the 20th century. This earlier use did not communicate the social disapproval usually implied in more recent usage. In 1793, the term "politically correct" appeared in a [[U.S. Supreme Court]] judgment of a political lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;In the 18th century, the term "politically correct" occurs in the case of ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'', 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793). Associate Justice [[James Wilson]], of the U.S. Supreme Court comments: "The states, rather than the People, for whose sakes the States exist, are frequently the objects which attract and arrest our principal attention... Sentiments and expressions of this inaccurate kind prevail in our common, even in our convivial, language. Is a toast asked? 'The United States', instead of the 'People of the United States', is the toast given. This is not politically correct." [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=2&amp;page=419 ''Chisholm v. Georgia'', 2 US 419 (1793)] ''Findlaw.com'' – Accessed 6 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The term also had occasional use in other [[Anglosphere|English-speaking countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://newspaperarchive.com/uk/middlesex/london/courier/1804/08-18/page-2?tag=politically+correct&amp;rtserp=tags/?pep=politically-correct&amp;psb=dateasc|title = (London) Courier|last = 18 August 1804|first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = |page = 2|quote = "In your paper on Monday [...] you offered some observations to your readers which were evidently well-meant though they were not politically correct"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Australian Mail And New Zealand Express|url = http://newspaperarchive.com/uk/middlesex/london/australian-mail-and-new-zealand-express/1861/06-15|website = newspaperarchive.com|date = 15 June 1861|accessdate = 29 November 2015|quote = For to call it " a new colony " is only politically correct – the stress should be laid on the word "colony".}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Safire]] states that the first recorded use of the term in the typical modern sense is by [[Toni Cade Bambara]] in the 1970 [[anthology]] ''The Black Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Safire|first1=William|authorlink=William Safire|title=Safire's political dictionary|date=2008|publisher=Oxford Univ.

===Early-to-mid 20th century===
In the early-to-mid 20th century, the phrase "politically correct" was associated with the [[Dogmatism|dogmatic]] application of [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] doctrine, debated between [[Communism|Communist]] Party members and American [[Socialism|Socialists]]. This usage referred to the Communist [[Party line (politics)|party line]], which provided "correct" positions on many political matters. According to American educator [[Herbert Kohl (educator)|Herbert Kohl]], writing about debates in New York in the late 1940s and early 1950s,

{{Quote|The term "politically correct" was used disparagingly, to refer to someone whose loyalty to the CP line overrode compassion, and led to bad politics. It was used by Socialists against Communists, and was meant to separate out Socialists who believed in egalitarian moral ideas from dogmatic Communists who would advocate and defend party positions regardless of their moral substance.|"Uncommon Differences"|The Lion and the Unicorn Journal&lt;ref name=Kohl/&gt;}}

In March 1968, the French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] is quoted as saying: "a political thought can be politically correct ('politiquement correcte') only if it is scientifically painstaking", referring to leftist intellectuals attempting to make Marxism scientifically rigorous rather than relying on orthodoxy.&lt;ref name=FOUCAULT&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foucault|first1=Michel|title=Foucault répond à Sartre|journal=La Quinzaine littéraire|date=March 1968|issue=46|url=http://1libertaire.free.fr/MFoucault419.html|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
In the 1970s, the American [[New Left]] began using the term "politically correct".&lt;ref name="Perry-1992a"&gt;Ruth Perry, (1992), "A Short History of the Term 'Politically Correct'", in ''Beyond PC: Toward a Politics of Understanding'', by Patricia Aufderheide, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay ''The Black Woman: An Anthology'' (1970), Toni Cade Bambara said that "a man cannot be politically correct and a [[Chauvinism#Male chauvinism|[male] chauvinist]], too." Thereafter, the term was often used as self-critical [[satire]]. Debra L. Shultz said that "throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the New Left, [[Feminism|feminists]], and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]]... used their term 'politically correct' ironically, as a guard against their own orthodoxy in social change efforts."&lt;ref name="Schultz-1993a"&gt;{{cite web |first=Debra L. |last=Schultz |year=1993 |title=To Reclaim a Legacy of Diversity: Analyzing the 'Political Correctness' Debates in Higher Education |work= New York: National Council for Research on Women |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED364170.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry-1992a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schultz citing Perry (1992) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; As such, PC is a popular usage in the comic book ''Merton of the Movement'', by [[Bobby London]], which then was followed by the term ''ideologically sound'', in the comic strips of [[Bart Dickon]].&lt;ref name="Perry-1992a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3027/a_politically_correct_lexicon/ |title=A Politically Correct Lexicon |journal=In These Times |author=Joel Bleifuss |date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay "Toward a feminist Revolution" (1992) [[Ellen Willis]] said: "In the early eighties, when feminists used the term 'political correctness', it was used to refer sarcastically to the [[anti-pornography movement]]'s efforts to define a 'feminist sexuality'."&lt;ref name="willis"&gt;Ellen Willis, "Toward a Feminist Revolution", in ''No More Nice Girls: Countercultural Essays'' (1992) Wesleyan University Press, ISBN 0-8195-5250-X, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] suggests one way in which the original use of the term may have developed into the modern one:
{{quote|According to one version, political correctness actually began as an in-joke on the left: radical students on American campuses acting out an ironic replay of the Bad Old Days BS (Before the Sixties) when every revolutionary groupuscule had a party line about everything. They would address some glaring examples of sexist or racist behaviour by their fellow students in imitation of the tone of voice of the Red Guards or Cultural Revolution Commissar: "Not very 'politically correct', Comrade!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stuart |last=Hall |authorlink=Stuart Hall (cultural theorist) |year= 1994 |url=http://www.ram-wan.net/restrepo/hall/some%20politically%20incorrect%20pathways.pdf |format=PDf |title=Some 'Politically Incorrect' Pathways Through PC |work= S.

An October 1990 [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] article by [[Richard Bernstein]] is credited with popularizing the term.&lt;ref name=Berman1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crossroads&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valdes|first1=edited by Francisco|last2=Culp|first2=Jerome McCristal|last3=Harris|first3=Angela P.|title=Crossroads, directions, and a new critical race theory|date=2002|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1566399300|pages=59, 65|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dCedxQu542UC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Browne&gt;Anthony Browne (2006).

After 1991, its use as a pejorative phrase became widespread amongst conservatives in the US.&lt;ref name="Charles-Wartella"/&gt; It became a key term encapsulating conservative concerns about the left in culture and political debate more broadly, as well as in academia. Two articles on the topic in late 1990 in ''[[Forbes]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' both used the term "[[thought police]]" in their headlines, exemplifying the tone of the new usage, but it was Dinesh D'Souza's ''Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus'' (1991) which "captured the press's imagination."&lt;ref name="Charles-Wartella"/&gt;{{clarify | date = October 2015 | reason = The source also mentions Bloom and the NYT article, so why is D'Souza being singled out?}} Similar critical terminology was used by D'Souza for a range of policies in academia around victimization, supporting multiculturalism through affirmative action, sanctions against anti-minority [[hate speech]], and revising curricula (sometimes referred to as "canon busting").&lt;ref name="Charles-Wartella"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''The New York Times'' newspaper article "The Rising Hegemony of the Politically Correct", the reporter [[Richard Bernstein]] said that: {{Quote|The term "politically correct", with its suggestion of Stalinist orthodoxy, is spoken more with irony and disapproval than with reverence.

[[Herbert Kohl (educator)|Herbert Kohl]], in 1992, commented that a number of [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] who promoted the use of the term "politically correct" in the early 1990s were former [[Communist Party]] members, and, as a result, familiar with the [[Marxist]] use of the phrase. He argued that in doing so, they intended "to insinuate that egalitarian democratic ideas are actually authoritarian, orthodox and Communist-influenced, when they oppose the right of people to be racist, sexist, and homophobic."&lt;ref name="Kohl"/&gt;

During the 1990s, conservative and [[Right wing|right-wing]] politicians, think-tanks, and speakers adopted the phrase as a pejorative descriptor of their ideological enemies – especially in the context of the [[Culture War]]s about [[American English|language]] and the content of public-school curricula. [[Roger Kimball]], in ''Tenured Radicals'', endorsed [[Frederick Crews|Frederick Crews's]] view that PC is best described as "Left Eclecticism", a term defined by Kimball as "any of a wide variety of anti-establishment modes of thought from structuralism and poststructuralism, deconstruction, and Lacanian analyst to feminist, homosexual, black, and other patently political forms of criticism."&lt;ref name=Kimball/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt; [[Jan Narveson]] wrote that "that phrase was born to live between scare-quotes: it suggests that the operative considerations in the area so called are ''merely'' political, steamrolling the genuine reasons of principle for which we ought to be acting..."&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;

In the [[American Speech]] journal article "Cultural Sensitivity and Political Correctness: The Linguistic Problem of Naming" (1996), Edna Andrews said that the usage of culturally inclusive and gender-neutral language is based upon the concept that "language represents thought, and may even control thought".&lt;ref name="cs"&gt;Cultural Sensitivity and Political Correctness: The Linguistic Problem of Naming, Edna Andrews, ''American Speech'', Vol. 71, No. 4 (Winter, 1996), pp. 389–404.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews' proposition is conceptually derived from the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis|Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis]], which proposes that the grammatical categories of a language shape the ideas, thoughts, and actions of the speaker. Moreover, Andrews said that politically moderate conceptions of the language–thought relationship suffice to support the "reasonable deduction ... [of] cultural change via linguistic change" reported in the ''Sex Roles'' journal article "Development and Validation of an Instrument to Measure Attitudes Toward Sexist/Nonsexist Language" (2000), by Janet B. Parks and Mary Ann Robinson.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

[[Modern liberalism in the United States|Liberal]] commentators have argued that the conservatives and reactionaries who used the term did so in effort to divert political discussion away from the substantive matters of resolving societal discrimination – such as [[racism|racial]], [[social class]], [[gender]], and legal inequality – against people whom the right-wing do not consider part of the social mainstream.&lt;ref name="Schultz-1993a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Messer–Davidow"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Messer-Davidow |first=Ellen |date=1995 |title=Manufacturing the Attack on Liberalized Higher Education: The Humanities and Society in the 1990s }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lauter"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lauter |first=Paul |date=1993 |title='Political Correctness' and the Attack on American Colleges }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stimpson"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Catharine R. |last=Stimpson |title=New 'Politically Correct' Metaphors Insult History and Our Campuses. |date=29 May 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Axtell"&gt;{{cite book |first=Axtell |last=James |title=The Pleasures of Academe: A Celebration &amp; Defense of Higher Education |date=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scatamburlo"&gt;{{cite book |title=Soldiers of Misfortune: The New Right's Culture War and the Politics of Political Correctness |first=Valerie L. |last=Scatamburlo |date=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glassner"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid of the Wrong Things: Crime, Drugs, Minorities, Teen Moms, Killer Kids, Mutant Microbes, Plane Crashes, Road Rage, &amp; So Much More |first=Barry |last=Glassner |date=5 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commenting in 2001, one such British journalist,&lt;ref name="Tomlinson, Race And Education: Policy And Politics In Britain, p. 161."&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Sally|title=Race and education : policy and politics in Britain|date=2008|publisher=Open Univ.

===Media===
{{See also|Media bias}}
In the US, the term has been widely used in the intellectual media, but in Britain, usage has been confined mainly to the popular press.&lt;ref name=Lea&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lea|first1=John|title=Political Correctness and Higher Education: British and American Perspectives|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1135895880|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pKmTAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many such authors and popular-media figures, particularly on the right, have used the term to criticize what they see as bias in the media.&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; William McGowan argues that journalists get stories wrong or ignore stories worthy of coverage, because of what McGowan perceives to be their liberal ideologies and their fear of offending minority groups.&lt;ref name=McGowan&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGowan|first1=William|title=Coloring the news : how political correctness has corrupted American journalism|date=2003|publisher=Encounter Books|location=San Francisco, Calif.|isbn=1893554600|edition=[New postscript].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Novak, in his essay "Political Correctness Has No Place in the Newsroom", used the term to blame newspapers for adopting language use policies that he thinks tend to excessively avoid the appearance of bias.

Jessica Pinta and Joy Yakubu caution against political incorrectness in media and other uses, writing in the Journal of Educational and Social Research: "...linguistic constructs influence our way of thinking negatively, peaceful coexistence is threatened and social stability is jeopardized." What may result, they add as example "the effect of political incorrect use of language" in some historical occurrences:
{{quote|Conflicts were recorded in Northern Nigeria as a result of insensitive use of language. In Kaduna for instance violence broke out on the 16th November 2002 following an article credited to one Daniel Isioma which was published in “This Day” Newspaper, where the writer carelessly made a remark about the Prophet Mohammed and the beauty queens of the Miss World Beauty Pageant that was to be hosted in the Country that year (Terwase n.d). In this crisis, He reported that over 250 people were killed and churches destroyed. In the same vein, crisis erupted on 18th February 2006 in Borno because of a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed in Iyllands-posten Newspaper (Terwase n.d). Here over 50 people were killed and 30 churches burnt. |"Language Use and Political Correctness for Peaceful Coexistence: Implications for Sustainable Development"&lt;ref name=Pinta/&gt;}}

===Education===

Much of the modern debate on the term was sparked by conservative critiques of [[liberal bias in academia]] and education,&lt;ref name="Schultz-1993a"/&gt; and conservatives have used it as a major line of attack since.&lt;ref name="Charles-Wartella"/&gt;
University of Pennsylvania professor [[Alan Charles Kors]] and lawyer [[Harvey A. Silverglate]] connect [[Speech code#At United States universities|speech codes in US universities]] to philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]]. They claim that speech codes create a "climate of repression", arguing that they are based on "Marcusean logic". {{relevance inline|date=November 2015}} The speech codes, "mandate a redefined notion of "freedom", based on the belief that the imposition of a moral agenda on a community is justified", a view which, "requires less emphasis on individual rights and more on assuring "historically oppressed" persons the means of achieving equal rights." They claim:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our colleges and universities do not offer the protection of fair rules, equal justice, and consistent standards to the generation that finds itself on our campuses. They encourage students to bring charges of harassment against those whose opinions or expressions "offend" them. At almost every college and university, students deemed members of "historically oppressed groups" – above all, women, blacks, gays, and Hispanics – are informed during orientation that their campuses are teeming with illegal or intolerable violations of their "right" not to be offended. Judging from these warnings, there is a racial or sexual bigot, to borrow the mocking phrase of McCarthy's critics, "under every bed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kors|first1=A.

Jessica Pinta and Joy Yakubu write that political correctness is useful in education, in the Journal of Educational and Social Research:
{{quote|Political correctness is a useful area of consideration when using English language particularly in second language situations. This is because both social and cultural contexts of language are taken into consideration. Zabotkina (1989) says political correctness is not only an essential, but an interesting area of study in English as a Second Language (ESL) or English as Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms. This is because it presents language as used in carrying out different speech acts which provoke reactions as it can persuade, incite, complain, condemn, and disapprove. Language is used for communication and creating social linkages, as such must be used communicatively. Using language communicatively involves the ability to use language at the grammatical level, sociolinguistic level, discourse and strategic levels (Canale &amp; Swain 1980). Understanding language use at these levels center around the fact that differences exist among people, who must communicate with one another, and the differences could be religious, cultural, social, racial, gender or even ideological. Therefore, using language to suit the appropriate culture and context is of great significance. |"Language Use and Political Correctness for Peaceful Coexistence:

Zoologists Robert Pitman and Susan Chivers complained about popular and media negativity towards their discovery of two different types of [[killer whale]]s, a "docile" type and a "wilder" type that ravages sperm whales by hunting in packs:  "The forces of ''political correctness'' and media marketing seem bent on projecting an image of a more benign form (the [[Free Willy]] or [[Shamu]] model), and some people urge exclusive use of the name 'orca' for the species, instead of what is perceived as the more sinister label of "killer whale."&lt;ref name=Cummings&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cummings|first1=Michael S.|title=Beyond political correctness : social transformation in the United States|date=2001|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder, Colo|isbn=1588260062|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7mgAwXas5xIC|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Morris (game theorist)|Stephen Morris]], an economist and a game theorist, built a game model on the concept of political correctness, where ''"a speaker (advisor) communicates with the objective of conveying information, but the listener (decision maker) is initially unsure if the speaker is biased. There were three main insights from that model. First, in any informative equilibrium, certain statements will lower the reputation of the speaker, independent of whether they turn out to be true.

===Right-wing political correctness===
"Political correctness" is a label typically used for left-wing terms and actions, but not for equivalent attempts to mold language and behavior on the right. However, the term "right-wing political correctness" is sometimes applied by commentators drawing parallels: in 1995, one author used the term "conservative correctness" arguing, in relation to [[higher education]], that "critics of political correctness show a curious blindness when it comes to examples of conservative correctness. Most often, the case is entirely ignored or censorship of the Left is justified as a positive virtue. [...] A balanced perspective was lost, and everyone missed the fact that people on all sides were sometimes censored."&lt;ref name="WilsonConservativeCorrectness"&gt;"Conservative Correctness" chapter, in Wilson, John. 1995.

And the goal is very much the kind of thing [[George Orwell|Orwell]] tried to convey with his notion of [[Newspeak]]: to make it impossible to talk, and possibly even think, about ideas that challenge the established order."&lt;ref name="Krugman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=The New Political Correctness|url=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/26/the-new-political-correctness/|accessdate=17 February 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 US presidential election===
{{Too few opinions|section|date=November 2016}}
In 2015 and 2016, leading up to the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]], Republican candidate [[Donald Trump]] used political correctness as common target in his rhetoric.&lt;ref name=rampell/&gt;&lt;ref name="swaim"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swaim|first1=Barton|title=Donald Trump tries to kill political correctness – and ends up saving it|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-has-made-political-correctness-credible-again/2016/11/01/0f397c0c-9fb1-11e6-a44d-cc2898cfab06_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mink/&gt;&lt;ref name=lind/&gt; Eric Mink in a column for the Huffington Post describes in disagreeing voice Trump's concept of "political correctness":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
political correctness is a controversial social force in a nation with a constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression, and it raises legitimate issues well worth discussing and debating.

But that’s not what Trump is doing. He’s not a rebel speaking unpopular truths to power. He’s not standing up for honest discussions of deeply contentious issues. He’s not out there defying rules handed down by elites to control what we say.

All Trump’s defying is common decency.&lt;ref name="mink"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mink|first1=Eric|title=Trump’s Political-Correctness Con Job|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-mink/trumps-political-correctn_b_12316240.html|website=huffingtonpost.com|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Columnists Blatt and Young of the [[The Federalist]] agree, with Blatt stating that "Trump is being rude, not politically incorrect" and that "PC is about preventing debate, not protecting rudeness".&lt;ref name="blatt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blatt|first1=Michael|title=How Donald Trump Makes Political Correctness Worse|url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/08/05/how-donald-trump-makes-political-correctness-worse/|website=thefederalist.com|publisher=The Federalist|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Cathy|title=Why Electing Donald Trump Could Make Political Correctness Worse|url=https://thefederalist.com/2016/11/07/electing-donald-trump-make-political-correctness-worse/|website=thefederalist.com|publisher=The Federalist|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the sexual assault scandals and the criticism the victims faced from Trump supporters, [[Vox (website)]] notes that after railing so much against political correctness they simply practice a different kind of repression and shaming: "If the pre–“political correctness” era was really so open, why is it only now that these women are speaking out?"&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lind|first1=Dara|title=Donald Trump shows the opposite of "political correctness" isn’t free speech.

===As a conspiracy theory===
Some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] commentators in the [[Western world|West]] argue that "political correctness" and multiculturalism are part of a conspiracy with the ultimate goal of undermining [[Judeo-Christian ethics|Judeo-Christian values]].  This theory, which holds that political correctness originates from the [[critical theory]] of the [[Frankfurt School]] as part of a conspiracy that its proponents call "Cultural Marxism", is generally known as the [[Frankfurt School#Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory|Frankfurt School conspiracy theory]] by academics.&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Copsey |editor1-first=Nigel  |editor2-last=Richardson |editor2-first=John E. |last=Richardson |first=John E. |title=Cultures of Post-War British Fascism |chapter=‘Cultural-Marxism’ and the British National Party: a transnational discourse |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HIwGCAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JAMIN&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Shekhovtsov |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |last=Jamin |first=Jérôme |title=The Post-War Anglo-American Far Right: A Special Relationship of Hate |chapter=Cultural Marxism and the Radical Right |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-1-137-39619-8 |doi=10.1057/9781137396211.0009 |pages=84–103 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=VbLSBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA84 |work=The Post-War Anglo-American Far Right: A Special Relationship of Hate |year=2014 |accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory originated with Michael Minnicino's 1992 essay "New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness'", published in a [[Lyndon LaRouche]] movement journal.&lt;ref name=Jay&gt;[[Martin Jay|Jay, Martin]] (2010), "[https://web.archive.org/web/20111124045123/http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/backissues/168-169/martin-jay-frankfurt-school-as-scapegoat.cfm Dialectic of Counter-Enlightenment: The Frankfurt School as Scapegoat of the Lunatic Fringe]". [[Salmagundi (magazine)|Salmagundi]] (Fall 2010–Winter 2011, 168–69): 30–40.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, conservative commentator [[Patrick Buchanan]] wrote in ''[[The Death of the West]]'' that "political correctness is cultural Marxism", and that "its trademark is intolerance".&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Patrick. ''The Death of the West'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False accusations ===
In the United States, left forces of "political correctness" have been blamed for censorship, with ''[[Time]]'' citing campaigns against violence on network television as contributing to a "mainstream culture [which] has become cautious, sanitized, scared of its own shadow" because of "the watchful eye of the p.c. police", even though in John Wilson's view protests and advertiser boycotts targeting TV shows are generally organized by right-wing religious groups campaigning against violence, sex, and depictions of homosexuality on television.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, John. 1995. ''[https://books.google.com/?id=jl-mXwLH0JkC The Myth of Political Correctness: The Conservative Attack on High Education].'' Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press. p. [https://books.google.com/?id=jl-mXwLH0JkC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=%22watchful%20eye%22 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, some newspapers reported that a [[Preschool|nursery school]] had altered the nursery rhyme [[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep|"Baa Baa Black Sheep"]] to read [[Loony Left#Baa Baa White Sheep|"Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep"]] and had banned the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Blair|first=Alexandra|title=Why black sheep are barred and Humpty can't be cracked|publisher=The Times|date=7 March 2006|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article738220.ece|accessdate=5 October 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was later reported that in fact the Parents and Children Together (PACT) nursery had the children "turn the song into an action rhyme.... They sing happy, sad, bouncing, hopping, pink, blue, black and white sheep etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4782856.stm |title=Nursery opts for 'rainbow' sheep |accessdate=6 October 2007 |work=BBC News | date=7 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This story was widely circulated and later extended to suggest that other language bans applied to the terms "black coffee" and "blackboard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teenink.com/talk/showthread.php?s=cb96eb0a024fd73bbc9080f5184fd151&amp;postid=322528 |title=Teen Ink – Bah, Bah, Rainbow Sheep |accessdate=6 October 2007 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Private Eye (magazine)|''Private Eye'' magazine]] reported that [[Loony left|similar stories had been published]] in the British press since ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' first ran them in 1986.&lt;ref name = "BaaBaa-Bollocks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.septicisle.info/2006/03/baa-baa-rainbow-bollocks.html |title=Obsolete: Baa Baa Rainbow Bollocks. |accessdate=6 October 2007 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satirical use===
Political correctness is often satirized, for example in ''The PC Manifesto'' (1992) by Saul Jerushalmy and Rens Zbignieuw X,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiction.net/tidbits/politics/pc.html |title=TidBits: The PC Manifesto |publisher=Fiction.net |date= |accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Politically Correct Bedtime Stories]]'' (1994) by [[James Finn Garner]], which presents [[fairy tale]]s re-written from an exaggerated politically correct perspective.  In 1994, the comedy film ''[[PCU (film)|PCU]]'' took a look at political correctness on a college campus.

Other examples include the television program ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', [[George Carlin]]’s "Euphemisms" routine, and ''The Politically Correct Scrapbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capc.co.uk/PC%20_Scrapbook_Main.htm |title=Book – Buy Now |publisher=Capc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The popularity of the ''[[South Park]]'' cartoon program led to the creation of the term "[[South Park Republican|''South Park'' Republican]]" by [[Andrew Sullivan]], and later the book ''[[South Park Conservatives]]'' by [[Brian C. Anderson]].&lt;ref name = "anderson"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Anderson | first = Brian C. | title = We're Not Losing the Culture Wars Anymore | url = http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_4_were_not_losing.html | date = Autumn 2003 | accessdate = 9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its [[South Park (season 19)|Season 19]], South Park has constantly been poking fun at the principle of political correctness, embodied in the show's new character, [[PC Principal]].&lt;ref name=Caffrey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caffrey|first1=Dan|title=PC Principal rides the line between hero and villain on the season finale of South Park|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/pc-principal-rides-line-between-hero-and-villain-s-229588|website=avclub.com|publisher=AV Club|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Crystal|title=‘South Park’ Perfectly Showed How To Do A Caitlyn Jenner Joke Right|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2273831/south-park-caitlyn-jenner-joke/|website=mtv.com|publisher=MTV|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coombs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coombs|first1=Alexa Moutevelis|title=‘South Park’ Brilliantly Mocks PC Culture|url=http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/culture/alexa-moutevelis-coombs/2015/11/19/south-park-brilliantly-mocks-pc-culture|website=newsbusters.org|publisher=Newsbuster|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Colbert Report]]'''s host [[Stephen Colbert]] often talked, satirically, about the "PC Police".&lt;ref name=Steinberg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steinberg|first1=Dan|title=Colbert Report on Redskins’ new foundation|journal=The Washington Post|date=27 March 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2014/03/27/colbert-report-on-redskins-new-foundation/|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Daddario&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'addario|first1=Daniel|title=Stephen Colbert jokes about #CancelColbert: "The system worked!"|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/04/01/stephen_colbert_jokes_about_cancelcolbert_the_system_worked/|website=salon.com|publisher=Salon|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in selected countries==

===Canada===
Graham Good, an academic at the [[University of British Columbia]], wrote that the term was widely used in debates on university education in Canada. Writing about a 1995 report on the Political Science department at his university, he concluded:
"Political correctness" has become a popular phrase because it catches a certain kind of self-righteous and judgmental tone in some and a pervasive anxiety in others – who, fearing that they may do something wrong, adjust their facial expressions, and pause in their speech to make sure they are not doing or saying anything inappropriate. The climate this has created on campuses is at least as bad in Canada as in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Good|title=Humanism Betrayed: Theory, Ideology and Culture in the Contemporary University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPLL9y9RvdwC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{See also|Censorship in Hong Kong}}
In [[Hong Kong]], as the [[1997 handover]] drew nearer, greater control over the press was exercised by both owners and the [[China|Chinese state]]. This had a direct impact on news coverage of relatively sensitive political issues. The Chinese authorities exerted pressure on individual newspapers to take pro-Beijing stances on controversial issues.&lt;ref name=Lai&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lai|first1=Carol.

Zhaojia Liu and Siu-kai Lau, writing in ''The first Tung Chee-hwa administration : the first five years of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region'', said that "Hong Kong has traditionally been characterized as having freedom of speech and freedom of press, but that an unintended consequence of emphasizing political 'correctness' is to limit the space for such freedom of expression."&lt;ref name=Siu-kai&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siu-kai|first1=edited by Lau|title=The first Tung Chee-hwa administration : the first five years of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|date=2002|publisher=Chinese University Press|location=Hong Kong|isbn=962996015X|page=298|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vb70owE7O8AC|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], controversies over PC surfaced during the 1990s regarding the social studies school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Hunter and Paul Keown, "The New Zealand social studies curriculum struggle 1993–1997: An 'insider' analysis." ''Waikato Journal of Edttcation'' (2001) 7:55–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Openshaw, ''Citizen who? The debate over economic and political correctness in the social studies curriculum'' in P. Benson, &amp; R. Openshaw, eds., ''New Horizons for New Zealand Social Studies'' (Palmerston North: ERDC Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in research==
According to ''[[ThinkProgress]]'', the "ongoing conversation about P.C. often relies on anecdotal evidence rather than data".&lt;ref name="thinkprogress 160114"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/01/14/3737907/the-phony-debate-about-political-correctness/ | title=The Phony Debate About Political Correctness | work=[[ThinkProgress]] | date=14 January 2016 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Hellerstein, Erica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, researchers at Cornell University reported that political correctness increased creativity in mixed-sex work teams,&lt;ref name="cornell 141104"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/11/pc-workplace-boosts-creativity-male-female-teams | title=PC workplace boosts creativity in male-female teams | publisher=Cornell.edu | work=[[Cornell Chronicle]] | date=4 November 2014 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Catt, Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying "the effort to be P.C. can be justified not merely on moral grounds but also by the practical and potentially profitable consequences."&lt;ref name="thinkprogress 160114" /&gt;{{clarify|reason=the researcher's definition of 'PC' should be made clear|date=March 2016}}
