The phrase ''politically correct'' first appeared in the 1930s, when was used to describe dogmatic adherence to ideology in [[authoritarian regimes]], such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Russia]].&lt;ref name=Gibson /&gt; Early usage of the term ''politically correct'' by [[leftists]] in the 1970s and 1980s was as self-critical [[satire]];&lt;ref name="Schultz-1993a"/&gt; usage was ironic, rather than a name for a serious [[political movement]].&lt;ref name="Perry-1992a"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SchultzPerry&gt;Schultz citing Perry (1992) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="willis"/&gt; It was considered an in-joke among leftists used to satirise those who were too rigid in their adherence to political [[orthodoxy]].&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; The modern pejorative usage of the term emerged from [[conservative]] criticism of the [[New Left]] in the late 20th century, with many describing it as a form of [[censorship]].&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Ford |first=Becky R. |date=2017 |title=An Empirical Test of the Effects of Political Correctness: Implications for Censorship, Self-Censorship, and Public Deliberation |publication-place=University of California, Santa Barbara |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/12f562b0#author |access-date=11 June 2022 |archive-date=11 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220611071318/https://escholarship.org/uc/item/12f562b0#author |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Early-to-mid 20th century ===
{{Main|Party line (politics)}}
In the early-to-mid 20th century, the phrase ''politically correct'' was used to describe strict adherence to a range of ideological orthodoxies within politics. In 1934, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Nazi Germany was granting reporting permits "only to pure 'Aryans' whose opinions are politically correct".&lt;ref name=Gibson /&gt; 

The term ''political correctness''  first appeared in Marxist–Leninist vocabulary following the Russian Revolution of 1917. At that time, it was used to describe strict adherence to the policies and principles of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], that is, the [[Party line (politics)|party line]].&lt;ref name="EBPC"&gt;{{cite web |title=political correctness |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-correctness |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=9 April 2022 |archive-date=7 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220407080901/https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-correctness |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the United States, the phrase came to be associated with accusations of [[dogmatism]] in debates between communists and socialists. According to American educator [[Herbert Kohl (educator)|Herbert Kohl]], writing about debates in New York in the late 1940s and early 1950s. 

{{blockquote|The term "politically correct" was used disparagingly, to refer to someone whose loyalty to the CP line overrode compassion, and led to bad politics. It was used by Socialists against Communists, and was meant to separate out Socialists who believed in egalitarian moral ideas from dogmatic Communists who would advocate and defend party positions regardless of their moral substance.|"Uncommon Differences"|''[[The Lion and the Unicorn (journal)|The Lion and the Unicorn]]''&lt;ref name=Kohl/&gt;}}

=== 1970s ===
{{Main|New Left}}
In the 1970s, the American [[New Left]] began using the term ''politically correct''.&lt;ref name="Perry-1992a"&gt;Ruth Perry, (1992), "A Short History of the Term 'Politically Correct'", in ''Beyond PC: Toward a Politics of Understanding'', by Patricia Aufderheide, 1992, {{ISBN|978-1555971649}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay ''The Black Woman: An Anthology'' (1970), [[Toni Cade Bambara]] said that "a man cannot be politically correct and a [[chauvinism#Male chauvinism|[male] chauvinist]], too." [[William Safire]] records this as the first use in the typical modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Safire|first1=William |author-link=William Safire|title=Safire's political dictionary|date=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0195343342|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "political correctness" was believed to have been revived by the New Left through familiarity in the West with [[Mao's Little Red Book]], in which Mao stressed holding to the correct party line. The term rapidly began to be used by the New Left in an ironic or self deprecating sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hughes |first= Geroffery|date=2011 |title=Political Correctness A History of Semantics and Culture |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Political_Correctness/Zzw9WabmmVwC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=political+correctness+communist+party&amp;pg=PT49&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher= Wiley |isbn=9781444360295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter, the term was often used as self-critical [[satire]]. Debra L. Shultz said that "throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the New Left, [[feminists]], and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]]... used their term 'politically correct' ironically, as a guard against their own orthodoxy in social change efforts."&lt;ref name="Schultz-1993a"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Debra L. |last=Schultz |year=1993 |title=To Reclaim a Legacy of Diversity: Analyzing the 'Political Correctness' Debates in Higher Education |location=New York |work=National Council for Research on Women |isbn=978-1880547137 |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED364170.pdf |access-date=28 March 2016 |archive-date=10 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210310085256/http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED364170.pdf |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry-1992a"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SchultzPerry/&gt; ''PC'' is used in the comic book ''Merton of the Movement'', by [[Bobby London]], which was followed by the term ''ideologically sound'', in the comic strips of [[Bart Dickon]].&lt;ref name="Perry-1992a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3027/a_politically_correct_lexicon/ |title=A Politically Correct Lexicon |journal=[[In These Times]] |first=Joel |last=Bleifuss |date=February 2007 |access-date=20 March 2010 |archive-date=29 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200629085359/http://inthesetimes.com/article/3027/a_politically_correct_lexicon/ |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay "Toward a feminist Revolution" (1992) [[Ellen Willis]] said: "In the early eighties, when feminists used the term 'political correctness', it was used to refer sarcastically to the [[anti-pornography movement]]'s efforts to define a 'feminist sexuality'."&lt;ref name="willis"&gt;[[Ellen Willis|Willis, Ellen]]. "Toward a Feminist Revolution", in ''No More Nice Girls: Countercultural Essays'' (1992) [[Wesleyan University Press]], {{ISBN|081955250X}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] suggests one way in which the original use of the term may have developed into the modern one:
{{blockquote|According to one version, political correctness actually began as an in-joke on the left: radical students on American campuses acting out an ironic replay of the Bad Old Days BS (Before the Sixties) when every revolutionary groupuscule had a party line about everything. They would address some glaring examples of sexist or racist behaviour by their fellow students in imitation of the tone of voice of the Red Guards or Cultural Revolution Commissar: "Not very 'politically correct', Comrade!"&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite web |first=Stuart |last=Hall |author-link=Stuart Hall (cultural theorist) |year=1994 |url=http://www.ram-wan.net/restrepo/hall/some%20politically%20incorrect%20pathways.pdf |title=Some 'Politically Incorrect' Pathways Through PC |work=S.

The term probably entered  use in the modern sense in the United Kingdom around 1975.&lt;ref name=Hughes/&gt;{{clarify|reason=here or below, first modern UK use should be expanded|date=December 2015}}

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
[[Allan Bloom]]'s ''[[The Closing of the American Mind]]'', a book first published in 1987,&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt; heralded a debate about "political correctness" in American higher education in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="Schultz-1993a"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kamiya&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamiya|first1=Gary|title=Civilization &amp; Its Discontents|journal=[[San Francisco Chronicle Magazine]]|date=22 January 1995|url=http://www.sfgate.com/magazine/article/Civilization-Its-Discontents-3152155.php|access-date=16 November 2015|archive-date=28 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210228042025/https://www.sfgate.com/magazine/article/Civilization-Its-Discontents-3152155.php|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of English literary and cultural studies at [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] Jeffrey J.

An October 1990 ''[[New York Times]]'' article by [[Richard Bernstein (journalist)|Richard Bernstein]] is credited with popularizing the term.&lt;ref name=Berman1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crossroads&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Valdes|editor-first1=Francisco|editor-last2=Culp|editor-first2=Jerome McCristal|editor-last3=Harris|editor-first3=Angela P.|title=Crossroads, directions, and a new critical race theory|date=2002|publisher=[[Temple University Press]]|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1566399302|pages=59, 65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCedxQu542UC|access-date=21 October 2015|archive-date=30 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730022119/https://books.google.com/books?id=dCedxQu542UC|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Browne"&gt;Browne, Anthony (2006).

After 1991, its use as a pejorative phrase became widespread amongst conservatives in the US.&lt;ref name="Charles-Wartella"/&gt; It became a key term encapsulating conservative concerns about the left in cultural and political debates extending beyond academia. Two articles on the topic in late 1990 in ''[[Forbes]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' both used the term "[[thought police]]" in their headlines, exemplifying the tone of the new usage, but it was Dinesh D'Souza's ''Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus'' (1991) which "captured the press's imagination".&lt;ref name="Charles-Wartella"/&gt; Similar critical terminology was used by D'Souza for a range of policies in academia around victimization, supporting multiculturalism through affirmative action, sanctions against anti-minority [[hate speech]], and revising curricula (sometimes referred to as "canon busting").&lt;ref name="Charles-Wartella"/&gt;{{efn|In ''[[The New York Times]]'' newspaper article "The Rising Hegemony of the Politically Correct", the reporter [[Richard Bernstein (journalist)|Richard Bernstein]] said:

That response received funding from conservative foundations and think tanks such as the [[John M. Olin Foundation]], which funded several books such as D'Souza's.&lt;ref name="Schultz-1993a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;Wilson, John. 1995.

[[Herbert Kohl (educator)|Herbert Kohl]], in 1992, commented that a number of [[neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] who promoted the use of the term "politically correct" in the early 1990s were former [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] members, and, as a result, familiar with the [[Marxist]] use of the phrase. He argued that in doing so, they intended "to insinuate that egalitarian democratic ideas are actually authoritarian, orthodox, and Communist-influenced, when they oppose the right of people to be racist, sexist, and homophobic".&lt;ref name="Kohl"/&gt;

During the 1990s, conservative and [[right-wing]] politicians, think tanks, and speakers adopted the phrase as a pejorative descriptor of their ideological enemies, especially in the context of the [[culture wars]] about [[American English|language]] and the content of public-school curricula. [[Roger Kimball]], in ''Tenured Radicals'', endorsed [[Frederick Crews]]'s view that PC is best described as "Left Eclecticism", a term defined by Kimball as "any of a wide variety of anti-establishment modes of thought from structuralism and poststructuralism, deconstruction, and Lacanian analyst to feminist, homosexual, black, and other patently political forms of criticism".&lt;ref name=Kimball/&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

=== As a conspiracy theory ===
{{main|Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory}}
Some conservative commentators in the [[Western world|West]] argue that "political correctness" and multiculturalism are part of a conspiracy with the ultimate goal of undermining [[Judeo-Christian ethics|Judeo-Christian values]]. This theory, which holds that political correctness originates from the [[critical theory]] of the [[Frankfurt School]] as part of a conspiracy that its proponents call "Cultural Marxism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Post-War Anglo-American Far Right: A Special Relationship of Hate|last=Jamin|first=Jérôme|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1137396198|editor1-last=Shekhovtsov|editor1-first=A.|location=[[Basingstoke]]|pages=84–103|chapter=Cultural Marxism and the Radical Right|doi=10.1057/9781137396211.0009|editor2-last=Jackson|editor2-first=P.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbLSBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84|access-date=19 November 2020|archive-date=22 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922220920/https://books.google.com/books?id=VbLSBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA84|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultures of Post-War British Fascism|last=Richardson|first=John E.|date=2015|isbn=9781317539360|editor1-last=Copsey|editor1-first=Nigel|chapter=‘Cultural-Marxism’ and the British National Party: a transnational discourse|editor2-last=Richardson|editor2-first=John E.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIwGCAAAQBAJ|access-date=12 August 2015|archive-date=29 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929062019/https://books.google.com/books?id=HIwGCAAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory originated with Michael Minnicino's 1992 essay "New Dark Age: Frankfurt School and 'Political Correctness'", published in a [[Lyndon LaRouche]] movement journal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Jay|Jay, Martin]] (2010), "[https://web.archive.org/web/20111124045123/http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/backissues/168-169/martin-jay-frankfurt-school-as-scapegoat.cfm Dialectic of Counter-Enlightenment: The Frankfurt School as Scapegoat of the Lunatic Fringe]".

''[[The Death of the West]]'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
{{see also|Media bias}}
In the US, the term has been widely used in books and journals, but in Britain the usage has been confined mainly to the popular press.&lt;ref name="Lea"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pKmTAgAAQBAJ|title=Political Correctness and Higher Education: British and American Perspectives|last1=Lea|first1=John|date=2010|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1135895884|access-date=28 October 2015|archive-date=12 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412201758/https://books.google.com/books?id=pKmTAgAAQBAJ|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many such authors and popular-media figures, particularly on the right, have used the term to criticize what they see as bias in the media.&lt;ref name=Friedman /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; William McGowan argues that journalists get stories wrong or ignore stories worthy of coverage, because of what McGowan perceives to be their liberal ideologies and their fear of offending minority groups.&lt;ref name="McGowan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Coloring the news : how political correctness has corrupted American journalism|last1=McGowan|first1=William|date=2003|publisher=[[Encounter Books]]|isbn=978-1893554603|edition=[New postscript].|location=San Francisco, Calif.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Novak, in his essay "Political Correctness Has No Place in the Newsroom", used the term to blame newspapers for adopting language use policies that he thinks tend to excessively avoid the appearance of bias. He argued that political correctness in language not only destroys meaning but also demeans the people who are meant to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-16805698/political-correctness-has-no-place-in-the-newsroom|title=Political Correctness Has No Place in the Newsroom|last1=Novak|first1=Robert|date=March 1995|access-date=28 October 2015|work=[[USA Today]]|archive-date=29 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200629061809/https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-16805698/political-correctness-has-no-place-in-the-newsroom|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FK7hAAAAMAAJ|title=Mass Media|last1=Gorham|first1=Joan|date=1996|publisher=Dushkin Publishing Group, [[Indiana University]]|isbn=9780697316110|access-date=28 October 2015|archive-date=4 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211104213031/https://books.google.com/books?id=FK7hAAAAMAAJ|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Media Bias|last1=Sloan|first1=David |last2=Mackay|first2=Jenn |date=2007 |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|isbn=978-0786455058|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors David Sloan and Emily Hoff claim that in the US, journalists shrug off concerns about political correctness in the newsroom, equating the political correctness criticisms with the old "liberal media bias" label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6LhAAAAMAAJ|title=Contemporary media issues|last1=Sloan|first1=David|last2=Hoff|first2=Emily|date=1998|publisher=Vision Press, [[Indiana University]]|isbn=978-1885219107|location=Northport|page=63|ref=Sloan|access-date=28 October 2015|archive-date=10 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211010135551/https://books.google.com/books?id=c6LhAAAAMAAJ|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author John Wilson, left-wing forces of "political correctness" have been blamed for unrelated censorship, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' citing campaigns against violence on network television in the US as contributing to a "mainstream culture [that] has become cautious, sanitized, scared of its own shadow" because of "the watchful eye of the p.c. police", protests and advertiser boycotts targeting TV shows are generally organized by right-wing religious groups campaigning against violence, sex, and depictions of homosexuality on television.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, John. 1995.

=== Satirical use ===
Political correctness is often [[satirized]], for example in ''The PC Manifesto'' (1992) by Saul Jerushalmy and Rens Zbignieuw X,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiction.net/tidbits/politics/pc.html|title=TidBits: The PC Manifesto|publisher=Fiction.net|access-date=1 June 2009|archive-date=7 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211007193505/http://www.fiction.net/tidbits/politics/pc.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Politically Correct Bedtime Stories]]'' (1994) by [[James Finn Garner]], which presents [[fairy tale]]s re-written from an exaggerated politically correct perspective. In 1994, the comedy film ''[[PCU (film)|PCU]]'' took a look at political correctness on a college campus. Other examples include the television program ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', [[George Carlin]]'s "[[Euphemism]]s" routine,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} and ''The Politically Correct Scrapbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.capc.co.uk/PC%20_Scrapbook_Main.htm|title=Book – Buy Now |publisher=Capc.co.uk|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090530054012/http://www.capc.co.uk/PC%20_Scrapbook_Main.htm|archive-date=30 May 2009|url-status=dead|access-date=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the ''[[South Park]]'' cartoon program led to the creation of the term "[[South Park Republican|''South Park'' Republican]]" by [[Andrew Sullivan]], and later the book ''[[South Park Conservatives]]'' by [[Brian C.

{{see also|Politicization of science}}
Groups who oppose certain generally accepted scientific views about [[evolution]], [[second-hand smoke|second-hand tobacco smoke]], [[AIDS denialism|AIDS]], [[global warming]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and other politically contentious scientific matters have used the term "political correctness" to describe what they view as unwarranted rejection of their perspective on these issues by a scientific community that they believe has been corrupted by liberal politics.&lt;ref name=Bethell&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bethell |first=Tom |title=The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science |publisher=[[Regnery Publishing]] |location=Washington, D.C |year=2005 |isbn=978-0895260314 |url=https://archive.org/details/politicallyincor00beth_0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right-wing political correctness==
"Political correctness" is a label typically used to describe liberal or left-wing terms and actions but rarely used for analogous attempts to mold language and behavior on the right.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Joshua|title=Time for equal media treatment of 'political correctness'|url=https://www.cjr.org/criticism/political-correctness-journalism.php?curator=MediaREDEF|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=12 June 2017|access-date=15 June 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170831092315/https://www.cjr.org/criticism/political-correctness-journalism.php|archive-date=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote that "the big threat to our discourse is right-wing political correctness, which – unlike the liberal version – has lots of power and money behind it.
